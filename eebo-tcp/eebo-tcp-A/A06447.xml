         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOVRABLE SIR <hi>THOMAS EGERTON</hi> KNIGHT: LORDE Keeper of the Great-Seale of England, and one of her Maiesties most honourable priuie Counsell. (*)</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the shoare of the Sea Euxinus,</hi> in the land of <hi>Colchis,</hi> there stoode a Cyttie named <hi>Dioscurias,</hi> so much haunted of strangers, that, (as <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth by record of <hi>Thimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenes,)</hi> it was resorted vnto of three hundred Nations of distinct languages, and that the Romans for the better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition of their wares there, had at length lying in the same 130. Interpreters. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> testifieth, that men in times past came to Rome from the furthest Coastes of Spayne and Fraunce, to see <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> whose eloquence was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous throughout the whole vvorld. Certainly, famous and excellent was that Citty, that so many resorted vnto, and where the renowned Romans had so many Interpreters lying. And without all question, admirable was the eloquence of <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> that fetched men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so farre to see him. Then vndoubtedly (Right Honorable) diuine &amp; learned is this reuerend Authour <hi>F. Ludouicus Granatensis,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not onely the spacious Empire of the Latines, but Spayne, Fraunce, and
<pb facs="tcp:9369:3"/>
Italie, haue trauailed to see, and tasting the honnyed sweetnes of his celestiall ayre, and finding such supernaturall and heauenly treasures in him, haue not onely com'd to see him, but haue sent thether their Interpreters, there to soiourne, for the better transportation of his wares and commodities.<note place="margin">Onely his Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, done by ANONY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MVS. And his Manuell in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane tonge translated by Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Dober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niner.</note> Onely, I wondred that England, whose Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agers were neuer out-stript by any, had so sparingly and slenderly visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this famous and renowned Diuine: that shee, I say, as Germany had but onely one Interpreter lying with him, seeing that otherwhere she had such aboundance of worthy Factors, &amp; rich linguists.</p>
            <p>Entering into consideration of the great scarcity of our Traffickers to so rich a Mine, I discouered certaine corruptions, which as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Rockes threatned shipwracke, to them that sailed vnto him. The Poets faine, that a Dragon kept the Golden-fleece, and yet that hindered not <hi>Iason</hi> from the conquest of it: neyther did Gyants nor Monsters fright <hi>Hercules</hi> from his rich spoyles &amp; glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests. Cosmographers write, that in the Mountaines of <hi>Albania,</hi> and <hi>Hircania,</hi> Countries of <hi>Scythia,</hi> there are found the best and freshest Emeralds, the purest Christall, much gold &amp; precious stones, but these Mountaines are encircled with huge woods, wherein are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of fierce and cruell wilde beastes, as Gryphons; Leopards, Tygers, Panthers, and Dogs of that fiercenes and greatnes, that they pull downe Bulls, and slay Lyons. But as the Dragon amated not <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> nor the Monsters amazed <hi>Hercules,</hi> and as these <hi>Scythian</hi> dangers doe not hinder men from seeking and finding these earthly &amp; terrestriall iewels: so should wee not be discouraged in this spirituall pursute, for a few corruptions and dangers, remembring that all wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, (the sacred Scriptures excepted, which are absolutely pure and perfect) haue a relish of theyr earthly and corruptible Authours. <hi>Nihil ex omni parte beatum,</hi> sayth <hi>Horace,</hi> and yet wee must not doe as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> dyd, who, because the Grape was abused by potte companiors, cutte downe all the Spartan Vines. For we finde by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that this Argument <hi>Ab abusu ad non vsum,</hi> from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of good things to the abolishing of them, as it hath bred heresies and schismes in the Church: so also rebellions &amp; treasons in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. <hi>Plutarch</hi> sayth, that it had beene better for <hi>Lycurgus</hi> to haue digged Wells and Fountaines neere vnto the Vines, and as <hi>Plato</hi> counselleth, <hi>Insanum Deum alio sobrio repressum,</hi> that is,
<pb facs="tcp:9369:3"/>
to take away the abuse by mixing some quantitie of water with it. Which gaging &amp; moderation, as I haue performed in this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by remouing corruptions, that as Rocks would haue endangered many: so if other Interpreters, as good Pylots doe the same in this learned <hi>Iberian,</hi> neuer had <hi>Dioscurias</hi> moe Interpreters, nor <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Liuius</hi> moe visiters, then <hi>Granatensis</hi> shall haue. For if that most famous and excellent Phylosopher <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus</hi> (as <hi>Philostratus</hi> writeth) trauailed almost throughout the whole world, and passed euen to the Mountaine <hi>Caucasus,</hi> and to the <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> Phylosophers of <hi>India,</hi> that he might onely heare <hi>Iarchas</hi> an <hi>Indian</hi> Philosopher, in his golden throne professing wisedome among the small number of his schollers, and disputing of the motion of the celestiall Spheres: what ought not Christians to doe, and whether shoulde not they trauell to heare one, not teaching how the heauens are mooued, but how men may come to heauen: yea, how <hi>Sinners</hi> may be <hi>Guyded</hi> thether?</p>
            <p>And albeit all the workes of this reuerend Diuine are profitable for instruction in religion, and very auaileable for perswasion to good life: yet my iudgement, (beeing grounded vpon the iudgements of graue and worthy Diuines,) doth estimate this booke aboue the rest, as <hi>Sybilla Cumaea</hi> did the last of her three Bookes vnto King <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quine.</hi> Which with all humility I dedicate vnto your <hi>Honor,</hi> whom God of his great mercy, hath vouchfafed in this decrepit and ruinous age of the world, to bestow vpon our state for the maintenaunce and countenaunce of Religion and Learning, and for the defacing &amp; sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of vice and corruption: like as in times past hee gaue vnto Common-wealths, that needed such helpe, <hi>Dauid, Hezekiah, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah, Hercules, Cyrus, Artaxerxes, Alexander Magnus, Scipio Affricanus, Iulius Caesar, Augustus, Mecaenas, Constantinus Magnus, Theodosius, Carolus Magnus, Sigismundus, Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandus, Alphonsus</hi> King of Naples, <hi>Fredericke</hi> Duke of Saxon Prince Elector, and Lord <hi>Ernestus</hi> his Brother, <hi>Laurentius Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices</hi> Duke of Florence, and <hi>Borsus</hi> Duke of Ferrara, with many other Princes and Nobles, some of which were mighty Pillars and Protectors of true Religion and Christianity, &amp; others liberall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers and bountifull Patrons of learning and vertue, against all <hi>Licinians, Iulianists, Valentinians, Caligulaes, Neroes, Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,
<pb facs="tcp:9369:4"/>
Mahometists, Baiazets, Aretinists, Simonists,</hi> &amp; such like Monsters of nature, beeing cruell persecuters of true Religion, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of all humanity, and destroyers of all learning and discipline, who despising God and all goodnes, did degenerate so farre from their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, that they delighted wholy to spill the blood of worthy men, to burne famous Libraries, to rob the Church of her patrimony, and to rase and ouerthrow the Vniuersities and Schcoles of all Artes &amp; Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, as in the tragicall Histories of former times is recorded, &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but with great greefe remembred.</p>
            <p>All ages haue written and spoken great and glorious things of that good Emperour Great <hi>Constantine,</hi> for his defence and patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of sacred Christianitie, and bounty vnto the Church and her Pastors: So all Diuines and whole Vniuersities of Schollers doe daily blesse God, who (in this corrupt &amp; simoniacal age, &amp; in these dog-daies of the Church and Religion, which together with learned Diuines &amp; worthy schollers, doe lie in a desperate <hi>Paroxisme,</hi> and most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous fit, ioyntly shaken and assaulted by wicked Patrons and wretched Atheists) hath allotted vnto vs, not onely another <hi>Alexander,</hi> that so honoured the Poet <hi>Pindarus,</hi> that at the destruction of Thebes, he gaue charge that the family and kinred of <hi>Pindarus</hi> should be spared, but another <hi>Mathias</hi> of the newe Law, nay, a true follower and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tater of <hi>Christ,</hi> who daily casteth out of the Temple of God all them that buy and sell in it, and ouerthroweth the Tables of Money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers, and the seates of them that sell Doues, endeuouring with all zealous sincerity, to make the house of GOD that that it should be, that is, a house of Prayer, not as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would haue it, a Denne of theeues, and a Cage of vncleane byrds.</p>
            <p>I humbly entreate your Lordship to accept this small gift, the fruites of a poore schollers study, and weigh it, not according to my skill, which is but weake, but according to the soundnes of the doctrine therein contayned, which is warranted by the authority of the holie Scriptures. <hi>Quod si ex tua dignitate spectetur, exiguum est; sin ex animo meo, magnum.

                  <head>THE PROLOGVE OF the first Booke.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>AY ye, surely it shall be well with the iust. Esay 3.</hi> This is the embassage which GOD in times past sent to all the iust by the Prophet Esay, short and briefe in words, but most copious, and exceeding rich in rewards and benefits. Men are wont to be liberall in promises, but niggards and couetous in performance of them: God, after a contrary manner, is so liberall &amp; bountifull in performance, that the words of his promise, are much lesse then his deede and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration. For what could be spoken more briefely, then <hi>Say yee, surely it shall be well with the iust?</hi> But o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, how many &amp; how great be the blessings, which are contained vnder this small word <hi>Well?</hi> Which I thinke so to be left without any extention or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifying, that men might vnderstand, that it is impossible, that it should be expressed according to the veritie &amp; nature of the thing: neither that this litle word should be vnderstood of these or those blessings, but of all kinde of blessings, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended vnder this word <hi>Well,</hi> without any limitation.</p>
                  <p>For thys cause it was aunswered to Moses of the Lord, when he asked, what was his name; <hi>I am that I am</hi>: no other word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.</note> that God might signifie, that his being could not bee circumscribed or defined with words; but that it was a thing v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall, which comprehendeth in it all kind of Essences, &amp; all perfection, which without any imperfection pertaineth to that Essence and beeing. So in this place the Prophet doth put this short word <hi>Well,</hi> not adding any explication, that he might sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie and intimate vnto vs, that the whole vniuersitie and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of all good things, that can be desired of mans hart, are to be found in thys word, and be conioyned to it, which the Lord doth promise heere to the righteous for reward of his vertue.</p>
                  <p>This is the chiefe &amp; principall argument, which (Gods holy Spirit assisting mee) I haue purposed to handle in this Booke: to the which I will also adioyne counsailes, instructions, &amp; rules, which ought to be obserued of those, who are studious of vertue. According to this purpose this booke shall be deuided into two
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:9369:7"/>
Tomes,<note place="margin">The deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Booke.</note> or two principall parts. In the first shall bee shewed those most straight and firme bonds, which binde vs to followe and embrace vertue: also the inestimable and inualuable fruites and profits which are brought forth by this studie.</p>
                  <p>In the latter part or Tome, wee will speake of a godly life, which is lead according to the prescript rule of vertue,<note place="margin">Two things required to pietie.</note> &amp; of the admonitions &amp; doctrines, which are required vnto it. For there are two things necessary to a man that will become godly and honest. The first is, that hee desire to be really and indeede in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with vertue. The second is, that he may know how to be so indued and furnished. For the first of these two, the first Booke is profitable and auailable: for the second, the second. For they (as Plutarch sayth) that teach that vertue is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, but deliuer not the way and manner how to attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> they doe as those that light a Lampe to burne, but poure in no oyle. Certes although the second booke is very profitable, yet the first booke (if I may so say) is most necessarie. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because to the knowledge of good &amp; euill, the very light of nature and reason is much conducent, which is bred &amp; borne with vs: but that wee should loue one, and hate another; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace one, and flie from another, very great contradictions and lets doe meete with vs, and doe arise of sinne, as well within, as without man.</p>
                  <p>For seeing that man is compounded of a spirite and flesh, &amp; both parts desire theyr like; the flesh alwayes seeketh for things carnall and fleshly, in which vices raigne and beare sway; but the spirit desireth spirituall things, in which vertues haue dominion and preheminence. Therefore the spirit dooth feele and suffer great contradiction and repugnancie of his owne flesh, which hath no feeling, but of those thinges, which delight and bring pleasure; which desires and appetites, next vnto originall sinne are most vehement, when as by that, the bridle of original righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes is lost, with which they were bridled and restrayned. Neyther doth the flesh only resist the spirite, but also the world, <hi>Which</hi> (as S. Iohn testifieth) <hi>wholie lyeth in wickednes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Iohn, 5,</note> The deuill also, a capitall enemie of vertues, doth repugne the spirit, and so doe our corrupt dispositions, and vicious custome, which as an other nature, especially in those, who haue had growth, and are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:9369:7"/>
confirmed in wickednes, through the continuaunce and diutur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of tyme. Therefore, that a man may passe boldly through the midst of these difficulties, and that hee may approch neere vnto vertue in veritie, and with the whole desire of his hart, to the despight of the flesh and all her powers it cannot be denied, but that these difficulties doe happen to man, and that ayde and helpe is necessary for him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, that we may come vnto thys first part, this former Booke is made, and sette foorth, in the which I haue bestowed much paynes, and haue laboured with all my strength, that I might gather (as it were) into a bundle all the reasons, which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any whit to belong to the qualitie of this matter, or to the manner of this writing for the aduauncement of vertue; by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before your eyes the profit and fruites of them, who follow vertue, as well in this life, as in the life to come: and by declaring the great bonds, by which wee are bounde to vertue, seeing that God doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund it vnto vs, whom not to obey is exceeding haynous; and to which we are obliged, as well for that which it is in it selfe, as for that which it is for vs, and towards vs. I vvas especially moued to handle this argument, for that I dyd dailie see the greater sort &amp; number of men to prayse vertue in words, but to follow vices in deedes. And truely in mine opinion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst many other causes of this so great enormitie, one is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men, ignorant of the condition and nature of vertue, doe esteeme it to be vnpleasant, barraine, and painefull. For this cause, when as they are wholy drowned in vices (because they seeme more pleasant vnto them) they flie from all vertue, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that there is no sweetnes in it.</p>
                  <p>I, pittying the error of these men, willingly vnderwent thys labour, that I might shew how many, and howe great be the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, delights and treasuries; how great is the dignitie, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this heauenly Bride: and also that I might demonstrate howe vnknowne it is vnto men; that these mine admonitions might free them from this errour, and inflame them with the loue of so precious a thing.</p>
                  <p>For if it bee true, that thys is one of the most excellent things, that are in heauen or earth, and most worthy to be loued &amp; had in honour; without doubt it is to be lamented, that men
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9369:8"/>
are such strangers from the knowledge and desire of so great a good. A great benefite therefore hee shall doe to all mankinde, whosoeuer he be, that endeuoureth to restore thys Lady to her honour, and to seate her in her royall Throne: for shee is the Queene and Lady of all things.</p>
                  <p>But before I come to my purpose, I will shewe by a certaine example, with what minde thys Tractate ought to bee vsed. Heathen men doe write of theyr famous Hercules,<note place="margin">Cicero in the first booke of his offices.</note> howe when he began to waxe a man (which time is gyuen of Nature to choose, what course of life euery man will follow and enter into) went into the wildernes, and there sitting long debating &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing with himselfe, when he saw two waies, the one of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, the other of Vertue, which it were better to enter &amp; walke in: at the length, after mature deliberation, Pleasure being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, he entred into Vertues path. Truely, if there bee anie thing in the world woorthy of deliberation and aduise, this is it. For if wee so often muse vpon those thinges, which pertaine to the vse of life, and doe so aduisedly deliberate of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; how much more carefully and thorowly ought wee to weigh and consider of life it selfe? especially seeing so many and so diuers kindes of lyuing are found in the world.</p>
                  <p>Proceede therefore, my brother, thys is that, that I woulde haue thee now to do, and to the which I now inuite thee. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou must know, that before all things it is needfull, that in this short time thou sette behinde thee, the whole rabble of the thoughts and busines of this world, &amp; that thou enter into thys spirituall wildernes, and that thou beginne to deliberate with thy selfe of the manner and way of that life, which it behoueth thee to follow hereafter. Remember, that among all humane affaires there is none, which ought to bee weighed and examined vvith greater care and attention, and which requireth a longer time in deliberating, then the election of that kinde of life, which is to be followed, &amp; continued till death. For if the beginning be good, those things that follow will be lawdable. On the contrary part, if thy choyce be faultie, what soeuer is built thereon will goe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ill to worse. All other consultations, with the errors that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in them, are particuler, thys onely is generall, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all other vnder it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:9369:8"/>Tell mee I pray thee, what may be builded vpon an ill foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation? What doe all prosperous euents profit? What auaile al admonitions and counsailes, if thy life be ill ordered? And what doe all aduersities hurt, if thy life be well lead?<note place="margin">Math, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>For what shoulde it profit a man, though he should winne the whole world, and loose his owne soule?</hi> Therefore we can speake of no matter or businesse more weightie vnder heauen, of none more proper vnto man, or of greater moment: for we doe not intreat heere of riches, or of honors; but of the lyfe of the soule, and of euerlasting glory. Doe not therfore run ouer these things carelesly, slightly, &amp; slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingly, as without aduisement thou doost read ouer many other things, oftentimes passing ouer many leaues, desirous to see an end, before thou hast wel examined the beginning: but I would that thou sitte as a Iudge in the iudgement seate of thine hart, &amp; that thou heare all these words with silence &amp; quie
tnes of mind. These things are not to be posted ouer hastily, but to be looked to heedfully &amp; discreetly, because in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are handled the whole regiment of thy life, and what soeuer thereupon dooth depend. Consider howe thou wouldest that all the businesses of thys worlde should bee ordered and appointed; for in determining these things, one mans opinion cannot suffice thee, but haue an eye that they be seene to, examined &amp; scanned of sundry Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, Aduocates, and Iudges, least happily thou offend in them.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, seeing that in this case we doe not speak of earth, but of heauen; not of thine, but of thy selfe; haue an earnest care that this thing bee not considered of slothfully and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, but with the greatest attention. If thou hast erred he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, now at the length cast with thy selfe, that thou art rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated and borne againe, and beginne to enter into iudgement with thy selfe, and cut off the thred of thine errors, and begin by another way to vntwist this webbe. O who will nowe so blesse my labours, that thou maist now credite mee, and harken vnto me with attentiue eares, and that like a good Iudge thou mayst pronounce thy sentence and iudgement, according to those things which are spoken and approued vnto thee; for this thy resolution should be truelie blessed, and thy labour exceeding profitable. I know assuredly that I request too much, and that a wryting cannot be found so effectuall and preuailing, that may
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:9369:9"/>
effect and performe this request: therefore in the beginning of this my worke (of what esteeme or value soeuer it bee) I intreat this one thing, that he who is the power and wisedom of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (who hath the key of Dauid, that he may shutte and open heauen to whom he will) would be heere present, and so temper these my writings, that they may yeeld a perswasiue spirit &amp; lyfe to those who shall reade them.</p>
                  <p>But if I shall gette no fruite of thys my labour, yet this shall be a recompence sufficient for mee, that I haue satisfied mine owne desire &amp; delight, and that once I haue filled &amp; glutted my selfe, in praysing &amp; commending a thing greater then all praise, as Vertue is, especially seeing that of a long time I haue longed and wished to apply my minde to this studie. This also I haue obserued throughout all this worke (which also I haue doone in all the rest of my labours) that I might fitte and apply my selfe to all sorts and estates of men, spirituall and not spirituall, Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and Laitie; that as the cause and necessitie is common, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so this Treatise might bee as common. For the good, reading this, shall be confirmed in the loue of Vertue, &amp; being deeplie grafted into it, they shall take deepe roote in it: they that be not good, perhaps shall vnderstand by this what they haue lost and forgon. With thys our labour, good Parents may instruct and teach theyr chyldren, when they are but young; that they may be accustomed from theyr infancie to haue Vertue in honor &amp; reuerence, and to bee studious of it; seeing it is the greatest ioy that a Father hath, to see his sonne whom he loueth, to bee a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Vertue, honest in very deede, and beautified &amp; adorned with all kinde of Vertue.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine moreouer will be especially profitable to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whose dutie it is in the Church to teach the people, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them to embrace Vertue: for heere are deliuered in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the chiefest instructions, titles and reasons, which make vs debtors vnto Vertue; to the which also as to common places, euery thing may bee reduced, which is written of this matter. And seeing that heere are handled those graces and blessings, which are promised in this world to Vertue (which are displaied and vnfolded in her twelue notable and famous preheminences and prerogatiues) and seeing that it is true, that we haue all these
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:9369:9"/>
good things and blessings by Christ; it consequently followeth, that this doctrine shal bring much light to the vnderstanding of the holy Scriptures, especially to those places which intreate of the misterie of Christ, and the inestimable benefite of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: of the which (amongst others) the Prophet Esay, Salomon in his Canticles, and such others, doe write more of purpose.</p>

                  <head>THE ARGVMENT OF THE FIRST BOOKE.</head>
                  <p>THIS first Booke, Christian Reader, dooth containe a large exhortation to Vertue, which is the watchman and keeper of the commandements of GOD, in which consisteth true Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. This Booke is deuided into three principall parts. In the first part Vertue is perswaded to be embraced of vs, with those rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and common arguments, which are wont chiefely to bee alledged of the holie and auncient Fathers: as are those bonds, by the which we are bound to our Lord GOD, as well by that, which hee is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as by that which he is for vs, by reason of his inestimable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and also by the necessitie of Vertue herselfe, which is prooued and layd open vnto vs by the foure last things: which are, Death, Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Heauenly-glory, and Hell. And these are handled in the first part.</p>
                  <p>In the second part, the same thing is conuinced and prooued mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly by other newe reasons: as are the commodities and profits of grace, which are promised in this life to the students &amp; louers of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Heere the twelue particuler prerogatiues and priuiledges are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed, by which Vertue is famous &amp; renowned: and they are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and discoursed of seuerally, and by themselues. Which preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, although many times they are touched of the Saints and holy Writers, shewing the light, the peace, the true libertie and ioy of a quiet conscience, and the consolations and comforts of the holy Ghost, which things the righteous enioy, and all those excellent benefits, which are circumscribed within Vertues circumference: yet neuer any man was seene, or read of me, who handled this matter so copiously, and in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:9369:10"/>
that order, as wee doe. Therefore it hath not beene vnto mee a little trouble, or a small labor to bring together into one head all these things out of diuers places of Scripture, &amp; to call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their propper names, to reduce them into order, to declare and display them, and to approue euery one of them seuerally by diuers testimonies of the Scriptures and of the Fathers. This diligence was very necessarily bestowed, that they, who are not mooued to loue Vertue for the hope of the good to come, because it seemes to be farre off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, at the least that they might bee moued with the profite of that inestimable good, which Vertue affoordeth in this world. But because it suffiseth not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all the reasons, which proue and establish this question and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vnlesse also the contrarie arguments and obiections bee refuted: therefore the third part of this Booke is occupied and conuersant in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowing and confuting them, in which we plentifully aunswere all the excuses and obiections, which are wont to be alledged of naughtie men, why they doe flie and eschew Vertue.</p>
                  <p>Because the matter and subiect of these two Bookes is Vertue, wee would not haue the Reader to be ignorant, that by this word Vertue, we barelie or solely vnderstand the habite of Vertue, but also her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and duties, to the which that noble habit is ordered and disposed: because the Figure is very well knowne, that the effect is signified by the name of the cause, &amp; the cause by the name of the effect.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>WO things chiefely (Christian Reader) are wont to mooue and stirre vp the will of man to any good action.

Of these two, although (for the most part) Profit is more sought after and desired, yet Honestie is more effectuall and powerfull. For there is not any profit or commoditie to be found in this world, although it be great, which may compare with the excellencie of Vertue: as also there is no losse or disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie so great or grieuous, which a wise man ought not rather to choose, then to runne into anie vice, as Aristotle auerreth.</p>
                        <p>Seeing therefore, that it is our purpose and meaning in this Booke, to inuite men to the loue of Vertue, and to ensnare them with the beautie of it; I take it that we shall doe very well, if we begin of this more principall part, declaring the bond, by which we stand bound to Vertue: and therefore to God himselfe also, who seeing that he is goodnes it selfe, doth commend nothing in this world, doth desire nothing, doth not account any thing

Therefore with great care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, let vs consider those iust titles and claimes, which God hath, to demaund and exact this so great debt and bond of vs. But seeing that they be innumerable, wee will onely induce sixe of the chiefest, euery one of which seuerally do binde man, with out any excuse, to him in whatsoeuer he can or may. The first and greatest, and which can lesse be declared or expressed, is, to be him that he is;<note place="margin">GOD is that he is.</note> to which is referred the greatnes of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, and all his perfections. Hetherto pertaine the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible magnitude of his goodnes, mercy, iustice, wisedom, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power, noblenes, beautie, faithfulnesse, truth, benignitie, happines, maiestie, and the other riches and perfections that be in him; which are such and so immeasurable, that (as a certaine famous Doctor saith) if the whole world were ful of bookes, and all creatures Writers, and all the water of the Sea ynck, first all the bookes should be filled, first all the Writers should be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and first all the Sea should be exhausted and drawne drie, then one alone of his perfections should be described absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and as it is in deede, and in it selfe. The same Doctor also saith, if God should create a newe man, and should giue vnto him a hart so ample, capable and spacious, as are all the harts of men ioyned and mixed together, if that hart should apprehend with an immeasurable and vnusuall light the qualitie and quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of one of these perfections, it would faint, die, or breake in peeces, by reason of the greatnes of that ioy and pleasure, which should redound to it, except it were preserued by the singuler power of GOD.</p>
                        <p>This therefore is the first &amp; the most equall and iust reason, by which we are bound to loue God, and to serue &amp; obey him, who is truth it selfe in so high a degree, that the very Epicures themselues, who are the ouerthrowers and destroyers of all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, (for they denie the diuine prouidence, and the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie of soules) doe not denie that there is a Religion, which is the worship and adoration of God.<note place="margin">Epicures teach, that God is to be serued.</note> For one of them disputing in that Booke, which Tully writ of the nature of the Gods, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth and prooueth very strongly that there is a God; and also he acknowledgeth the altitude of his admirable and wonderfull perfections; and for them he saith, that he is to be worshipped,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:9369:11"/>
adored, and reuerenced, for this is due to the greatnes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of this most noble substance. Therefore he is to bee worshipped by that name and title onely, if hee had not anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For if we honour and reuerence a King for the onely dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his presence,<note place="margin">A similitude</note> although hee be without his kingdome, where we receiue no benefit by him; why rather should we not giue and exhibite all honour and reuerence, to this Lord, who (as Iohn testifieth) hath written vpon his garment, and vpon his thigh,<note place="margin">Apoc. 19.</note> 
                           <hi>The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> It is he that with his three fingers doth beare vp the round Globe of the earth, doth dispose of causes, &amp; moueth the heauens; it is he that changeth times, altereth the elements, diuideth the waters, bringeth forth the windes, engendereth causes, giueth influence to the Planets, and as an vniuersall King and Lord, doth nourish and sustaine all creatures.<note place="margin">The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is not by succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> That also is of greater moment, that his kingdom is not by succession, or by election, or by inheritance, but by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For euen as a man naturally is greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Pismier, so that most noble substance in greatnes doth far excell all other things created: insomuch that euery thing whatsoeuer it be, and the whole vniuersall world, in his eyes, haue scarce the quantitie and bignes of an Emmot. If that vnhappy Philosopher acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and confessed this truth, why shall not Christian phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy acknowledge and confesse it? This therefore teacheth, that although there be many titles and names, by which wee are bound to God: yet this, that we now entreate of, doth excell them all, the which is of such weight &amp; valuation, that (if there were no other) this alone deserueth all the loue and seruice of man, yea though he had infinite and innumerable soules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which might attend and waite vpon his worship and loue. That alwaies hath beene the care and studie of the Saints, whose loue were so pure and sincere,<note place="margin">Bernard in his 83. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vpon the Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> that of it S. Bernard saide; Pure loue doth not take strength from hope, and yet feeleth not the hurt of distrust. As if hee should say, that true loue is not kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led through hope to worship God, by which it hopes for any reward from God, neither to waxe colder, although it knowe that it should receiue nothing of him; for it is not mooued through lucre and profit but through pure loue, which is due to that infinite goodnes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="12" facs="tcp:9369:12"/>Although this reason chiefely doth binde vs vnto God, yet it doth lesse moue the weake and imperfect,<note place="margin">Why men are lesse moued with the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God.</note> and that for two causes. The first is, because our owne proper commodity doth moue by so much the more, by howe much our owne proper loue hath taken deeper roote in the soule. The second is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many men being rude and ignorant, doe not vnderstand the dignitie, and beauty of that supreame goodnes. For if they had receiued the knowledge of it, this onely glory &amp; splendour would so steale theyr harts from them, that beeing content with it alone, they would desire no other thing. Therefore I think it not amisse, to open a window to these men, and to yeelde them some light, that they may know more of the greatnesse of thys Lord. This doctrine is borrowed of that excellent &amp; great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Dionisius, who hath no other purpose in his mistical The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie, then to shew the dignitie of the Diuine essence, bee
ing compared with all other things created: teaching, that in the contemplation of God, our eyes are to bee turned from all the perfection of the creatures, least we be deceiued, being desirous to measure him by them; but leauing all these inferiour things, we must lift vp our minds to the contemplation of one Essence,<note place="margin">In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of God, we must turne our eyes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al creatures.</note> which is aboue all Essences; of one substance, which is aboue all substances; of one light, which is aboue all lights, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which, all light is darknes; of one beautie, which is aboue all beautie, to the which if all beautie be compared, it is defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and abhomination.</p>
                        <p>The clowde into which Moses entred, when he talked with the Lord,<note place="margin">Exod, 24.</note> doth signifie this vnto vs, which couered the face of all things, which were not God, that by this meanes the true God might be knowne more easily and more exactly. Thys thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Elias signified couering his eyes with his Mantle,<note place="margin">1. Kings, 19</note> when hee saw the glory of God passing by. For a man ought to turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his eyes from all things, as vnworthy, when hee will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template vpon the Diuine glory. This will bee showen more manifestly, if we consider the great difference betweene a thing vncreate, and a thing created: that is, the difference between the Creator and the creature. For we see that all the creatures had a beginning, and that they may haue an end; but he neither had beginning, neither can haue end. The creatures acknowledge a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9369:12"/>
superiour, and depend of him: The Creator neyther acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth superiour, nor dependeth of any. The creatures be mutable and subiect to diuers alterations: the Creator hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mutation in himselfe, nor any alteration. The creatures are mixt and compound; but in the Creator no composition is found, by reason of his pure simplenes. For if hee was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of many parts, hee should haue one to compound him, who should be before him, which is impossible. The cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures may be moe, then they are; haue more then they haue; know more then they know. The Creator cannot be moe then he is; seeing that the perfection of the whole Essence is in him; neyther can he haue more then he hath, seeing that in him is the bottomlesse deepenes of all riches: neyther can he knowe more then he doth know, seeing that his wisedome is infinite, and his excellency eternall, to which all things are as present. For which cause the great Philosopher Aristotle called the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator a pure act, signifying that hee is the chiefest and greatest perfection, to which nothing may be added: for it is impossible that he should participate more of that substance, wherof he is, neyther can any thing be thought of, which is wanting in him. All creatures doe fight vnder the banner of mutability, for like needy and poore beggers, they may be mooued to seeke for that, which is wanting vnto them: but he hath no cause at all to moue himselfe, because nothing is wanting to him, and he is found in euery place. All other things are found to be diuers and differing, and one to be distinguished from an other: but in him there is found no distinction of seuerall parts, by reason of his great simplenes: so that his Being, is his Essence, his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is his power, his power is his will, and his will is his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and his vnderstanding is his intent, and his intent is his wisedome, and his wisedom is his goodnes, and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is his iustice, and his iustice is his mercy: which although they haue contrary effects (as to pardon and to punish) yet in him really and in deede they are one and the same; in so much that his iustice is his mercy, and his mercy is his iustice; and so in him these operations and perfections appeare onely, but are not contrary in deede, as Augustine hath well noted. For he is most misticall and most powerfull, most beautifull and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9369:13"/>
strongest, stable and incomprehensible, without place and in euery place, inuisible and seeing all things, immutable &amp; chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all things: hee doth alwayes worke and is euer quiet, hee doth fill all things and is not included, hee is stretched ouer all things and not diuided: he is great without quality, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore immeasurable; hee is good without quality and therefore exceeding perfectly good.</p>
                        <p>To be briefe, that I may speake many things in few words, all things created as they haue their essence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ircumscript, which comprehendeth and contayneth them: so haue they their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer limited and finit, to which they are extended, and their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited labours in which they are exercised, and theyr circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script places in which they stand, and theyr certaine names by which they are called and demonstrated, and theyr particuler definitions by which they are declared, &amp; their particuler prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments vnder which they are contayned. But that supreme iustice as it is infinite in essence, so is it infinite in power, and in all other things: and as it hath no definition, by which his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is defined, so it hath no praedicament, vnder which it is contayned, no place in which it is limited, nor name whereby his right propriety may be signified: Yea rather seeing that he hath no name, as Dionysius sayth, he hath all names: for in him are found all perfections, which in these names are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and signified. Whereupon is inferred, that as all creatures are finite and limited, so are they comprehensible: but that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Essence solely as it is infinite, so is it incomprehensible of all created intelligences. For euen as, (saith Aristotle) that which is infinite hath no beginning, so neither absolutely nor fully can it be comprehended of any intelligence, vnlesse of that, which comprehendeth all things.</p>
                        <p>What other thing doe those two Seraphins signifie, which the Prophet Esay saw standing before the Lord,<note place="margin">Ess, 6,</note> who sate vpon an high throne, <hi>Euery one,</hi> sayth he, <hi>had sixe wings: with twaine hee couered his face, and with twaine he couered his feete</hi>; But to signifie, that those excellent spyrits, who haue so high a place in heauen, and are the nearest vnto God himselfe, cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all that is found in God: neyther come from one to an other that they may knowe and vnderstand these things, al|
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9369:13"/>
though they see him in his proper Essence &amp; beauty? For euen as one standing vpon the shoare doth see the Sea,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> and yet doth not see the breadth and depth of it; so those excellent spyrits, and all the other elect, which be in heauen, doe see God really, yet they cannot comprehend eyther the depth of his greatnes, or the altitude of his eternity. And although God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is sayd to sit vpon the Cherubines, yet rather hee may be sayd to stand vpon them, so that they cannot approach vnto him, much lesse comprehend him. This is the darknes, which, as the Psalmist sayth,<note place="margin">Psal. 18,</note> he made his secret place, and his pauilion round about him, euen darknes of waters, and cloudes of the ayre; that that might be signified, which the Apostle sayth, that God dwelleth in the light that none can attayne vnto,<note place="margin">1, Tim. 6.</note> and to which there is no passage open: therefore the Prophet calleth it darknes, because it hindrethas well the sight, as the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God.<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> For euen as (as a certaine Philosopher sayth) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there can be found nothing more bright and visible then the Sunne, yet nothing is lesse seene then it, by reason of the excellencie of his brightnes, and the weakenes of our sight: so although there is nothing in it selfe more intelligible then God, yet there is nothing in this lyfe lesse vnderstoode then he, for the same reasons. Wherfore he that after any manner kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth God, after he shall come to the end, and furthest limit of those perfections, which may be knowne, he shall confesse, that hee must further proceede by infinite wayes, and that God is greater then those infinite wayes, then that he may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended: and by how much the more he acknowledgeth that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Cap. 1</note> Wherfore Saint Augustine also sayth: When I seeke for my God, I doe not seeke for a shape of a body, not for the glory of time, not for the cleerenes of the light, not for beauty, not for the sound of sweet melody, and whatsoeuer ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant tunes: not for the sweete sauours and odours of flowers, oyntments and spices, not for honey and Manna pleasant and delightfull to the tast, not for other things gratefull and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the touch or embrace, neyther doe I seeke for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing subiect to these sences, when I doe seeke for my God. God forbid that I should thinke these to be my God, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so are apprehended of the sences of bruite beastes. And yet when I seeke for my God, I seeke for neuerthelesse a certaine light aboue all light, which mine eye is not capable of: a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine voyce aboue all voyces, which mine eare doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue: a certayne sauour aboue all sauours, which my nosthrils cannot conceaue: a certaine sweetnes aboue all sweetnes, which my tast cannot conceaue: a certaine embracing aboue all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracings, which my touch cannot conceaue. This light doth shine, where place doth not receaue it: this voyce doth sound, whereas no ayre doth moue it: this sauour doth smell, whereas no blast doth carry it: this tast doth there sauour, where there is no feeding: and this embrace is there touched, where it is not sundered.</p>
                        <p>But if thou wilt conceaue and vnderstand any thing of this incomprehensible magnitude, behold the frame of this world, which is the worke of his hands, that by the quality of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, thou mayst know the noblenes of the cause; presupposing that of Dionysius in the beginning, that in all things there is sound a Being, an Ability, and a Worke: which three doe so
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:9369:15"/>
agree betweene themselues,<note place="margin">Three things are to be marked in euery thing, the Being, the Ability, and the Worke.</note> that of what sort the Being of a thing is, of the same sort is the Ability of it, and what the Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the thing is such is the Worke of it. This principle being thus layde, let vs foorth-with enter into contemplation, how beautifull, how well ordered, and how great this world is: for in the firmament there are certayne starres of such great mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, as Astrologers say, that in their quantity they exceede eighty times the earth and the water, which together make but one Globe. Then agayne consider how beautifully adorned the world is, and how full of infinite variety of things, which are found in the earth, in the water, in the ayre, and in euery part of it, all which are made with such perfection, that (monsters being excepted) from the beginning of the world, euen to this day there is nothing found, to which any thing is wanting to the furnishing or perfection of his Essence. Then consider (as Saint Augustine sayth) that God created this huge and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable frame of the world, in a moment, and made it of nothing: for he made it without any matter beeing, without workmai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, without any workmen, without any instruments, without patterne, without any exteriour thing contayning example, and without space of time: but only according to the pure and simple conceipt of his owne will, he brought foorth into light this great worke, and this whole vniuerse of things.</p>
                        <p>Consider furthermore, that with the same facility he created this world, he could haue created infinite thousands of worlds, euery one of which should haue beene greater, more beautifull, and inhabited of moe people. And after hee had made them, hee could with the same facilitie haue cast them downe againe and ouerthrowne them, and brought them to nothing without any resistance. Therefore tell mee, if according to the doctrine of Dionysius (as it is presupposed before of vs) the power and force of the cause is knowne by the effects and work, and by the power &amp; force the Essence is knowne: What maner of power shall it be, from whence so great a worke proceeded? and if this power be such and so great, what an one, and howe incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible is that Essence, which is knowne by that power? This contemplation without all doubt, doth farre exceed all humane reach. In this we must further consider, that all these excellent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:9369:16"/>
and great workes, not onely as they are, but as they might haue beene, are as though they were not in the viewe of that diuine power, yea after an infinite manner they are lesser: for that is infinitely greater, to which this power doth extend it selfe. Who then will not be astonished, considering of the greatnes of such an Essence, and of such a power? which although a man cannot see with his externall eyes, yet he may make a most certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, and gather of the foresaid reason, how great it is, &amp; how incomprehensible.</p>
                        <p>This wonderfull immensitie of God, that great Schooleman Thomas Aquinas doth show in his Breuiarie of Diuinitie, by this example. We see (sayth he) in things corporall, that by how much any thing is more excellent, by so much also it is greater in quantitie; for we see that the element of the water is greater then the earth, and the ayre greater then the water, and the fire then the ayre: furthermore, the first or lowest heauen, is greater then the element of fire, the second heauen greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the first, and the third then the second; and after the same manner, by ascending euen to the tenth Spheare, yea euen to that heauen, which is aboue all the Spheares, whose greatnes is incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. That any one may plainly see, if he haue any consideration, how little the Globe and roundnes of the earth and water be, if they be compared with the heauens. The Astrologers also say, that the whole circumference of the earth and water, are but as a pricke or a poynt in comparison of heauen: which they proue manifestly by their demonstrations. For although the circle of the heauen be deuided into the twelue signes of the Zodiacke, through which once in a yeere the Sun doth runne, yet in ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Horizon onely sixe are seene: for the bignes and standing of the earth, dooth take vp and possesse no more place of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, then a leafe of paper or a tablet will, being placed and sette in the Center of the world, from whence the compasse of the heauen may be seene without let or impediment. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that that heauen which is aboue all the Spheares, which is the chiefest and the noblest body of the world, is of such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable magnitude aboue all bodies, we may easily vnderstand (sayth Thomas) how God, who is without any circumscription the chiefest, greatest, and best of all things, as well of things cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9369:16"/>
as spirituall, who also is the maker of them, ought &amp; must exceed all things with a certaine infinite magnitude, not in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie (for he is no body) but in excellencie and noblenesse of his most perfect Essence. But that we may returne from whence we are digressed; after the same manner we may search in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, how great and of what condition be the magnitudes &amp; perfections of this Lord. For it is necessary that they be such as his Essence is. Ecclesiasticus confesseth that, where he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of Gods mercy,<note place="margin">Eccle. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>According to his greatnes</hi> (saith he) <hi>so is his mercy:</hi> of such sort are all the rest of his perfections. Such is his goodnes, such is his benignitie, maiestie, gentlenes, wisedome, sweetnes, noblenes, beautie, omnipotencie, and to be briefe, such is his iustice. He therefore is infinitely good, infinitely sweet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely amiable, and woorthy whom all creatures should obey, feare and reuerence: insomuch, that if mans hart could containe infinite loue and feare, and infinite obedience and reuerence, all that should be obliged by the bond and rule of iustice, to the dignitie and excellencie of this Lord. For if as euery one is more worthy &amp; more excellent, so greater reuerence is due vnto him, it followeth, that seeing the excellencie of God is so infinite, that also infinite reuerence is due vnto him. Heereupon is inferred, that all that which is wanting to our loue and reuerence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we doe not come to that measure, is therefore wanting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is indebted to a dignitie of such greatnesse. Which thing seeing it is so, how great, I pray thee, is that debt, which this one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie title, although there were no other, doth request of vs in the loue &amp; obedience of this Lord? What I pray thee will he loue, who doth not loue so great a goodnesse? What will hee feare, who doth not feare so great a Maiestie? Whom will hee serue, who will not attend vpon such a Lord? For what is thy will made, if not to loue and embrace that, which is good? If then he be the chiefest good, what is the cause that our will doth not loue &amp; embrace him, aboue all that is called God? And if it bee so heynous an euill, not to loue or feare his Lord aboue all things, what wil it be not to esteeme or regard him? Who would haue euer supposed, that the malice of man would haue come to so great impietie? Neuerthelesse, to that height of peruersitie they are come, that for a little beastly pleasure, or for a little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:9369:17"/>
or for a small gaine and filthy lucre, doe offend and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne so great a goodnesse. O blindnes to be deplored, ô in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensiblenes more then bestiall, ô deuillish rashnes and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What doth not he deserue who dareth such things? with what punishment, with what kind of torture, shall the contempt of so great a maiestie be worthily satisfied? It is certaine, that it shall be punished with no lesser torment, then that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for such an offence; that is, that whosoeuer hee be that contemneth God, shall be tormented in hell fire euerlastingly, and yet neither shall he worthily be punished.</p>
                        <p>This then is the first Title, which bindeth vs to the loue and seruice of this Lord: which bond is so great, that all bonds, by which by any manner of meanes in thys world we are bound to any person, eyther for his excellency, or for his perfection, are vnworthy the name of bonds, if they be compared with this. For euen as the perfections of all other things being compared with the diuine, are no perfections: so neither the bonds, which by reason of their perfections and excellencies are named such, are bonds, beeing compared with this: as neyther all the offences made onely to the creatures cannot be called offences, if they be compared to them, by which the Creator himselfe is offended. For which cause Dauid also in that paenitentiall Psalme sayth, that he had offended the Lord onely,<note place="margin">Psalm, 50,</note> and onely sinned against him, albeit he had offended most grieuously against Vrias, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had commaunded to be slaine, being innocent: and against his wife, whom he had defiled with filthy adultery, and against all his owne kingdome, which hee had so scandalizd. Yet hee saith that he had sinned against GOD onely; for he knew that all euils, offences, and inconueniences, were of no moment in comparison of the filthines of that sinne, for asmuch as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned the Law of God. Therefore the consideration of that enormitie, did so greatly afflict him, that he contemned, and set at naught all other iniu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ies and offences whatsoeuer. For euen as God is infinitely greater then all creatures, so also our debt is infinitely greater, in which wee are bound to him, and also the offence greater which is committed against him. For there is no proportion of a thing infinite, to a thing finite.</p>

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E ought not only to apply our selues vnto Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and to obey the diuine commaundements, for that which God is in himselfe; but also for that which hee is to vs: that is, by reason of his innumerable benefits: of which although wee haue spoken in another place, for that purpose which then we had in hand, neuerthelesse heere also wee will handle the same things: that they being before our eyes, we may see plainly, by how many names and titles we are bound to serue such a giuer. Of these benefits our Creation is the first, of which (seeing that it is knowne to euery bodie) onely I will say that, that man wholy is bound for that alone to serue and attend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord, who hath created him. For according to all lawes, a man is a debtor of all that he hath receiued. Seeing that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by this benefite he hath receiued his being, that is, his body, with all his senses, and his soule, with all her powers and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the consequent is, that he must bestow all them to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his Maker, vnlesse he will be accounted towards him a theefe, and an ingratefull man, beeing enriched with so great a benefit. For if a man should build a house, whom shall it serue for, but for the Lord who builded it? And if a man shall plant a Vineyard, who shall gather the grapes? shall not hee that hath planted the Vineyard? And if a Father hath a sonne, whom shal he rather serue then his father, who begat him.</p>
                        <p>This is that, which auncient lawes doe say, that it cannot be esteemed how great the authority of the father is ouer his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which reacheth so farre, that it was lawfull for a father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in necessity to sell his child: for in respect of that, that hee hath giuen to his child to be that he is, therefore the father hath that power ouer his child, that he might doe with his child what he would. If therfore the dominion and authority of a father
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:9369:18"/>
be so great ouer his child; what shall be his dominion and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, from whom is deriued the being of all fathers, as well in heauen as in earth? And if they as Seneca sayth, who haue receaued a benefit, ought to imitate and follow the fertile field, which yeeldeth much more, then it receaueth: how shall wee make aunswere to God, in this measure of gratitude, seeing that we cannot yeeld more vnto him, then we haue receaued of him, although we yeeld all that we haue? But if he that yeeldeth no more, then he hath receaued, doth not obserue and keepe this law and rule;<note place="margin">Honour is due to God, because he is our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> what shall we say of him, who yeeldeth lesse, then is bestowed vpon him? And if, as Aristotle sayth, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rendered like to God and our parents, how shall there be giuen like to God, who hath bestowed more vpon vs, then all the fathers in the world? But if it be a greeuous offence, if a sonne be disobedient to his father, what a wickednes will it be to be rebellious to God, who by so many names is our father? Yea in comparison of whom no man deserueth the name of a father? This is that which the Lord worthily complayneth of by his Prophet.<note place="margin">Mal. 1.</note>

As liued that cursed King of Aegypt, whom God threatneth by his Prophet saying: <hi>Behold, I come against thee, Pharaoh King of Egipt, the great Dragon, that lyeth in the midst of his riuers, which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:9369:18"/>
hath sayde, The riuer is mine, and I haue made it for my selfe.</hi> After this manner liue all they, that forget theyr Creator, as though they were created of themselues acknowledging no maker. Better did Saint Augustine,<note place="margin">Augustine in one of his Solilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies. ca. 31.</note> who by the knowledge of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and beginning came to the knowledge of his Creator, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one of his Soliloquies: And I returned to my selfe, and I entred into my selfe, and I sayde vnto my selfe: Who art thou? and I aunswered my selfe, a reasonable man and mortall: and I began to discourse and dispute with my selfe, what this was, and I sayd: Whence commeth ô my Lord God this manner of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature? Whence, but from thee? Thou madest me, and not I my selfe. Who art thou? Thou art hee, by whom I liue, thou art he by whom all things liue. Who art thou? Thou ô Lord art my true and onely God, omnipotent, and eternall, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible and vnmeasurable, who alwayes liuest, and nothing dyeth in thee. O my God tell me thy humble seruant, ô mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull God tell mee poore wretch, tell mee I pray thee for thy mercies sake, whence is this manner of creature, but from thee? Shall any man be the maker of himselfe? Is to be and to liue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from any other then from thee? Art not thou the chiefest good, of whom all things are that be? For whatsoeuer is, is of thee, because nothing is without thee. Art not thou the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of life, from whence floweth all life? For whatsoeuer ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, liueth by thee, because nothing liueth without thee. Thou ô Lord then hast made all things. Shall I aske who hath made me? Thou ô Lord hast made me, without whom nothing is made. Thou art my maker, &amp; I thy worke. I giue thee thanks, ô my Lord God, by whom I liue, and by whom all things liue. I giue thee thanks ô my framer &amp; fashioner, because thy hands haue made me, &amp; fashioned me. I yeeld thee thanks ô my light, because thou hast enlightned mee, and I haue found both thee, and my selfe. This is therfore the first of the diuine benefits, and the foundation of all the other. For all other doe presuppose a Being, which is giuen by this benefit; and so all are gotten and ioyned with this as accidents with their substance, in which they haue their ground and footing, that by this meanes thou mayst vnderstand, how large &amp; liberall a benefit it is, and how worthy it is that thou shouldest deepely and profoundly consider of it.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9369:19"/>
Goe too therefore, if God requires so great a thanksgiuing of thee for euery one of his benefits, what doest thou thinke that he will require, for this alone, which is the foundation of all the other? Especially seeing that it is the condition of the diuine Godhead, that as he is most liberall in bestowing of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, so is he most desirous, and as it were couetous in requiring thanks for them. Not because hee doth stand neede of them, but because our duty doth will them. For in the old Testament we reade that God did no sooner bestow one benefit vpon his people, but forth-with it being scarse bestowed, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it should be had amongst them in perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and that for it they should giue euerlasting and immortall thanks.<note place="margin">Exod, 12,</note> So when he deliuered his people from the Egyptian seruitude and yoake, scarsely they were gone out of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, when he commaunded, that euery yeere they should cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate a solemne feast in remembrance of that benefit.<note place="margin">Exod. 13.</note> For that end also he slew all the first borne of the Egiptians, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with commaunded that all the Israelites first borne should be sanctified vnto him, as well of men as of beasts, which after that should be borne of them, or amongst them.<note place="margin">Exod. 16. GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of vs, grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</note> The Lord sent the Israelites Manna from heauen, where-with they might be fed, and hee fed them with that kinde of meate forty yeeres in the wildernes: as soone as they had begun to eate it, he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to gather a certaine measure of the Manna, and to put it into a pot, and to lay it vp before the Testimony, that all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity might haue knowledge of this benefit. Not long after that, he gaue them a famous victory against the Amalekites, and sayd vnto Moses:<note place="margin">Exod. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>Write this for a remembrance in the booke, and rehearse it in the eares of Iosua.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If therfore God be so carefull, that the memory of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall benefits should liue for euer amongst his people; what will he not require of vs, for this immortall benefit, seeing that our soule, which he hath giuen vnto vs, is immortall? Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon sprung that consideration, which moued the holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches to build Alters, that there might be monuments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances as often as they receaued any particuler benefits of the Lord: yea they did remember in the names of their sons receaued benefits,<note place="margin">Gen. 41.</note> least they shold be buried in obliuion. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

a certaine holy man very well concluded, that man should not oftner breathe, then he should be mindfull of his God. For euen as he alwayes hath a Being, so alwayes ought he to giue thanks to his Lord God for his immortall Being, which he hath receaued of him. The Bond of this obligation is so great, that also it was not vnknown to the Ethnick Philosophers but there were amongst them, that exhorted men that they should not be ingratefull to God.<note place="margin">Epictetus.</note> Epictetus a Stoicke Philosopher was wont to say: O man be not ingratefull to that high power, for benefits receaued, as are thy sight, hearing, tast, &amp;c. But more for thy life, which he hath giuen thee, and for other things with which he nourisheth and sustaineth thee. Giue thanks to him for the ripe fruites, for wine, for oyle, and for all other things. But especially thou oughtest to blesse him, because he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon thee the light of reason, that thou mayst vse all them afore-sayd, and that thou mayst know theyr valour and worth. If an Heathen man shall so commend gratitude, &amp; shall exact it so strictly for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon benefits; what ought not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man to doe, who hath also receaued a greater light of faith, and greater, &amp; more excellent benefits and blessings of God?</p>
                        <p>But perhaps thou wilt say;<note place="margin">That the benefits of nature are of God.</note> that these common benefits doe seeme rather to be of Nature, then of God: to which why ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am I bound for the disposition or the order of thinges, which are regularly done, and doe obserue theyr course? Alas, this is not the voyce of a Christian, but of an Ethnick, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Beast. But that thou mayst know and acknowledge this more manifestly, heare the same Philosopher, chiding and correcting such men. Thou wilt say perhaps that nature besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth these benefits vpon thee: Ah thou too much ingratefull man, doest thou not mark, that in saying that, thou doest change a name of God? vvhat other thing is Nature then God, who is the first and chiefest nature? Not therefore, ô ingratefull man art thou to be excused, when thou saiest that thou art bound to Nature, and not to GOD, seeing that not any nature may be found without God. If thou shouldest obtaine any thing of Lucius Seneca, and afterwards shouldest say, that thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to Lucius, and not to Seneca, thou dost not change thy Creditor, but onely his name.</p>

                           <p>FVrthermore, not onely the debt of iustice, but also our own necessitie, doth binde vs to haue alwaies a respect and an eye to our Creator: if after that we be created, we will attaine vnto felicitie and perfection. For we must know, that those thinges, which are borne and breede (after a common manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) are not forthwith borne with all their perfection.<note place="margin">All things that are borne, are not by and by perfect.</note> They haue many things perfect, yet many things in them are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which afterwards are perfected. That perfection he must adde and giue, who began the worke. So that it pertayneth to that cause, which gaue the first Beeing, to giue also the finishing and perfection. Heere-vpon it is, that all effects in their kinde, haue recourse and looke backe to their causes, that of them they may receiue their last perfections. Plants do labour as much as lies in them, that they may finde out the Sun, and that they may send foorth theyr rootes into the earth, which produced and brought them foorth: Fishes also doe not goe out of that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which engendered them: a Chickin being excluded out of the Egge, by and by doth hatch it selfe vnder the winges of the Henne, and followeth her wheresoeuer shee goeth. The same doth a Lambe, who after that he is brought forth, presentlie hasteth to the dugges of his Damme; and if there were a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand sheepe of the same fleece and colour, yet hee knoweth his owne Damme, &amp; goeth alwaies with her: as though he should say: Hence I haue receaued that I haue, hence I will require that which I want. This almost in all naturall things hath place, and also it would come in vse amongst artificiall things, if either they had sence or motion. If a Painter in delineating &amp; pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying a picture, should leaue the eyes imperfect, if that picture could perceiue it,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> or could be admonished of that it wanteth, what doost thou thinke that it would doe? whether would it goe? it is certaine that it would not goe to the pallace of a King or of a Prince, because they could not satisfie the desire of it, nor supply his want: but it would returne to the house of his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and there would desire him, that he would make it perfect, and that he would finish that he began. Tell mee, ô reasonable
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:9369:20"/>
man, what is the cause, that thou doost not that, which vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable creatures doe? Thou art not yet perfect, many thinges are lacking in thee, many things are as yet wanting to thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art finished or perfected. The first example and patterne, as yet is not scarce delineated and drawne (as we say) after a rough and rude manner: the comlines, decking &amp; trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the worke are yet wanting, which most plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth the continuall appetite of that nature: which alwayes as it were feeling her owne necessitie, desireth alwayes seruent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and seeketh carefully that which is wanting to her.</p>
                           <p>God will afflict thee with hunger, that being compelled by this necessity, he might make thee enter in by the right gate, and that thou shouldest haue respect vnto him. For this cause, hee that made thee, would not presently finish and make thee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: and for this cause he would not presently make thee rich. Hee dyd this, not because hee is couetous, but because hee is louing and fauourable to thee, knowing that it is good, that thou shouldest be such an one, not that thou shouldest be poore, but that thou shouldest be humble; not that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest alwayes be in neede, but that thou shouldest alwaies haue respect vnto him. If therefore thou be blinde, poore, and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding neede of many things, why doost thou not runne to thy Father that created thee, and to the Painter that shadowed thee, that hee may perfect those things which are missing and vvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting?</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OT onely man is bound to the Lord his GOD for the benefit of Creation, but also for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of preseruation: for it is he that made thee, &amp; after he made thee, hee also preserueth thee, so that thou doost depend of his hands, and thou canst no more lyue without him, then bee without him, before thou wast created. This is no lesse a benefit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that former. For that was but onely once done for thee, but this is alwaie done and renued, and the Lord daily by one meanes or other, dooth estsoones create thee: for him he continually preserueth, whom he once created. Not lesse power, nor lesse loue is required in the one, then in the other. If thou therefore owest so much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, who created thee in a moment; how much more shalt thou be indebted to him, for that he preserueth thee continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie? thou doost not mooue a foote, which hee doth not mooue, neither doost thou open or shutte thine eyes without his helpe. And if thou doost not beleeue that God doth moue thy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers when thou doost mooue, thou art not worthy that thou shouldest be called a Christian: but if thou doost beleeue, that he doth yeeld and bestow vpon thee this fauour, and yet darest offend him, I doe not know by what name I shoulde call thee.</p>
                        <p>Tell me, if a man should stand in an high tower, and should hold an other man in his hand hanging by a small thred,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> durst he thinkest thou, that seeth himselfe in such a case, slaunder and rayle at him that holdeth him? If thou therefore, that art sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Diuine goodnesse, as hanging by a very small thred, that if God doth but a little draw backe his hand, thou necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily commest to naught; how is it possible, that thou darest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke to wrath that Diuine Maiestie, which sustaineth thee, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in that same time, wherein thou offendest him?<note place="margin">In his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie, ca. 4.</note> For as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onisius sayth) the vertue and goodnes of the chiefest Good is so excellent, that the creatures when they are immorigerous and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9369:22"/>
disobedient, doe receaue of his immeasurable vertue the Being and Ability, by which they striue and strugle against him, that they may both Be, and be able to repugne him. Which seeing that it is so, how darest thou offend with thy members and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that Lord, who preserueth thee? O great blindnes, ô intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable rebellion. Who euer saw so impudent a conspiracy? The members doe rise against the head, of which their life and death dependeth. The day will come, when this iniury shall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and the complaints of the diuine honor shal be heard. Haue yee conspired against God? It is equall and right that the vniuerse of the whole world shold likewise conspire against you, and that God should arme euery creature to the reuenge of that iniury, and that all the whole circumference of the earth should warre against the ingratefull, and those that will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this benefit. For it is meete, that they that would not open their eyes, whilst they had time, and were inuited of so great a multitude of diuine benefits, I say, that is meete, that their eyes shold be opened by the multitude of torments, which neuer shall haue end. But what will be done, if to these afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd we set before thee, the plentifull, rich and aboundant table of this world,<note place="margin">All things created for the vse of man.</note> which the Lord hath created for thine vse? What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is found vnder the cope of heauen, is eyther for the vse of man, or for the vse of that thing, which attendeth and way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vpon man: for if man be not fed (as I may so say) with flies, that flye in the ayre, yet he is fed with those birds, which are fed with these flies: and if hee eate not grasse and wild hearbs, yet he eateth the beasts of diuers sorts and kinds, which are nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with these hearbs. Cast, and cast againe thine eyes vpon euery corner of the world, and thou shalt see how spacious and large the bounds and limits of thy riches are, and how plentifull and affluent is thine inheritance. Euery thing that goeth vpon the earth, that swimmeth in the water, that flyeth through the ayre, that shineth in heauen, is thine. But all these benefits are of God, and the works of his prouidence are the glasses of his beauty, and testimonies of his mercy, the sparks of his loue, and the reports and prayses of his liberality. See how many Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers God sendeth vnto thee, that thou mayst know him. All things that are in heauen and in earth (sayth Saint Augustine)

If thou hast eares that thou canst vnderstand the voyces of the creatures, thou shalt perceaue manifestly, how they all together teach thee, that thou shouldest loue God. For all they in holding their peace, cry that they were made for thy seruice, that thou, as well for thy selfe, as for them, mightest serue both thy Lord &amp; theirs.<note place="margin">The expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulation of the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts with man.</note> Heauen sayth, I doe minister vnto thee by day the light of the Sunne, and by night the benefit of the Moone and starres, that thou shouldest not walke in darknes; and I doe giue and send vnto thee diuers influences, that diuers things may encrease and breed with thee, that thou mayst not perish thtough hunger. The ayre sayth, I doe apply my selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, that thou mayst breathe in me: I doe coole and refresh thee; I doe temper and moderate thine internall heate, least it consume thee: I haue in me diuers kinds of birds, that by their variety and beauty thine eyes may be delighted, thine eares with their singing pleased, and thy pallate by their tast contented, and satisfied. The water sayth, I do serue thee in the appoynted times of the yeere with my rayne and showers; I doe refresh &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thee with my riuers and springs: I doe bring forth &amp; nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish diuers kinds of fishes, that they may be meate for thee, I doe water thy sowing, thy gardens, &amp; fruitfull trees, that thou mayst be nourished with them all, I doe giue thee way through the midst of the Sea, that thou maist traffique with the whole world, and that it may be at thy pleasure to ioyne thy riches with the wealth of another Hemispheare. What thinkest thou that the earth will say, which is the common mother of vs all, &amp; as it were the shop and ware-house of all naturall things? Truly it will say not without reason, I doe beare thee as an vnprofitable lump, I thy mother doe carry thee as it were in mine armes, I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide thee of necessaries; I doe sustaine thee with the fruits of my bowels; I haue participatinn &amp; communion with all the other elements, with all the heauens, and I doe pertake of all theyr in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, and I doe fruitfully yeeld and giue thee all my bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. To conclude I like a good mother, neyther leaue thee in life nor death: for in lyfe I doe suffer thee to tread vpon mee with thy feete, and doe sustaine and beare thee vp; and in death
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9369:23"/>
I yeeld thee a place of quiet and rest, and I doe hide and enclose thee within my wombe. What neede I many words? All the world doth cry with a loud voyce, Behold with what great loue my Lord and Creator doth affect thee, who created me for the loue of thee, and willed that I should serue thee for him, &amp; that thou in like manner shouldest loue and serue him, who created me for thee, and thee for himselfe.</p>
                        <p>These are, ô man, the voyces of all the creatures: marke and giue eare now that there can be no such wicked deafenes, as to heare these voyces, and to be ingratefull for so great benefits. If thou hast receaued a benefit, pay thy debt by thankfulnes, least thou be plagued vvith the punishment of ingratefull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. For euery one of the creatures (as very well sayth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne Doctour) doe speake to,<note place="margin">The crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do cal vpon vs with three words.</note> and call vpon man with three words, Receaue, Render, Beware: that is, receaue a benefit, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy debt, and beware of punishment, if thou doest not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
                        <p>But that thou mayst more feruently meditate &amp; think vpon these things, consider how Epictetus a Philosopher, of whom we haue made mention before, came to the knowledge of this Diuinity: who willeth that in all things created we shold heare and see our Creator,<note place="margin">The saying of Epictetus</note> saying: When the Crow doth crooke, and doth fore-shew any change of weather, it is not the Crow that doth fore-shew this to thee, but God himselfe. And if by mans voyce thou be admonished of any thing, is it not in like manner God, who created man, and gaue vnto him power and ability, that he might be able to admonish? That thou mayst know that the Diuine power doth worke somtimes by one meane, and somtimes by another, that he may doe as seemeth good in his owne eyes. For when things are of any great moment, which he would haue signified vnto vs, he causeth that they be signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of more worthy and more noble Embassadours. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the same Phylosopher goeth forwards: At the length when thou hast ended the reading of my counsailes and adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, thou shalt say vnto thy selfe; These things are not spoken vnto me of Epictetus the Phylosopher, but of God. For from whence, if not from him hath he got this faculty of pleading &amp; perswading? Therfore not he, but God by him hath told these
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:9369:23"/>
things to me. Hetherto Epictetus. How shall he be worthy the name of a Christian, who blusheth and is ashamed to proceede thither, whether this Heathen man proceeded? Certainly it is a most shamefull thing, that eyes enlightened with the clearenes of fayth should not see this, which, eyes set in the mist and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of reason did see.</p>

Thou wilt say, that it is a filthy thing to say that we are made like vnto beasts, and that we resemble beastes in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; but yet it is reason and meete,<note place="margin">Men like vnto swine.</note> that wee speake of men according to their deserts.

Dost thou thinke, that it pleaseth God, that men should be excelled &amp; exceeded in reason of beastes?

                              <note place="margin">See Aulus Gellius in the 5. booke &amp; 14. chap.</note> What is more cruell and fierce then a Lyon? and yet Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion Polihistor writeth, that Androdus a Dane, the seruaunt of a Romane Senator, beeing constrained to take his flight into Affrica through the bad dealing of his Maister with him, being daily and vniustly beaten &amp; abused; and that his lurking might be the more safe and secret, he liued in the wildernes of fieldes, and in the desert of sands; and hauing gotte into a certaine Den farre from any frequencie of people, there hee hid and reposed himselfe. Not long after, a Lyon came thether into the same Denne,<note place="margin">The nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a Lyon.</note> with one of his feete lame &amp; wounded, pittifully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, and lamenting the griefe of his wound. At the first, the seruaunt was horribly afraide, but at the length, the Lyon beeing mild and gentle, came vnto him, and lifting vp his foote, showed it to the seruaunt, as though hee seemed to desire his helpe. Androdus (as sayth Appion) pulled out a great stumpe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:9369:24"/>
or stalke of a tree sticking in the sole of his foote, and crushed and squeased out the putrified matter that was festered and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted within the wound. The Lyon being eased through the cure and helpe of Androdus, putting his foote into his hands, he laid him downe and rested himselfe: &amp; from that time three whole yeeres, the seruaunt and the Lyon liued together, in the same Denne, and with the same foode. For what soeuer wilde beastes the Lyon hunted &amp; tooke, hee brought the more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and daintier parts of them to Androdus; which he with the mid-day sunne (for he had no fire) rosted and eate. At the length, Androdus being wearie with that kinde of life, fledde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the Lyon being absent: and being taken, and brought to Rome to his Maister, he was condemned to the beasts. In the meane time, the Lyon was also taken, and brought to Rome, &amp; is let in for to fight with Androdus. The Lyon when hee sawe him a farre of, on a suddaine stoode still, as though he was ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and after that, as though he should know him, came vnto him leysurely and peaceably. Then he mooued his tayle, after the manner and custome of fawning doggs, gently and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and licked his legges and hands with his tongue softly, and pleasantly.</p>
                           <p>Androdus, at these blandishments and allurements of so cruell and fierce a beast, plucked vp his spirits, and at length knew the Lyon, and both seemed to reioyce. For this cause, the man and the Lyon were both sette free, which Lyon was giuen to the man by the Suffrages of the people. Afterwards (as Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion proueth by the testimonie of the whole people of Rome) Androdus ledde this Lyon by a small thong of leather through out the whole Cittie, about all places where men meet to talke and to be merry, and much money was giuen to Androdus, &amp; a long while after, the people euery where cast flowers vppon the Lyon.<note place="margin">Plinie lib, 8. cap. 17.</note> Furthermore, one Helpis of Samos sayling into Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, his shyp standing by the shoare and he going on land, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spyed a Lyon fearefullie gaping vpon him, for dread of whom he gotte vp into a tree. But the Lyon lying him downe at the roote of the tree, with that gaping that he terrified, with that he desired and besought helpe and pittie. A bone, through hys strong and fierce byting and griping, stucke fast in his teeth,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:9369:25"/>
which so hindered his feeding, that hee was almost pined to death. Helpis, seeing the thing, came out of the tree, and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out the bone, hee holding and applying his mouth to his hand. And so long as the shippe stayed by the shoare, the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requited the benefit of his helper, for he continually &amp; daily bringing his prayes to him, feasted all that were in the shyppe.</p>
                           <p>No lesse admirable is that, which is remembred of another Lyon,<note place="margin">The like to this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of Henricus Leo, Duke of Saxonie. See Kranti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in his Saxonie lib. 6. cap. 34.</note> who fighting with a Dragon, was wonderfully ouerbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ouer-matched of him, so that through the woundes that the Dragon gaue him, his life was greatly endangered: by great chaunce a certaine Knight beeing on hunting, came that way, and seeing the Lyon in such hazard, helped him, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Dragon. For which benefit, the Lyon followed the Knight, and neuer left him afterwards: and when the Knight went foorth to hunt, the Lyon did his part in the chace. But when as the Knight tooke shippe without the Lyon, the Lyon seeing himselfe forsaken and left of his Maister, cast himselfe into the sea, and by swimming followed the shyp; but beeing wearie through too much labour, hee was drowned in the vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no body being at hand to help him. What shall wee say of the fidelitie &amp; gratitude of Horses? Plinie reporteth of certaine Horses,<note place="margin">The grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Plinie, lib. 8 cap. 42.</note> which lamented the death of their Maisters: of others, which shed teares for the death of their Maisters. King Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes being slaine, his horse pined away to death. Some Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses haue reuenged their maisters death with their heeles, and with byting. So a certaine King of the Scythians beeing slaine, when as the conquerour came to dispoyle his slaine enemie, he was killed of his horse with his blowes and byting.</p>
                           <p>These are light and slight, if we compare them with the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie, friendship, and gratitude of doggs;<note place="margin">The grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of doggs. Plinie lib. 8. cap. 40.</note> of which the same Plinie doth remember admirable things. Hee writeth of a dog which did fight against theeues, and beeing sore beaten, would not depart from his slaine Maister, but driue away birds and wilde beastes, that they should not teare the dead body. And that a dog, Iason Lycius his Maister beeing slaine, woulde eate no meate, but died through hunger. But hee speaketh of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, admirable beyond the rest, which hee testifieth to haue happened at Rome in his tyme, Appius Iunius, and Publius
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9369:25"/>
Silius beeing Consuls. When as punishment was inflicted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a certaine youth in the matter and cause of Nero Germani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, his dogge could not bee driuen from the prison, neyther would he depart from his Maister, but his Maister beeing cast into that place, whether condemned men were throwne, he sent forth lamentable howlings, a great company of the people of Rome standing about him.</p>
                           <p>But heare more wonderfull things; when one of the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by had cast meate to the dogge, the dogge tooke it, and layde it vpon the mouth of his dead maister. At length, when as by the sentence of the Iudge, the dead body was cast into the Riuer of Tyber, the dogge endeuoured to keepe it vp, that it might not be drowned. What can be worthy of greater admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? In the time of Henricus Auceps the Emperour, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dogge in the pallace of Caesar,<note place="margin">Ditmarus, in the first booke of his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle.</note> knowing the enemie of his Maister, ranne vpon him, and with a suddaine snatch bytte his right hand, and as though the matter had been well doone, hee returned to his friendes, wagging his taile. All that were present maruailing at it, and hee that was bitten beeing asked in vvhat thing he had wronged the dogge; he confessed, that he had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly killed the Maister of the dog, lying a sleepe, beeing wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, his dog striuing much against it, but all in vaine.</p>
                           <p>If therefore beastes, in whom there is no reason, but onely a certaine sparke of a naturall instinct, by the which they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a benefit, be so gratefull, and are aydful in what they may, and doe obey and serue their benefactors; howe can it bee that man should be so carelesse, and so forgetfull of him, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom come and flow to him so many benefits; seeing that hee is eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with so great a light, to acknowledge benefits receiued? Is it possible, that hee shoulde suffer himselfe to bee excelled of beastes, in the lavv of humanitie, fidelitie, and gratitude? espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, seeing that they are infinitely greater, which man hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of God, then those which beastes can expect of man: seeing also the person, vvho dooth giue, and the loue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they are giuen, &amp; the intent for which they are giuen, are much more excellent: and that GOD doth not giue, that he expects lucre or gaine thereby, but of his meere grace and loue towards vs? Surely, it is a thing to bee astonished and amazed at, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:9369:26"/>
which doth sufficiently and euidently argue, that there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of deuils, which doe blind our vnderstanding, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den our vvill, and disturbe our memory, that wee may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member so great a benefactour.</p>
                           <p>Furthermore, if it be so great an offence, not to remember this Lord, vvhat, I pray thee, and how great vvill it be, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him? yea to offend him with his owne benefits? The first degree of ingratitude, sayth Seneca, is, not to recompence bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits with benefits:<note place="margin">Diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</note> the second is, to forget the benefactour: the third is, to doe ill to him who hath doone well to thee: and that seemeth to be most vilde and vnworthy: but who doth offend his benefactour with those same benefits which hee receiued of him, and doth conuert those benefits to the iniury aud hurt of his benefactour? Truly I know not whether any man may bee found in the world, who dooth that vnto another man, vvhich many men dare doe vnto GOD himselfe.<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> Who is that man, (although he be neuer so dangerous and wicked) who when he hath receaued most ample and large gifts of a King or Prince, that with them will foorth-with muster together an Armie, and set vpon the King? And doost thou wretched man, with those same benefits, which God the giuer of all good things hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon thee, mooue warre against him, and stirre vp and sette thy self against him? What greater wickednesse can bee thought of?<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> Would it not be a wickednesse intollerable, if a married woman should giue all her Ouches, Tablets, Ringes, Chaynes, Earings, and Bracelets (which her husband gaue her, that shee might be beautified with them, and to please him,) to an adulterer, that shee may allure him to her loue? I doe not thinke that a more execrable and damnable thing coulde bee thought of in the world; and yet this iniurie is doone to man of man, to an equall of an equall.

All these precious things, for which wee ought to giue to the Lord God infinite and euerlasting thanks, they vse as the prouokements of their riotousnes and luxuries: peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the vse of all the creatures of God, and making them the instruments of vanity, which they ought to make the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vertue.

not suffer, that this so dangerous a burthen layd vpon thee doe remaine to the houre of death; which by how much it is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by so much a straighter account shall be exacted of thee. That God giueth much to him, who is ingratefull, is a certaine kinde of iudgement: but when he giueth to him, that abuseth his benefits, it is a token of reprobation. For in this we shew that wee haue put off all shamefastnes; the beasts in this kinde of vertue doe goe before vs, and are much more thankfull to their benefactour, then wee are.

I know not what to speake, neyther what to keepe close and silent. If the idlenes and slothfulnes of men did not neede this prick to liue well, it were better to adore with silence the altitude and depth of such a benefit, then to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and darken it with the harshnes (that I may so speake) and penury of my tongue.<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> It is remembred in the writings of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men, that a certaine famous Paynter, when he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paynt the funerall solemnity of a certaine Kings Daughter, fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned many of her kinsfolks &amp; alliance standing about the course with sorrowfull and heauy countenances; hee ioyned also the mother vnto them, more mournfull and sorrowfull then the rest: When he came to delineate and pourtray the father, hee did couer his face with a certaine artificiall shadow; signifying

thereby that his Art did heere faile him. By which new deuice and inuention he expressed the greatnes of his greefe. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all our knowledge is not sufficient to declare the benefit of our Creation, what tongue, what eloquence, what oratory, can sufficient worthily expresse the benefit of our Redemption? God created all things with the onely becke and pleasure of his will; but for mans redemption he sweat thirty three yeeres, hee shed his blood, neyther had he any one member or sence, which was not tormented and vexed with some particuler and peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er greefe. It seemeth that an iniury is done to this glorious mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, if any man shall suppose that he can expresse it with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane tongue.</p>
                        <p>Then what shall I doe; shall I speake or shall I holde my peace? I may not be silent, and I cannot speake. How can it be, that I should keepe in silence thy mercy so vnmeasurable, and how shall I declare this mistery so high and so to be adored? To hold my peace ingratitude, to speake may be called rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and presumption. Wherefore ô my God, I intreate thine vnmeasurable piety, grant vnto me, that as long as I shall speake of thy glory after my rude manner, those blessed spirits, which are aboue in heanen, who know how to glorifie thee, may prayse and glorifie thee for me, and that thy holy spirit may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister and supply vnto me those things, wherin I faile.</p>
                        <p>After that man was created, and seated in a place of delights in great dignity and glory,<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note> and also was bound to God with so great and straight bonds, as the benefits were great, that he had receaued of him, he became disobedient and rebelled: and of those things, of which he should haue taken and receaued grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter causes of louing his Creator, of those he receaued and tooke greater occasion of treason and disloyalty. Therefore he was thrust out of Paradice, and cast into banishment, yea, and was adiudged to hell fire; that as hee was made a companion with the deuill in sinne, so hee might be his companion in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Prophet Elizeus sayd to his seruant Gehezi,<note place="margin">4, Kings, 5.</note> 
                           <hi>Thou hast receaued siluer and garments of Naaman: therefore the lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of Naaman shall cleaue vnto thee, and to thy seede for euer.</hi> Like was the iudgement of God against man, who seeing that he had affected the riches and treasure of Lucifer (that is his pride

and ambition) it was meete that he should be infected with the leaprosie of the same Lucifer, which was the punishment of his pride. Behold then man made lyke vnto the deuill, being a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of his fault.</p>
                        <p>Therfore when man was so abhominable in Gods eyes, and had incurred so great displeasure, our most gracious and most mercifull Lord, did not disdaine to respect vs, he did not looke to the iniurie done to his supreame Maiesty, but to the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of our owne misery: more lamenting our errour, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of reuenge, for the contumely offered vnto him: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to repaire man and to reconcile him vnto him, his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie begotten sonne being our Mediatour. But how hath he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled man vnto him? What humane tongue shall declare this vnto vs?<note place="margin">The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the incarnation</note> Christ hath procured so great friendship between vs and God, that not onely God hath pardoned to man all his fault, hath receaued him into his fauour, hath made him one and that same with himselfe through a certaine vnion of loue, but (that which passeth all greatnes) hath made such a likenes and similitude betweene himselfe &amp; mans nature, that amongst all things created, there can be found no greater conformity, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are the Deity and humanity: for they are not one and the same through loue and fauour, but also in person. Who euer durst haue hoped, that a wound so largely gaping, should after this manner haue beene drawne together? Who euer could haue thought, that these two natures, betweene which there was so great difference both of nature and of offence, that euer they could haue beene so neerely ioyned together; not in one house, not at one table, not in one loue, but in one and the selfe same person? What two greater contraries may be giuen, then God and a sinner? And what two things are now more straightly and narrowly combined together, what more commixt, then God and man? There is nothing higher or nobler then God (saith Bernard) and there is nothing lower or baser then that clay, of which man is formed.</p>
                        <p>Neuerthelesse, with so great humility GOD descended vpon the earth to man, and with so great sublimitie earth ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to God, that whatsoeuer God hath done, earth may be said to haue done it, and whatsoeuer earth hath suffered, God may
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:9369:28"/>
be sayd to haue suffered it. Who would haue said to man, when he was naked, &amp; knew that he had incurred the wrath of God, when he sought lurking holes and corners in Paradice, wherein he might hide himselfe; vvho (I say) would haue then said, that the tyme should come, when this vild substance should be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, in one and the selfe same person? Thys vnion is so neere, straight, and faithfull, that when it was to be dissolued, (which was in the tyme of the Passion) it would rather rent and breake, then faint and forsake. Death might seperate the soule from the body, which was the vnion of nature; but it could not pluck GOD from the soule, nor fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body: for that vvas the vnion of the Diuine person. For what it once apprehendeth with so strong a loue, it neuer forsaketh. This is that peace, this is that health and saluation which wee receaue by the benefit of our Mediatour and Sauiour.</p>
                        <p>Although we are such and so great debtors for thys benefit, that no mans tongue can vtter it,<note place="margin">Wee are bound to God, not onely for our Rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but for the manner of it.</note> yet we are not lesse bound to God for the manner of our Redemption, then for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it selfe.

For the loue of me thou didst fast, thou didst watch, thou didst run hether &amp; thether, thou didst sweat, thou didst weepe, and thou didst proue by experience, those miseries which my sinnes deserued; and yet thou wast without any sinne, neyther was there guile found in thy mouth: neyther hadst thou offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but wast offended. To be briefe, for me thou wast taken, forsaken of thine, denied, sold, presented now before this Iudge, now before that, falsely accused before them, beaten with fists, spette vpon, mocked, whypped, crowned with thornes, reuiled with blasphemies, hanged vpon the Crosse, dead, and buried. At the length thou didst free me from all euill, dying vpon the Crosse, and ending thy life, thy mother looking on: at which time thou wast found in so great neede and misery, that in that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:9369:29"/>
thine intollerable thirst, a small drop of water was denied vnto thee, by which thou mightest refresh and coole the heate of thy mouth. Not onely thou wast forsaken of all externall things, but also of thine owne Father. What is worthy of greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, then that the God of so great a maiestie, should end his lyfe vpon the cursed tree of the Crosse, with the title of a malefactour? When any man, yea of meane estate, commeth to that misfortune, that he is to be punished with like death for his offence and fault, and thou by chaunce dost know him, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his countenaunce, thou canst not sufficiently wonder, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering into what an vnhappy estate his misery hath cast hym, that hee must vnder-goe a death so cruell and ignominous. Wherefore, if it be an admirable thing, to see a common man of inferiour degree to be compassed with so miserable calamitie; what will it be to see not a man, but the Lord of all creatures to be so plunged? Can a thing be seene with greater admiration, then God himselfe to be brought into so great misery for the offences of one malefactour? And if by how much the person is more worthy, and more noble, who is slaine, by so much hys case is more admirable and more miserable;<note place="margin">The Angels were asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished at the passion of our Lord</note> O yee Angels, to whom the height and excellencie of this Lord is so perfectlie knowne &amp; vnderstood, tel me, what was your griefe and discru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatement?

Nature herselfe stoode astonished, and all the creatures were suspended from theyr functions; the principalities and powers of heauen were amazed, considering this inestimable goodnesse, which they knew to be in GOD.

O Lord, if I bee so greatly indebted to thee, because thou hast redeemed me, what doe I not owe thee for that manner, by which thou hast redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med me? Thou hast redeemed mee with most great dolours, with contumelies and ignominies not to be borne; in so much, that thou wast made a reproch of men, and the scorne of the whole vvorld. Through thy reproches thou hast honored me; through thy accusations thou hast defended me; through thy blood thou hast washed me; through thy death thou hast ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me; and through thy teares thou hast freed me, from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting weeping, and gnashing of teeth.</p>
                        <p>O good Father, who so tenderly louest thy chyldren, thou art that good and true Sheepheard, which giuest thy selfe foode for thy flocke.

thou thinke that it is a thing to be borne, to be ingratefull to a father so good, and to a benefactour so liberall?

For he it is, that by his mercie preuenteth a sinner, &amp; afterwards calleth him; and beeing called, iustifieth him, and beeing iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, directeth him by the paths of righteousnes, and so bringeth him by the gyft of perseuerance to the end of his course and race, vntill at the length he bestoweth vpon him the crowne of glory: for this benefit comprehendeth in it all the other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.

Which cannot by any meanes be brought to passe, without the peculier help &amp; ayde of God: which the Lord testifieth in plaine words, vvhen hee sayth:<note place="margin">Iohn, 6.</note> 
                           <hi>No man can come to mee, except my Father draw him,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying, that no strength of mans nature can deliuer a man from sinne, and bring him vnto grace, vnlesse the arme of the diuine power helpe him.</p>
                        <p>Thomas Aquinas dooth thus comment vpon these words; Euen as a stone (sayth hee) alwaies of his owne nature falleth downevvards,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> neyther can lift it selfe vpwards, without exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall helpe; so man (by reason of the corruption of sinne) dooth alwayes tend downewards; that is, he doth alwaies slide to the loue and desire of earthly things: but if hee be to be lifted vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, that is, to the loue, &amp; to a supernaturall desire of heauenly things, he hath neede of the right hand of the highest, and of the Diuine helpe. Thys sentence is to be noted and obserued, for by this a man doth come to the knowledge of himselfe, and vnderstandeth the corruption of his owne nature, and knoweth how necessary the continuall prayer for the Diuine helpe is.</p>
                        <p>Therefore (that we may returne to our purpose) man by his owne strength cannot be deliuered from sinne, and brought to grace; because necessarily the hande of the Lorde is required, which must deliuer him. But who can declare what other great benefits are contained in this alone? For seeing without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, that by this, sinne is banished and expelled out of the soule, which ingendereth many euils in it; howe great a good will that be, which doth cast and driue out all these euills? But
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:9369:33"/>
seeing that the consideration of this benefit,<note place="margin">Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings it bringeth with it.</note> doth very much stir vp man to gratitude, and to the desire of vertue, heere by the way I will declare the great blessings, which this onely good is wont to bring with it.</p>
                        <p>First, by it man is reconciled to God, and is brought and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his fauour and friendship. For the first and chiefest of all euils,<note place="margin">1. It reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth man to GOD.</note> which sinne bringeth to the soule, is, that it maketh man an enemie to God: who seeing that he is infinite goodnes, aboue all things he hateth and curseth sinne.<note place="margin">Psalme, 5.</note> Therefore (sayth the Prophet) <hi>Thou hatest all them that worke iniquitie, thou shalt destroy them that speake lyes.</hi> He addeth furthermore, that God abhorreth and detesteth the bloody man and deceitfull. Thys is the greatest of all euils, and the roote and fountaine of all the rest; as on the contrary side, to be loued of God, is the greatest of all blessings, and the cause and originall of them. From thys so dangerous an euill, by this benefit of Iustification we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered: by which wee are reconciled to God,<note place="margin">It maketh vs the sons of God.</note> and of enemies, made friends vnto him; and that not in a common degree of friendship, but in the highest, which may be found of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards the sonne. The Euangelist Iohn, worthily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth this fauour and friendship,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3.</note> when he saith, <hi>Behold what loue the Father hath shewed vnto vs, that we should be called and be indeede the sonnes of GOD.</hi> He is not content to say, that vvee should be called, but he addeth that we are: that the base estate and small confidence of man, might euidently know the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnes and liberalitie of God: and that we might see, that it is not a name of honour or title, but rather of the deed and thing it selfe. But if it be so great an euill to be hated and reprobated of God, what great good will it be to be beloued of him, and to remaine in his fauour? This truly is an Axiome of the Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, that a thing is so much the better, by howe much his contrary is worser. And therefore it necessarily followeth, that that is the chiefest good, whose opposite is the chiefest euill, as we haue said that that is, to be hated of GOD. But if in this world it be esteemed a matter of great moment, if any man bee had in honour &amp; estimation amongst his Superiors, as with the Emperour, King, or Prince, or such great &amp; honorable estates, I pray thee what will it be, to haue found fauour and grace with
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:9369:34"/>
the highest Prince, the supreame Father, &amp; with the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, excellent and noble Lord; in comparison of whom al the principalities and dignities of this worlde, are as though they were not? Which fauour also is so much the greater, by hovve much more it is freely gy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uen: for it is certaine, that as it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for a man to be able to doe any thing before hee vvas created, whereby he might deserue to be created; (for then hee was not any thing) so also without all doubt is it, that he can do nothing, after that he is fallen into sinne, whereby hee may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue Iustification; not because he is not, but because he is euill, and hated of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">2 By iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion man is freed from eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</note>Another benefit followeth this going before, that it deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and freeth a man from the condemnation of euerlasting punishment: of which hee was guiltie by reason of his sinnes. for sinne doth make a man abhominable vnto God, &amp; no man can liue without Gods fauour, without his owne extreame harme. Hence is it that the sinners forsaking God, because they sinne and contemne him, that they deserue to be contemned, &amp; to be remoued out of the sight of God, beeing banished from his company, and from his beautifull dwellings: and because they forsaking God doe loue the creatures with an inordinate loue, it is meete that they should be punished in all things, and be tormented with eternall payne, to which, visible punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being compared, they rather seeme paynted then true. To this so great vnhappines that euerlasting worme doth also come, which alwayes gnaweth the bowels and conscience of the wicked. But what shall I say of the society of those cursed spirits, and of all the damned? What shall I speake of that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and lamentable Region full of darknes, and confusion? Where there is no order, but where continuall horror abideth: where no ioy is found, no peace, no rest, no content, no hope; but perpetuall complayning, and euerlasting gnashing of teeth, exceeding outragiousnes and fury, continuall blasphemy, and eternall malediction? From all these euils the Lord hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered all them, whom he hath iustified, who after that they are reconciled to him, and receaued into his fauour, they are free from this wrath, and from the punishment of his vengeance.</p>
                        <p>Behold an other benefit more spirituall, which is the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:9369:34"/>
and renouation of the inward man,<note place="margin">3. Iustification doth renue a man.</note> which was defiled and polluted through sinne. For sinne doth not onely depriue the soule of God, but also doth spoile and rob it of all superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall strength and fortitude, and of all other riches and gifts of the holy Ghost, with which it was adorned, beautified, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched: by and by after that it is depriued of these graces, it is wounded, maymed, and depriued also of the naturall blessings. For seeing that man is a reasonable creature and sinne is a work done against reason, and seeing that it is naturall, that one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary should destroy an other; the consequent is, that by how much more sinnes are multiplied, by so much more the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the soule are destroyed and disturbed; not in themselues, but in their aptnes to worke.</p>
                        <p>By these meanes sinnes doe make the soule miserable,<note place="margin">What mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe sins work to the soule.</note> weake, sluggish, and instable to euery good worke: but procline, prompt and ready to all euill, weake and feeble to resist tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and flow to walke in the wayes of Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They depriue her also of the true liberty and rule of the spirit: and they make her the captaine of the deuill, the world, the flesh, and of her owne appetites. And by this meanes shee liueth in captiuity more hard and intollerable then that of Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon and Aegipt. Furthermore, all the spirituall powers of the soule are made also sluggish and slothfull, so that they doe not heare diuine inspirations and heauenly voyces; they doe not see the great euils prepared for them: they doe not smell the sweete fauour of Vertue, nor the most beautifull paths and examples of the Saints: they doe not tast how sweet the Lord is, neyther doe they feele the scourgings, nor acknowledge the benefits, by which they are prouoked vnto his loue; and besides all these, they take away the peace and ioy of the conscience, they doe extinguish the heate and seruour of the spirit, and doe leaue a man filthy blemished, deformed, and abhominable in the sight of God, and in the sight of all his Saints. From all these euils this benefit doth deliuer vs. For so bottomlesse are the mercies of God, that he is not content to haue pardoned our faults, and to haue receaued man into fauour, vnlesse also hee expell all these euils, which sinnes bring with them; reforming and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing our inward man. By this maner he healeth our wounds,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:9369:35"/>
he washeth away our spots &amp; blemishes, he breaketh the bonds of sinne, destroyeth the yoake of euill concupiscences, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs from the seruitude of the deuill, mitigateth and aswageth the fury and rage of our peruerse affections and perturbations; and doth restore vnto vs the true liberty &amp; beauty of our soule: doth giue vs the peace and ioy of a good conscience, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue our inward sences, doth make them prompt and fit to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good worke, and slow to any euill. Maketh them strong and valiannto resist the temptations of the deuill, and doth inrich vs with all good works. To be briefe, he doth so absolutely renue and repaire our inward man with all his powers, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle calleth such men, iustified, renued, yea new creatures. This renuing is so great, that when it is made by Baptisme, it is called regeneration, but when by repentance, it is called a resurrection and rising againe: not onely because the soule is raysed from the death of sinne to the life of grace, but because after a certaine manner it also imitateth the beauty of the future resurrection. This is so true,<note place="margin">The beauty of a iustified soule.</note> that no tongue of man is sufficient to expresse the beauty of a iustified soule. This onely knoweth that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that maketh it beautifull and his Temple, and placeth his seate and mansion in it. Wherefore if thou comparest all the riches and honours of this world, and all naturall graces, with the beauty and riches of a iustified soule, all will seeme most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and most vild in comparison of it. For as great difference as there is betweene heauen and earth, betweene a spirit and a body, betweene eternity and momentary time, so great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence also is there found betweene the life of grace, and the life of nature; betweene the beauty of the soule and the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the inward riches and the outward; betweene the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall strength and the naturall. For all these are circumscribed within certaine limits, they are temporall, and appeare onelie beautifull to the corporall eyes, to which a generall comming of God is sufficient; but to the other a speciall, perticuler, and supernaturall comming is required. Neither can they be called temporall, when they bring vs to eternity, neyther can they be called altogether finite, because they bring the infinite God to vs, in whose eyes they are so precious and of such valour, that by theyr beauty they prouoke God to loue vs. Furthermore,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9369:35"/>
when as God could haue wrought all these things by his helpe and will, he would not doe it; but it pleased him to adorne the soule with infused vertues, and with the gifts of his holy Spirit, with which not onely the very Essence of the soule, but also all her powers are clothed, and adorned with these diuine habites.</p>
                        <p>To all these diuine benefits the eternall and infinite goodnes of God doth ioyne another,<note place="margin">4. By iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion God dwelleth in vs.</note> that is the presence and ayde of the holy Ghost, and so of all the most sacred Trinity, which doth turne into a iustified soule, and doth come, that he may dwell in her, that he may teach her how to vse rightly so great riches,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> as a good father, who not content to haue giuen riches to his sonne, but doth giue him also a Tutor, who well knoweth how to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose &amp; bestow them.

                           <hi>If any man loueth me, he will keepe my sayings, &amp; my Father will loue him, and we will come vnto him, and will dwell with him.</hi> By the vertue of these words, all the Doctors as wel Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall as Schoolemen, confesse, that the holy Ghost himselfe by a certaine speciall &amp; peculier meanes doth dwel in a iustified soule, distinguishing betweene the holy Ghost &amp; his gifts: say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moreouer, not only these gifts to be giuen of the holy ghost, but also the holy Ghost to giue himselfe, who entring into this soule, doth make it his Temple &amp; habitation; placing his seate in it. Therfore he doth purge and sanctifie it, &amp; doth adorne it with his gifts, that it may be an In worthy of such a guest.</p>
                        <p>These benefits afore-sayd doe not suffice,<note place="margin">5.

of them, then of himselfe; he is no lesse carefull for them, then for his owne members, without intermission hee poureth his vertue and grace vpon them, as the head vpon his members; to be briefe, the eternall Father doth behold them with fauourable eyes, no otherwise then the liuely members of his onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Sonne, vnited, and incorporated with him, by the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his spirit.<note place="margin">Confidence in prayer.</note> Of the same dignity it proceedeth, that when those that are iustified, doe aske for fauour and grace of God, they aske it with great confidence: for they know that they doe aske it, not onely for themselues, but also for the sonne of God himselfe, who is honoured in them and with them. For seeing that it may not be denied, but that which the members doe, the head also doth the same, it followeth, that seeing Christ is their head, when they aske any thing for themselues, they aske it also for him. For if it be true, that they (as sayth the Apostle) who offend against the members of Christ,<note place="margin">Christ is honoured, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man is honored.

Which seeing that it is so, how great confidence will a righteous man haue in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when he considereth, that desiring fauour and grace for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, after a certaine manner he also desireth the same of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Father for his best beloued sonne? Is it not true, that when fauour is done to any man for the loue of an other, that it is done principally for him, for whose loue it is done? For wee beleeue that he that showeth mercy to a poore man for Gods sake that he not onely doth shew it to the poore man, but also to God himselfe.</p>

For as that our infinite and vnmeasurable Lord, in whom together shineth all iustice and mercy, adiudgeth to euerlasting payne those that doe not repent, so hee taketh to eternall life all those that truly repent.

of all his sinnes, and receaued him into his friendship and fauor with communion and participation of his glory, yet he would not doe it; but those, to whom for his mercies sake he remitteth sinnes, he also iustifieth; whom he iustifieth, those he maketh his sonnes, whom he maketh his sonnes, those also he maketh heires, and pertakers of his celestiall inheritance together, with his onely begotten sonne. Hence ariseth that liuely hope, which maketh the iustified merry and glad in all tribulation: by reason of the pledge and earnest of this infinite treasure. For although they see themselues brought into straights, to be afflicted with infirmities, to be oppressed with the miseries of this life: yet they know,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                           <hi>that the afflictions of this present time are not worthy of the glory, which shall be shewed vnto them.</hi> And also they know, <hi>that this light affliction,</hi>

                           <p>THose things which hetherto we haue spoken of, doe not as yet comprehend all those kinds of benefits, which the holy Ghost worketh in the soule of a iustified man, neyther is the bountifulnes of GOD circumscribed within those limits. For it is not enough that the holy Ghost should haue brought man through the gate of Righteousnesse, and entred him into the schoole of Vertue, but after that he is entred, that he should be ayded of the same Spirit,<note place="margin">Graces wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon the holie Ghost.</note> and ledde as it were with the hand in all his wayes, vntill all the waues of this stormy sea being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, he enter safe and sound into the hauen of saluation. For after that the holy Ghost hath entred into a iustified soule, by the meditation of the precedent benefit, he doth not sitte there idlely: for it suffiseth him not to beautifie the soule with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, but also he sanctifieth it by his vertue, working in it, and with it,<note place="margin">After what manner the holy Ghost sitteth in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> soule of a righteous man, and what hee doth there.</note> whatsoeuer is necessary vnto saluation. He sitteth there, as an housholder in his house, gouerning it; he sitteth there, as a schoolemaister in his schoole, teaching it; as a Gardiner in his garden, tilling and trymming it: as a King in his kingdom, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it; as the Sunne in the world, enlightning it: to be briefe, as the soule in the body, giuing to it life, sence, and motion: not as the forme in the matter, but as an housholder in an house. What then is more happy, what more to bee desired, then to haue within him such a guest, such a guide, such a companion, such a gouernour and tutor, and such an helper? Who seeing that he is all things, doth worke all things in that soule, in which he remaineth and dwelleth. Especially as fire, hee enlightneth our vnderstanding,<note place="margin">The holy Ghost is fire. A Doue.

doth asswage and moderate our madnes, and the furie of our passions.<note place="margin">A wind.</note> To conclude, he as a vehement and strong wind, doth moue and incline our will to all good, seperating it, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from all euill inclinations, vntill at length the iustified bee brought to that passe, that all vices are odious vnto them, which before they loued; and they loue all vertues, which before they hated: as Dauid plainly acknowledgeth that it hapned to him, for he sayth in a certaine place,<note place="margin">Psalm, 118, Psalm, 119,</note> 
                              <hi>That hee did hate and abhorre ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</hi> And in another place, <hi>That hee had as great delight in the way of the testimonies of the Lord, as in all riches.</hi> The reason was, because the holy Ghost had instilled and infused into his soule, the vvormewood of earthly things, and the honny of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly commaundements: vvherein thou seest plainly, that wee owe all our good to this diuine Spirit: insomuch, that if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from euill, he is the cause of it, and if we doe good, we doe it through him; if wee perseuere in goodnesse, wee perseuere through him, and if a reward be gyuen for our good, it is giuen through him.<note place="margin">Augustine vpon the 144. psalme.</note> Therefore it is euident, that it is most truly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Augustine, that when as God recompenceth our serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he rewardeth his owne benefits in vs; and so hee rendereth grace for grace, seeing the deserts are of grace.</p>
                           <p>The holy Patriarch Ioseph,<note place="margin">Gene, 42</note> was not content to giue to hys brethren corne, which they came to buy in Egipt, but he more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer commaunded, that the money which they brought to buy the corne, should be put in theyr sacke mouthes. After the same manner the Lord dealeth with his; for he giueth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> life euerlasting, and he also gyueth them grace and a lawdable lyfe, by which they may come to this eternall life. Here-vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth that,<note place="margin">In his 8. ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie of the Passeouer.</note> which Eusebius Emissenus sayth, hee therefore is worshipped that he may haue mercy, and hee hath had already mercy, that he might be worshipped. Therefore let a man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently examine his life, &amp; let him consider, (as the same Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour admonisheth him) what great good hee hath doone, from howe many euills, adulteries rapines, thefts, fraudes, and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the Lord hath deliuered him; and then he shal know, by how many meanes he is bound vnto him.<note place="margin">To a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</note> For as Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine sayth, all sinnes are to be accounted as forgiuen, from the which God doth keepe thee, least they be committed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:9369:38"/>
sayth hee, doe not loue him a little, as from whom a little was forgiuen, but rather loue him much, from whom much is gyuen vnto thee. For if hee loue, to whom it is giuen that hee may not repay, how much more ought he to loue, to whom it is gyuen that he may haue and possesse. For whosoeuer from the beginning remaineth honest, hee is gouerned of him; and whosoeuer of one dishonest is made honest, of him he is amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and whosoeuer is dishonest to the end, of him he is forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Which seeing that it is so, what other thing shall we doe, then cry out with the Prophet,<note place="margin">Psalme, 71,</note> 
                              <hi>Let my mouth bee filled with thy praise, that I may sing of thy glory, and of thy greatnesse euery day.</hi> Vpon which wordes,<note place="margin">Augustine vpon the 71. psalme.</note> Saint Augustine dooth thus comment.

So fully let my mouth be filled with thy praise, that I may sing of thy glory euery day, and all the day long.</p>
                           <p>If the sonne of God himselfe dyd gyue thankes to hys Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a fewe Barley loafes,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6,</note> as it is in the Gospell, what great thanks ought we to giue, for thys great benefit, that wee are so sanctified by his holy Spirit, that we are made his Temple, and the dwelling and seate of the most sacred Trinitie? If wee are bound to giue thanks for our nourishment, whereby our Being is vpholden, how great thanks are wee bound to giue him, for this our well Being. For we doe not prayse a horse, because he is a horse, but because he is a good horse: nor wine, because it is wine, but because it is good wine: nor a man, because hee is a man, but because he is a good man.</p>
                           <p>If therefore so many wayes we be bound to him, who hath created vs, how much more are wee bounde to him that hath made vs good? If wee owe so much vnto him for the gyfts of our bodies, how much more doe wee owe for the gyfts of our mindes? if so much for the gyfts of nature, how much more for the gyfts of grace? To conclude, if so great things be due vnto him, because he hath made vs the sonnes of Adam, how much

more, that he hath made vs, of the vnhappy sonnes of Adam, the sonnes of God?

                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore woorthily thys benefit may be called a benefit of benefits, and a grace of graces.

Christ: and that as he hath begunne, so hee shall make an end. Surely it is true, that no man ought to be carelesse of his estate, and that no man ought to be secure of his perseuerance, seeing that the most wise Salomon, after that he had liued many yeres godly and religiously, in the end of his life failed, and playd the back-slider, and fell very filthily. But thys is but a particuler ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from that generall vse and custome, which we brought out of Paule, and which Salomon himselfe teacheth in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs, saying;<note place="margin">Prouerbs. 22.</note> 
                           <hi>It is a prouerbe, teach a child in the trade of his way, and when he is old, he shall not depart from it.</hi> So that if hee be a dilligent follower of vertue in his youth, he will be so in his old age. Of these and such like coniectures, which are found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Doctours of the Church, hee that is such an one may with humility assure himselfe of the infinite goodnes of God, that he is one of the number of the Elect. For as he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth in the infinite goodnes of God to be saued, so hee may humbly presume, that he is one of their number, who are to be saued, seeing that the one doth presuppose the other.</p>
                        <p>Which seeing that it is so, I pray thee consider with thy selfe ô man, with how great a pledge the Lord doth hold thee bound vnto him, for this vnmeasurable benefit, that is, that thou art written in that booke, of the which our Redeemer sayth to his Apostles,<note place="margin">Luke, 10.</note> 
                           <hi>In this reioyce not, that the spirits are subdued vnto you; but rather reioyce, because your names are written in the booke of life.</hi> How vnmeasurable therefore is this benefit to be loued and to be elected from that eternity, from which God was God? To rest in his most sweet breast, euen from the beginning of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity? To be accounted for the adopted sonne of God then, when his naturall sonne was begotten, in the glory and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of all the Saints, who were present in his diuine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing?</p>
                        <p>Consider therefore dilligently all the circumstances of this election,<note place="margin">The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances in election are to be considered.</note> and thou shalt see euery one of them, to be singuler very great benefits: and also to bring new bonds and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with them. Consider first the dignity of him who hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected thee, who himselfe is God, happy, and infinitely rich,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> who neyther needeth thine, nor any mans riches else. Consider <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> how vnworthy he is, who is elected, if thou considerest his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:9369:40"/>
and quality: for he is a miserable and mortall creature, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to all the infirmities, miseries, and pouerty of this life; guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of hell fire, both for an other mans, and also for his owne
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> sinne. Thirdly, marke how excellent the election it selfe is, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that thou art elected to an end so high, then the which a greater cannot be: that is, that thou mayest be made a sonne of God, an heire of his kingdome, and a pertaker of his glory.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Consider fourthly, how free this election is, when it is (as wee haue sayd) before any merrit of thine, of the onely lyking and ordinance of the diuine will, and (as the Apostle sayth) for the glory, and praise of the bounty and fauour of God. But a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit the freer it is, the more it doth hold a man bound. Fiftly, the antiquity of this election is to be looked vnto; for it did not begin when the world was made, but it is much more auncient then the world it selfe: yea, it is of the same age with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; who as he is from euerlasting, so he loueth his elect from euerlasting, and loueth them still, and will loue them for euer, whom he beholdeth with his fatherly eyes, and those truly fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, being alwayes mindfull to what an excellent good he hath
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ordayned and predestinated them. Sixtly, the rarenes of this benefit is to be considered; after that among so many nations of barbarous men, &amp; in such a multitude of the damned, the Lord would call thee to so happy an estate, that thou shouldest be in the number of them, which are elected to eternall life. And therefore he seperated thee from the masse of the corruption of mankind, condemned for sinne, &amp; out of the leauen of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath changed thee into Angels food. In this consideration few things are found, that may be written; but many things that may be considered of in the minde, that thou mayest be thankfull to the Lord for the perticularity of this benefit, which is so much the more, by how much the number of the elect is lesser, and the number of those greater, that are to be damned; which number (as Salomon sayth) is infinite.</p>
                        <p>But if none of these things doe moue thee, at the least let the greatnes of the costs and charges moue thee, which the most bountifull Lord determined to make by reason of this benefit, as are the life of his onely begotten sonne, and his blood shed in the cause of this benefit, as who had determined from euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,

to send him into this world, that he might be the executor of this determination. Which seeing that it is so, can there be any time long enough, and sufficient to consider of so great mercy of God? What tongue can euer vtter it sufficiently? What hart can perfectly feele and tast it? To be briefe, by what duties can he recompence it? And with what loue can man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vnto this diuine loue? Who will be so ingratefull, that will refuse now at the length to loue him, of whom hee hath beene beloued from all eternity? Who will change him for any other friend? For seeing that in the holy Scriptures an aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent friend is so highly praysed, and had in great estimation, who would change the possession and fauour of this most auncient friend with all the friends of the world? And if the possession of a thing time out of minde, doth giue authority and right to him, that in deede hath no right vnto it; what shall this eternall possession doe, by which the Lord doth possesse vs, that by the title of this friendship we may be reputed his? By these it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that no good may be found in the world, which is to be changed with this good, neyther that there are any such great euils, which are not to be borne for the loue of this good.</p>

Would not giue place vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? And bending his knees, with great humility would not wish well vnto him, and gratulate him with these words; ô thou happy and blessed man, art thou one of the blessed number of the elect?

Shalt thou pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse that euerlasting and eternall kingdome? Shalt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template and view that bright and glorious shining face of Christ? O happy is that day, in which thou wast borne, but much more happy is that day, in which thou shalt dye to the world: for then thou shalt begin to liue an eternall and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall life.

                        <p>These and such like are the words, with which wee would moue and perswade any man, whom we knew certainly to be predestinated.<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> For if any Prince, who is to be the heire of a great kingdome, doth passe by any way, all the inhabitants, their houses being left, flock to that place, that they may see him, and they admire that blessed (according to the opinion of the world) estate, which doth tarry for that young man, because he is borne to be the heire of a kingdome; how much more then ought men to admire and wonder at this most blessed estate? That is, that man is borne and elected without any merrit of his, not that he may be a temporall King in this world, but that he may raigne in heauen with God himselfe, and with his blessed Saints for euer and euer world without end? Therfore by these things, my brother, thou mayest easily know of that great bond, by which all the Elect for this benefit are bound to their Lord and Electour. From the which benefit let no man thinke himselfe excluded, so that he will doe his duty, and will not be wanting vnto himselfe: yea, let him giue all dilligence that by good works (as Saint Peter admonisheth) hee may make his calling and election sure:<note place="margin">2, Pet. 1.</note> for we assuredly know, that he that doth this, shall be saued: we also know that the fauour and grace of God doth neuer faile and diaspoynt any man, neyther will at anie time leaue or forsake him. Therefore let vs perseuere in good works in the vndoubted certainty of these two truths, and let vs hope that wee are of that happy and blessed number of the Elect.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very one of the fore-sayde titles ought worthily and of right to mooue a man to serue the Lord his God, to whom hee is bound by so many names and reasons. But because the greater part of men is more moued by reward and hire, then by the debt to iustice, that is (as others speake) rather by profit then honesty; we haue thought it a thing worth the labour, if to these afore-sayd we adde the great profits and commodities, which are promised to Vertue, as well in this life, as in the lyfe to come. Heere at the first we will speake of two especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rest, of the Glory, which we obtaine by Vertue, and of the Punishment, which we auoide by it. These are the two oares, by the benefit of which we row and saile out of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this troublesome &amp; stormy Sea: these are the two spurs, by which we are pricked forward to runne with celeritie to the way of this life. Hence it is, that certaine holy men, inspired with the holy Spirit, haue wished that Preachers would preach altogether, or for the most part, of vertues and vices, of glorie, and punishment; of vertues and vices, that they may teach how to liue well: of glory and punishment, that they may moue and perswade to liue well. It is also the opinion of Phylosophers, &amp; the common iudgement of all men, that reward &amp; punishment are the two counterpoises, by which the Horologe of mans life is mooued. For so great is the misery of our will, that no man desireth vertue being naked, bare and plaine, to the which pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is not adioyned, or which is not recompenced vvith some profit. And because no punishment, nor reward can bee thought of greater then that eternall glory, &amp; euerlasting paine, wee haue purposed at this present to speake of them, before which wee will sette other two, because they are first in order, that is, Death, and the Generall Iudgement.

I will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to relate the history of that solitary &amp; monastical man, who dwelled in Choreb.<note place="margin">A terrible &amp; feareful historie.</note> When as of a long time he had lyued ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie dissolutely and loosely, and had not had at all any care of his soule, at the length he was taken with a disease, and brought to his last home. And now when as an extasie had seased vpon his body, after an houre he came to himselfe againe, and desired all vs, that forth-with we should depart from him, &amp; the entrance of his Cell beeing stopped with stones, hee remained vvithin twelue yeeres; not at all speaking any thing to any man, neither tasting any other thing besides bread and water. There sitting and beeing amazed, hee onely ruminated and reuolued those things, which he had seene in that seperation of his soule from his body, and in these things he was alwayes of so fixed &amp; sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast a meditation, that he neuer changed his countenaunce, but alwaies continuing thus amazed &amp; astonished, silently he pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth aboundance of seruent teares.</p>
                        <p>When he was nowe at deaths doore, and death beganne to seaze on him, the entrance of his Cell beeing broke open, vve

entred in. And when as we earnestly desired some instruction and doctrine of him, vve onely heard thys of him; Pardon me. No man can abide himselfe should be drawn to sinne, if hee in deed doth soundly carry in his mind the remembrance of death. We meruailously wondered at him, beholding him, that before was so negligent and loose, to be so suddainly changed, and to be made another man by this most blessed change. Hetherto Climacus, who was present at all these things, and what he saw, he testifieth in his writings. So that no man ought to doubt of thys deede (although it seeme to some incredible) especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the witnes is true and faythfull.</p>
                        <p>In thys story there are many things which wee woorthily ought to feare; considering the life which thys holy man ledde, and much more the vision which hee sawe, whence came that manner of lyuing, which afterwards he obserued thorow out al his life.

Remember therfore (my brother) that thou art a Christian, and a man; because thou art a man, it is certaine that thou must die; because thou art a Christian, it is certaine that thou must giue an account of thy lyfe, after that thou art dead.

But most of all we must consider, how vncertaine that houre is; for that is wont to come (for the most part) when it is least looked for, and when as man is secure in all things, &amp; doth least thinke of it: but beeing busied and earnest about the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and necessities of this life, doth cast with himselfe to lyue and ouer-passe many dayes. For which cause it is sayde, that it commeth like a theese in the night, who is wont then to come, when as men doe soundly sleepe, and beeing secure, doe thinke of nothing lesse then of the theft so neerly hanging ouer them.</p>
                        <p>Before death come, great and grieuous infirmities goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which are to be considered with all their accidents, griefes, vexations, molestations, loathings, decocted syrrups, fumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pills, gargarismes, and other medicines; and also of the long nights, which at thys time bring much teadiousnesse and wearinesse.<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> For euen as he that would conquer a Castle, at the first doth make way to the ruine with his greater shot; after he doth assault, inuade and possesse it; so before death, great infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie is sent, which doth so vanquish and breake the naturall strength, that it giueth no rest to man, whether it be by day or by night: but without intermission, shaketh and wringeth all the chiefe members of the body; so that the soule can no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger defend her Castle, neither can any longer be preserued in it: wherefore the relinquisheth the body, &amp; hauing escaped, flyeth out of it, and goeth to another place.</p>

After these things, those last accidents grow on, which are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with death it selfe: which are much greater then these go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before. The forehead waxeth hard, the skinne is stretched out, from whence cold sweat breaketh foorth: the eyes vvaxe dimme, sayle, and are writhen about with intollerable payne;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9369:43"/>
the eares grow deafe, the nose doth sincke downe, the nosthrils are filled with filth, the countenaunce waxeth pale, the mouth is disturbed, the tongue is vnmoueable, and ceaseth to doe his dutie any more; the tast perrisheth, the lipps waxe blewe and wanne: the breath gathering it selfe from the bottome of the breast faileth: the hands waxe cold, the nayles waxe black, the pulse languisheth and is very little, but very thicke, sometime it ceaseth, and sometimes striketh softly; the feete die, and loose theyr naturall heate.</p>
                        <p>What neede I many wordes? all the flesh is turned to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and all the members, and all the sences, are disturbed &amp; troubled by reason of theyr too hastie seperation. After thys maner a man must at his departure out of thys life, recompence the labors and sorrowes of those, by whom he entred into thys world: bearing those griefes at his end, which his mother bare, when shee brought him forth. And so the proportion of mans departure and entrance into this world is notable: for both is full of sorrowes, his ingresse hath the sorrowes of another, his egresse his owne.</p>
                        <p>Whilst man is tost in this straight, sodainly the agony of death is at hand: the ende of life is presented to the memorie, the horrour also of the graue, and the infelicity of his body, which straightwayes is to be meate for wormes: but especially the soule is plunged, which as yet remayneth in the body, but after an houre or two being seperated from the body, it know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what entertainement or dwelling place it shall haue. Then thou wilt thinke that the iudgement of God is present at hand: then thou shalt see before thee all thy sinnes, which will accuse thee before the iudgement seate of the Diuine iustice: then thou at the length too late wilt acknowledge how filthie the crimes were, which thou so easily didst commit: then with many cursings and execrations thou wilt banne that day, in which thou didst offend; thou wilt bitterly curse the pleasures and delights, which moued thee with their enticements to sinne. In that houre thou canst not sufficiently wonder at thy selfe, and thy lenity, who for things so vaine, and of no moment (as those were, which thou wast wont to loue with so inordinate loue) hast cast thy selfe in danger to suffer so intollerable paines;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9369:44"/>
of the which in that most sorrowfull houre thou shalt make no small experiment. For the pleasures passing away, &amp; the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them approching, that which before of it selfe was but little, and now ceaseth to be, shall seeme to be nothing: but that which is great of it selfe, and present at hand, thou shalt suppose that it is greater then it is; because at the length thou shalt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly know it with all the circumstances.<note place="margin">The danger in which he that dyeth is.</note> When as therefore thou shalt see that for matters so vaine and light, I will not say filthy, thou hast depriued thy selfe of so great blessings, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting thy eyes heere and there, thou shalt see thy selfe on euery side compassed about with griefes and tribulations, (because longer thou canst not liue; and for repentance there is neyther place nor time; the number of thy dayes are come to an end: they cannot helpe thee, whom thou hast loued with so an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate loue: much lesse the Idols, which thou adoredst: what doe I say that they cannot helpe thee?

Whether wilt thou goe? What wilt thou doe? Whom wilt thou call vnto?

If they call to minde their life past, euery part of that doth reprehend them: if they behold the present time, they see that now they are dying: if the future time, which is now at hand, they see the Iudge sitting vpon his tribunall, and expect iudgement from him.

For all these afore-sayde with most bitter torments, shall rend and cut in peeces thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable conscience, and they shall be sharpe speares to wound their louers. It is naturall, that as the possession and presence of a thing, which we loue, doth ioy vs and make vs merry, so the absence of the same thing doth bring heauines and sorrowe. Hence it is that the sonnes doe flie the presence of their dying father, and the louing and religious wife being full of anguish, doth hide her selfe from her husbands face, least by her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence she might encrease his dolours. For although the soule, being by and by to be seperated from the body, hath a long and dangerous iourney to goe, yet the great greefe doth not permit any obseruation of the termes of humanity and ciuility, neyther doth it graunt the soule euen now iourneying before her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to bid farewell to her friends.

A certaine man cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Stephanus,</hi> sayth hee, dwelling in this place loued a solitarie and a quiet life. This man when he had liued many yeeres so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarily, being adorned with many singuler vertues of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and sanctification, built himselfe a Cell at the bottome of that hill, in which in times past Elias beheld his holy and diuine vision. He so venerable for life and conuersation, that he might furnish himselfe with more integrity and purity of liuing, hee came to a place of Anchorites, which place was called Fayth. In which place when hee had passed ouer many yeeres with a most straight kind of life: for this place was vtterly remote from all humane consolation, and almost not come to of any man (for it was almost seauenty miles distant from any dwelling of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:9369:46"/>
man) in the very last part of his life he departed thence, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to dwell in the Cell of that holy Hill.</p>
                        <p>There were two Disciples of Palestina, very religious, who also diligently obserued the Cell of this old man. In which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had continued a fewe dayes, he fell into sicknes, whereof he dyed. But a day before his departure, suddainly hee fell into an agonie and astonishment of minde, and with open eyes he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked about, first to the right side, then to the left side of the bed, and as though certaine required an account of him, all they that stoode about him, heard him say some-times thus: So in truth it is: but for this I haue humbled my selfe, and broken of my sinnes by repentance. Some-times hee said: No truly, but yee lie, I haue not doone thus. Then againe thus; So it is indeede, this is so; but I haue wept, and with weeping (as with a gunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot) I haue battered downe that partition wall, which kept Gods countenaunce from me, &amp; God hath heard my prayers and my teares. And againe, yee rightly accuse me. In some also some-times he said, So it is truly, and to these I haue not that I may say, vnlesse God be mercifull vnto me, and God is more mercifull, then man can be sinfull, if man will be sorrowful. And surelie, this inuisible and most sharpe iudgement, was a feareful and a terrible sight, in which also (that which is more terrible) they obiected vnto him, what he had not done, (ah woe is me) he being a man of such sanctitie and holines of life. In many of his sinnes he said, that he had not what he might aunswere; euen this man said so, who had almost forty yeeres ledde a soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie life, and had the grace of those teares, that wash and blot out the hand writing of GOD against vs. Certaine affirmed to me of a truth, that this man, whilst he was in the vvildernes, nourished a Leopard with his owne hand. And vvhilst thys strict account was required of him, and whilst he was in thys sore conflict, he departed thys life. Hetherto are the words of Climacus: which sufficiently declare, how greatly carelesse and negligent men ought to feare the seperation of theyr soule and body; when as the very Saints themselues are found to feare so greatly.</p>
                        <p>But if any one aske, why the Saints placed in this danger, do feare with so great trembling, to this Saint Gregorie aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

in the fourth booke of his Morrals,<note place="margin">Why the Saints doe feare in death. In the 4. booke of his Morrals, chap. 2.</note> in these words: The minde of the Elect, when it remembreth those things vvhich it hath done, is greatly feared with the dread of iudgement. Now it looketh perfectly into it selfe; but as yet it dooth not raise vp it selfe vnto security, because whilst it considereth how great the cumbrance and horrour of the last examination is, it carefullie trembleth betweene hope and feare; because the iust Iudge comming, he knoweth not what of his trespasses hee will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute vnto him, &amp; what he will forgiue. For they are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore secure, if outwardly in outward action they haue not offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but they are carefull for theyr thoughts, by which theyr minde is forced hether &amp; thether.<note place="margin">In the 11. booke of his Morrals, chap. 21. In the 24. booke of his Morrals. chap. 7.</note> For as much as they can do, that they may not offend outwardly, so much they cannot doe, that they may not offend inwardlie in their thought. Therefore often-times, the elect vnwillingly offend in thought, which they marke diligently in themselues, and consider what great gilt it is before the eyes of God. And when as for these things they alwaies feare the strict iudgement of God, yet then especiallie they doe feare, when they comming to pay theyr debt vnto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, do see themselues approching to the strict &amp; exact Iudge. And so much more pearcing is the feare, by howe much more the eternall retribution is neere.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, before the eyes of theyr hart at that time no fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall thing doth flie, because all such matters beeing taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they onely consider themselues and him, to whom they are approching. Feare increaseth by the neere retribution of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and by the neerenes of death so much, by howe much the strict iudgement is neere, &amp; as it were touched. Although they remember that they neuer offended in those things, which they know, yet they feare those things which they knowe not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot vtterly iudge of and discerne themselues; therefore their end growing neere, they are terrified with a greater feare.<note place="margin">Note.</note> Neither is the soule of man then feared without cause, seeing that after a very short time it shall haue that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which neuer can be changed. Hetherto Gregorie.</p>
                        <p>If therefore holy men with so great reason haue feared thys iudgement, what ought not they to doe, who are not such ones? Yea, who haue spent the greatest part of theyr lyfe in following

                        <p>O what a long chayne of miseries, haue thy short pleasures wrought &amp; made for thee. O foolish and sencelesse, what shall the allurements of the flesh now profit you, which you then so much delighted in, sith yee are now cursed to eternall mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and bewayling? vvhat is become of your riches? vvhere are your treasuries? vvhere are your delights? vvhere are your ioyes?

Your glory is perished, and your felicitie is drowned in the Sea of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; you are come to that scarcenes and sterilitie, that a small droppe of water is not graunted vnto you, by which the fierce flaming heate of your throate may be cooled, which so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly doth torment you. Not onely your delights haue not profited you, which you enioyed in this world: but they shall be the causes of greater torments.

                        <p>Then at the length, too late they shall acknowledge the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of the deuill, and being in the midst of errours, they shall begin in vaine to vtter those words of the Wiseman;<note place="margin">Wisdom. 5.</note>

All these and euery one of them, if they be considered,<note place="margin">In the 22. homily to the people of Antioch.</note> are pricks and motiues vnto Vertue. Wherfore also Saint Chrisostome dooth vse this argument also in his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, that he might stirre vp the people to Vertue. That thou maist prepare thy soule, (saith he) as the dwelling and habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, remember that horrible and exceeding feareful day, in which we all standing before the throne of Christ, shall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an account of things done heere: our sinnes shall be layde open before the eyes of all people, &amp; our actions shalbe reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and showne to all those that know them not, where the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Riuer, and the vnsleeping worme are, where all things are naked and open.

                        <p>Thinke therefore, that wee must come before a Iudge that cannot be deceaued: where not onely our actions, but also our words and thoughts shall be iudged; where wee shall receaue dreadfull and terrible paynes for those things that seeme but small vnto vs. Alwaies remember these things, and neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that vnquenchable flame. Haue an eye to him, comming to iudge the quick and the dead.

of hurly burly, and of darknes. But thou wilt say; Howe then may I escape these foresaide euils? I will tell thee: not onely keepe thy body pure and vnspotted, but when thou hast suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red iniurie, do good for it, if thou beest accused, be thou pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. When thou doost fast, be not boasting of it; for fasts are not commended for abstayning from meate, but for abstayning from sinne. Search the Scriptures, &amp; see how first the Prophet seeth a Hasill-wand, and afterwards a burning Cauldron, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating vnto vs, that the fire doth consume those that doe not beare the chastisement and correction of the rodde. So by Moses the pyllar of fire showed,<note place="margin">Exod, 19,</note> that they that obserue the law, receiue the light, but the disobedient receiue fire. Reade the Scriptures of our Sauiour, and learne, howe that when we goe hence thether,<note place="margin">Psalm, 49,</note> no body can helpe vs. The brother shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the brother from endlesse torments, nor the friend hys friend, nor the parents their children, nor the children their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>
                        <p>And what doe I speake of myserable men, when as if Noe, Iob, and Daniel come, they cannot intreate the Iudge? But thou wilt say; Whence may I know this to be true? Looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him that hauing not his wedding garment, was excluded, and none intreating for him. Looke vppon him that had the talent committed vnto him, and dyd not increase it, and how for him no body intreateth. Looke vpon the fiue Virgins, shutte foorth, neyther the other fiue intreateth for them, which also Christ calleth foolish; because, after they had troden pleasures vnder theyr feete, after they had cooled the fornace of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, then they were found fooles, and not without cause, because they obseruing that great dutie of Virginitie, dyd not keepe that small commaundement of Humilitie. Looke vpon the Iudge in the day of iudgement, placing the Sheepe on hys right hand, and the vnprofitable Goates on his left, and saying to those on his right hand: <hi>Come yee blessed of my Father, receaue a kingdome prepared for you.</hi> But those on his left hand to be cast into vtter darknesse, and that no body dooth helpe and succour them being cast out.

knowest how that Abraham himselfe could not ease his paines, although he desired and beseeched him. Therefore heereafter we regarding and respecting our selues, before we are confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and vtterly cast downe, let vs giue the glory to God. It is better here that thy tongue should be dried vp through fasting, then to keepe it moyst, and there to desire that moysture, which being denied, is eternall paine. Heere with small labour wee may auoide great torments.<note place="margin">Certaine excellent compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> And if we be so delicate and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in this life, that we can not suffer patiently a feauer of three dayes, how shall we in the life to come be able to suffer euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting fire? If wee doe feare the sentence of death pronounced of an earthly Iudge, which taketh only from vs life of a few yeres: why doe we not feare the sentence of this Iudge, which depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs vtterly of an eternall life? If we are terrified seeing the execution of some horrible punishment, which in this world is inflicted vpon some malefactour, when wee see the Sargiants with the Hang-man to draw the malefactour to punishment, to beate him, to hang and quarter him, or to burne him. Yet all these are rather solaces then sorrowes, if they be compared with the punishments to come. For these torments are ended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with life; but there neyther the worme shall dye, nor the tormenter shall be wearied, nor the fire shall euer be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. In so much, that if all things, which thou shalt compare with this punishment, be fire, be sword, be beasts, be what tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou wilt, yet it is a sleepe, and a shadow in comparison of this. But what will the condemned doe, when they see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues depriued of so great a good, and condemned to so great misery? What will they doe? What will they say? How will they breathe? And all these in vaine. For after the ship is drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Saylers are for no vse: neyther is a Phisition profitable, when the diseased dye. Then although too late, they shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime their errours,<note place="margin">Repentance too late.</note> and say, this was to be done, and this not. Although we often haue beene admonished, yet we haue not obeyed.

Yea, if all should hold their peace, yet our owne conscience would lift vp her voyce against vs, and accuse vs. All these things are out of Saint Chrisostome; by which it is manifest, how greatly hee shall be striken with a vehement feare, who shall come vnprepared to this sentence.

It is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the reward, which Vertue promiseth to her louers: that is, the glory of Heauen; in which two things are to be especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally looked vnto: the one is the excellencie and beauty of the place, that is, of the heauen of heauens: the other is the dignity and greatnes of the King, that dwelleth there with all his elect.</p>

of to some knowledge of it.<note place="margin">The first coniecture is the end.</note> Amongst these coniectures the first is the end of that worke: for the end is one of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which are wont especially to declare the condition and excellencie of a thing. The end therefore for which the Lord hath made this place, is, that by it he might manifest his glory. For although hee hath created all things for his glory,<note place="margin">Prouer, 16.</note> as sayth Salomon, yet properly and peculierly he is sayd to haue created heauen for this end; for in it after a more speciall manner, his dignitie, greatnes, and magnificence doth shine and appeare. For euen as King Assuerus, that raigned from India euen vnto Ethiopia,<note place="margin">Esther, 1.</note> ouer an hundred, and seauen and twenty prouinces, made a great feast vnto all his Princes and his seruants, euen the power of Persia and Media, in the Citty of Susan, by the space of an hundred and fourescore dayes, and that with all maiesty, cost, and royall magnificence: that hee might shew the riches and glory of his kingdome, and the honour of his great maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie: So the great King of Kings determined to make a most solemne and sumptuous feast in heauen: not by the space of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie time, but throughout all eternity: that in it he might show the vnmeasurablenes of his riches, of his wisedome also, of his liberality and goodnes. This is that feast, of which the Prophet Esay speaketh,<note place="margin">Esay, 25.</note> when he sayth; <hi>And the Lord of Hoasts shall make to all people in this mountaine a feast of fat things, euen a feast of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wines, and of fat things full of marrow, of wines fined and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> That is, of meates most delicate, most precious, and most sweete.</p>
                        <p>If therefore the Lord God doth make that solemne feast, that in it he may manifest the greatnes of his glory: if his glory be so great, what shall the feast be? What the riches? How precious all things that to this end are prepared?<note place="margin">The power of the Lord.</note> But we shal vnderstand this better, if wee consider the greatnes of the power of this Lord. His power is so great, that with one word he created this admirable frame, and that with one word in like manner he can destroy it againe. Neyther could he haue created one vvorld with one word, but infinite vvorlds: &amp; in like maner againe he could haue destroyed so many with one word. Furthermore, whatsoeuer he doth, hee doth it without labour: so that with the same facility, that he created a small Pismire, hee could haue
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:9369:53"/>
created the greatest Cherubin and Seraphin: for he feeleth no burthen, he sweateth not vnder a greater weight, neyther is hee eased of a lesse. For he can doe all things that he willeth, and whatsoeuer he willeth, he worketh by his onely will. Tell mee therefore, if the power of this Lord be so great, and if the glory of his most holy name be so great, &amp; so vnmeasurable his loue, what thinkest thou will be his house, the ioy, &amp; the feast, which he to this end hath prepared? What can be wanting to this worke,<note place="margin">Reasons why heauen should be absolute &amp; perfect.</note> why it should not be absolute in euery respect? There shall be no defect of his hands, because he is infinitely mightie and powerfull. There shall be lesse defect of his braine, because he that made it, is infinitely wise. There shall be no defect of his will: because he is infinitely good. Neither shall this worke be hindered through want of riches, because the maker is the Sea and Ocean of all treasure. What then vvill this vvork be, where there is such and so great preparation? What shall that vvorke be, that commeth out of that shop, in which such vvorkmai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters vvorke together, as are the omnipotency of the Father, the vvisedome of the Sonne, and the goodnes of the holy Ghost? Where the goodnes vvilleth, the vvisedome disposeth and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth, the omnipotencie can doe all that, vvhich the goodnes vvilleth, and the vvisedome ordereth, although all these are one and the same in diuers persons.</p>
                        <p>We haue also an other coniecture,<note place="margin">The second coniecture.</note> meete for this purpose, not vnlike to the former: For God prepared not this house onely for his owne honour, but for the glory and honour also of his elect.

This is manifest in Iosua; at whose commandement the Sun stood vnmoueable in the midst of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: no otherwise then if hee had had in his hands the bridle of the frame of the whole world,<note place="margin">Iosua, 10.</note>

Is not the like power seene in Elias,<note place="margin">3, Kings, 17, 18.</note> vvho by his vvord stayed the cloudes that they should yeeld no raine as long as hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? And afterwards by the vertue of his prayer, hee brought backe the cloudes and obtayned raine, and vvatered the earth vvith showers and dewes? Not onely such things in life are graunted vnto the Elect, but the Lord doth honour them so farre, that hee hath giuen this power after death to their bones and ashes.<note place="margin">4, Kings, 13.</note> Who vvill not prayse God, that the bones of dead Elizeus reuiued a dead man, vvhose body through feare of the theeues of Moab vvas cast into the Sepulcher of the Prophet? Yea,<note place="margin">Acts, 5.</note> he hath not onely giuen this vertue vnto the bones and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes of his elect, but also to their shadowes, the shadow of Peter restored them to health, whom it shadowed.

                        <p>If God be so ready to honour his Saints, yea in a time and place not ordayned nor destined for their reward, but appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for labours and miseries: how great doost thou thinke that glory will be, which he hath prepared for his beloued, in a place proper for reward and recompence, to honour them, and that he may be honoured in them? Hee that so greatly desireth to bestow honour, and can so easily doe it, let euery one consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with himselfe, how ample, precious, rare, and magnificent those things ought to be, which hee hath prepared for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Elect? In this place also may be considered the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable liberality of this Lord, in rewarding the seruices of his seruants. The Lord commaunded the Patriarke Abraham to sacrifice his onely and deerely beloued sonne, who beeing obedient to the commaundement, and preparing himselfe to the sacrifice,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.</note> he heard of him. <hi>Now I know that thou fearest God, seeing for my sake, thou hast not spared thine onely sonne. By my selfe haue I sworne, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thine onely sonne. Therefore will I surely blesse thee, and will greatly multiply thy seede, as the starres of the heauen, and as the sand which is vpon the Sea shoare, and thy seede shall possesse the gate
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:9369:54"/>
of his enemies.</hi> More-ouer, amongst thy sonnes I will giue thee one, who shall be the Sauiour of the world, and he shalbe both thy sonne, and the sonne of GOD. Dooth this seeme vnto thee an ample reward? Thys is a reward woorthy of God; for God is God in all things. Hee is God in recompencing; hee is God in correcting; hee is God in all other things.</p>
                        <p>Dauid on a certaine night considered with himselfe, howe he himselfe dwelt in a house of Cedar trees, and the Arke of GOD remained within the Curtaines: and he began to think of building an house vnto the Lord. And the same night, the word of the Lord came vnto Nathan,<note place="margin">2, Reg, 7.</note> saying: <hi>Goe and tell my seruaunt Dauid, thus saith the Lord: vvilt thou build mee an house for my dwelling? I doe sweare vnto thee, I will builde thee an house for euer, and for all thy posteritie with a perpetuall kingdome: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall my mercy depart from it.</hi> So he sayd, and so he did: for to the comming of Christ they raigned in the house of Iuda, who descended of the familie and seede of Dauid, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ followed, who shall raigne for euer. Therefore, if the glory of Heauen be a recompence, and an vniuersall remuneration of the diuine worship and seruice done vnto God of his Saints; &amp; if God be so liberall in this recompence, it is no hard thing to coniecture, how great the glory to come of the blessed will be.</p>

                        <p>God also exacteth, as an appendix of thys former, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test thing that may be exacted of man for this celestiall glory; that is, he take vp his crosse, that hee pull out his right eye, and cast it from him if it offend him; that he forsake Father and Mother, with all other things created, if they at any time, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade any thing contrary to the diuine commandements. And when we haue doone all things that we can, the Lord willeth, that we say that wee are vnprofitable seruants: hee willeth that glory be gyuen vnto him onely, and all things to be esteemed as his sole and meere grace. Which he confirmeth by Saint Iohn, when he sayth,<note place="margin">Apoc. 21,</note>

Tell me therefore, if the Lord our God be so magnificent, and so liberall in bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his graces, if his diuine goodnes hath graunted to all men in this life, the vse of things so different, if all the creatures of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth indifferently serue all, and the possession of them be common, as well to the vniust as to the iust, who deseruedly can doubt, that much greater are those supreame blessings, which he hath prepared onely for the righteous? Who was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer found, that freely bestowed so great treasures vpon him, to whom he was not indebted? How much greater will he gyue, if he shal be indebted to any? He that is so liberall in bestowing gifts freely, how liberall will he be in repaying and rewarding a debt? He that bestoweth so great things freely, what will hee not giue to him that continueth faythfull? If the magnificence of those things which he giueth, be so inestimable, vvhat shalbe the splendour of those things, which he will repay? Certainly it cannot be spoken, nor be expressed by any words, how great that glory will be, which the Lord will gyue to his Elect, seeing they are so great, which of his great bountie he bestoweth vpon the vnthankfull.</p>

Thys place the Scripture calleth, <hi>The Land of the liuing:</hi> that he might signifie, that this Land which wee inhabite, is a land of those which be dead. But if in this region of death, the creatures be so noble, so precious, and so excellent: what shall those there be, in the land of the euer-liuing? Turne thine eyes into what part soeuer thou wilt of thys visible world, and behold how many and how beautiful things are found in it. Behold how spacious the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the heauen is, how great the splendour is of the Sunne, Moone, and of all the s

                        <p>Let the pleasantnesse of Art, if it please you, be ioyned to the beautie of nature, and the beautie of all things shall be doubled. Because by Art, diuers and excellent peeces of curious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manshyp are wrought in gold &amp; siluer; by Art vessels, images,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9369:56"/>

If therfore in this base element, &amp; the lowest of all, which is called the Land of the dead, there be so many, so delightfull, beautifull, and pleasant things; hovve many, and how great thinkest thou, shall those things be in that highest place, which by how much it is higher then all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and all the elements, by so much it is nobler, by so much richer, by so much more beautifull? Especially, if wee consider those celestiall bodies, which are obuious to our sight (as are the starres, the Sunne, &amp; Moone) in splendour, in vertue, in beauty, and in perpetuitie, by so many degrees to excell and exceed all inferiour things; what then wil those things doe, which are hid from mortall eyes, and are onely open to immortall sight? thys excellencie can scarcely be presupposed or thought vpon.</p>
                        <p>We know that there are three kind of places, appointed of God vnto men in thys life,<note place="margin">The 5. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture. Three kind of places appointed to men, of GOD.</note> according to the diuersitie of times: the first is, the mothers wombe after conception: the second, is this world, straightwaies after byrth: the third, shal be heauen after death, if we haue liued well. In these orders of places, there is that proportion, that by how much more the second is more excellent then the first, by so much the third is more excellent then the second, as wel in the continuaunce and perpetuitie of the tyme, as in the largenesse and beautie of the place, and in all other things. For the diuturnitie and longnes of the first lyfe, it is certaine that it is no longer then nine moneths: the second life at the most is but an hundred yeeres: but the third is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and eternall. Moreouer, the greatnesse of the place of the first life, is no larger then the wombe in which it is contained: of the second, thys large and spacious world: but of the thyrd, the place is so much the greater and more spacious then the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, by how much the second is larger then the first, and the same excellencie that it hath in largenes and greatnesse, the same it hath in beauty, fairenes, riches, and in all other things. If therefore thys world by so much is more large, more beautiful, and more rich then the mothers wombe; how great will the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:9369:56"/>
largenes, the beautie, the riches, the nobilitie be of that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie place?</p>
                        <p>This same thing the difference of the inhabitants dwelling in these two places doe manifestly declare.<note place="margin">The 6, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture.

If therfore the difference of the inhabitants be so great, how great thinkest thou shal the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of places be? Especially seeing that God doth make all places conformable to the inhabitants.<note place="margin">Psal. 83.</note> 
                           <hi>Great and glorious things are spoken of thee thou Citty of God.</hi> Thou art large and great in space and latitude, faire and beautifull in fight and view, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in matter, noble in society, sweet in exercises, rich in all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and free from all euils. In all things thou art great, for he is the greatest that made thee, and the end is most excellent for which thou wast made; and thy inhabitants also are most noble, for whose vse thou wast made.</p>
                        <p>All these pertaine to accidental glory. But there is an other glory greater without all comparison,<note place="margin">Essentiall glory.</note> which is called essentiall, and consisteth in the sight and possession of God himselfe, of which Saint Augustine sayth, he himselfe shal be the reward of Vertue, who gaue Vertue, who shal be seene without end, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without loathing, and praysed without wearines. In so much that this reward is so great, that a greater cannot be: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is neyther heauen, nor earth, nor sea, nor any other cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature: but the Creator himselfe, and the Lord of all, who also as he is one, so he is the most pure and simple good, in whom all other good things are found.</p>
                        <p>For the further intelligence of this thing, we must know, that one of the wonderfull thinges, which are in this substance, is this, that we haue spoken of; that is, that it being but one and the most simple, yet it includeth all the perfections of all things, and that in the highest eminencie of perfection. For seeing that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:9369:57"/>
he is the Creator and maker of all,<note place="margin">God is the perfection of al things.</note> and it is he that gouerneth, and directeth all to their last end and perfection: it cannot be, that he hath not that, he giueth to another, or laboureth with any penury of that thing, that hee so aboundantly distributeth to others. Hence it is that all the blessed spirits doe reioyce in seeing all things in him alone; yet euery one according to the proportion of that glory, which they haue gotten. For euen as now the creatures are as it were looking glasses, in which the beauty of God may after some manner be seene; so then God shall be the looking glasse, in whom the beauty and fairenes of all creatures shall be seene: and that vision shall be much more perfect,<note place="margin">God all in all.</note> then if it were seene in the creatures themselues. So that God will be there the vniuersall good of all his Saints, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect felicity and satietie of all their desires. There God will be a looking glasse to the eyes of his Saints, musicke to their eares, Nectar &amp; Ambrosia to their palats, and ordoriferous Balsanum to their smelling. There we shall see the variety and beauty of the seasons, the pleasantnes of the Spring, the brightnes of Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the fruitfulnes of Autumne, and the quiet of Winter. To be briefe, there shall be whatsoeuer may delight our sences, and euery faculty of our soules. There (as Bernard sayth) will be the fulnes of light to our vnderstanding, the aboundance of peace to our will, and the continuance of eternity to our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. There the wisedom of Salomon shall seeme ignorance: there the beauty of Absalon shall seeme deformity: there the strength of Sampson shall seeme weakenes: there the life of those men, that liued at the beginning of the world, shall be as it were death: to conclude, there wee may worthily call the treasuries of all Emperours and Kings, starke beggerie and pouertie.</p>

                        <p>Porters and Cariers,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> when they are called to carry a burthen on their shoulders, first they looke diligently vpon it, then they peise and lift it vp, and try whether they be able to vndergoe it, and whether they can carry it; and thou ô miserable man, to whom sinnes are so pleasing, that for a little pleasure, hast en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled thy selfe to carry the burthen of it; ah mad man, first prooue and assay how great the waight is of the burthen, (that is, of the punishment, which thou shalt suffer for this pleasure) that thou mayst vnderstand, whether thou hast strength to beare it.</p>
                        <p>That this proofe may be made more conueniently, I wil bring hether a certaine consideration, by the which after some manner thou shalt be able to vnderstand the quality and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the torments of hel: that thou mayst make a triall, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou beest sufficient to beare the burthen, which thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakest to carry,<note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the punishment by reason of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God.</note> when thou sinnest. Let this then be the first consideration, the greatnes and infinite immensity of God, who will chastice and punish sinne, that wee may see what an one God is in all his works. This is it that I would say, that God is great and admirable in al things: not onely in the sea, in earth, and in heauen: but also in hel. In so much, that if the Lord be God in al his works (as we see that he is) he wil be God also in his wrath, in his iustice, and in the punishment of sinners. For this cause the Lord sayth by Ieremy,<note place="margin">Ieremy, 5.</note> 
                           <hi>Feare ye not me, or will ye not be afrayde at my presence, which haue placed the sand for the bounds of the Sea, by the perpetuall decree that it cannot passe it, and though the waues thereof rage, yet can they not preuaile, though they roare,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:9369:60"/>
yet can they not passe ouer it?</hi> That is, ouer the limits appoynted of me. As if he should say, is it not meete that ye feare the arme of the Lord so mighty, whose greatnes this admirable worke doth sufficiently shew? He therfore that is great in al his works, shal he not be great in punishing of sinners? Hee that for one thing is worthy, whom we doe reuerence and adore, shal he not be worthy for an other thing, that he may be feared? For this cause the same Prophet, although he was innocent, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his mothers wombe, so greatly feared the Lord, when he sayd;<note place="margin">Ierem. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>There is none like vnto thee, ô Lord: thou art great, and thy name is great in power. Who would not feare thee ô King of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? For to thee appertayneth the dominion: for among all the wise men of the Gentiles, and in all their kingdomes there is none like thee.</hi> And in an other place, <hi>I kept me farre off from men, because my hart was full of the feare of thy wrath.</hi> Although this Prophet was certaine that this wrath was not kindled against him, yet it was so great that it brought feare vpon him. Therefore it was sayd very well,<note place="margin">Psal. 105. Iob, 26.</note> 
                           <hi>That hee beholdeth the earth, and hee maketh it to tremble, he toucheth the mountaines and they smoake.</hi> And that <hi>the starres and pillers of heauen tremble and quake at his reproofe.</hi> And it is said of him not without reason, that before his maiesty those great principalities and supreame powers doe tremble; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not secure of their owne glory, but because the greatnes of the diuine Maiesty doth strike feare and trembling into them. If therfore they that be perfect be not without feare, what shal they doe, that are guilty and contemners of the diuine Maiesty? They are those, vpon whom hee wil poure out the fury of his indignation. This is one of the principal reasons, why the greatnes of this punishment is to be feared, as S. Iohn plainely teacheth in his Reuelation, where he after this manner speaketh of the scourges and torments of the Lord.<note place="margin">Apoc. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>Therefore shall her plagues come at one day</hi> (he speaketh of Babilon) <hi>death, and sorrow, and famine, and she shall be burnt with fire, for strong is the Lord God, which will condemne her.</hi> The Apostle also was not ignorant of the strength of this Lord, and therfore he sayd, <hi>It is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the Lord.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> It is not a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of men, because they are not so mighty, but we may escape their violence, and flye from

their fury; neyther haue they such authority, that they can thrust the soule into hel. Therfore our Sauiour sayd to his Disciples; <hi>Feare not them that kill the body,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Math. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>but cannot kill the soule: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feare him, who can cast both body and soule into hell fire.</hi> These be the hands, into which the holy Apostle sayth that it is a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to fall. Of these things it is no hard matter to gather, what is the nature of those hands, of which Ecclesiasticus spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; <hi>If we doe not repent,<note place="margin">Ecclesi. 2.</note> we shall fall into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men.</hi> By all which it is most manifest, that as God is great in power, in Maiestie, and in all his works, so he will be great in wrath, in iustice, and in the punishments of the wicked.</p>
                        <p>The same also is yet more plainly seene in examining the Diuine iustice,<note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the iustice of GOD.</note> the effects aud executions of which, be these pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments. Thys is after some manner knowen by the effects, that is, by the feareful punishments of God, inflicted at diuers times vpon wicked men, sundry of which are remembred in the Scriptures.<note place="margin">Numb. 16.</note> How terrible was the punishment of Dathan and Abiron, and of all theyr complices, whom the earth (opening her mouth) swallowed vp, with theyr Tents, and all their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and they went quick into hel; because they had stirred vp sedition against Moses and the Priests?

For feare of giuing vnto any of them of the flesh of his children, whom he shall eate, because he hath nothing left him in that siedge and straightnes, wherwith thine enemie shall besiedge thee in all thy Citties.

her softnesse and tendernesse, shall be grieued at her husband vvhich lieth in her bosome, and at her sonne, and at her daughter, and at her after birth, that shall come out from betweene her feete, and at her children, which shee shall beare: for when all things lacke, shee shall eate them secretlie, during the siedge and straightnesse, vvhere-with thine enemie shall besiedge thee in thy Citties.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Horrible and to be trembled at are these punishments: yet both these, and al other, with which men haue at any time been punished in this world, are no other thing then a smal shadow, and a figure of those punishments, which tarry for the damned in the other world: for that shall bee the time in which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine iustice shal shine, vpon and against those, that heere haue refused his mercy. But if the shadow be so horrible, who shal be able to sustaine the truth of the matter, and the thing it selfe? If now, when as the Diuine iustice is as yet tempered with mercy, and the cup of the wrath of the Lord is mixed with the water of his grace, be so bitter; what will it be, when it shall be drunke pure without mercy, especially of those that would shewe no mercy to theyr neighbour; although the punishment will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be lesse, then the desert and merrit of the sinne?</p>
                        <p>Neyther onely dooth the greatnesse of the iustice argue the greatnes of the punishment;<note place="margin">Of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God, the greatnes of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is gathered.</note> but also the greatnes of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, of the goodnes of which wicked men presume so much. For what is more admirable, then to see GOD clothed with mans flesh, and in it to suffer all kinde of torments &amp; reproches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> euen from his entrance into this life, to his going foorth of it, which he ended vpon the Crosse? What greater mercy, then to come into this world, and to take vppon him the debts of the vvhole world, that he might disburthen the world of them? &amp; to shed his blood for them who shedde his blood? Therefore, as the works of the Diuine mercie are admirable, so are the workes of the Diuine iustice to be feared: for there is not in God lesser or greater, but seeing that God is wholy and all that hee is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, therefore as much as his mercie is, so much necessarilie is his iustice,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> in those things that pertaine vnto it. For euen as by the greatnes of one arme, we gather the quantity of the other; so by the greatnes of the arme of the Diuine mercy, we measure also the quantity of the Diuine iustice: seeing that there is one

and the same measure of them both.</p>

For the mercie of GOD had not any thing that might prouoke it, or desire it, seeing there was nothing in mans nature, that might deserue it: but the Diuine iustice shal haue so many pricks, motiues, and pullers on for reuengement, as there hath been sinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in thys world: ánd of these sufficient coniectures may bee taken, how great and howe terrible the Diuine iustice will be. This thing Saint Bernard excellently declareth in a certaine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of the Natiuitie of our Lord:<note place="margin">In his first Sermon of the Natiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our Lord.</note> Looke how milde &amp; gentle he was (saith he) in his first comming, so hard and inexorable will he be in his second: and as now there is no man that may not be reconciled, so after a short time, there shalbe no man that may. Because, as the gentlenes and benignitie appeared beyond all hope and esteeme, so we must expect the sharpnes and seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, of the iudgement to be. God is vnmeasurable &amp; infinite in iustice, as he is in mercy: great to pardon, great to punish: but mercy doth challenge the first place, that if we will, iustice might not be found, vpon whom it should be extended. This sayth Bernard. By thys it sufficiently appeareth, how that by the mercie of God, the quantitie of his iustice may be gathered.</p>

The same thing the Diuine pacience doth most plainly teach, which hee vseth as well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the whole world, as towards all sorts of men, good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. For we see many men so disordered and dissolute, and of so
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:9369:62"/>
reprobate a life, that from the first time that they begin to open theyr eyes of reason, euen to the last day of theyr life, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume and spend the greater part of theyr life in offending God, and contemning his diuine commaundements: hauing neither respect nor regard of the promises, threatnings, benefits or cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of God, or of any other thing. Neuerthelesse, in al the time of theyr life, the great goodnes of God wayteth for them wyth great patience, not cutting off the thred of theyr life: not cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to call them by many wayes to repentance, although he see no token of amendement in them. But when that long pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shal come to an end, if he shal poure vpon them the store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of his wrath, (whom so many yeeres by little and little he hath beene gathering into the bosome of his iustice) with what force, with what violence, thinkest thou that they shal be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed?</p>
                        <p>What other thing would the Apostle signifie, when he said, <hi>Despisest thou the riches of his bountifulnesse, and patience, &amp; long sufferance,</hi>

Tell mee (I pray thee) if any man in gathering treasure, should so closely and diligently sticke to it, that neyther any day or houre should passe, in which hee woulde not adde somewhat to it, and that by the space of fiftie or sixtie yeeres: if at any time afterwards he should vnlock his doore, &amp; enter into his treasure house, what great store of treasure should he finde there? O vnhappy man, doost thou not marke, that neyther day nor houre passeth, in which thou doost not augment the heape of Gods wrath, which is reserued for thy destruction? that is, increased and augmented by euery sinne that thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittest. For although there were no other thing, but the disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

looke of thine eyes, the impure thought, or vncleane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and the hatred of thine hart, the word and periurie of thy mouth, these were enough alone to fill the whole world. But if to these all thy other vices &amp; sinnes be ioyned, meditate (I pray thee) what an vnmeasurable masse of the wrath of GOD thou hast heaped to thy selfe by the space of so many yeares? If the ingratitude and maliciousnes of peruerse men be well searched into, they will shewe vnto vs the greatnesse of the Diuine pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments.</p>
                        <p>That thys is true consider the goodnesse and liberalitie of GOD towards men: consider moreouer that which he dyd and sayd in thys world, with that which he suffered for them all. Consider also the commodities and necessaries for the vse of men, prepared of hym, that they might liue well: and all other things that he hath pardoned vnto sinners, or winked at, how many blessings he hath bestowed vpon them, and from hovve many euils he hath deliuered them, and many other kind of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and benefits, which daily he bestoweth vpon them. All these things increase and multiply the heape of Gods vvrath. Moreouer, call to thy minde, the forgetfulnesse and negligence of men towards God, and also theyr ingratitude and rebellion, lastly, their blasphemies and contempt, as well of God himselfe, as of his commaundements; which are so great, that not onely they looke for no gaine or profit of theyr sinning, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, of onely maliciousnes, they tread foolishly all that vnder theyr feete, which the Lord hath commaunded. He therefore, that without any reuerence or shamefastnes despiseth so great a Maiestie, no otherwise then if he were some Figge-tree God; who so often,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> as Paule speaketh, <hi>hath troden vnder-foote the son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Testament as an vnholie thing,</hi> wherewith he was sanctified; he that so often hath cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him with his works, worse then the works of Pagans, what other thing is to be looked for of him, when the houre of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering an account shall come, then that he giue the honour to God,<note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be like to the sin.</note> or suffer so much punishment, as he hath iniured God? For seeing that GOD is a iust Iudge, it is his duety to bevvare, that the punishments be not lesse then the iniuries done: but that they be like to the sinne of him who hath beene iniurious.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:9369:63"/>
In thys case, if it be God to whom the iniurie is doone, vvhat sentence shall be pronounced against the body and soule of the condemned, that the iniury doone may bee recompenced by worthy punishment? But if in the satisfaction of the offence done to God, the blood of the sonne of God was necessarie, in supplying the dignity of the person, which was wanting &amp; fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for the greatnes of the punishment, what shall it be, vvhen the recompence shall be performed, not by the dignitie of the person, but onely by the seueritie of the punishment?</p>

                           <hi>And I saw</hi> (saith he) <hi>a star which was fallen from heauen vnto the earth, and to him was giuen the key of the bottomlesse pitte. And hee opened the bottomlesse pitte, and there arose the smoake of the pitte, as the smoake of a great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and the sunne and the ayre were darkned by the smoake of the pitte. And there came out of the smoake Locustes vpon the earth, &amp; vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was giuen power, as the Scorpions of the earth haue power. And it was commaunded them that they should not hurt the grasse of the earth, neither any greene thing, neither any tree: but onely those men, which haue not the seale of God in their foreheads. And to them was commaunded that they should not kill them, but that they should be vexed fiue moneths, and that their paine should be as the paine that commeth of a Scorpion, when hee hath stunge a man. Therefore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the forme of the Locustes was like vnto horses prepared vnto battaile, and on their heads were as it were crownes like vnto gold, &amp; their faces were like vnto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men. And they had haire as the haire of vvomen, &amp; their teeth were as the teeth of Lyons. And they had Habbergions, like vnto Habbergions of yron: and the sound of their wings, was like the sound of Charrets, when many Horses runne vnto battaile. And they had tailes like vnto Scorpions, and there were stings in their tailes.</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto Saint Iohn. Tell mee nowe, my brother, what was the minde of the holy Ghost, (for he is the Authour of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) when vnder that horrible and fearefull figure, he vvould signifie the greatnesse of the scourges of the Diuine iustice? What other intent had he, then that by this terrible horrour he might admonish men, that they be not vnmindfull vvhat the wrath of the Lord God is, and what be the instruments of his iustice: what be the punishments of the wicked, and what is the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:9369:64"/>
power of our aduersaries: that we beeing admonished by the fearefull terrour of these things, may feare to offend God? For what is that starre, which fell from heauen vnto the earth, &amp; to whom the keyes of the bottomlesse pitte were deliuered, but that most bright Angell who fell from heauen, to whom vvas giuen the power of darknes? And what be those Locustes like vnto Horses prepared for the warre, but hellish Furies, Armies of damned companions, assistants, helpers, and ministers vnto him, who are deuils? what is the grasse, what the greene plants, which they are forbidden to hurt, but the iust, who are greene, and doe florish by the dew of the Diuine grace, and doe bring foorth fruite to eternall life? Who be they that haue not the seale of God in their foreheads, but they that haue not the spirit of God, who is the seale of his seruaunts, and of the Sheepe of his flock.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, against those miserable and wretched ones, such an Armie of the Diuine iustice is prepared, that both in this life and in that to come, according to theyr merrits, they shalbe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and tortured of the deuils themselues, whom they haue serued,<note place="margin">Exod, 8.</note> no otherwise then the Egiptians were vexed of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-flies and frogges, which they adored for Gods. How hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and fearefull a thing will it be then, in that damned &amp; cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed place to see so many terrible monsters, and hagges so dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? How fearefull will it be there to see that hungry Dragon, fretting and fuming with horrible madnesse: that great Behe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth, of whom it is said in the booke of Iob, that his tayle is like a Cedar, that drinketh vp riuers, and feedeth on Mountaines?</p>

What is to be looked for of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and infinitenes of God, I say of the greatnes of his iustice, in punishing wicked men and sinners? vvhat of the greatnes of his patience, which so gently doth forbeare, and expect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of sinners? vvhat of the multitude of his benefits, with which he doth loade sinners, that with the sweetnes of them, he might draw and allure them vnto him? What of the greatnes of his hatred, which he hath against sinne? for that sinne, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:9369:65"/>
offendeth an infinite Maiestie, merriteth an infinite hate. What of the greatnesse of the furie of our enemies, who are so migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in torments and tortures, and so ready to doe ill? What I say is to be looked for, or to be hoped of the greatnesse of all these things, but a mightie and vnheard of punishment of sinne? If therefore the punishment be so great which is prepared for sin, neyther may any escape it, neither doth it euer faile; (for so our sayth doth tell vs) what is the reason, or rather the blindnesse of them, who beleeuing and confessing these things, do not regard the intollerable burthen, which they take vpon them when they offend?

                           <p>BVt besides that those things which hetherto vvee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, be sufficient to beget in vs very great feare &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, yet they shall be much more effectuall, if we consider the perpetuitie of these punishments. For if there were any end, or intermission, or refreshing to be found in them, at the least after many thousand yeeres, certainly it would be a great comfort to these miserable and wretched soules. But what shall I speake of Eternitie, which knoweth none other end, then that which the Eternitie of GOD himselfe hath? Which space is so long, that (as a famous Doctour testifieth) if any of those damned should shed but euery thousand yeere one teare,<note place="margin">A fearfull saying.</note> greater aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of water shoulde flowe out of his eyes, then this whole world should be able to containe. What thing more terrible can be spoken or thought vpon? But if all the torments vvhich are in hell, were as the pricking of pinnes, yet for their Eternity they might suffice to moue a man, to vndergoe with a cheereful minde, the punishments, tribulations, crosses, and what soeuer miseries are in this world: at least, that hee may escape Eternall punishment.</p>
                           <p>O that this word <hi>Eternall,</hi> might alwayes stay and dwell in thy minde, how profitable would it be vnto thee? We reade of a certaine man, very studious and contemplatiue of the vanities of the world, who when on a certaine time he fell into the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:9369:65"/>
of this Eternity, fearing a thing of such continuance, which should haue none end, hee began thus to reason with himselfe: There cannot a man of a sound wit be found in this world, who would accept the gouernment of the whole world, with that condition, that for the space of thirty or forty yeeres together, hee should stretch himselfe vpon a bed strewed with roses and springing flowers: which thing if it be so, what is the madnes, frenzie, and dotage of men, that will for a thing of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie small moment, embrace a burning firy bed, vpon which he shall be rosted and broyled for euer and euer? This onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration was so profitable to that man, and wrought so great fruites in him, that forth-with vices being forsaken, hee sought after Vertue, and in a short time, in such manner profited in them, that hee became an holy man, and a Prelate of the Church.</p>
                           <p>What will the delicate tenderlings of this world say, who for the noyse of one gnat, doe passe whole nights without sleepe, when they shal see themselues stretched vpon this bed of burning fire, and to be burned in euery part with lyuing flames? And that not for one night, but to endure for euer. To such the Prophet Esay speaketh in these words,<note place="margin">Esay, 33.</note> 
                              <hi>Who among you shall dwell with the deuouring fire, who among you shall dwell with the euerlasting burnings?</hi> Whose shoulders are so hard or of Iron, that can beare such a burthen so long a time? O nation bewitched and sencelesse, ô men blinded of that old deceiuer, who doth muffle and hood-winke all the world with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts and guiles. What I pray thee is more strange from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, then that men regard and respect euery small trifle, that pertayneth to this life: and in a matter of so great moment, are so inconsiderate and negligent? If we doe not see these things, what wil we see? What wil we feare, if we doe not feare these things, or what shal we fore-see, if we doe not fore-see these things? But if these things be so, why doe we not embrace ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues with great alacrity of spirit, although they be hard and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the least that we may eschew these euils?</p>
                           <p>It is most certaine, that if God should grant to thee a choyce, and say; all the time that thou liuest, thou shalt eyther be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the goute, or be extreamely vexed with the tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:9369:66"/>
which disease neyther night nor day, shal suffer thee to take any case or rest: or if thou wouldest be free from these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, thou shalt enter into some austere and straight kinde of lyuing, which thy nature can hardly brooke: consider with thy selfe which of these thou wouldest choose. I doe not thinke that a man can be found so foolish, who (for the onely loue of himselfe) would not choose rather this straight kinde of liuing, then that he would endure so long time these griefes and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Seeing that therefore the discruciatements and dolours that we speake of, are infinitely more greeuous, &amp; in diuturnity of time without any comparison longer: and this austere and straight kinde of lyuing, which God requireth of thee, is much more lesse, then that thy nature can brooke and beare: vvhat madnes is it then to be vnwilling to vndergoe so small labours, and so short troubles, by which thou mayest escape those eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall torments? Who doth not see that this is the greatest errour of this world, and intollerable madnes? But the reward and fruite will be, that whilst a man will not free himselfe here from so great euils, by a small labour of repentance, that there he shall make euerlasting sorrow, and repentance without any fruite or profit. Wee haue a figure of this thing in the furnace, which King Nabuchodonozer commaunded to be heated in Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, <hi>The flame of which mounted aboue the furnace nine and fortie Cubits</hi>;<note place="margin">Dan. 3, A notable Allegory.</note> for the defect of one Cubit, it came not to the number of fifty, which signifieth the yeere of Iubily: that we may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that although these eternall flames of Babilon, that is, of hell, doe burne aboue measure and most cruelly doe torment the miserable and wretched being damned, yet they shall neuer come to that, to obtayne the fauour of a true Iubily. O punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without profit, ô barren teares, ô sharpe and bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, yet voyde of all hope and solace. How little of those thinges, that there the damned suffer without fruite, if they heere had suffered willingly and patiently, might haue preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them from these euils? How easily might they haue beene deliuered, and for how small paines?</p>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:9369:66"/>
will goe without cloathes, and naked; I will make lamentation like the Dragons, and mourning as the Ostriches; because the plagues of my people are greeuous.</hi> If these things were suspected of men, and if there were no credite to be giuen to these things, or if they were doubtful and vncertaine, after some manner it were tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, if men fel into this error.

                           <p>Tell me, ô blind and witles man, what thou doost finde wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy amongst the riches and goods of this world, that may be compared with this price?

For it is no small thing for the defence of this matter, to alledge that there is a God: and what the studious of Vertue deserue, what is giuen, and what is promised vnto them; on the other side, what threatnings are menaced and denounced against the vicious, and against those that flye from the study of Vertue.<note place="margin">It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, so many men are found wicked and vicious.

For it is not to be meruailed at, that there be many such among infidels, who seeing they know not Vertue, haue it in no price: euen as a ditcher, if he by chaunce finde a Iem, doth little esteeme it: because he knoweth not the vertue and price of it. But that Christians, who know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue all these things, doe liue as though they beleeued not, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of God, seruants of sinne, bondslaues vnto their owne passions and appetites, by so much more addicted to visible things, by how much more they are carelesse of inuisible things,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:9369:67"/>
ready to all kinde of sinne, no otherwise, then if death were not at all, neither that they should come to iudgement, neither that anie glorie of heauen was to be looked for, and to be briefe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hell to be feared. This I say, is greater then all admiration.</p>
                        <p>Therfore,<note place="margin">Whence this negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is.</note> as I said, it may worthilie be demaunded, whence this negligence growes, and whence this stupiditie of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and this diabolicall inchauntment (if I may so call it) comes vnto men. This mischiefe hath not one onely roote, but many and diuers. Amongst others, and those not the least, is a certaine generall errour, in which men of this worlde doe lyue, supposing all that God promiseth to the louers of Vertue, to be reserued to the life to come; and that in this present world, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be looked for. Therefore, seeing that man dooth so greatly desire reward, and especially is ledde by profit, but not vnlesse it be present, and is mooned with those things, which are obuious to the outward sences, when he seeth nothing present, he smally accounteth of that which is to come. So the Ievves seeme to haue doone in the time of the Prophets: For vvhen as Ezechiell (by the commaundement of God) did set before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great promises, or did denounce against them direfull commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, they mocked, and with a certaine contempt, hissed at them all,<note place="margin">Ezech, 12,</note> saying; <hi>The vision that he seeth, is for many dayes to come, and he prophecieth of the times that are farre of.</hi> So the scornefull contemned the sayings of the Prophet Esay,<note place="margin">Esay, 28,</note> and said; <hi>Precept must be vpon precept, precept vpon precept, line vnto line, line vnto line, there a little, &amp; there a little.</hi> This is one of the especiall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that withdrawes peruerse and froward men from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance of Gods commaundements, perswading themselues, that there is no reward ordained for Vertue in this world; but all things to be reserued for the world to come.</p>
                        <p>To this that great Wiseman respected,<note place="margin">Eccle. 8.</note> when hee said, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sentence against an euill worke is not speedily executed, therfore the hart of the chyldren of men is fully sette in them to doe euill.</hi> The Wise-man addeth also another thing, and that is, the worst a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all things that are done vnder the Sunne,<note place="margin">All things happen a like to the good and euill.</note> and that it doth giue great occasion to the wicked to sinne, that it happeneth ill to the righteous, as though they had doone the workes of the wicked: and the wicked often-times doth liue so securely, as if
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:9369:68"/>
they did the works of the righteous:<note place="margin">Eccle. 9.</note> or that all things come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to all; and the same condition is to the iust and to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; to the pure, and to the polluted; to him that sacrificeth, &amp; to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner, hee that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath. Whereupon he sayth, <hi>The harts of the sonnes of men, are full of euill, and madnes is in their harts whilst they liue, and after that, they goe to the dead.</hi> That which Salomon heere speaketh, the wicked and vngodly them selues doe confesse by the Prophet Malachie, saying: <hi>It is in vaine to serue God:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Mala. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>and what profit is it that we haue kept his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements, and that we walked humbly before the Lord of hosts? Therefore we count the proude blessed: euen they that worke wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, are sette vp, and they that tempt God, yea, they are deliuered.</hi> These things the wicked say, and these are the things which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially hold them in impietie: for they suppose it a very hard thing, as Ambrose sayth, to buy hope at their owne perrill: that is, to compasse future blessings with the losse of present, and to giue those things that are in their hands, for those which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heereafter may be giuen.</p>
                        <p>To banish and expell this most pestilent errour, I know not whence to take a fitter beginning, then from those wordes and teares of our Sauiour, with which in times past, he did lament &amp; weepe ouer that miserable Cittie of Ierusalem, saying: <hi>O if thou haddest euen knowne at the least in this thy day,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luke, 19,</note> 
                           <hi>those things which belong vnto thy peace: but now are they hidde from thine eyes.</hi> Our Sauiour did consider on the one part, howe great the blessings were, which were brought into the world for the vse and good of that people, together with his person: for all the graces and heauenlie treasures, descended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen together with Christ; on the otherside, he looked to this people, offended at his low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie humilitie and base estate, and that they would not accept of his blessings, and that for this sinne, they should not onely lose these treasures, but also their whole Common-wealth, and their Cittie.</p>
                        <p>Therefore the Lorde exceedingly lamenting, wept most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly, and broke forth into this short and imperfect sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: the which the shorter it is, it hath the greater significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This same affection, and these words may be fitly applied
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:9369:68"/>
to our purpose. For considering on the one part the beauty of Vertue, and the graces and riches, which attend on her; and on the other part, how farre these things are remoued and hid from the eyes of men, drowned in earthly things, and also how Vertue doth sweepe the ground, and being despised in all the world, cannot finde a place for her selfe, doost thou not thinke that wee haue iust cause to weepe, and to say with our Lord, <hi>O,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Men are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of those good things that are in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</note> 
                           <hi>if thou haddest euen knowne at the least in this thy day,</hi> that is, ô that God would now open thine eyes, that thou mightest see the treasures, magnificence, riches, peace, liberty, light, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, delights, fauours, and all the good things and blessings, which like Hand-maydes attend and wayte vpon Vertue, in what great price and esteeme wouldest thou haue her? With what great desire wouldest thou long and thirst after her? With what great diligence and labour wouldest thou seeke and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after her? But now all things are hid from carnall eyes: for they not seeing any thing besides the outward bark of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, neuer tasting the inward sweetnes of her, thinke that there is nothing in her, but that which is hard, sharpe, and vnsauery: they thinke, that she is not currant in this present life, but to be vsed in the other: and if there be any goodnes in her, that it pertayneth wholy to another world, and not to this. Therfore they disputing according to the flesh, doe say, that they will not buy hope by danger, neyther that they will hazard present things for things to come. So speake they that are offended at the exteriour figure of Vertue: for they are ignorant of the Philosophy of Christ,<note place="margin">Vertue like vnto Christ.</note> neyther know they that Vertue is like vnto her Maister Christ; who although outwardly hee beare the shape and image of a most poore and base man, yet inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie was the God and Lord of all creatures.

That thereby at the least may be vnderstood, that there is somewhat more in Vertue, then outwardly is seene. To be briefe, thou must consider, that seeing that the Author of Nature doth not faile in any necessary thing, (because hee giueth to all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, those things that are necessary) and seeing that in the world there is nothing more necessary, nor any thing of greater moment then Vertue, that he would not leaue her in the hands of a will so weake and crased, of an vnderstanding so blind, of an appetite so ready to all euill, and of a nature so disordered, and so corrupt through sinne: but that he would prouide her of helpe and hability, by ayde of which she might saile through this Sea. For it was not meete, nor conuenient, that seeing the Diuine prouidence was so carefull in giuing to flies, spiders, and pismires hability, and all instruments necessary to preserue their life: that he should be vnmindfull of man, and that he should not giue him those things, which are necessary for the attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

I will say more, if the world and the deuill do bestow vpon their seruants, for the seruice that they yeeld them, so manie kinde of tasts, pleasures, and delights, at the least so in appearance: how is it possible that God should be so barren &amp; vnfruitfull to his friends and faithfull ministers, that he should leaue them in the midst of their labours &amp; tribulations, fasting, and with hungry and dry mouthes? Howe? doost thou thinke then that the condition of Vertue hath so much gall, and that there is so much honny in the flowers of vices? Doost thou thinke that God will permit and suffer, that one should enioy delights, and another be exercised with troubles, and many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations? Thou art deceiued.

                        <p>Blessed and happy without all doubt, is that soule, which by gifts and benefits receiued of God, doth shew the greatnesse of his goodnesse: but vnhappy and miserable is that soule, which by punishments and torments, dooth make manifest the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Diuine iustice.

                           <p>For first, thou canst not denie, but that heere is made a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and a distinction, betweene a reward, which is giuen in thys life, and that, which is in another: whilst one is promised as to come, the other is offered as present.

For we see for the most part, that to them is not giuen great dignities, not loftie honours, not large possessions, nor the magnificent furniture of this world: but that many of them doe liue in corners, buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the obliuion and obscurity of the world: expecting their last houre in pouerty, misery, and calamity. Which seeing that it is so, how can the infallible truth of this sentence be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, vnlesse we confesse, that God in this life doth giue to his those gifts,<note place="margin">what goods be those that God bestoweth vpon the good.</note> and those spirituall riches, which may satisfie a man without any externall pompe of this world, with greater felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, with greater ioy, sufficiencie and quiet, then the possession of all the goods of this world. Neyther is this so much to be meruailed at: For as we beleeue that it is not of any necessity to God, that hee should nourish mens bodies with bread onely, (for he hath many other meanes to that end) so is it not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to him, that he should satisfie soules with temporall blessings onely. For he can doe this most easily without them: as hee hath most certainly done in all his Saints. Who were endued with that spirituall ioy and mirth, and with that affection of deuotion, that their prayers, exercises, teares, and delights, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all the solaces and pleasures of this world. And after this manner it is most certainly verefied, that an hundreth fold is receaued for that little they left: for they receaue for deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and apparant things, those that be vndoubtedly true; for things vncertaine, certaine; for things corporall, spirituall: for carefulnes, security; for troubles, quietnes; for perturbations, peace and inward tranquility; to conclude, for a life impure, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and abhominable, they receaue a life splendent through vertues, and most acceptable to God and Angels. So also thou, if thou shalt despise temporall good for Christ, thou shalt find in him inestimable treasures: if thou shalt contemne false and fayned honours, thou shalt finde in him those that be true: if thou shalt renounce the loue of thy father and mother, for this he will delight thee, with greater blandishments and cherishing, and thou shalt find for a temporall father an eternall; &amp; if thou shalt cast from thee those pestiferous and venomous pleasures, thou shalt haue in him sweeter, pleasanter, and holier delights.</p>

For after that heauenly light hath illuminated our eyes, by and by there is begot a new face of all things, and diuerse from the former; and all things doe seeme to haue put on a certaine new shape, by which they shew themselues to our eyes; and therefore that which before seemed sweet, is now bitter, and that which before appeared bitter, is now sweet: that which before terrified vs, doth now like vs: that which before was beautifull, now seemeth filthy; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it appeared to be such before, yet now it seemeth not such, neyther that it was well knowne before.</p>
                           <p>Therefore after this manner standeth the truth of Christes promise, when for the temporall goods of the body, there are giuen spirituall blessings of the soule; &amp; for those goods, which are called the goods of fortune, there are giuen the blessings of grace, which without all comparison are greater, and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall and forcible to enrich and satiate mans hart, then all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall blessings. For the more confirmation of this matter, I will not omit to remember a notable and famous example, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the booke, called, The booke of famous and illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men.</p>
                           <p>When as,<note place="margin">A notable example.</note> sayth the Author, Saint Bernard preached the word of God to the people in Belgia, and that with a most fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent zeale conuerted the inhabitants to God, amongst many other, who being touched with the grace of the holy Ghost, vvere conuerted to a better lyfe, there vvas a certaine noble Knight famous among the Belgians, called Arnulphus: vvho was bound and tyed to the world, with very many and mighty bonds, and who was exceedingly ensnared and entangled with wordly vanities. This man when at the length he bad farewell to the world, and betooke himselfe to a vertuous and heauenly kinde of lyuing, this holy father so reioyced at his conuersion, that he sayd to them that were present, that Christ was no lesse miraculous in the conuersion of Arnulphus, then he was in the raysing of Lazarus, seeing that Christ had raysed him being so fettered with the chaynes of so great sinnes, and buried in such
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:9369:72"/>
deepe pleasures, and had brought him to newnes of life. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulphus also was no lesse admirable in his proceeding; then he was in his conuersion. And because it is too long to relate here all the vertues of this man, I will onely repeate that, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for our purpose. This holy man was many times so pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Windy-colicke, that often his life was endangered by it, &amp; he stroue with death. When on a time he had lost toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his speech all his sence, so that there was scarcely left any hope of longer lyuing, they applying a little phisicke vnto him, forth-with againe he began somewhat to breathe, and by little &amp; little to come vnto himselfe. At the length on a suddaine he began to prayse the Lord, crying out with a loude voyce: All things which thou hast spoken, ô blessed Iesu, are most true. And he repeated these words very often. Those religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men that stoode about him, meruailed at him, and asked him how he did, and why he sayd so. He aunswered none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but doubled the same, saying ouer againe, <hi>All things which thou hast spoken, ô blessed Iesu, are true.</hi> Some that were present sayd, that the greatnes of his payne and disease, had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed his reason and iudgement, and that this disturbance did cause him so to speake. To whom he aunswering, sayd; It is not so my brethren, but I doe speake with a sound iudgement, and with a good vnderstanding, that those things are most true, which our Sauior Iesus Christ spake. They said vnto him again, surely we confesse as much, that it is so, but for what intent doost thou speake it? Because, sayth he, he sayth in the Gospell, that whosoeuer for the loue of him shall forsake his parents, he shall receaue an hundreth fold in this world, and shall haue life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting in the other.<note place="margin">The sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and pleasure of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yea in their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test greefes and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.</note> The experience of this I haue now in my selfe, and I confesse with all my hart, that now I haue receaued an hundred fold in this life: for the greatnes of the griefe which I now suffer, is so sweet vnto me, for the certaintie of the hope which I haue of my saluation, that I woulde not change my Christ with the hundreth fold of all those things that are in the vvorld. And if I that am so great a sinner, doe receaue so great consolation in my griefes and paines, what shal holy and perfect men receaue in their reioycings? For that spirituall ioy, vvhich hath brought this hope vnto mee, dooth farre exceede all that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:9369:72"/>
worldly ioy, which I possessed in this world. When they had heard these things, all they that stoode by meruailed, that a man vnlearned &amp; illiterate, should vtter so great misteries: but sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie it was the holy Ghost, that dwelled in his hart, that spake these things in him.</p>
                           <p>Therefore by this example it is very manifest, that God with out any pompe or preparation of these temporall blessings, can giue to his, much more aboundance, and many moe precious blessings, then those were, which they left for him: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent it is hence euident, howe shamefully they erre, who thinke that no reward is destined and ordained for Vertue in this life.<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</note> To banish therefore this errour so dangerous (besides those things which haue beene spoken) the twelue priuiledges &amp; prerogatiues which follow, shall be most profitable, in which we will handle and discourse of the twelue admirable fruits and preheminences, which attend and waite vpon Vertue in thys life: that by them the louers of this world may vnderstand, that in Vertue there are found many moe excellent blessings then they suppose. And although to the perfect knowledge of thys, the experience and vse of Vertue herselfe were necessarie, (that thereby we might the better know her riches and commodities) yet that which is wanting in this respect, Fayth shall supply, which confesseth &amp; acknowledgeth the truth of the diuine and holy Scriptures, by the testimonies of which I will approue all things, which I am to speake of this matter: that we should at no time doubt of the excellencie of Vertue.</p>

Although there is in him a generall prouidence ouer all his creatures, yet he hath a singuler and a speciall prouidence one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ouer them, whom hee hath chosen, that they should be his: and seeing that he accounteth of them as of his sonnes, he hath also giuen vnto them a childes hart, and a filiall spirit, and he in like manner, beareth towards them, the hart of a most louing &amp; tender Father, and therefore he hath ouer them a care &amp; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, equall vnto this loue.</p>
                        <p>But how great that prouidence is, it cannot be vnderstood, vnlesse of them, which haue tried, or at least haue seene, or haue read with industrie &amp; attention those places of Scripture, which speake of this prouidence. Whosoeuer shall doe this, hee shall see that generally all these things are directed to that end. For all things haue reference and are turned about these two points,<note place="margin">Two things are to bee considered of in euery place of Scripture: the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</note> no otherwise then the heauen about his poles, that is, about the Commaundement, and the Promise. For here, the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth obedience to man, and obseruaunce of his precepts; there he promiseth great rewards to them who obserue &amp; keep them, &amp; threatneth fearefull punishments to them, who breake and violate them. This doctrine is deuided after that manner, that all the morrall bookes of the sacred Scripture do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund and promise: and the historicall doe shew the true effect of this or that; showing how differently GOD carrieth himselfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the good &amp; euill. But seeing that God is so magnificent
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:9369:73"/>
and so liberall, and man so miserable and so fraile; he so rich in promising, this so poore in giuing; greatly different is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of that which he commaundeth, in respect of that hee giueth: so that he commaundeth few things, but giueth verie many: he commaundeth loue and obedience, both which, hee himselfe giueth, and for them he offereth inestimable blessings, as well of grace, as of glory, both in this life, and that to come. Amongst these, wee giue the first place to his loue and fatherly prouidence, which he beareth towards them, who are receiued of him for sonnes: which loue exceedeth al loue &amp; prouidence, which all earthly fathers haue, or can haue towards their sonnes. The reason is this, because euen to this day, there hath not been found any Father, who hath layd vp &amp; prepared so great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings for the good of his chyldren, as GOD hath prepared &amp; prouided for his children: that is, the participation of his owne glorie. Neyther hath any Father laboured or taken so much paynes as hee, who hath for them shedde his owne blood: To conclude, neyther doth any Father watch and keepe his vvith so great care and diligence, as God dooth his, who are daily in his eyes, and to whom he is present in all their tribulations. This Dauid confesseth in his Psalmes,<note place="margin">Psalm, 41.</note> when he sayth, <hi>Thou vpholdest me in mine integritie, and doost sette mee before thy face for euer.</hi> That is, thou neuer turnest thine eyes from me, for that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall care thou hast of mee. Also hee sayth in another place, <hi>The eyes of the Lord are vpon the righteous,</hi>

                        <p>In the New Testament also, more excellent &amp; magnificent things are spoken of this diuine prouidence, where the Lorde sayth, that he onely hath not a care of the bones of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but also of euery one of theyr haires,<note place="margin">Luke, 12, &amp; 21.</note> that they fall not, nor perrish without his prouidence: willing after this manner of speaking, to insinuate and intimate vnto vs, his greatest and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallest prouidence towards them.

                        <p>What King was euer founde, that had such a garde as our Lord hath giuen vnto vs? This is most manifestly seene in the bookes of the Kings: the King of Syria comming to take the Prophet Elizeus,<note place="margin">4. Reg. 6.</note> brought a great Armie with him, vvhich the seruaunt of the Prophet seeing, feared, and began to tremble. But the Prophet turning to his prayer: prayed the Lorde, that hee would vouchsafe to open the eyes of his vnbeleeuing ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, that he might see the Armie, which stoode for the defence of the Prophet, being stronger by infinite thousands then that, which came to hurt and wrong him. And hee opened the eyes of his seruant, and he saw the Mountaine ful of horses, and of fierie Charrets, for the defence and gard of Elizeus. Like to this gard is that, which is mentioned in the Canticles, in these words, <hi>What shall you see in the Shulamite</hi> (which is the Church,<note place="margin">Cant, 6.</note> or any soule liuing in the state of grace) <hi>but as the company of an Army?</hi> that is, an Armie of Angels. This same also in the same booke is explaned by an other figure,<note place="margin">Cant. 3,</note> when it is said; <hi>Behold Salomons bedde, threescore strong men are rounde about it, of the valiant men of Israell. They all handle the sword, and are expert in warre, euery one hath his sword vpon his thigh, for the feare by night.</hi> What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing is this, then that the holy Ghost by this figure might teach and show, the great care &amp; singuler prouidence, by which God defendeth and watcheth ouer the soules of the righteous? For whence is it (I pray thee) that man being conceaued in sin, liuing in a corrupt flesh, bent to all euill, should passe so many yeeres among so many snares and dangers, without destruction and vtter ruine of himselfe,<note place="margin">God tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils into good, to those who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he loueth.</note> if hee were not preserued &amp; sustay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Diuine prouidence? Which is so great, that it dooth not onely preserue men from euill, but also oftentimes it dooth turne the very euills, into which men fall through carelesnesse and negligence, into a matter of greater good: that is, as often
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:9369:75"/>
as by that they are made more wary, more humble, and more thankfull vnto him, who hath drawne them back from so great danger, and hath pardoned them so great a sinne.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Rom, 8.</note> For this cause the Apostle sayth, <hi>Vnto them that loue God, all things worke together for the best.</hi> If this fauour and friendship be worthy of admiration,<note place="margin">He is not onely good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the righteous, but also to their family Exod. 20.</note> that shall be more worthy, that God doth not onely shew this mercy to his seruants, but also to their sonnes and Nephewes, and to all things, that appertaine vnto them: as God himselfe testifieth, saying; <hi>I am the Lord thy God, a iealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers vpon the children, vpon the third generation, and vpon the fourth of them that hate me: And shewing mercy vnto thousands to them that loue me, and keepe my commaundements.</hi> An example of this we haue in Dauid: for God would not cast off his sonnes in so many ages, although their sinnes had oftentimes deserued it. And that onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Dauid their Father.<note place="margin">Gen. 17, and the 24.</note> The same thing the Lord shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Abraham, when he directed his seruant in his way, and prospered his busines, when his maister had commaunded him, that he should fetch a wife for his sonne Isaack.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:9369:75"/>
but also in many places of the old Testament. For so the Prophet sayth in his Psalmes;<note place="margin">Psal. 103,</note> 
                              <hi>As a Father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that feare him: for he knoweth whereof we be made, he remembreth that we are but dust.</hi> Because it seemed but a small thing to another Prophet, that he should be called a Father, seeing that his loue and prouidence doth exceede the loue of all fathers, he sayth;<note place="margin">Esay, 63.</note> 
                              <hi>Doubtlesse thou art our Father; though Abraham be ignorant of vs, and Israell know vs not.</hi> As if he should say, Those that are fathers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the flesh, are not worthy that name, if they be compared with thee.</p>
                           <p>But because in the loue of parents,<note place="margin">God is more then a mother. Esay, 49.</note> the loue of the mother is commonly wont to be the more vehement and tenderer; the Lord is not content with the name of Father, but will also be called a Mother, and more then a Mother, as he himselfe sayth in Esay, in most sweet words; <hi>Can a woman forget her child, and not haue compassion on the sonne of her wombe? Though they should forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold I haue grauen thee vpon the palme of mine hands: thy wals are euer in my sight.</hi> What words can be spoken with a more tender loue? Who will be so blind, or so blockish, who vnderstanding this, will not reioyce? Who will not be reuiued? Who will not lift vp his head, hearing that he hath such a pledge of the loue and of the diuine prouidence? For he that considereth that it is God that speaketh this, whose truth is for euerlasting, neyther doth he euer deceaue: whose riches haue no end, and whose power is infinite, whom shall he feare? What shall he not hope for? How shall he not reioyce at those words? When he heareth this assurance of his estate? this prouidence? and this certaine demonstration of loue? What? I will yet speake more. For the Lord is not content to haue compared his loue to the common loue of mothers; but hee chooseth one among all other, which excelleth al others in loue, that is the Eagle; with whose loue he compareth his loue and prouidence,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> saying; <hi>As an Eagle prouoking her young ones to flye, fluttereth ouer her birds, stretcheth out her wings, taketh them, and beareth them on her wings.</hi> This same thing the same Prophet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so testifieth in words more cleare, before the people being now ready to enter into the Land of promise: <hi>The Lord thy God hath

                              <note place="margin">God a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour or sheepheard.</note> By the same reason of the diuine prouidence, God after that he had taken vpon him the name of a Father, hee would also be called a Pastour or Sheepheard, as wee may see in the Gospell. That he might declare how farre this pastorall loue, and sheepheardly care doth extend it selfe, hee sayde, <hi>I am the good sheepheard, and know my sheepe, and am knowne of mine.</hi> O Lord how doost thou know them? with what eyes doost thou behold them? <hi>As the Father knoweth me,</hi> sayth he, <hi>so know I the Father.</hi> Which is, with the same eyes that my Father beholdeth me, I behold the Father; and with the same I looke vpon my sheepe. O blessed eyes, ô happy aspect. O supreame proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. What greater glory, what greater treasure, what greater riches can be desired of any one, then with such eyes to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held of the sonne of God; that is, with the same eyes, that the Father beholdeth him? For although this comparison in euery poynt is not equall (for the naturall sonne deserueth more, then the adoptiue) yet great is that glory, that it is worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with this. Yet what ones, and how great the workes and benefits of this prouidence are, God by his Prophet Ezechiell doth most plentifully teach,<note place="margin">Ezechiel. 34</note> in these words; <hi>Behold, I will search my sheepe, and seeke them out. As a sheepheard searcheth out his flocke, when he hath beene among his sheepe that are scattered, so will I seeke out my sheep, and will deliuer them out of all places, where they haue beene scattered in the cloudy and darke day. And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the Countries,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:9369:76"/>
and will bring them to their owne Land, and feede them vpon the mountaines of Israel, by the riuers, and in all the inhabited places of the Countrey. I will feede them in a good pasture, and vpon the high mountaines of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lye in a good fold, and in fat pasture shall they feede vpon the mountaines of Israel. I will feede my sheepe, and bring them to their rest, sayth the Lord God. I will seeke that which was lost, and bring againe that which was driuen away, and will binde vp that which was broken, and will strengthen the weake, but I will destroy the fat and the strong, and I will feede them with iudgment.</hi> And a little after: <hi>And I will make with them a couenant of peace, and will cause the euill beasts to cease out of this Land: and they shall dwel safely in the wildernes, and sleepe in the woods. And I will set them, as a blessing, euen round about my mountaine, and I will cause raine to come downe in due season, and there shall be raine of blessing.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Tell me I pray thee, what could our good sheepheard pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise more? Or how could he describe this his meaning with words more sweet, more louing, or more elegant? For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that God speaketh heere not of a materiall flocke, but of a spirituall, which are men: where-vpon concluding this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he sayth, <hi>And yee my sheepe, the sheepe of my pasture are men:</hi> Neyther promiseth he grosse or aboundance of temporall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings; which are common to good and euill: but aboundance of spirituall graces, and of speciall prouidence, with which the Lord doth gouerne and rule this spirituall flock, as a shepheard, so sayth Esay,<note place="margin">Esay, 40.</note> 
                              <hi>He shall feede his flocke like a sheepheard: he shall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lambs with his arme, and carry them in his bosome, and shall guide them with young.</hi> What I pray thee can be spoken more louingly or more cherishingly? Of the offices and benefits of a sheepheard that whole Psalme speaketh, whose beginning is, <hi>The Lord doth guide me,</hi> for which S. Ierome translateth, <hi>The Lord is my sheepheard.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Diuers names of God.</note> After this beginning, he proceedeth to remember all the duties of a sheepheard, which in this place we will not set downe, because they are in euery place found, and this psalme may be reade of any one. Neyther heere in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will I remember, that as he is called a sheepheard, because he doth feede, so is he called a King, because he doth gouerne and defend; a Maister, because he teacheth; a Phisition, because
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:9369:77"/>
he healeth; a Carier, because he beareth vs in his armes; a Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, because he watcheth for our defence; of which names the Scriptures are full. Among all these names, there is none more louing, which also demonstrateth this prouidence, then the name of a Bride-grome,<note place="margin">God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome. Ierem, 3.</note> by which name in the Canticles, and in other places of Scripture he is called. By thys sweet and louing word, hee inuiteth the soule of a sinner, to call vpon him: <hi>Call mee, and still cry vnto me,</hi> (sayth he, by the Prophet) <hi>Thou art my Father, and the guide of my youth and virginity.</hi> The which name is greatly honoured of the Apostle. For after those words, with which he that was first formed spake to his wife Eue,<note place="margin">Gene, 2.</note> 
                              <hi>Therefore shall a man leaue his Father and his Mother, and shall cleaue to his wife:</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Ephe 5.</note> 
                              <hi>&amp; they shall be one flesh:</hi> the Apostle addeth; <hi>This is a great secrete, but I speake concerning Christ, and concerning the Church.</hi> Which is his Bride, as is euery soule of man placed in the state of grace. What therefore is not to be hoped of him, who hath such a name, as this is? especially, seeing that it is vndoubtedlie true, that this name is not giuen vnto him in vaine, or vvithout reason?</p>
                           <p>But why in searching the Scriptures, doe we seeke for thys name or that,<note place="margin">God all in all.</note> when as all names which promise any good, doe agree to this Lorde: especially, seeing that whosoeuer loueth him, or whosoeuer seeketh him, may finde in him all good that he desireth?<note place="margin">Ambrose of virginitie.</note> Thys is that which Saint Ambrose saith in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Sermon; Christ is all vnto vs: If thou desirest to heale thy wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, he is a Phisition; if thou beest ouer-heated with feauers, he is a fountaine to coole thee; if thou beest burdened with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnes, hee is righteousnesse; if thou neede helpe, hee is strength; if thou fearest death, he is life; if thou desirest heauen, he is the way; if thou hatest darknes, he is light; if thou seekest for meat, he is foode. See (I pray thee my brother) with hovve many names and titles Christ is noted, and set out vnto vs, who notwithstanding, is one in himselfe, and most simple. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he is one in himselfe, yet he is all things in vs, &amp; that for the releeuing of all our necessities, which are innumerable.</p>
                           <p>There should be no end, if I would recite all the authorities of the Scripture, which pertaine to this matter; yet I haue brought a fewe of many, to the comfort of them, who waite &amp;

Can any one think of a greater good in this life, then to haue GOD a Sheepheard, a Phisitian, a Maister, a Supporter or Caryer, a strong vvall, a defence, a garde, and to conclude, a Bridegrome, and all in all?

For to this prouidence it pertayneth, to prouide them of all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:9369:81"/>
to the obtaining of the last end, which is the last perfection and blessednes: by helping them in all their needes, and by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating in their mindes all aptnes, disposition, vertue, &amp; other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, which are requisite vnto that end.</p>
                        <p>Of the number of these, the first is the grace of the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">After the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, the grace of the holy Ghost is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all blessings.</note> which next to that diuine prouidence, is the originall &amp; beginning of all other priuiledges and celestiall gyfts. Thys was the first robe with which the prodigall childe was clothed, after he was receiued into his Fathers house. If thou demaundest of me what this grace is? I answere, that this grace, (according to Diuines) is a participation of the Diuine nature: that is, of sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, goodnes, puritie, and of the noblenesse of God himselfe: by whose helpe &amp; benefit,<note place="margin">What the grace of the holy Ghost is.</note> man doth cast from him all the base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, vildnes, and rudenes, which hee tooke and receiued from Adam; and is made partaker of holinesse, and of the Diuine noblenesse: putting off himselfe, and putting on Iesus Christ. The Fathers show this by the example of yron cast into a fire;<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> which remaineth yron still: yet pertaking of the nature of fire, it is pulled out altogether shyning &amp; glowing, as though it were fire in deede. I say, that the same substance of yron remaineth with the name: but the heate, the splendour or shyning, and all other accidents, are not of the yron, but of the fire. After the same manner grace (which is an heauenly qualitie,<note place="margin">Grace doth deifie.</note> which God infuseth into the soule) hath that admirable vertue and effeca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that it transformeth man into God: after this manner, that still remaining a man, yet hee is made a partaker of the Diuine puritie and noblenesse;<note place="margin">Gala, 2.</note> as he was a partaker, who said; <hi>I doe not now liue, but Christ lyueth in me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, Grace is a supernaturall forme, and diuine, which maketh that a man leades a life co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to the forme,<note place="margin">Grace is a supernatural forme.</note> from which it proceedeth: which also is supernatural &amp; diuine. In which thing, after an admirable manner, shineth the Diuine prouidence: which as it willeth that man should liue a double life,<note place="margin">Two soules of man.</note> naturall and supernatural, so hath it prouided for the same a double forme: which are as it were the two soules of these lifes: one by which we liue this first life, another, by which we liue the other. For euen as from the soule, which is the naturall forme, all the powers and sences doe proceede, by whose help we liue this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:9369:81"/>
naturall life: so from grace, which is the supernaturall forme, al vertues and gyfts of the holy Ghost doe proceede, by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of which we liue a supernaturall life. Therefore this is, as the prouision of two kinde of instruments, by helpe of which, we labour in diuers exercises.</p>
                        <p>Grace is also a spirituall ornament of the soule,<note place="margin">Grace is a spirituall ornament.</note> wrought by the handes of the holy Ghost, which dooth make the soule so beautifull, and so acceptable in the eyes of God, that he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it for his daughter, and for his Bride. Of this ornament the Prophet glorieth,<note place="margin">Esay, 6,</note> saying; <hi>I will reioyce in the Lorde, and my soule shall be glad in my God, because he hath put vpon me the vesture of saluation, he hath couered me with the garment of righteousnes, as a Bridegrome adorned with a crowne, and as a Bride decked vvith Iewells.</hi> Which are all vertues, with all the gyfts of the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">Psalm, 44.</note> with which the soule is adorned at the hands of GOD. Thys is that golden vesture, wrought about with great variety, with which the Queene was clothed, who stoode before the King her Spouse: for from grace, all the colours of all vertues &amp; celestiall habits doe arise, in which the beautie of the Queene consisteth.</p>
                        <p>Of these it is easily gathered what be the effects, which grace worketh in those soules,<note place="margin">1. The worke of grace, maketh a man accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God.</note> wherein it dwelleth. For the speciall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it is, to make a soule so acceptable and beautifull in the eyes of God, that hee taketh her to be his daughter, his spouse, his temple, his dwelling, in which he enioyeth his delights with the sonnes of men. An other effect of it is, not onely to adorne the soule, but also to strengthen it with those vertues, which proceede from it.<note place="margin">2. It streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth man.</note> Which are as the haires of Sampson, in which consisted not onely his beautie, but also his strength. As well from this, as from the former effect of grace, the soule is praised in the Canticles, where the Angels admiring the beautie of it, say;<note place="margin">Cant. 6,</note> 
                           <hi>Who is shee that looketh foorth as the Morning, faire as the Moone, pure as the Sunne, terrible as an Armie with banners?</hi> Wherby we know, that Grace is as a shield couering the whole body, or as a complete Armor, which armeth a man from the head to the foote, and maketh him beautifull and valiant, &amp; so valiant, that, if we beleeue a certaine learned Schoole-man, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grace is sufficient to conquer and ouer-come all the deuills,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:9369:82"/>
with all sinnes that raigne and rule in the world.</p>
                        <p>There is also a third effect of grace, that it maketh the soule so acceptable and excellent in the sight of God,<note place="margin">3. It maketh our works acceptable vnto God.</note> that as manie works as it dooth deliberatiuely and aduisedly, (which are not sinnes) are acceptable vnto him. That not onely the acts of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but also naturall works, as to eate, drinke, sleepe, &amp; such like, are acceptable before the Lord.</p>
                        <p>The fourth effect is, that it maketh vs the sonnes of God by adoption,<note place="margin">4 It adopteth vs to be the sonnes of God.</note> and heyres of the heauenly kingdome, and also wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bee written in the booke of Life, in which all the names of the righteous are written: and by consequent, it giueth vnto vs a lawfull claime and title, to that most rich and heauenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearitance. This is that priuiledge and prerogatiue which our Sauiour praysed so greatly in his Disciples, then, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned merily vnto him,<note place="margin">Luke, 10.</note> saying: <hi>Lord, euen the deuils are subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto vs through thy Name:</hi> to whom our Sauiour answered; <hi>In this reioyce not, that the spirits are subdued vnto you: but rather reioyce because your names are written in heauen.</hi> For it is certaine, that this is the greatest good, that mans hart can thinke vpon, or desire in this life.</p>
                        <p>But that I may speake many things in few words, it is grace that maketh man fitte to all good:<note place="margin">The For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the effects of grace.</note> which maketh the way to heauen plaine before vs: which maketh the yoke of the Lorde, easie and sweet vnto vs: which leadeth man by the way of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: which healeth our weake nature, &amp; maketh all that seeme light vnto vs, which while it was weake, seemed intollerable: it is that, which after an ineffable manner, reformeth and armeth all the powers and faculties of our soules, &amp; that by the meanes of those vertues, which proceede from it: it enlightneth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, it inflameth our will, it strengtheneth our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, it tempereth and moderateth our part concupiscible, least it runne into all euil: it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth the part irascible, least it be slow &amp; too sluggish to work well. Moreouer, because all our natural passions, which are found in these two inferiour powers of our appetite are as it were step-dames vnto vertue, &amp; dores, wherby deuils oftentimes enter into our soules, it hath appointed, as it were Sentinels in each of these parts, which watch and keepe it: that is, a certaine infused vertue, comming from aboue, vvhich
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:9369:82"/>
doth helpe man, and maketh him secure in danger, which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by meanes of those passions. So to defend the soule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the appetite of gluttonie, it sendeth Temperance: to defend it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lust of the flesh, it sendeth Chastitie, and to defend it from ambition, it sendeth Humilitie, and so in the rest.</p>
                        <p>But there is one thing,<note place="margin">Grace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth our soules the dwelling &amp; temple of God.</note> which exceedeth all the fore-sayde, that is, that grace maketh God to dwell in our soule, that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in it, he may gouerne it, defend it, direct it in the heauenly way: God therefore sitteth in our soule as a King in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; as a Captayne among his armie; as a Maister in his schoole: and as a Pastour among his flocke, that there he may exercise, and vndergoe spiritually all these offices, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster all prouidence. Goe to therefore if this precious pearle, out of which so many good things come, be a perpetuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion vnto Vertue, who will not willingly imitate that wise Merchant in the Gospell, who sold all that he had, that he might buy this alone?</p>

The reason is,<note place="margin">The first reason.</note> because it is a function and duty of grace to heale and recure nature beeing weake, feeble, and decayed. Euen as therefore it healeth the appetite and will weakened through sinne,<note place="margin">It is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of grace to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</note> so also it recureth the vnderstanding, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly obscured and darkned by the same sinne: that by this benefit the vnderstanding may know, what it ought to doe; and by the will there may be ability &amp; power to doe, that which now it vnderstandeth is needefull for to be done. Not vnlike to this is that Saint Gregory hath in his Morals; Not to be able
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:9369:83"/>
to fulfill that which man vnderstoode, was a punishment of sinne: as also that was a punishment of the same, not to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that.<note place="margin">Psal 27.</note> Therefore sayd the Prophet; <hi>The Lord is my light,</hi> against ignorance, <hi>and my saluation,</hi> against impotencie. In one is signified what is to be desired, in the other strength is giuen, by which we may attaine vnto it. And so as well this as that pertayneth to the same grace. Hence it is that besides fayth and prudence infused, which enlighten our vnderstanding, that it may vnderstand, what it ought to beleeue, what also to doe, the gifts of the holy Ghost doe increase also in vs,<note place="margin">Foure gifts of the holy Ghost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</note> foure of which pertaine to the vnderstanding; that is, the gift of wisedome, which is giuen for the knowledge of high and lofty matters; the gift of Science, which is giuen, that wee may vnderstand lower matters; the gift of vnderstanding, by which we come to the knowledge of the misteries of God, and to the congruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and beauty of them; and the gift of counsaile and aduice, by whose helpe we know the actions of this life, and how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne and rule, whatsoeuer happeneth to vs in it. All these beames come from the splendour of grace onely, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called in the holy Scriptures,<note place="margin">Grace why it is called an Vnction.</note> an Annointing or Vnction. <hi>For it teacheth all things,</hi> as Saint Iohn speaketh. Wherefore, euen as oyle among all liquid substances, is the fittest to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue light, and to cure wounds: so this diuine Vnction doth cure the wounds of our will, and doth illuminate the darknes of our vnderstanding. This is that most precious oyle, better then all oyle;<note place="margin">Psal. 23.</note> of which the kingly Prophet speaketh; <hi>Thou hast an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted mine head with oyle.</hi> It is certaine that he speaketh heere not of a materiall head, nor of materiall oyle, but of a spirituall head, that is, of the superiour part of our soule, in which our vnderstanding is, as very well sheweth a learned man, wryting vpon this place: and of spirituall oyle, which is the light of the holy Ghost, by which our lampe is preserued, that it is not put out. Of the light of this holy oyle this good King had much, who thus speaketh of himselfe;<note place="margin">Psal, 51.</note> 
                           <hi>Thou hast taught me wisedome in the secret of mine hart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The second reason.</note> An other reason may be also giuen of this. For seeing that it is the office of grace, to make a man endued with Vertue; it cannot execute this, vnlesse first it moue a man to sorrow and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:9369:83"/>
repentance of his former life, and stirre vp the feare of God in him. Vnlesse before it worketh, that man doth deadly hate sinne, and desire heauenly blessings with great feruency, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together contemne these worldly vanities. But the will cannot obtayne these and the like, vnlesse before it hath the light of vnderstanding, and a knowledge proportionable, by which the will may be stirred vp.<note place="margin">The will is a blind fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</note> For the will is a blind faculty, which is not mooued except the vnderstanding goe before, carrying a light, and shewing good and euill in all things, that the affection towards them may encrease or decrease. Hence it is, that Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas sayth, euen as the loue of God doth encrease in the soule of a righteous man: so also encreaseth the knowledge of the goodnes, fauour, and beauty of the same God, and that by an equall proportion: that if one of them encrease an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth degrees, so many also encreaseth the other. For hee that loueth much, he vnderstandeth many causes of loue in the thing beloued; but he that loueth little, vnderstandeth but few. And that which is cleerely vnderstoode of the loue of God, this also is vnderstoode of feare, hope, and of the hatred of sinne. From which men would no more abhorre, then from other things, vnlesse they vnderstood that it was an euill, then which nothing in this world is more worthy of horror and execration.</p>
                        <p>Seeing therefore that the holy Ghost willeth that these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects should be in the soule of a righteous man, he willeth also that there should be causes in it, from whence they may come. As hee willeth that there should be diuersity of effects in the earth, so also he willeth that diuers causes and celestiall influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces should be wrought in it. Furthermore, seeing that it is true, as we before haue proued, that God doth dwell by grace in the soules of the righteous; and that God is light, <hi>Enlightning euery man that commeth into the world,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Iohn, 1.</note> as Saint Iohn sayth; it is not to be doubted, that by how much the soule is purer and cleaner, by so greater a clearenes the beames of the diuine light doe shine in it.<note place="margin">God is the Glasse of a purified soule.</note> Wherefore Saint Augustine calleth God the Glasse of a purified soule: for hee maketh it shine with the beames of his light, teaching it all things, which are necessary to saluation. What meruaile is it, that he doth bestow this benefit vpon men, who hath not denied such a like thing to lower and more inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:9369:84"/>
creatures, which by the instinct of the Authour of nature know all things,<note place="margin">God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to beasts, to flie hurtfull things, &amp; to embrace wholsome,</note> which belong to theyr preseruation? Who hath taught the beasts among so many kinde of herbes, which grow in the fieldes, to knowe which are wholesome, and which are hurtfull? To feede vpon these, and to leaue the other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched? To know also what creature is enemy vnto them, &amp; what is a friend? To flie a Wolfe, &amp; followe a dogge? It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that they haue learned this of none other, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lord. If therefore God hath infused thys knowledge into vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, that they might be preserued in theyr naturall life, how much more ought hee to prouide for the righteous, that they may haue greater knowledge, whereby they may bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in a spirituall life? For thys is no lesse necessary for men, by reason of those things that be aboue nature, then those things are for beasts, which concerne their nature. For if the Diuine prouidence hath beene so carefull to prouide things of nature, how much more shall it be carefull for those things, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to grace? vvhich by howe much they bee more excellent, by so much they exceede the powers and faculties of humane wit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What thys supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is.</note> This example not onely proueth that there is such a light of the vnderstanding, but also it sheweth what it is: for it is not a knowledge so speculatiue as actiue, not so contemplatiue as practike: neither is it giuen, that we may vnderstand, but that we might worke: not that wee should bee subtile and wittie in disputing, but industrious and laborious in working. Therfore, not onely it remaineth in the vnderstanding, as Sciences got in Schooles; but by the power of it, it moueth the vvill, inclyning it to all that, to which such kinde of knowledge dooth prouoke and excite. For it is the proper instinct of the holy Ghost, who as a most perfect maister, teacheth his very often with this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, all that which it behoueth them to knowe. Thys the Bride confesseth in the Canticles;<note place="margin">Cant, 5.</note> 
                           <hi>My soule,</hi> sayth shee, <hi>melted within me, after that my beloued spake.</hi> By which sentence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, what is the difference betweene this learning, and that, which is deliuered in schooles: for that onely enlightneth the vnderstanding, but this moueth the will also, and delighteth it, and by her vertue doth pierce all the corners of our soules, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:9369:84"/>
and effecting all that, which pertaineth to the reformation of them:<note place="margin">Heb. 4,</note> as the Apostle declareth, when he saith; <hi>The Word of God is liuely, and mighty in operation, and sharper then any two ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged sword, and entereth through, euen vnto the deuiding a sunder of the soule and the spirit, and of the ioynts and the marrow.</hi> For it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a diuision betweene the part animall of a man, and the part spirituall: seperating the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other, dissoluing that most dangerous bond of friendship, which was wont to be between the flesh and the spirit: for when the spirit is mingled with the flesh, it is made one with it: which bond is dissolued by the word of God, making, that a man lyueth a spirituall life, and no more a carnall.</p>
                        <p>Thys therefore is one of the especiall effects of the Diuine grace: one also of the especiall priuiledges, in which those that are endued with vertue, doe ioy in this world. But (although those things which we haue spoken of, be sufficiently proued of vs) least any man be so carnall, that hee should complaine, that these things are obscure to be vnderstood,<note place="margin">Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Scripture as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Iohn, 14. Iohn, 6,</note> and hard to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I will confirme them with most euident testimonies, as wel of the olde Testament as of the new. In the new Testament Saint Iohn telleth, that Christ sayd at his last supper; <hi>The holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, which I haue told you.</hi> And in another place: <hi>It is written in the Prophets; and they shall be all taught of God.</hi> As if hee should say, the time shall be, when as men euery where shall bee taught of God. <hi>Euery man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, commeth vnto me.</hi> The same the Lord promiseth by the Prophet Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; <hi>I will giue my law into their bowels,</hi> (and that which before was written in tables of stone) <hi>I will write in their harts:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ierem. 31,</note> So that all men are to be taught of the Lord. The Lord in like manner willing to shew how great the maiesty, glory, and prosperity of the Church should be, thus among other things he speaketh in Esay:<note place="margin">Esay, 54.</note> 
                           <hi>O thou afflicted, and tossed with tempest, that hast no comfort, behold, I will lay thy stones with the Carbunkle, &amp; lay thy foundation with Saphirs, and I will make thy windowes of Emerauds, and thy gates shining stones, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.

                        <p>Of this which hath beene spoken, we may easily know that there be two kindes of sciences; one of the Saints, another of Wise-men, one of the Righteous, another of the Doctours.

                           <note place="margin">Prou. 9.</note> Because science consisteth onely in the vnderstanding, and belongeth vnto contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but it is the property of prudence to wish the best things,<note place="margin">In the first booke of his great Morals, chap. 34.</note> and to choose and doe them, sayth Aristotle. And it is required not that we may know, what things be right, but that we may become honest and righteous. How often doe wee finde this wisedome promised vnto vs in the Psalmes?

Which knowledge the same Prophet oftentimes calleth the foode of the soule, sometimes the water of refreshing, a table prepared against his enemies.

For in these he showeth, how great the beauty of vertues be, and howe great the filthines of vices are: how great the vanity of the world is, how great the dignity of grace is, the greatnes of glory, the

But because heere wee doe rather speake of the priuiledges and prerogatiues, which vertues bring with them, then of the vertues themselues; Charitie being the Prince of all vertues: we will not heere speake of it, although it also might be referred to thys order, and our purpose, not as a vertue, but as an admirable gyft, which God is wont to giue to those that apply themselues to the studie of Vertue: and that which after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ineffable manner inflameth the inmost part of our will, &amp; inclineth it to loue God aboue all things, which may be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Which loue, the more perfect it is, the more sweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightsome it is. For thys cause, not vnfitly it may be inserted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this number as a fruite, or a reward, as well of other vertues, as of it selfe. Notwithstanding that I may not seeme an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and too curious a prayser and commender of vertues, of which so many and so great things may bee spoken, I will sette in the fourth place the ioy of the holy Ghost, which is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall proprietie of the same charitie, and one of the especial fruits of the holy Ghost, as Saint Paule testifieth, writing to the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians. For euen as we said a little before, that light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which God doth bestow vpon his friends, not onely doth
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:9369:88"/>
sticke in the vnderstanding, but also doth descend to the will, where it doth diffuse her beames, and disperse her brightnes; so that the minde is made glad, and reioyceth in the Lord after a certaine ineffable manner. In so much, as the naturall light sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from her heate, which we feele: so this light being spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, doth beget in the soule of a righteous man that spirituall ioy, of which we speake; according to that of the Prophet, <hi>Light is sowne for the righteous,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psal. 97.</note> 
                           <hi>and ioy for the vpright in hart.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This matter is so plentifull and copious, that neuer too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges may be spoken of it. But for the purpose of this booke, it shall be worth the labour to show, how great this ioy is: for the knowledge of this greatnes is very profitable, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie forcible to draw the minds of men to the loue of Vertue. For no man is ignorant, that as all kinde of euils are found in vices;<note place="margin">Euill men thinke that there is no pleasure in Vertue.</note> so all kinde of good things, as well honest as profitable, are perfectly to be found in vertues, onely pleasure excepted, which naughty and wicked men deny to be in vertues. Seeing that therefore mans hart desireth nothing so much as pleasures, these men say (at least their works speake, if not their words) that they had rather haue pleasure vnperfect, then that which wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth pleasure, with all her perfections and prerogatiues. This is that Lactantins Firmianus sayd in times past, Because, sayth he, bitternernes is mixed with vertues, and vices are seasoned with pleasures: and men eschew bitternes, and are inticed with the sweetnes of pleasures; many forsaking vertues, with great earnestnes follow after vices. This is one, and the onely cause of so great a mischiefe, and hee that shall bring men from this perillous errour, he shall not bestow a small benefit vpon them, and he that shall prooue by most euident arguments, that the way of vertue is much more playner and sweeter then the way of vices, he shall mightily helpe them. This is that wee would now prooue and demonstrate with most firme arguments and clearer then any light, especially with the authorities of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Scripture, seeing that they are more certaine and sound proofes, then those which may be brought for this matter from any other place.

                           <hi>They shall be satisfied and drunke with the fatnes of thine house, and thou shalt giue them drinke out of the riuer of thy pleasures.</hi> With what other words could the Prophet haue more cunningly or liuely depainted, and expressed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of these delicates, calling them drunkennes and a riuer of pleasures, that hee might shew the force and efficacie, which

For the nouelty of that knowledge doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in them exceeding admiration and loue, ioyned with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible sweetnes and gratitude, which they exhibite vnto him, of whom they haue receaued so great good things, and of whom they are deliuered and freed out of so great darknes.<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> We see by experience that a man, when he entreth into any famous Citty, or royall Pallace, the first day he walketh wondering, his minde hanging in suspence by reason of the nouelty of things, that there he seeth: but when hee hath stayed longer in that place, and hath seene the same things oftner, that admiration is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and that pleasure lesned, with which hee did see them at first.

For the more euident vnderstanding of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, wee must know that the Diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, (which bountifully prouideth, that all the creatures haue those things that are necessary for their preseruation and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) when it willeth that a reasonable creature should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, hath prouided most plentifully and copiously, that not any of those things should be wanting, which belong vnto his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. And because the perfection of this creature, consisteth in the perfection of his vnderstanding and will, which are two of the chiefest and principallest faculties of our soule, one of which is perfected by Science,<note place="margin">In what thing consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of man.</note> the other by Vertue, God hath created vniuersall principles of all sciences in our vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, whence theyr conclusions proceede: and in the vvill hee hath ordained a seminary or seede plotte of all vertues: for hee hath put in it a certaine naturall inclination to all good, and a dread or horrour of that which is euill: so that the vvill natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reioyceth in the one, and is heauy in the other, murmuring against that, as against a thing which it naturally abhorreth.</p>
                        <p>Which inclination is so naturall, and so effectuall, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by chaunce it be weakened through a daily custome of ill liuing, yet it cannot vtterly perrish or altogether be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. We haue a figure of this in the booke of Iob; in each of the calamities and losses of this man of God, alwayes there was a seruant remaining, which brought him word of the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and misery. After the same manner this seruant is neuer wanting, nor euer leaueth him who sinneth. The Doctors doe name this seruant, the Keeper or Watcher ouer the conscience,

which in all shypwracks escapeth safe, and among all the dead, it onely dieth not, which ceaseth not to present before the eyes of the wicked, the good which they haue omitted, vvhen they sinned, and the euill which they haue committed. In vvhich thing, the care and loue of the Diuine prouidence, shineth with a wonderfull beautie, by which it loueth &amp; embraceth vertue, after that it hath appointed for her a perpetuall stirrer vp, that she sleep not; a perpetuall Preacher that neuer keepeth silence, and a maister, who alwaies directeth her to all good.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Esay, 14,</note> For by the iust iudgement of God, the hart of the wicked, which heere is vnderstood by Babilon, is giuen into the power of the Hedghog, that thornie and pricking creature, that is, into the handes of the deuill, and also into the power of the thornes and pricks of the conscience, which sinnes doe bring with them: which as sharpe thornes and needles, doe thrust through and rent the hart of man.

                           <note place="margin">The thyrd thorne.</note> Infamie is another thorne, which followeth sin, whicha sinner knoweth of will he nill he; and therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but grieue: for naturally men wish well vnto themselues, &amp; are afflicted with the contrary.<note place="margin">Seneca in his 3. booke of benefits, chap. 17. Certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thorns.</note> For there is not a more grieuous punishment, as a certaine Wiseman sayth, then publique hate. An other thorne is the necessarie feare of death, the incertainty of life, the feare of rendering an account, and the dread &amp; hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of euerlasting punishment. Euery one of these are seuerall thornes, which grieuously pierce and prick the hart of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly: insomuch, that as often as the memory of death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, on one side so certaine, on the other so incertaine, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be sadde and heauy, as saith Ecclesiasticus. For he seeth that day, which shall auenge all his iniquitie, and bring an end to his vices and pleasures.

                        <p>Hence it is,<note place="margin">The feare of an euil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</note> that being in any dangerous estate, hee quaketh and trembleth through feare, being doubtfull whether he shall die, or not, for the vehemencie of his owne loue, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of feare, maketh him to feare a shadow, and to dread, where there is no such cause. Therefore, if in the Land destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and common infirmities doe arise, as the plague, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, thunder and lightning, a sinner straight-waies feareth, and is troubled, and is altered through the feare of an euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, perswading himselfe that these shall light vppon him.

All these thornes together pricke, goare and thrust through the harts of wicked men, as very largely remembreth one of Iobs friends,<note place="margin">Iob, 15,</note> 
                           <hi>The wicked man,</hi> sayth he, <hi>is continually as one that trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth of child, and the number of yeeres is hid from the Tyrant: A sounde of feare is in his eares, and in his prosperitie the destroyer shal come vpon him.</hi> Thys sounde, is the clamors and cryes of an ill conscience, which continually biteth and accuseth him: in the midst of peace hee feareth the deceits of his enemies, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he lyueth peaceably, and content with that hee hath, yet the feare of an euill conscience is neuer absent. <hi>Hee beleeueth not that he may returne out of darknes into light:</hi> that is, he cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that it is possible, that at any time he should be freed from the darknes of thys miserable estate in which he liueth, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that peace and tranquilitie of a good conscience, which as a most pleasant light reioyceth, and illuminateth all the corners of the soule. <hi>Hee seeth the sword on euery side of him,</hi> which vvay soeuer he turneth his eyes, he seeth a naked sword before hym, insomuch, that <hi>when he mooueth himselfe to gette his bread,</hi> when he sitteth at the table, where men are wont to be most merry, a thousand feares are present with him, for <hi>he knoweth that the day of darknes is prepared at hand:</hi> that is, of death, iudgement, and definitiue or finall sentence, insomuch that <hi>Affliction and anguish shall make him afraid: they shall preuaile against him as a King rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to the battell,</hi> foote-men and horse-men, shall hemme him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.</p>
                        <p>After this manner thys friend of Iob doth describe the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell torment, which those miserable and wretched men do suffer in their harts. For feare, as the Phylosopher sayth, dooth vvaite vpon the wicked, by the Diuine dispensation. Not vnlike to thys, is that of Salomon, <hi>The wicked flieth, when no man pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>

                           <hi>but the righteous is confident as a Lyon, and without feare.</hi> Saint Augustine comprehendeth all this in few words; Thou hast commaunded ô Lord, and truly it is so, that euery inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate soule should be a punishment vnto it selfe. That for the most part is seene in all things.<note place="margin">All disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are euil. Similitudes.</note> For what is found in the vvorld inordinate or disordered, which naturally is not vnquiet, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and restlesse? Bones out of ioynt, &amp; remoued from theyr naturall place, what griefes doe they bring? That element that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:9369:98"/>
is without his Spheare, what violence doth it suffer? the humors of mans body when they exceede their quantity, and naturall temperature, what infirmities doe they not bring? Seeing that therefore it is so proper vnto a reasonable creature to liue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and according to reason, if hee whose life is out of order and square, his nature doth suffer and is tormented: Not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause, sayth Iob, <hi>Who hath resisted God, and hath had peace?</hi> Saint Gregory hath commented vpon these words thus, Hee who wonderfully hath created all things,<note place="margin">Gregory in the 9. booke of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. cap. 2.</note> he hath ordayned that the things he hath created should agree within themselues. He inferreth out of this, that as often as the Creator is resisted, so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that agreement of peace is dissipated and broken: because, sayth he, they cannot be orderly, who loose the disposition of the high gouernment. For they that are subiect to God, cannot remaine in quiet, if they suffer confusion in themselues: because they finde no peace in themselues, they resist and contradict that which commeth from aboue from the Author of peace. So that high Angelicall spirit, who beeing subiect vnto God, might haue continued in his high estate, suffered the repulse &amp; foyle of himselfe: because through the vnquietnes of his owne nature he wandred out of himselfe, and out of his order. So the first parent of mankinde, because he resisted the precept of his founder and Author, hee presently felt the contumely of his owne flesh: and because he would not by obedience be subiect to his Creator, he was prostrated and cast downe vnder him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and forth-with lost the peace of his body. This saith Saint Gregory.</p>
                        <p>That therefore is a torment, in which the wicked liue by the iust iudgement of God: and it is not the least misery of those punishments, which they suffer in this world. Almost all the Fathers of the Church doe testifie as much, and among others Saint Ambrose;<note place="margin">Ambrose of duties.</note> vvhat greater punishment, sayth hee, then the wound of the inward conscience? Is not this more to be flyed then death? then losse? then banishment? then sicknes? then sorrow? Isidore sayth, A man may flie all things, but his owne hart:<note place="margin">Isidor. in Syn.</note> for he cannot depart or leaue himselfe; for whether so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he goeth, the guiltines of his conscience doth not leaue him. And in an other place; No punishment is more greeuous, then
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:9369:99"/>
the punishment of conscience.<note place="margin">In the 2. booke of his Solilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies.</note> But wilt thou neuer be sad or heauy, liue well. A secure and safe minde doth lightly sustaine sadnes. A good life hath alwayes ioy: but a guilty conscience is alwayes in torment. A guilty minde is neuer secure; for an euill mind is tortured with the stings and pricks of the conscience. This is so true, that also the very Ethnick Philosophers not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, or beleeuing the punishments, by which our faith punisheth wicked men, through all theyr works haue confessed the same thing.<note place="margin">Seneca E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist 43.</note> Heare Seneca; vvhat profiteth to hide thy selfe, and flie the eyes and eares of men? A good conscience cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth company together, but an ill conscience is fearefull, and trembleth in solitarines. If the things that thou doost be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, let all men know: if vnhonest, what skilleth it if no man know? O thou wretch and miserable, if thou contemnest this witnes; for thy conscience, (as it is in the Prouerb,) is a thousand witnesses. The same Author sayth also in another place, The greatest punishment that sinne can be punished with,<note place="margin">In his book of manners.</note> is, to haue committed it. In another place repeating the same thing, Feare (sayth hee) no man more, that knoweth of thy sinnes, then thy selfe.

In his booke also of Catechizing the ignorant, hee sayth thus, Thou who seekest for true rest (which after this life is promised to Christians) heere thou mayst also tast of it sweetly, amongst the most bitter troubles of this lyfe, if thou shalt loue his commaundements, who hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it.

And more to be desired then gold, yea, then
much fine gold: sweeter also then honey, and the honey combe.</hi> But how the kingly Prophet was delighted in keeping the commaundements of the Lord, he testifieth of himselfe in another Psalme, saying; <hi>I haue had as great delight in the way of thy testimonies,</hi>

This is one of the chiefest iewels &amp; treasuries of a Christian life: thys is the possession and patrimony of the sonnes of God; thys is the safe and secure hauen, &amp; true remedy of all the miseries of this lyfe. But we must heere note (least perhaps wee be deceiued) that as there be two kindes of fayth, one dead, which bringeth foorth no fruite, and thys is the fayth of euill and wicked Christians: the other is a liuely fayth, full of charitie, and fruitfull vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good worke, which the righteous haue, which leadeth vnto life:<note place="margin">Hope two fold.</note> so also there are two kindes of Hope or Confidence, one dead, which gyueth not life vnto the soule, neither strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it with her workes, neither comforteth it in tribulations. Such is the hope which the wicked glory in. The other is a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hope (as the Apostle Peter calleth it) which as it is a thing that hath life,<note place="margin">1, Peter, 1,</note> so also it bringeth foorth the effects and fruites of lyfe: which are to rayse vp the minde, to comfort, to reioyce it, and to support it in that way, which leadeth to heauen, and to recreate, refresh, and encourage it in the troubles of this world: as that holy woman Susanna was strengthened and refreshed, of whom it is written, that beeing already condemned, when she was led to the place of execution, where she should haue beene stoned to death, she was not discouraged, <hi>but shee hoped in God, and her hart had sure affiance in the Lord.</hi> Such was the hope of Dauid,<note place="margin">Psalm, 119,</note> when he sayd; <hi>O thinke vpon thy seruant as concerning thy

                        <p>Of these effects the first is, that it strengtheneth a man in the way of Vertue,<note place="margin">Effects of true hope. 1.</note> through the hope of a rewarde: for the more sure and certaine he hath the pledge and pawne of this reward, by so much more cheerefully he runneth thorowe whatsoeuer tribulations of this world, as all the holy Doctors of the Church confesse with one mouth. Hope, sayth Saint Gregory, dooth rayse vp the soule vnto eternitie,<note place="margin">Gregory in the 6. booke of his Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</note> and therefore it feeleth no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, which it outwardly beareth.

Vpon the 12. Psalme.</note> Saint Ambrose dooth subscribe vnto this: Hope of profit, saith he, dooth steale away our labours, and doth hide the feare of danger. Of the same minde is Saint Ierome; All labour, and euery worke, sayth he, is wont to become easie, and to be made light,<note place="margin">Ierom in an Epistle.</note> when the reward of it is thought vpon: and the hope of reward, is the solace and comfort of the labour.</p>

Of all these wee haue most certaine, and most euident pledges and gages of holy Scriptures: but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Dauids Psalmes. For there is scarcely found any psalme, which doth not commend vnto vs this vertue, and which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth not vnto vs, the most noble fruites of it. For without all doubt hope is a most rich treasury, &amp; a very great consolation, which the righteous haue in this world.

                        <p>In the second booke of the Chronicles, a certaine Prophet sayth to King Asa;<note place="margin">2, Chro. 16.</note> 
                           <hi>The eyes of the Lorde behold all the earth, to strengthen them, that with a perfect hart beleeue and hope in him.</hi> Ieremie speaketh thus of thys hope;<note place="margin">Lamen. 3,</note>

place is vnderstood, the tranquilitie &amp; inward rest of the soule, in the midst of tribulations: which is the effect of hope, which hurleth and casteth foorth all carefulnesse, and inordinate anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, by that fauour which it expecteth of the Diuine mercie.

                           <hi>beleeue in him, and yee shall not be frustrated of your reward. Ye that feare God, hope in him, and mercy shall come vnto you for pleasure.

                           <hi>Put thy trust in God with all thy hart, and leane not vnto thine owne wit.

                           <note place="margin">Psalm, 31,</note> He saith also in another psalme, <hi>My trust hath beene in the Lord: I will be gladde and reioyce in thy mercie.</hi> The effect of thys hope, the same man declareth, when he sayth;<note place="margin">Psalm, 32,</note>

In another psalme he teacheth the same thing more at large:<note place="margin">Psalm, 40</note> 
                           <hi>I waited patiently,</hi> saith he, <hi>for the Lord, and he enclined vnto mee, and heard my calling. He brought mee also out of the horrible pitte, out of the mire and Clay: and sette my feete vpon the Rocke, and ordered my goings. And hee hath put a newe song in my mouth: euen a thanks-giuing vnto our GOD. Many shall see it and feare: and shall put theyr trust in the the Lord. Blessed is the man that hath set his hope in the Lorde, and turned not vnto the proude, and to such as goe about with lies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>All these be the words of the Prophet, in which hee also <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> sheweth another effect of this Vertue; that is, the mouth and eyes of man are opened, that hee may know by experience the goodnes and fatherly prouidence of God. It is also a singuler <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> fruite of hope, that wee are not onely deliuered from dangers;
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:9369:103"/>
but also that there is a new prayse and a new thanksgiuing put into our mouthes, which the Prophet insinuateth, when hee sayth; <hi>And he hath put a new song in my mouth, &amp;c.</hi> He calleth it a new song, which is sung for a new deliuerance, with an vnusu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and new affection of mirth. We shal not easily end this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if wee should alledge all the verses, and sometimes whole Psalmes, written of this matter. For the ninety and one Psalm, and the hundreth and fiue and twenty are wholy imployed in commending this vertue vnto vs, and to describe the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fruites of it, which they enioy and ioy in, who haue theyr trust and confidence in the Lord, and dwell vnder his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Saint Bernard writing vpon the ninth verse of the former Psalme:<note place="margin">Bernard in his 9, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vpon the Psalme, Who dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</note> 
                           <hi>Because thou ô Lord art my hope</hi>: he sayth; Whatsoeuer therefore is to be done, whatsoeuer is to be eschewed, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is to be borne, whatsoeuer is to be wished, ô Lord, thou art my hope. This is the onely cause of all my promises, this is the whole reason of mine expectation. Let one pretend merit, let him boast that he hath borne the heate of the day, let him say that he hath fasted twice a weeke, lastly let him brag that hee is not like other men: but it is good for mee to cleaue vnto the Lord; and to put my trust in my Lord God. If rewards be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised me, I will hope that I shall obtaine them by thee; if wars rise against me, if the world rageth, if the wicked fret and sume, if the flesh lust against the spirit, yet I will trust in thee. For to what end are we wise, if we doe not sticke and cleaue with all feruour and deuotion of soule and spirit to this solide, sound, perfect, and blessed hope, and cast away all other miserable, vaine, vnprofitable, and seducing hopes? A little after the same mellifluous Doctour by way of Dialogue, doth thus reason: Fayth sayth;<note place="margin">In his 20. Sermon vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Psalm.</note> Great and inestimable blessings are prepared of God, for those that serue him: Hope sayth; those are kept for me: Charity sayth; I runne vnto them.</p>
                        <p>Behold my brother, thou doost see how great be the fruites of this vertue,<note place="margin">A Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the effects of hope.</note> and profitable for what. Hope is as a safe Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to which the righteous direct theyr course, so often as any storme of the world rageth: it is as a most strong shield, vpon which all the darts of our enemies are receaued without any wound: it is as a Store-house for foode, whether in the time of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:9369:103"/>
famine, all the poore may come, &amp; haue bread. It is that taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, couer, and shadow, which the Lord doth promise in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, that hee will be to his elect a shadow to defend them from the heate of the day, and a defence from the stormy tempest and from raine. That is, a safegard from all the aduersity and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the world, To conclude, it is the medicine, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon remedy of all our euils, and encumbrances. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that whatsoeuer we hope for of God iustly, faithfully, and wisely, we shall obtaine it, if it be conducent and appertayning to our saluation.<note place="margin">Cyprian in an Epistle to Don.</note> Therfore Cyprian calleth the mercy of God, a fountaine or vvell of all blessings, that cannot be drawne dry, and our hope and trust a bucket or vessell, in which those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings are receaued: and he sayth that according to the quantity of the vessell, so is the proportion of the remedy. For in respect of the fountaine, the water of mercy neuer fayleth. The Lord sayd to the children of Israel, <hi>All the places that the soles of your feete shall tread vpon,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Iosua, 1.</note> 
                           <hi>haue I giuen you</hi>: So also all the mercy, vpon which man shall set his foote, shall be his. Like to this is that; <hi>He that taketh his motion, or is moued of the Lord, hee will hope all things, neyther shall he be frustrated of his hope.</hi> Whereby it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that this hope is an imitation of the vertue and diuine power,<note place="margin">Bernard in his 85. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vpon the Cant. Hope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> redounding to the glory of the same God. Bernard was not ignorant of this, when hee sayd; Nothing doth make the omnipotency of the word more cleare, then that it doth make all them omnipotent, who hope in him. Wilt thou know that this is true; did not he pertake of the omnipotency of God, who being vpon the earth, commaunded the Sun, that it should stand still in the midst of heauen, and that it should not hasten to runne his course, for the space of a day? And an other, who gaue a wish to King Ezechias,<note place="margin">4, Kings, 20.</note> whether he would that the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Sunne should goe forwards ten degrees, or returne backe so many? This is that, that after a singuler manner illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strateth the glory of the Lord, when we see his seruants so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull. For if that proude King of the Assirians glorified in that,<note place="margin">Esay, 10.</note> that Kings, as himselfe, serued him: how much more shall the Lord our God glory, that after a certaine manner all they are Gods, that serue him; after they haue participated of his power?</p>

                           <p>THis then is the treasury of Hope, which the righteous pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse in this life, and to which there is no accesse for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. For although they also haue hope, yet they haue not a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, but a dead hope. For sinne taketh away the life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theyr hope worketh not in them those effects, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we haue remembred. For as there is nothing to be found, which more reuiueth hope, then a good conscience: so the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest cause which maketh it to faile, and killeth this hope, is an euill conscience. For that alwayes flyeth and feareth the light, and maketh a man faint-harted and of feeble courage: for he is not ignorant that the gate of the diuine fauour &amp; grace is shut against him. Hence it is, that as a shadow doth alwayes follow the body, so feare and desperation in all places and at all times, doe wayte vpon an ill conscience. It appeareth then that such is the trust and hope of the wicked, as their felicity and happines is: for as their felicity is in the goods of this world, so in them is their hope and trust; seeing that they glory in them, and in the time of tribulation runne vnto them, as to a Sanctuary or a place of refuge. Of this hope it is written in the booke of Wisedom; <hi>The hope of the vngodly is like a dry thistle flowre,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Wisdom. 5.</note>

Neyther onely is this hope vaine, but it is very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, deceitfull, and dangerous: as the Lord God admonisheth by the mouth of the Prophet;<note place="margin">Esay, 30.</note> 
                              <hi>Alas for those disobedient children</hi> (that is, who haue forsaken their father) <hi>sayth the Lord, that they will take counsaile, and not of me, that they will take a secret aduice, and not out of my spirit, and therefore adde they sinne vnto sinne. Euen they that walke to goe downe into Egipt, and haue asked no question at my mouth, but seeke strength in the might of Pharao, and trust in the shadow of Egipt. Therefore shall the strength of Pharao be your confusion, and the trust in the shadow of Egipt your shame. They were ashamed of the people that could doe them no good, and that might not helpe them, nor shew them any profit, but were their confusion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke.</hi> All these be the words of Esay. Neyther content with
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:9369:104"/>
these he proceedeth in the next Chapter:<note place="margin">Chapter, 31</note> 
                              <hi>Woe vnto them that goe downe into Egipt for helpe, and trust in Horses, and put their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Charrets, because they be many: and in Horse-men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they be lusty and strong: but they regard not the holy one of Israell, and they aske no question at the Lord. And he neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse is wise, and will plague the wicked, and goeth not from his word, he will arise against the houshold of the froward, and against the help of euill doers. Now the Egiptians are men, and not God, and theyr Horses flesh, and not spirit: and as soone as the Lord stretcheth out his hand, then shall the helper fall, and he that should haue beene hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and they shall altogether be destroyed.</hi>

                              <hi>O put not your trust in Princes, nor in any child of man: for there is no help in them. For when the breath of man goeth forth, he shall turne againe to his earth, and then all his thoughts perrish. Blessed is he that hath the God of Iacob for his helpe: and whose hope is in the Lord his God, which made heauen and earth, the Sea, and all that therein is.</hi> Behold heere also a difference betweene both hopes. The same difference the same Prophet declareth also in another Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 20.</note> saying; <hi>Some put their trust in Charrets, and some in Horses: but we will remember the name of the Lord our God. They are brought downe and fallen: but we are risen &amp; stand vpright.</hi> Thou seest heere how well the fruites agree to the roote, foundation, or tree of hope: for the fruite of the one is a downfall;<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Math. 7,</note> but of the other exaltation and victory. Wherefore very fitly they that trust in the vanities of this world, may be compared to that man in the Gospell, <hi>Who built his house vpon the sand: and the rayue descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beare vpon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.</hi> But they that trust in the Lord, may be likened vnto him, that built his house vpon a rocke, which stood safe, strong,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:9369:105"/>
and firme against all the tempests and stormes of thys life.</p>
                           <p>The same thing no lesse elegantly the Prophet Ieremy doth teach by an excellent comparison:<note place="margin">Ierem, 17,</note> 
                              <hi>Cursed be the man,</hi> saith hee, <hi>that putteth his trust in man, and that taketh flesh for his arme, and he whose hart departeth from the Lord. Hee shall be like the Heath that groweth in the wildernesse: as for the good thing that is for to come, hee shall not see it, but dwell in a dry place of the wildernesse, in a salt and vnoccupied Land.</hi> But of the righteous, he speaketh on a contrary manner: <hi>O blessed is the man,</hi> sayth he, <hi>that putteth his trust in the Lord,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">To him that trusteth in the Creator all thinges happen suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfully and prosperous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but to him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in the creatures, al things fall out vnluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kilie.</note> 
                              <hi>and whose hope is in the Lord himselfe. For he shall be as a tree that is planted by the waters side, which spreadeth out the roote vnto moistnesse, whom the heate cannot harme when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, but his lease shall be greene: and though there growe but little fruite because of drouth, yet is hee not carefull, neither euer leaueth of to bring forth fruite.</hi> Hetherto be the words of Ieremie.</p>
                           <p>Tell me now I pray thee, what other thing can bee desired (if so be that men haue but a little spark of reason) to know the difference, which is betweene the hope of the righteous, &amp; the hope of the wicked; betweene the prosperity of the one, and of the other? What greater commodity can arise from a tree, then to be planted after that maner that the Prophet speaketh? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me, such is the condition and estate of the righteous, to whom all things fall out prosperously, and with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all things goe well: because they are planted by the current of the Riuer of Gods grace. But on the contrary part, there can be no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser estate of a tree, then to be wilde, then to be planted in a dry ground, in the wildernes, &amp; in a land of salt: it dooth not yeeld fruite in due season: to be briefe, it is farre remooued from the sight and tillage of men. By thys comparison, the wicked may easily vnderstand, that they in thys life cannot haue a more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable estate, because they haue eyes remoued, yea quite turned from God, who is the fountaine of liuing water, and haue theyr eyes sette and fixed, and theyr hope reposed vpon frayle &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull creatures, which are vnderstood by a dry land, desert, &amp; vnoccupied.</p>
                           <p>By this also it is manifest, in how excellent a place the world it selfe is planted,<note place="margin">Where the world is planted.</note> which certainly is planted in a dry &amp; barraine ground, seeing it hath the footing of his hope placed on a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:9369:105"/>
so weake: which is no hope, but errour, vanitie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, as before we haue showen. Tell me, I pray thee, vvhat misery can be greater then this? what pouertie more naked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue without hope? Therefore, seeing that man is through sinne left so poore and naked,<note place="margin">How vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy the estate of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, who haue not theyr trust in god.</note> as before we haue declared, and that the hope of the Diuine mercy is so necessary for him, what shall bee left vnto him, who hath lost it, which might haue strengthened and confirmed him? Wee see that all liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in theyr kinde are brought foorth perfect, that nothing is wanting vnto them for the preseruation of theyr life. But man, through sinne is so desolate, and so bereft of all things, that hee hath nothing of those things, which are needfull and necessary for him, but he must liue of almes, and be relieued from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine mercy. Then if thys meanes be taken away, what shall be the life of man? Surely lame, maimed, &amp; full of a thousand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. What other thing is it to liue without hope, then to liue without God? What other thing is left vnto man of all his aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient patrimony to preserue his life,<note place="margin">Onely hope is left vnto man.</note> besides this onely support and helpe? What Nation was euer so barbarous, so voyde of all religion, that had not some knowledge of God, or of some Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, whom it did not worshyp with some certaine honour &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration? of whom also it did not looke for some benefit of the Diuine prouidence?</p>
                           <p>In that short time that Moses was absent from the chyldren of Israell,<note place="margin">Man cannot liue without a God.</note> the people thought that they had beene vvithout a God, and as rude and ignorant began to exclaime, and to speak to Aaron,<note place="margin">Exod, 32.</note> 
                              <hi>Arise, make vs Gods to goe before vs</hi>: as if they durst not goe any further without some God. Wherby it is manifest, that mans nature, although it alwayes knoweth not the true God, yet it is necessary that it know some God. And although man is ignorant of the cause of his owne frailtie, yet he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth his owne frailtie, and for this naturally seeketh helpe of some God.<note place="margin">A similie.</note> Euen as Iuie naturally seeketh for some post or tree, which it may leane vnto; or some wall, by which it may bee supported, and creepe aloft, it beeing not able to sustaine and held vp it selfe:<note place="margin">A similie.</note> And as a woman naturally seeketh for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation and shadow of man; for she as an imperfect creature, knoweth that the ayde and helpe of man is necessary for her:
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:9369:106"/>
so mans nature beeing needfull, and wanting many things, doth seeke for the shadow and refuge of God.</p>
                           <p>These things therefore beeing thus, wee may easily coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what is the life of those men, who liue in this wretched &amp; miserable widowish estate, forsaking God, and beeing forsaken of God. I would gladly knowe this one thing: They that lyue after thys manner, how doe they comfort themselues in theyr miseries? howe doe they defende themselues in dangers? vvho doth cure theyr infirmities? with whom doe they confer of their businesse? of whom doe they aske counsaile in doubtfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? of whom doe they seeke for help in theyr necessities?<note place="margin">How ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie Hope is for man.</note> with whom doe they traffique? with whom are they conuersant? whom doe they sticke to? to be briefe, by whose help doe they escape the snares of this life, who haue not any refuge? If the body cannot liue without the soule, nor the soule without God, surely God is no lesse necessary for the one life, then the soule is for the other. And if (as we haue said before) liuely hope be the anchor of our life, how dare any man vndergoe the dangers of this tempestuous sea, his shyp beeing destitute of this anchor of hope? If hope be the shielde, by which wee defend our selues; how can men defend themselues in the midst of theyr enemies beeing without this shield? If hope be the staffe, by which mans nature is supported in all her weakenes and frailtie; vvhat shall weake and feeble man doe, without the staffe of this hope?</p>
                           <p>Hetherto, as I thinke, we haue sufficiently showed, what is the difference betweene the hope of the righteous and of the wicked: and what is the nature and condition of them both. That is, one of them hath God for his defence and bulwarke; but the other, <hi>the broken staffe of reede of Egipt, which he that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vpon,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Esay, 36,</note> 
                              <hi>it goeth into his hand, and shooteth it through.</hi> For it is meet, that that error which he committeth, in hoping in things so vncertaine and doubtfull, &amp; relying altogether on them, that he should be corrected no otherwise,<note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fruitlesse &amp; vaine hope. Ierem, 48,</note> then by hauing mischance and being deceiued by them, as the Prophet Ieremy plainlie te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth: who when he would denounce the destruction and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of the kingdome of Moab, he sayth thus: <hi>For because thou hast trusted in thine owne workes and treasure, thou shall bee taken: and Chamos (the God in whom thou trustest) with his priests
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:9369:106"/>
and Princes, shall goe away into captiuitie.</hi> Consider therefore what kinde of ayde that is, the trust of which, is the ruine and ouerthrow of him that so trusteth.</p>
                           <p>Therefore let these things suffise which haue beene spoken of the priuiledge and prerogatiue of hope: which although it seeme almost to be the same with the speciall prouidence of God,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the prouidence of God, and of hope or trust.</note> of which wee haue spoken before, yet it is not the same: for they differ betweene themselues, as the effect and cause of a thing. For although there be many foundations of thys hope, as the goodnes of God, truth of the same God, and the merrits of Christ: yet the principall ground is the fatherly prouidence of God, from which ariseth thys hope &amp; confidence. For to know that God hath so great a care ouer him, and that he is defended and gouerned of him with so respectiue a regard, dooth excite and stirre vp in man, a great hope, and an assured confidence.</p>

False liberty is proper vnto them, who haue their bodies free, but their soules captiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and subiect to the tiranny of their own passions and sinnes: as was the soule of great Alexander; who when hee was the Lord of the whole world, he was the seruant of his owne vices. But true liberty is proper vnto them, who haue their soules free from all these tirannies, although their bodies be somtimes free, and sometimes bond and captiuated: as was the soule of the Apostle, who although he was captiue, and holden in bonds, yet in spirit he mounted vp to heauen, and by the doctrine of his letters he freed the whole world.</p>

                           <p>IF any man shall aske me, whence is this bondage, of which we speake? I say that it is a seruitude and captiuity vnder the most terrible,<note place="margin">Sinne a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell Tyrant.</note> most direfull, and most cruell Tyrant of any, that may be named; that is, vnder Sinne. For amongst all the most abhominable and dreadfull things that be in the world, the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:9369:107"/>
of hell is most dreadfull and abhominable: yet much more dreadfull and abhominable is Sinne, which is the cause of this torment, and also of this seruitude: by which sinners are made seruants and bondslaues, as you haue vnderstoode by the words of our Lord before aleadged; <hi>Whosoeuer committeth sinne, is the seruant of sinne.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>What seruitude then can be more miserable then this? Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he onely a seruant of sinne, who committeth sinne: but he is a slaue vnto the perswaders and procurers of sinne; as are the deuill, the world, and his owne flesh, corrupted of the same sinne,<note place="margin">Whose ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is.</note> and he is a seruant vnto all other inordinate desires, which proceede of the flesh. For he that is the seruant of the sonne, is also a seruant of the father. And it is confessed of all, that these three are the fathers of sinne; and therefore they are called ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the soule, because they bring &amp; procure great mischiefe to the soule: as that is, that they make it a slaue &amp; a Captiue, and deliuer it into the hands of this cruell Tyrant. And although all these three doe conspire to this end, yet they worke by diuers meanes. For the two first are serued of the third, which is the flesh, as another Eue to deceiue Adam: or as an instrument very fit,<note place="margin">The flesh is sinne, and a nourisher of sinne.</note> to carry and draw vs into all euill. For this cause the Apostle doth more manifestly call the flesh sinne: putting the effect for the cause; for it is it which pricketh forwards to all kind of sin. For the same cause the Diuines call it the tinder &amp; touchwood of sinne, that is, the meate and nourishment of sinne. By a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon name it is called Sensuality,<note place="margin">Fleshly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is the cause of perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> Flesh, or Concupiscence: which also is called by a name more knowne Fleshly, or sensuall desire, whence all the perturbations of the minde spring, in as much as it is corrupt, and made disordered through sinne: it is the motioner, mouer, and picker forwards to all sinne. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also the two other enemies take singuler aduantage of the flesh, and her appetites, that they may more strongly assault and wrong vs.<note place="margin">Basill.</note> Hence it is that Saint Basill sayth, that the espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall weapons with which the deuill fighteth against vs, are our owne desires. For the vehemency of our affection seeketh by right and wrong, to enioy those things, that it lusteth after: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maketh any regard, although it be forbidden by the law of God, and from such an affection sinnes doe arise.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="200" facs="tcp:9369:108"/>Such an appetite therfore, is one of the most cruell Tyrants, which man being a sinner is subiect vnto: or, as the Apostle speaketh,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> vnder which he is sold. Hee calleth him sold vnder sinne, because his sensuall appetite is made so mighty, that it carrieth him as a bondslaue, whether so euer it listeth.</p>
                           <p>But what is more lamentable, then to see a man, who hath a soule made to the image and likenes of God, illuminated with heauenly light; and an vnderstanding by which hee ascendeth aboue all things created, vntill it find out God himselfe: &amp; yet notwithstanding that hee should contemne and despise all this his nobility and excellency, and be subiect and gouerned after a certaine furious and frantick maner, of his beastly appetite, &amp; to be corrupted of sin, and moreouer to be led about, to be moued, and driuen forwards &amp; backwards of the deuill? What I pray thee at the length is to be expected of this gouernment, but ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, downfall, destruction, &amp; incomparable mischiefes? But that thou mayst see more manifestly the filthines of this seruitude &amp; bondage, I will illustrate it by a certaine example. Imagine that a man had married a woman of so great beauty,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> nobility, &amp; wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: as could possibly fall into any of this sexe, &amp; being happy through this marriage, should haue a Mayd-seruant a Witch, or an Inchaunter, with whom he is besotted by some preposterous meanes, and so dotes on this in chaunting drudge, that forsaking his owne wife, he giueth himselfe a pray vnto his seruant, vsing her in steed of his wife, eating, sleeping, and conferring with her, acting &amp; executing all his busines with her, and with her prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally consuming and spending all his riches in banquets, sports, and surfetting, and after such like maner: yea, not content with these, to come to that dotage and folly, that he forceth his owne wife to wayte on this drudge, and to serue her in all things as a slaue, which she shall commaund her. Who would think that a man should euer come to this madnes? And if he shall so fall, how shall he be rayled vpon, and condemned of those that be wise? How great shall the hate and indignation of all be against this seruant? And on the contrary part, how great will the moane and commiseration be of all towards that good and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble woman? With how many sighs will her kinsfolke deplore the madnes of her husband? This thing at the first view doth
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:9369:108"/>
seeme very shamefull: yet much more shamefull, and filthy is that, which heere wee speake of. For wee must knowe that these two women, that is, the spirit and the flesh are found in our soule: which the Diuines doe call by another name, the superiour part,<note place="margin">The superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our part, &amp; the inferior part of the soule.</note> and the inferiour part of the soule. The superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our part is that, wherein the reason and the will are, which are naturall lights, with which God in the creation hath marked that part, of which part there is so great beauty and noblenes, that by reason of it man is sayd to haue the image of God, to be capable of God, and to be the brother of Angels. This is that noble woman, which God hath ioyned and coupled to man as his wife, with whom he should leade his life, ordering all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires by her direction, that is, by the instruction of her heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie light. In the inferiour part is the sensuall appetite, of which we haue lately spoken; which is giuen vnto man, to desire all things necessary for his life, and for conseruation of his kinde. This therefore, as a Steward receaueth al things by limitation and order appoynted of reason, and layeth out, and disburseth the goods according to the will of the maister and Lord.<note place="margin">The appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite ought to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, and not to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne.</note> This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is that Hand-mayde, of which wee spake a little before, which because it hath not the light of reason, it is not made that it should gouerne or rule, but that it should be gouerned and ruled. These things being thus, vnhappy is that man, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to that madnes, to be giuen as a pray to the loue, and lust of this naughty woman, which casting reason aside, by which she ought to be gouerned, commeth to that malapertnes and headstrongnes, that shee will rule and dominere ouer reason: doing all the mischiefe that this sawcie and peruerse drudge will, following and prosecuting all her appetites, all her desires, and lusts, as well carnall, as sensuall. For we see many men so carnall, vnbrideled, and subiect to the lusts of their owne hart, that in all theyr actions like vnto beasts, they obey this malapert and froward woman, without respect eyther of law or reason. What other thing is this, then to giue the whole rule of the life, into the hands of an abiect seruant, which is the flesh, by surfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in all the delights, sports, banquettings, and pleasures of this world, and despising the counsailes and aduices of Reason, being the noble and lawfull wife?</p>

That woman knowes if she be found of her husband in an act so wicked and detestable, that she shall be slaine without any hope of pardon: shee knowes that shee shall loose together at one and the selfe same time, her soule, her life, her honour, her riches, and all other blessings, which she might hope for eyther in this world, or in the world to come, then which losse surely a greater nor a more vniuersall cannot be inuented or thought of. She is not ignorant that she shall be a perpetuall reproch and scandale to her desamed children, to her father and mother also, to her brethren and sisters, and to her whole family, and that shee shall for euer be a griefe vnto them.

Behold Amnon King Dauids eldest sonne, when as he laciuiously had beheld his sister Thamar, he was so blinded with this darknes, and so miserably bound with these chaines, and so vehemently tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this hunger, that he could neyther eate nor drinke, nor sleepe: yea, he was so farre enamoured of her, that he was sicke for her loue.

But that thou mayst know, that the remedy of this infirmity was not to haue obtayned, that he desired; marke how the same Amnon was further out of square and more greeuously afflicted, and more vexed with a contrary affection, after hee had satisfied his lust, then he was before: for the Scripture sayth, <hi>And hee hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred where-with he hated her, was greater then the loue, where-with he had loued her.</hi> So that the rauishing of his sister did not free him from the passion, but changed the one into another greater. Is there any Tyrant to be found in the world, who so often doth tosse and turmoyle his Captiues, that doth commaund them to doe &amp; vndoe; that forceth them to goe and returne the same way?</p>
                           <p>Certainely beleeue me my brother, they are all such, who are subiect to the like vices; who are scarce Lords ouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.

in which they are plunged night and day, casting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues headlong into most certaine danger of life, and honour for this rauening and tormenting pleasure? Is there any Tyrant in the world, which after such a manner doth dominere and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize ouer his seruant, as vice rageth and raigneth ouer this mans hart? For a seruant is neuer so bound to his Lord, that night and day he doth wayte vpon him, that no time is left him to bestow on his owne busines, or that he may not breathe from his duty: but this vice, as also others, is such an one, that when it hath once gotten rule and empire ouer the soule, it doth so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure and swallow it vp, that scarcely there remayneth to man any force, any commodity, any time, or memory, or any wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to follow other busines.

                           <p>For this Tyrant had so possessed all the sences of this Queene, that now she was vnfit for al things; only the thoughts and cogitations of her new loue being excepted. Which by how much more he ruled in her hart, by so much she was lesse able to apply her selfe to those thinges that pertayned to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and lesse able to doe thinges, which otherwise ought to haue beene done.

of wise-men, the dotage of old men, the madnes of yong men, and the common plague of mankind.</p>
                           <p>Neyther must wee thinke that onely in this vice there is so great tiranny,<note place="margin">The serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</note> but also in all others. Behold &amp; view, a little while an ambitious man, and one that is swelled with vaine glory, and choked with the smoke of honour: and see how seruilely he ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth subiect vnder this desire; and how immoderately he affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and thirsteth after this vaine worldly glory, how carefull and vigilant he is to attaine vnto it, directing all his actions and all his endeuours to this end? To serue, to get acquaintance, to be cloathed, to be booted and spurd, his table, his bed, his house, his seruants, the carriage of his body, his gate, his speach, to be briefe, what so euer is done of such like men, and what so euer is in them, all that is formed, compozed, and applied to this end. For they doe adorne and fashion themselues onely to this end, that they may seeme neate and cult, thereby to gaine the prayse and vaine opinion and applause of the people. Yea, if thou doost well consider, thou shalt see that an ambitious man in all things that he doth or speaketh, hath none other respect, then that he may lay snares and nets to catch the popular applause of the people. If we wonder at that Emperour, which passed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the festiuals in taking of flyes; how much more is the madnes of an ambitious man to be wondered at, who doth not onely spend all the festiuals and holy-dayes, but also the whole course of his life, in catching onely smoke, and wordly vanity? This wretched man by reason of this ambition, doth not what he would, neyther doth he cloath himselfe according to his own estate, neyther is he permitted to goe whether he would: for he goeth but sildome to the Church, neyther dare he be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant with good men; fearing least perhaps the world, to which he lyueth subiect, should see somthing in him, which might be reprehended. And that which is more, that he might satisfie this his passion, he lauisheth out greater store of riches, then ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is willing, or hath, casting himselfe headlong into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand needes and many debts, with which his soule is afflicted; with the griefe of his posterity, which he leaueth to be heires of his debts and imitators of his folly.

For them hee fasteth, and with-holdeth bread from his owne mouth; to be briefe, he loueth them more then he loueth God himselfe, seeing that for the loue of them, hee is not afraid oftentimes to offend GOD? In them is his rest, hys glory, his hope, and all his thoughts. With them hee watcheth and sleepeth; and for them he consumeth his whole life, and all his sences, in trafficking and taking vncessant paines for them, in the meane while vtterly forgetting himselfe, and all other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse.<note place="margin">A couetous man is the seruant and slaue of his money.</note> Shal we say that such a man is the Lord of his riches, that he may determine of them as he pleaseth? or rather shall we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that he is the seruant and slaue of his money? for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes of his riches, as a most hard and seuere mistres, doth compell him to obey them; but it suffereth him not to enioy them, &amp; it sharpeneth the desire, but taketh away the pleasure. A couetous man prouideth riches, as though he were a gallant and braue man, but he vseth them as a beast &amp; a niggardly pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant. He taketh paines but he wanteth the fruite &amp; pleasure of his trauaile, whilst he with-draweth and holdeth his riches from his body and soule, yea, and from life it selfe, if so his treasure and store may encrease and augment.</p>
                           <p>Surely I knowe not what captiuitie can bee more great or grieuous: for if you call him a captiue and a prysoner, who is shutte vp in a turret, and there hath his handes and feete sette in a payre of stocks, rather is he not worthy of this name, vvhose soule is imprisoned and captiuated with the inordinate desire of those things, which he loueth? For when a man doth gape af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gaine, and is wholy occupied in seeking after pelse, hee hath no facultie or power of his soule truely free: neyther is he Lord of himselfe, but a seruant of his owne riches. For where the loue
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:9369:112"/>
or desire is, there the hart lyeth bound and fettered. Neyther is the seruitude of thys captiuitie lesser, because it is voluntarie: for if it be captiuitie in deede, it is so much the more dangerous; by how much it is more voluntary.<note place="margin">A Similie.</note> For neyther is the malignity and mischiefe of poyson lesser, although it be sweet, so that it be poyson in deede. There cannot be a greater captiuitie, then if thou doost so blind-fold thy selfe, that thou canst not beholde God, truth, honestly, nor the lawe of righteousnesse. If thou doost suffer thy selfe to be tortured vnder the vnreasonable rule of thys empyre, thou art no more Lord of thy selfe, then a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken man is of himselfe, ouer whom wine hath the soueraigntie and vpper hand. But if it be a torment &amp; a torture, to be a slaue &amp; a seruant: what greater torment can there be, then that with which couetous men are tormented? especially, seeing that they cannot many times possesse that, which they so greedily desire, neither can they choose but couet that, neither knowe they meanes or way to obtaine it. Therefore at the length they come to this ambiguitie, that they say that, which a certaine Poet sayd to a melancholie and braine-sicke woman; I loue thee, &amp; I hate thee. And if thou askest me the cause, I will tell thee; I abhorre thy familiaritie, and yet I cannot liue without thee.</p>
                           <p>If any one placed in this seruitude and slauerie shall assay to breake these chaynes, and to ouercome &amp; conquer thys desire, he shall finde the force of this appetite so mighty in striuing &amp; wrastling against him, that oftentimes hee shall dispayre of the victorie, and so he (wretched man) shall returne againe, and put his hands and feete into his former gyues and chaynes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, doth not hee say well, that calleth this appetite a bondage and a torment?</p>
                           <p>But if man were bound with one chaine alone,<note place="margin">A sinner is not bounde with one chaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</note> surely it were a lesser euill: for that man that onely is shutte vp in one prison, &amp; hath but one only enemy to buckle with, there is some hope, that thys man may come free: but what shall wee say, of the bondes of so many other affections, with which miserable man is bound? Seeing therefore that mans life is subiect to so many, and so diuers necessities, all these be chaines and motiues of this insatiable couetousnes: for they be snares, in which our wretched hart is taken: although they take hold sooner &amp; more
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:9369:113"/>
grieuously of one then of another. For there are many men, by nature so apprehensiue, that they cannot be brought from that, which once they haue apprehended. There be others that bee weake, and as it were melancholy, who through the nature of this humor, doe most easily apprehend any thing, whose desires are very vehement. Some others are faint-harted, and of feeble courage, to whom all things seeme great, hard and difficult, and worthy to be much esteemed: and although they are very smal, yet they are exceedingly desired. For to a base and peasantlie mind, all things seeme great, albeit they be small, as Seneca saith. Many also are naturally found very vehement in all things that they doe desire:<note place="margin">Pub. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> of which number are women, of whom a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wise-man speaketh very well; Either a woman loueth or hateth: there is no third thing.</p>
                           <p>All these therefore doe suffer a hard and a sharpe seruitude, through the violence of the passions which captiuate them. But if the misery be so great to be bound with one onely chaine, and to be the bond-slaue of one onely Lord, what great misery shal it be, to be bound with so many chaines, and to be a seruant of so many Lords, as a sinner is, who obeieth so many Lords, as he hath affections and vices, which hee serueth? What misery can be greater then this? If all the dignitie of man, in that he is man, consisteth in two things, that is, in Reason and Will; what can be more contrary to the one, and to the other, then passion and appetite, which blindeth the Reason, and hindereth the Will? Hence it is manifest, how dangerous and deadly all affection is, for it throweth man out of the seate of his dignity, by obscuring his reason, and peruerting his will. Without these two, man is not man, but a beast. Thys therefore my brother, is that mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable seruitude, in which sinners liue, as a nation which is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gouerned of God, nor of reason, but is haled and drawne of the appetite, and of passion.</p>

Wherefore,<note place="margin">Esay, 14.</note> that saying of Esay is fulfilled; <hi>And they shall take them prisoners, whose captiues they were, and haue rule ouer theyr oppressours.</hi> For before grace, the sensuall appetite did hold vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the spirit, &amp; exercised tyrannie ouer him: constraining him to serue euill lusts, as before we haue spoken.

                           <p>This is most excellently prefigured in the death of Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezech King of Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Iudges, 1.</note> who was slaine of the children of the chyldren of Israell, first the thumbes of his handes and feete beeing cutte off.

And so presently after that most holy and sacred passion of our Sauiour, men began to tryumph ouer this Tyrant, and with great power to raigne ouer the deuill, the world, and all vices; so that all the torments of the world, shall not be able to driue &amp; force men to ruinate their soules.</p>

                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is certaine, that the speech of the Prophet is not heere of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Serpents, but of spirituall; which are our appetites, and euill inclinations: for these when they are free and not hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, infect the world with their poyson: neither doth he speake of corporall chyldren, but of spirituall: amongst whom hee is sayd, to be a sucking childe, who first beginneth to serue God, who as yet hath neede of milke, vntill hee bee further growne: and he is called the weined child, who hath somewhat profited, and goeth on his feete, and now is fedde with more solide meat, as bread, and other foode fit for men. Therefore the Prophet, speaking as well of the one as of the other, saith at the first, that they shall play &amp; be delighted; because they see themselues liue in the midds of spirituall Serpents, and yet by the vertue of the Diuine grace, they doe not receiue of them any mortall hurt by consenting to sin. Others after they are weined, and haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited in the way of the Lord, he saith, that they shall put theyr hands vpon the holes of Cockatrices: as if hee shoulde say, that God doth keepe them in the midst of the greatest dangers. For in them is fulfilled that of the Psalmographer;<note place="margin">Psalm, 91,</note> 
                              <hi>Thou shalt walke vpon the Lyon and Aspe: the young Lyon and the Dragon, shalt thou tread vnder feete.</hi> These are they that put their handes vppon the holes of Cockatrices, neither feele any hurt.

                           <p>This thing the Apostle declareth more perspicuously, and without a metaphore, when (after he had spoken copiously of the tyrannie of our appetites and of our flesh) at the length cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out;<note place="margin">Rom, 7.</note>

Gregorie testifieth in a certaine homilie. But if any man, saith he, hath tasted with the mouth of his hart, what is the sweetnes of heauenly rewards, what be the musicall assembles of Angels, and what is the incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vision and sight of the holy Trinitie: to this man by hovve much that is more sweet, which inwardly hee feeleth and seeth, by so much that is more bitter, which outwardly hee pertaketh.

                           <p>When as nowe the vessell of our hart is full after this manner of that heauenly liquor, nowe the thirst of our soule is quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, now remaineth no further any reason or cause to desire or seeke after the fraile goods and abiect things of this life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our soule is free, neither is it bounde any longer with the chaynes of euill appetites: for where there is no desire or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, there are no chaynes, no captiuitie. Insomuch that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:9369:115"/>
the hart, because it hath found the Lord of all, therefore, it after a certaine manner is made Lord of all: for in this chiefe good, it findeth and possesseth all good.</p>
                           <p>To these two diuine benefits,<note place="margin">The thyrd cause, daily vse, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> by helpe of which men come to true libertie, the care also and diligence of man is to bee ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: by which hee striueth and contendeth to subiect the flesh to the spirit, and the affections to reason. By which study, men by little and little are mortified, and are made fit and able to all good, theyr manners are bettered, and their furie and former boldnes, is restrained and bridled. Hence it is that S. Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome sayth; If wilde beasts, that are nourished among men, by degrees put off their naturall fiercenesse, and become tame, and are peaceably conuersant among men, as the Poet sayth verie vvell:
<q>
                                 <l>Lyons that be fierce, barbarous, and wilde,</l>
                                 <l>In time are tamed to play with a child.</l>
                              </q>
What great thing is it, if our naturall affections, when they haue accustomed themselues by little and little to obey reason, if by degrees they waxe gentle &amp; milde; that is, if by little and little, they participate something of the nature of the spirit &amp; reason, and reioyce in the works of the spirit? If custome &amp; good vse hath so great force and efficacie, what shall not grace doe, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king together with this vse? Hence it is that the seruants of God, are often more sensibly merry &amp; delighted (for so it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth me to speake) in celestial rauishments, in silence, in reading, in prayer, in meditation, and in such like exercises; then they would be in feasting, in sports, in hunting, and in other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and delights of this world. For now they hate all those, &amp; it is a torment vnto them to remember them: insomuch that now the very flesh dooth abhorre that, which before it loued, and findeth tast and delight in that thing, which before it loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed. Which is so true, as a certaine learned and holy man saith, that often-times the inferiour part of our soule, is so delighted in prayer, and inwardly hath such sweet conference with God, that it feeleth a great torment, when it is with-holden by anie manner from these exercises, or hindered in them.</p>
                           <p>Thys is that which the Prophet sayth,<note place="margin">Psalm, 16,</note> 
                              <hi>I will praise the Lorde, who hath giuen me counsell: my reines also chasten me in the nights:</hi>
                              <pb n="216" facs="tcp:9369:116"/>
or as another translation hath,<note place="margin">Ierome.</note> 
                              <hi>they teach mee.</hi> Thys surelie is an excellent worke of the Diuine grace. For those that comment vpon this place, vnderstand by the reines, the affections and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions of man, which are wont, as wee haue said, to bee prouokers and procurers of sinnes.<note place="margin">The affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are taught of the Lord, &amp; do worke good vnto man.</note> Which notwithstanding oftentimes through the vertue of grace, not onely doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and stirre vp to euill, as they were wont, but some-times they helpe vnto good: and not only they doe not serue the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, on whose side they were wont to warre, but they goe on Christs side and turne theyr weapons vpon his enemies. Which although it be seene in many spirituall exercises, yet especially it appeareth in the affection of contrition, and in the greefe for sinne: in which the inferiour part of the soule playeth her part, in afflicting it selfe, and in plentifull pouring out of teares for sinnes. Therefore the Prophet sayth, that in the night, when the day beeing past the righteous are wont to examine theyr consciences, this same his reines did in chastising him: for from that anguish &amp; bitternes, which he felt in that part of his soule, because therein he had offended GOD, he was alwayes afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and he was alwaies carefull, that he might not commit that againe, for which hee was sorrowfull. Therefore not vvithout cause he gaue thanks vnto the Lord: for not onely the superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our part of his soule, in which his vnderstanding was, inuited him to good: but also the inferiour part, which alwaies for the most part, is wont to driue and prick man to euill.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">A Caution.</note> But although this be both truth, and also great glory of the Redemption purchased by Christ for vs, (who as hee is a most perfect and absolute Redeemer, so hee hath most perfectly and absolutely redeemed vs) yet no man must be too bolde to trust to his owne flesh, yea although it be mortified, so long as hee continueth in this mortall life.</p>
                           <p>These therefore be the chiefest causes of thys admirable and wonderfull libertie, after which followeth a newe knowledge of GOD, and a sound and solide confirmation of our fayth, and of our Religion, which we professe, as the Lord himselfe testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth by the Prophet Ezechiell,<note place="margin">Izech, 34,</note> saying; <hi>And they shall knowe that I am the Lord, when I haue broken the cordes of theyr yoke, and deliuered them out of the handes of those that serued themselues of

                              <note place="margin">The yoke of sinners.</note> Wee say that this yoke is sensualitie, or an inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to sinne, which cleaueth to our flesh, and which oppresseth vs, and subdueth vs to sinne. The cordes of thys yoke are euill inclinations, with which the deuill apprehendeth and catcheth man, and draweth him vnto him: which inclinations are so much the stronger, by how much they haue beene longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed through an euill custome. Which thing Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine confesseth of himselfe in these wordes;<note place="margin">Augustine in his eight booke of his confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, the 5- chapter.</note> I was bounde not with yron, but with mine yron will: my will the enemie kept, &amp; of my selfe made a chayne for my selfe, and bound me with it. Because of my corrupt will came lust, and whilst I did not resist lust, custome folowed, with which as with a chaine, I was bound and imprisoned in sinne.</p>
                           <p>Therefore, if at any time a man shall see himselfe bound af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, that this holy man confesseth himselfe to haue beene bound, and is willing and desirous to be vnlosed, and to gette out of thys captiuitie, hee shall finde as great difficulties to escape out, as hee found: but if at the length he beeing conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto GOD, doe see these chaynes broken in peeces, these affections tamed and brought vnder, and these euill incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations mortified: and if hee see himselfe free, and the Lord of hys ovvne appetites: to conclude, if hee see the yoke, that lay vpon his shoulders, novve lye vnder his feete; what other thing ought he to doe, then assuredly and vndoubtedly to beleeue, that it is GOD, who hath broken these chaynes, and hath taken thys greeuous and burthenous yoke from his shoulders?

their felicity in visible things, hence that thirst and dogs famine ariseth, which they haue of those things, in which they suppose theyr felicity to be placed: when as oftentimes they cannot haue those things that they desire, (for others more greedy and stronger doe many times preuent them) forth-with they are troubled and afflicted,<note place="margin">A similie.</note> as a child that hath beene brought vp in a thousand delicacies and cockerings, who when those thinges are denied him, that he desireth, hee weepeth, and cryeth out with such a clamour, that his parents are afrayd, least he should burst in sunder: for euen as the satisfying of the desire, as the vvise-man sayth, is a tree of life: so there is not a greater griefe or discruciatement, then to desire, and not to haue that is desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

This is that most miserable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, which our Sauiour so copiously sheweth in that parable of the prodigall sonne,<note place="margin">Luke, 15.</note> in which it is sayd, that <hi>there arose a great dearth throughout that Land, and he began to be in necessity</hi>: And through hunger he was constrayned to feede Swine, although he was the sonne of a great noble man. But this is more misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he would haue filled his belly with the huskes, that the Swine eate: but no man gaue them him. With what greater Art I pray thee, could the whole discourse, and all the miseries of the life of the wicked be more liuely depaynted? Who is that prodigall sonne, who left his fathers house, &amp; wandred abroade into a farre Countrey; vnlesse a miserable sinner, who forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God, entreth into the way of vices, and abuseth all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of God?

But if thou shalt consider what is their exercise and practise in this life, thou shalt finde it be none other then to feede Swine; and to fill the bellies of theyr filthy appetites and desires.

What other thing be their sweet odours? what their merriments? what their feastings? so great delicates? their decked chambers? their consorts of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke? their meetings? their receipts and expences? What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing I say be these, then to seeke for huskes, and feeding for this heard of Swine? Giue it what name thou wilt, call it pure nobility, magnificence, or if thou wilt courtly splendour and glory; yet in Gods Dictionary it hath not this name, but is called the feeding of Swine.<note place="margin">A simily.</note> For euen as Swine are a certayne Heard of beasts, that delight in mire and durt, and are nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with the basest and most vncleane meates: so the soules of these men (if so be that they are to be called men) are delighted with no other thing, except with the most filthy durt of carnall pleasures. This also is greater then all misery, that a son sprung from so noble a Father, who was created to feede at the table of the Lord, and to be nourished with the bread of Angels, cannot be satisfied with foode so meane, because there is so great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in that Land.

                           <p>There commeth also to these another euill, much more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, and that is thys. Oftentimes men accomplish theyr wishes and desires, and they thinke that they haue sufficient, and are satisfied, and theyr estate is at that passe, that if they wil, they can liue to theyr harts content. But foorthwith another minde possesseth them, and they perswade themselues that such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, titles, dignities, places and preheminences, are necessary for them. Now if perhaps they seeke after these, and labour to obtaine them, and if they be denied them, and are not able to compasse them, then they be strooken to the hart, &amp; feele grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter torment, then if all those thinges were wanting vnto them, which before they thought were sufficient to liue well: &amp; thus they liue with this sting, or that I may speake better, with thys
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:9369:120"/>
continuall scourge, as long as they are in this worlde, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbeth all their prosperity.

The same Art GOD vseth against the wicked, that they may plainly knowe (so that they will open theyr eyes) that felicitie, and the content of mans hart, is the gyft of God, which hee giueth when, and to whom it pleaseth him, without any of theyr labour or industrie, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it away againe according to his pleasure, by putting a peg or pinne into the tuch-hole of the gunne: that is, by sending some of these perturbations into theyr felicity.</p>
                           <p>For thys cause, although they be mightie and rich, as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly appeareth, yet by reason of this hidden &amp; secret defect, they are so desolate, and liue in so great perturbation and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that thou wouldest thinke that they had nothing, and that they possessed nothing. Thys is that which Esay speaketh in the person of the Lord, against the power of the King of Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, <hi>Therefore,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Esay, 10,</note> saith he, <hi>shall the Lorde God of hosts send among his fatte men, leanenesse, and vnder his glory he shall kindle a burning, like the burning of a fire.</hi> That it may appeare thereby, howe the Lord knoweth to finde out a rock, against which the shyp say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling prosperously, may be dashed in sunder, and to send weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the midst of strength, and misery in the midst of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie.</p>
                           <p>The same thing is also shewed in the booke of Iob, where it is sayd,<note place="margin">Iob, 25,</note> that the Gyants doe mourne vnder the waters, that we may know that God hath deepe places, and myseries for them also, as he hath for them that be base and small, who otherwise seeme more subiect to the calamities of this worlde. Salomon sheweth thys more plainly, when amongst other miseries of this world,<note place="margin">Eccles, 6,</note> he reckoneth vp this as one of the greatest, saying; <hi>There is also another euill which I saw vnder the sunne, and it is much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men: A man to whom God hath giuen riches, and treasures, and honour, and hee wanteth nothing for his soule of all that it desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth:
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:9369:120"/>
but God giueth him not power to eate therof, but a strange man shall eate it vp.</hi> What is thys, that GOD hath not giuen him power to eate thereof, but to spend his goods, and not to haue that content by them and that rest of minde, which hee might haue of them. For by that small perturbation and trouble of which wee speake, God disposeth, that all his felicities is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; that thereby he may vnderstand, that as the dead letter gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not true wisedome, but it is God that giueth it: so neither the riches and goods of this world doe giue true peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but it is God that giueth it.</p>
                           <p>Therefore, that we may returne from whence wee haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed: If they, who haue all things that they desire, and haue not God, doe liue in sorrowes, and are exceedingly disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; what shall they doe, to whom all these things are wanting? Because euery defect of them, is as a famine &amp; as a thirst, which pincheth and afflicteth them, and as a thorne, which pricketh through theyr hart. What peace, what tranquilitie, can there be in that soule, in which there is such sedition, so great warre, and such trouble and hurly burley of appetites and cogitations?

Also, sometimes it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to passe, that in this sea contrary windes doe rage one against another, which is a token and a cause of a greater storme.

Blessed therefore is this peace, which being one of the eleuen fruites of the holy Ghost, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered and begotten of other fruites and priuiledges, as we haue spoken: yet especially it proceedeth from Vertue herselfe, whose vndiuidable companion Peace is. Wherefore euen as honour and outward reuerence is naturally due vnto Vertue; so also the inward peace is due, which in like manner is both a fruite and a reward of her. The inward warre proceedeth from
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:9369:122"/>
pride, and the vnquietnes of the passions: but when they are tamed and bridled by vertues, whose duty and function it is so to worke, then all the cause of the sedition and tumult ceaseth. This is one of those things, in which the felicity of the heauenly kingdome consisteth vpon earth, of which the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; <hi>The kingdome of God is not meate nor drinke,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> but righteousnes and peace, and ioy in the holy Ghost.</hi> Where, by righteousnes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hebrew phrase, Vertue herselfe and holines is vnderstoode, of which we speake in this place: in which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with these two admirable fruites, that is, peace and ioy in the holy Ghost, consisteth the felicity and happines begun and inchoate, which the righteous enioy in this world. That this peace is an effect of Vertue herselfe, the Lord most plainely telleth in Esay;<note place="margin">Esay, 32.</note> 
                              <hi>And the worke of iustice,</hi> sayth he, <hi>shall be peace, euen the worke of iustice and quietnes, and assurance for euer. And my people shall dwell in the tabernacle of peace, and in sure dwellings, and in safe resting places.</hi> Wee must know that in this place, by quietnes is vnderstoode the inward peace, which is the tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and quietnes of the passions, which trouble the quiet and peace of the soule with importunate clamours, and disordered and graceles appetites.</p>
                           <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The second cause.</note> this peace ariseth from the liberty and rule of the subdued passions, of which we haue more largely spoken in the former Chapter. For euen as when a Citty is taken, and the Cittizens subdued, straightwayes there ariseth peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity in it, so that euery one sitteth vnder his own roofe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare, and without suspition of any hostility: so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And so it comes to passe, that as they, when they had rule ouer him, and exercised their authority, turmoyled him, &amp; tost him hether and thether; so when man is free from their tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, &amp; doth hold them captiue, there is not any thing left, which may breed sorrow and trouble vnto him.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The third cause.</note> the same peace ariseth of the greatnes of spyrituall
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:9369:123"/>
consolations, of which we haue also spoken before: by which the desires and affections of our appetite are brought into such order, that they are stilled, quieted, and content with that part and portion that happeneth vnto them, according to the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the vpper portion of the soule.

                              <note place="margin">The fourth cause.</note> Fourthly, this peace proceedeth from the testimony and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ioy of a good conscience, which bringeth great quietnes and tranquillity to the soules of the righteous, although it doth not make them vtterly secure; for they doe not remaine without the care and dread of holy feare.</p>

For the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of this priuiledge we must know, that there haue
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:9369:123"/>
beene two vniuersall deluges and drownings of this world; the one materiall, the other spirituall; and they both had one cause, that is,<note place="margin">Gen. 7.</note> sin. The materiall deluge, that was in the time of Noah, left nothing aliue in the worlde, but those that were in the Arke: for the waters couered all things, so that the Sea deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the earth with all the labours and riches of men. But there was another flood before that, much greater then this: for it did not onely hurt and endamage the men of that age, but it brought deadly destruction to all the men of the ages past, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and to come: neyther did it onely hurt their bodies, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so theyr soules; for it spoyled them of all the riches of grace, which the world had receaued, by the meanes of him that was first formed. And in this miserable estate all things as yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, as we may see in euery creature, which newly commeth into this world, being naked and disfurnished of all the goods as well of the soule, as of the body.</p>
                        <p>From this first deluge all those miseries, beggeries, and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are deriued, to which mans life is subiect, which are so many and so great, that learned Wryters, and graue Doctors of the Church, haue written large and copious volumes of this matter: Philosophers also very learned, on the one part consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the dignity of man aboue all other lyuing creatures, and on the other vnto what great miseries and vices he was subiect, they could not wonder sufficiently at it, seeing so great disorder and misgouernment in the world: for they vnderstoode not the cause, which was sinne. For they did note and marke, that onely man, amongst so many liuing creatures enioying so many thousand kindes of pleasures, and desires of the flesh, was vexed with couetousnes, ambition, and insatiable desire to liue, neither with these bonds his misery to be limitted, but that hee must thinke of his death and buriall, and what shall become of him after death.<note place="margin">Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is more miserable then any lyuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> There is not any liuing creature that hath a nature more fraile, or inflamed with greater gurmandize or couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, neyther that feareth more vainely, or more rageth through anger. They did also see that other lyuing creatures did passe the greater part of their life, without sicknesses and infirmity, without the helpe of Phisitions; and that all necessaries were prouided for them, without their labour or industry. But on
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:9369:124"/>
the contrary part, they did see that miserable man was exposed and layd open to a thousand infirmities, mischaunces, necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and greefes, as well of soule as of body, both for himselfe, and for his friends. That which is past, greeueth him; that which is present, afflicteth him; that which is to come, terrifieth him; and that oftentimes he laboureth and taketh paynes all his life long, for a morsell of bread, and a mouth full of water, to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine himselfe with all. Neyther can I so soone make an ende to speake of these miseries of mans life, of which blessed Iob sayth:<note place="margin">Iob, 7.</note>

Therefore all my exercise shall be, alwaies to mourne, grone, &amp; poure out my sighes before thee as a Doue, and I will call and cry out vnto thee, as a young Swallow doth vnto her Dam. So this holy man spake, although he was a most mighty King. Also his Father Dauid beeing much greater then bee, neuerthelesse in all his neede he ranne to this sanctuarie, &amp; with the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and same intent,<note place="margin">Psalm, 142,</note> saith; <hi>I cryed vnto the Lorde with my voyce: with my voyce I prayed vnto the Lord, I poured out my meditation before him, &amp; declared mine affliction in his presence.</hi> That is, when I cast mine eyes about looking heere and there, I see all passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges stopt, and the gates of hope shutte against mee; therefore, when as mans helpe doth faile me, by prayer I desire heauenlie ayde, which God hath left vnto me, as the onely refuge &amp; stay in all my troubles and dangers.</p>

But if this be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to comfort and to confirme vs in prayer, how much more shall those things confirme vs, which Christ himselfe speaketh, and that pledge which wee haue of our labour, as hee himselfe saith in the Gospell:<note place="margin">Math, 7,</note>

call these wordes into doubt or question? who by this comfort will not be refreshed and encouraged in all his prayers? vvhom will not this royall charter content &amp; satisfie? This is one of the greatest and chiefest priuiledges, which attend vpon the louers of vertue in thys, that is, to knowe that these great and assured promises are especially made for them. For it is one of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentest graces, that our Lord bestoweth vpon them for the paiment of their obedience, that he alwaies is present with them praying, and that hee heareth all their prayers. Dauid assureth this vnto vs,<note place="margin">Psalm, 34,</note> when hee saith; <hi>The eyes of the Lorde are vpon the righteous, and his eares are open vnto theyr cry.</hi> And the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth the same thing by Esay;<note place="margin">Esay, 58,</note>

And if men were iust prisers and esteemers of things, how greatly were they to esteeme this promise? Of what great woorth would a man make it, if he had found this fauour with some King, who would

giue vnto him, whatsoeuer he should aske? If an earthly King would be in such price with thee, shall not this heauenly King be in greater? But if thou shalt esteeme these to bee naked words, and that the effect and fruite dooth not follow the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, looke into the liues of the Saints, and consider what they haue done onely by prayer. How great things did Moses in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt, and in all that iourney through the wildernes,<note place="margin">What great things the Saints haue doone by prayer.</note> onelie by prayer? What great things did Elias and Elizeus effect &amp; bring to passe, onely by prayer? What great miracles did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles by prayer onely?

                        <p>This therefore is the rewarde promised to the obedience of the righteous, that seeing they are so faithfull &amp; obedient to the voyce of the Lord, he semblably dealeth with them; &amp; because they answere vnto his voyce, when hee calleth and cryeth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is meete that he should remunerate them after the same manner.

For we know, that there is not any sea so stormy and rempestuous in this world,<note place="margin">Our lyfe is a Sea.</note> as our life is: for in it there is not found any felicitie so safe and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, which is not subiect to a thousand kindes of casualties, which at all times hang ouer our heads. Surely it is a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of consideration, to see with what great difference good and euill men doe passe through this miserable world: for the good, knowing that they haue GOD to be theyr Father, and that it is he, that bids them drinke of this cup, like vnto a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine prescribed of a most wise and skilfull Phisitian; and that tribulation is as a file, the which the sharper it is it so much the more maketh the soule purer, brighter, and more shining, and doth scoure of all the rust: and considering in like manner, that it is it, which maketh men humbler in their thoughts; more

                        <p>But if at any time the labour and payne encreaseth, the helpe and ayde also encreaseth, least man should faynt: and he is made so much the richer, by how much his tribulation is mightier: that he may not flye from it,<note place="margin">Tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> as from a dangerous and hurtfull thing; but that he may desire it, as a merchandize of great gaine. For these causes the righteous oftentimes doe beare calamities and miseries, not onely with patience, but also with ioy. For they doe not looke vpon the labour, but vpon the reward: not vpon the payne, but vpon the crowne: not vpon the bitternes of the medicine, but vpon the health which it bringeth: not vpon the griefe of the chasticement, but vpon the loue of the chasticer, who himselfe sayth, that hee chasticeth euery one whom he loueth. The ayde of the Diuine grace, doth ioyne it selfe to this consideration, as already we haue sayd; which neuer forsaketh the righteous in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>For the saluation,</hi> sayth he, <hi>of the righteous is of the Lord, and he is theyr protectour in the time of tribulation: and the Lord shall helpe them and deliuer them, and shall take them from among sinners. and shal saue them, because they trusted in him.</hi> And in another place yet more plainely.<note place="margin">Psal. 31.</note>

Though I sayd in mine hast, I am cast out of thy sight, yet thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest the voyce of my prayer, when I cryed vnto thee.</hi> Thou seest heere how manifestly the Prophet demonstrateth the fauour and ayde, which the righteous haue of God in their greatest and sorest troubles.

                           <note place="margin">A simily.</note> signifying (as a certaine interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sayth) that as a King when hee would keepe any man safe from danger; placeth him in his Pallace, that not onely the wals of the King, but also the eyes of the King may defend him from his enemies: then the which gard none can be safer: so the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly King by the same prouidence doth defend his. Hence it is that we see and reade, that the Saints oftentimes being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with many dangers &amp; temptations haue endured them, and borne them with a minde quiet and vntroubled, and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Those three young men felt this, whom Nabuchodonozer commaunded at Babilon to be cast into the firy furnace: among whom the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of the Lord walked in the midst of the fire, and cast out the flame of the fire out of the furnace, and made the midst of the furnace like a coole and refreshing wind, and the fire touched them not, neyther troubled them, nor brought any greeuance vnto them. And the King was astonished, and sayd; Did wee not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I see foure men loosed, and walking in the midst of the fire. And the fourth is beautifull as the sonne of God. Thou seest then how the presence of our Lord is at hand in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. That argument of this matter is not lesse, which the Lord performed for that holy young man Ioseph, after he was sold of his brethren.<note place="margin">Wised. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>For hedeliuered him from sinne</hi> (as it is in the booke of Wisedome) <hi>he went downe with him into the dungeon, and fayled him not in the bands: till he had brought him the seepter of the realme, and power against those that oppressed him, and them that had accused him, he declared to be lyers, and gaue him perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall glory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>These examples confirme that Diuine promise, which is in Dauid: <hi>I am with him,</hi> sayth the Lord, <hi>in trouble; I will deliuer him, and I will honour him.</hi> O happy trouble, which deserueth to haue such a companion. Which seeing that it is so, let vs all lift vp our voyces with Saint Bernard, and say: O Lord send me trouble,<note place="margin">All vertues helpe the afflicted.</note> that thou mayst alwayes be with mee. With this the ayde and supply of all vertues doe ioyne themselues, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre at this time, that they may strengthen, corroborate, and rayse vp the distressed minde. For euen as when the hart is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed and afflicted,<note place="margin">A simily.</note> all the blood from euery part runneth thether, that it may releeue and comfort it, that it faynt not: so the soule when it is oppressed with griefe and anguish, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all the vertues runne vnto it, and releeue it, now after this manner, now after that. But after a more especiall maner Fayth is present, bringing a cleare and plaine knowledge both of the good things, and of the euill in the life to come: in comparison of which, all the calamities and miseries of this world are of no

The loue of God commeth, with which loue they being inflamed, desire with great feruentnes to beare all kinde of sorrowes and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this life. Obedience and the conforming of our wils with the Diuine will runneth &amp; hasteth hether; at whose hands they receaue with ioy, and without murmuring, whatsoeuer is giuen vnto them. Patience ioyneth herselfe vnto these, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is to strengthen the shoulders, that men may be able to beare all those burthens, which are layd vpon them. Humility hath also heere her function and worke, which bendeth the hart as a young twig, shaken and tossed to and fro of the stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my wind of tribulation, and maketh man to be humbled vnder the mighty hand of the Lord; whilst he acknowledgeth, that those things which he suffereth are much lesser, then his sinnes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

God, then in all trouble to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme ourselues to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Gods will. But amongst all the vertues, liuely Hope hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth man in that time, after a singuler and an especiall manner, and it wonderfully strengtheneth our hart in the midst of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. The Apostle declareth this, who when hee had sayd; <hi>Reioycing in hope,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Rom, 12,</note> he further addeth, <hi>and patient in tribulation</hi>: not being ignorant that one followeth another: that is, of the ioy of Hope, followeth the fortitude of Patience. For which cause the Apostle not vnelegantly calleth Hope an anchor:<note place="margin">Hope is an Anchor. Hebr, 6,</note> for euen as when it is fastned into the earth, it keepeth the shyppe safe, which stayeth in the midst of the waues, and maketh it, that it feareth not the billowes of the raging sea: so liuely Hope, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmly fixed vppon the heauenly promises, preserueth the minde of the righteous vnremoued in the midst of the waues of this world, and maketh it, that it contemneth and despiseth all the storme &amp; tempest of the winds. So it is reported that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine holy man did in times past, who seeing himselfe enclosed on euery side with tribulations, sayd: That good that I looke for is so great, that all punishment and all torment is a pleasure vnto me.</p>
                        <p>Therefore thou vnderstandest, my brother, how all vertues concurre to strengthen the mindes of the righteous, when they see them in a straight. And although a man be weake and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet forthwith he returneth to himselfe, &amp; to his right mind, and with greater affection and zeale, sayth: If thou shalt fayle in the time of triall, when God hath determined to try &amp; proue thee, where is thy liuely Fayth, by which thou beleeuest in him? where is thy charity? where is thy fortitude? where is thy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? where is thy patience? where is thy faithfulnesse? and where is thy strength of hope? Is this the end of all thy labors? is this thy good purpose? is this that thou so often desiredst, &amp; prayedst to God for? Remember, that Christianitie consisteth not onely in this,<note place="margin">Wherein true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth.</note> to fast, to pray, to heare seruice and sermons, but it is necessary, that God find thee faithfull, as another Iob, or Abraham, in the time of trouble. A righteous man beeing helped after this manner by his good meditations and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, by his owne vertue, and by the fauour of the Diuine grace, which neuer forsaketh him, at length commeth to that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:9369:129"/>
passe, that he beareth the burden of his troubles not onely with patience, but also with thanks-giuing, and with great ioy. A proofe of this, is the example of the holy man Tobias the elder, of whom it is written, that after many calamities, with which he was proued; yea by Gods sufferance he lost his sight in his old age, that an example of patience might be giuen vnto men: he was neither consumed through griefe of minde, neither lost he that sayth and obedience, which before he had. Wherefore the Scripture sayth;<note place="margin">Tob, 2.</note> 
                           <hi>But God therefore suffered this temptation to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto him, that an example of his patience might remaine vnto posteritie: like as of holy Iob. For when as hee had alwayes feared God, euen from his infancie, and had kept his commaundements, hee did not murmur against God, that this plague of blindnesse fell vppon him: but he remained vnmoueable in the feare of GOD, giuing thanks to God all the dayes of his life.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thou seest therefore, that the holy Ghost dooth adde pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in troubles, vnto vertue and vnto the feare of the Lorde, which this holy man had, according to that, which before hath beene said. There might also in this place be remembred cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine excellent and famous examples of our time: in which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine men and maids, the seruants of GOD, haue borne very great troubles and afflictions with great ioy: who in bitternesse haue found sweetnes, in tempest a calme, and in the midst of the Babylonian fornace haue found a most wholsome and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table refreshing.</p>

                           <p>THere is lesser cause to praise the Lord, when we see the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous constant in tribulation; then there is to lament and grieue, when we see the wicked compassed and enclosed vvith troubles.<note place="margin">The wicked are vnfit to beare tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</note> For these haue neither charitie, nor fortitude, nor hope, nor any vertues like vnto those: and so tribulations finde them vnarmed and vnprepared: neither haue they light, by benefit of which they might see that, which the righteous doe see through fayth: neither doe they embrace that by a liuely hope, neyther by experience haue they tryed that singuler goodnes, &amp; father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie prouidence of God, by which he watcheth ouer his. It is a thing worthy of exceeding sorrow, to see them swallowed vp

in this sea, neither to finde any footing, nor any body to reach the hand vnto them to stay and support them. For whilst they haue not this helpe, and saile without this Pilot and Gouernor, and fight without this Armour, what is to be hoped for of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that they must be drowned and make shypwracke in that storme and tempest: or that they must be slaine in this warre? What is to be hoped for of them, but that they must be tossed with the stormes of windes, and with the floods of tribulations: and that they must split theyr ship against the rocks of vvrath, faint-hartednes, impatience, blasphemy, and desperation?</p>
                           <p>There are many also found,<note place="margin">The force of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> who furthermore haue lost their vnderstanding, their health, their life, or els their sight, through continuall mourning &amp; teares. So that one part of men, as most pure gold, tried in the fire of affliction, remaineth firme &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable: and another part, as lead or tinne, foorth-with is melted through the heate of the fire. Therfore, whilst one sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth, another singeth; and where one is drowned and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, another swimmeth and walketh dry foote: therfore in the Tabernacles of the righteous, alwaies the voyce of prayse and myrth dooth sound; but in the houses of sinners, lamentations are alwaies heard, and voyces full of misery and confusion. But if thou wilt more plainly vnderstand that which I say, consider the sighes and sorrowes, and the extreame lamentations of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine great noble women, after that by death they had lost a son or a husband; and thou shalt find, that some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie shutte vp themselues in obscure and darke places, where they might neither see the Sunne, nor the Moone: others, lyke beasts, shutte themselues vp in Caues and Dennes of the earth; others, haue cast themselues into the fire: others, to whom lyfe was a payne, and death a desire, haue dashed out theyr ovvne braynes against a wall. To be briefe, others after easier maners through impatience, and vehemencie of sorrowe, haue ended theyr liues, and ouerthrowne their families. But this is more, that not onely they haue been cruel and inhumane vnto themselues, but they haue maliciously spurn'd against God, blaspheming his Name, and reuiling and reproching his prouidence, cursing his iustice, banning his mercy, and opening theyr sacriligious mouthes against heauen, and against the high and soueraigne

maiestie of God.

Yea, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes this worke of the hand of GOD, is wont to be most iust, that hee suffereth man from one calamitie and tribulation, to fall into greater. Wherefore, these vnhappy and miserable wretches, the guidance of Vertue leauing them, doe all thinges after a contrary and preposterous manner, and doe peruert all order in the time of tribulation: they blaspheme, where they ought to blesse; they are proude, when humilitie is required; augmenting their owne woe and misfortune with that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they bring vpon themselues; and making their case more desperate, with that medicine, which they thought to apply vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tothemselues: which is as the beginning of one hell, and going to another, which is prepared.

But if thou shalt say, that these promises are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made vnto the Iewes, then vnto Christians: (for vnto these according to Ezechiel those more excellent blessings, as are the blessings of grace, and of glory, are promised) yet as in that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall law, God did not denie to the righteous Iewes spyrituall blessings, so in the spirituall law he doth not withdraw tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall prosperity from good Christians: yea, hee doth giue vnto them temporall blessings, and that with a double commodity; neyther of which the wicked haue. The first is, because as a skilfull Phisitian, he bestoweth these blessings vpon them after that measure, which their neede requireth: that by this way they may be releeued, and not waxe proude, neyther beeing fatted and crammed kick and spurne. This commodity the wicked haue not; for they scrape together as much as they are able, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer regarding theyr saluation.

So although the life of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the blood, yet too much aboundance of blood, is the cause of death, and oftentimes killeth men. The second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity is, because lesser pelse, and a measurable and an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent possession of riches doth bring greater quietnes and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity vnto the soule: which is the end, why men with such
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:9369:132"/>
greedines desire temporall goods. For whatsoeuer God can doe by second causes, he can doe it, yea more perfectly, by himselfe, without those meanes. So hath hee done in all his Saints; in whose name the Apostle sayth:<note place="margin">2, Cor. 8.</note> 
                           <hi>Hauing nothing, and possessing all things:</hi> For so little doth suffice vs, that we hauing very little, and being therewith content, we seeme vnto our selues to be the Lords of the whole world.<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> A trauailer for his prouision in his voyage carrieth his money in gold: for so he is the richer, and he is troubled with lesse weight: after the same manner also our Lord doth lighten his, laying vpon them but easie burthens, but yet sufficient, and that which may content them. After this manner the righteous doe goe naked, yet they are content: they are poore, and yet they are rich. But the rich when they are full of wealth, yet dye for hunger; and when as they sit euen vp to the lips in water, yet they are slayne with thirst, as the Poets in times past fabled of Tantalus. For this and such like causes, that great Prophet long agoe did prayse the obseruance of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine law, willing that in it all our meditation should be.

Amos, 9,</note> seeing that it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally appertaineth to all men, who haue knowledge of the Diuine law, and doe despise it, neyther will obey it, as the Lord himselfe testifieth by his Prophet; <hi>Haue not I brought vp Israell out of the Land of Egipt, and the Philistines from Cappadocia, and the Syrians from Cyrene? Behold, the eyes of the Lord God, are vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the sinfull kingdome, and I will destroy it cleane out of the earth.</hi> Signifying, that all these changes of kingdoms, whereby thys kingdome is ouerthrowne, and that planted and raysed vp, doth come through sinne. And if any one will see that this is true, let him read ouer the histories of times past, &amp; he shal vnderstand, how God doth chastice the froward and peruerse; but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally those, that haue the true law, and doe not keepe it. He shal see, how great a part of Europe, Asia, and Affrica, which in
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:9369:135"/>
times past were full of Churches, and of Christian people, now are possessed of Infidels: &amp; he shall know also what great mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres, ruines, and destructions, the Gothes, Hunnes, and Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales haue made vpon the Churches; who in the time of Saint Augustine,<note place="margin">See Ierome in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph vpon Fabiol. c. 3.</note> destroyed and wasted the Prouinces of Affrica, and that without any mercie or compassion; they sparing neyther men nor women; neither old nor young; neither Virgins nor married. At the same time also, and after the same manner, the kingdome of Dalmatia was wasted, with the bordering Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as Saint Ierome showeth,<note place="margin">Ierome vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the 4. chap. of Osea.</note> who was borne in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: insomuch, that he that should haue passed through &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled those Countries, should haue seene nothing but heauen and earth; all things were so ruinated and ouerthrowen. Yea, if we will looke into our owne times, we shall see, what slaughters, and effusion of Christian blood, what desolations and euersions of Citties, sinne hath caused in Fraunce, Belgia, and many other Countryes? What mightie massacres, and lamentable diuasta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hath sinne brought vppon the world by the sword of the Turkes, those professed enemies of Christianitie, who stil bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish their swords against Christendome, for the sinnes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians? These sufficient plainly doe declare, how that true ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and sincere religion, are not onely profitable to the obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of eternall blessings, but also to gette and keepe temporall blessings: that the consideration of all these may inflame our mindes with the loue of Vertue, which preserueth vs from so many mischiefes, &amp; bringeth with it so many good things.</p>

past, but time is not graunted. If it looke behind, it seeth the course and race of the whole life led, as a moment of time. If it looke before, it beholdeth the infinite space of eternity, which expecteth it. It sorroweth and sobbeth, because it hath lost the ioy of euerlasting eternity, which it might haue obtayned in so short a time: it tormenteth it selfe, because it hath lost the inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable sweetnes of perpetuall delight, for one sensuall, carnall, and momentany pleasure. It blusheth, considering that for that substance, which is wormes meate, it hath despised that, which Angels price so highly. And weighing the glory of those immortall riches, it is confounded, that it hath changed them for the basenes and vildnes of temporall things. But when it casteth the eyes vpon things below, and seeth the darke and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure valley of this world, and beholdeth aboue it the shyning brightnes of eternall light, then it confesseth that all that it loued in this world was black night, and vgly darknes. O then if such a soule could obtayne a space of repentance, and a time to recall it selfe, how austere and seuere a life would it embrace? What difficult and great matters would it promise? vnto what great vowes, prayers, and other exercises would it bind it selfe? But whilst it meditateth and consulteth of these things with it selfe, the fore-runners and harbengers of death begin to approach: that is, the eyes waxe dim, the breast swelleth and panteth, the voyce sayleth and foltreth, the members grow colde, the teeth waxe blacke, the mouth is filled with humors, and the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance waxeth pale and wan. In the meane time come the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Sargiants, which attend vpon Death now at hand: and they present vnto the wretched soule, all the works, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and cogitations of the life past, bearing bad and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous witnes against theyr mistres, and although she would not see them, yet she is compelled to see them.

And there they begin to dispute betweene themselues, to whether part this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable pray must happen. For if fayth in Christ, vertues, and works of piety and godlines be found in her, straightwayes she is comforted with the sweete speaches and consolations of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. But if the enormity of sinnes, and a life wickedly led doe

require another thing; alas, sodainly she trembleth, and is terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with an intollerable dread, and feare, and trembling, doe terribly assault her. Forthwith the deuils assayle her and take her, and violently pluck her from the miserable flesh, and cast her headlong into torments, neuer to be ended, but to continue for euer and euer.

                           <p>BVt the death of the righteous is farre off from these miseries and calamities. For euen as at that time the wicked receaue the punishment of theyr iniquity: so the righteous receaue the wages of their vprightnes, according to that of Ecclesiasticus, <hi>Who so feareth the Lord,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Ecclesiast. 1.</note> 
                              <hi>it shall goe well with him at the last, and in the day of his death he shall be blessed.</hi> That is, he shall be enriched, and shall receaue the reward of his labours. Saint Iohn in his Reuelation, doth insinuate the same thing more manifestly, when he sayth, that he heard a voyce from heauen, saying vnto
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:9369:137"/>
him; <hi>Write:</hi> The words which he was commaunded to write were,<note place="margin">Apoc. 14.</note> 
                              <hi>Blessed are the dead, which dye in the Lord. Euen so sayth the Spirit, that they may rest from theyr labour: and their works follow them.</hi> How can he be discouraged in that houre: that heareth this of the Lord, when he now seeth himselfe hasten thether, where he shall receaue that, which he desired all the time of his life? Therefore of the righteous it is reade in the booke of Iob; <hi>And thine age shall appeare more cleare then the noone day: thou shalt shine and be as the morning.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Iob. 11.</note> Which words Saint Gregory expounding,<note place="margin">In the 10. booke of his Morals. Cap. 21.</note> sayth: The age of the righteous shall appeare more cleare then the noone day: because hee knoweth how great clearenes and brightnes remayneth for him, when now he beginneth to goe out of this world. And so at that time, when the wicked are heauy and faynt, the righteous reioyce, and haue confidence in the Lord. This Salomon testifieth in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs; <hi>The wicked,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Prou. 14.</note> sayth he, <hi>shall be cast away for his malice: but the righteous hath hope in his death.</hi> Tell mee, I pray thee, what greater hope, or confidence can be wished for then that, which a certaine holy man did ioy in at the houre of his death? Death drawing on, and he seeing the enemy of mankinde, sayd, Thou cruell beast, why standest thou there? thou shalt find nothing deadly in me: for the bosome of Abraham shall receaue me in peace. How can hee feare, or be disquieted, who at the very poynt of death, had so great hope of the heauenly glory? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the righteous doe not feare death: yea, they reioyce and prayse God, when they dye; and doe render vnto him great thanks for theyr ende: for by the benefit of death they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from all their labours, and enter into their happines. Saint Augustine writing vpon the Epistle of Saint Iohn, sayth: Hee that desireth to be dissolued, and to be with Christ, dyeth not patiently, but lyueth patiently, and dyeth delightsomly. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the righteous hath no cause to sorrowe, neyther to feare death: yea, rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He feareth not death,<note place="margin">The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous feareth not in the houre of death.</note> because he feared God: and he that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him, neede not feare any other. He feareth not death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he feared life: but feares of death are the effects of an euill life. Hee feareth not death, because throughout all his life he
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:9369:138"/>
learned to dye, and prepared himselfe to dye: but a man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and prouident feareth not his enemy. Hee feareth not death, because so long as he liued, he sought for those things that might helpe him, that is, for vertues and good works. He fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not death, because he hath the Iudge fauourable &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vnto him, and this was the comfort of Saint Ambrose, when he was departing this life.<note place="margin">Paulinus in the life of Ambrose.</note> I haue not so liued, sayth he, among you, that I am ashamed to liue any longer: neyther doe I feare to dye, because we haue a good and a gracious Lord. To be briefe, he feareth not death, because to a righteous man death is not death, but a sleepe: it is not death, but an end of all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: it is not death, but the way vnto life, and a ladder vnto Paradice. For he knoweth very well that death hath lost all the bitternes of death, after that it hath passed through the veines of life, and that it hath receaued the sweetnes of life. Hee is not discouraged for any other accidents, which oftentimes happen vnto him at this last cast: for he knoweth that those sorrowes are the sorrowes of the birth, by which he is borne vnto eternity: for the loue of which he hath alwayes desired death, and led his life in patience. He is not terrified through the memory of his sinnes, because he hath Christ his Redeemer: whom alwayes he did striue to please. He feareth not the Diuine iudgement, because he hath Christ his Aduocate: he sereth not the presence of deuils, because he hath Iesus his defender and Captaine: he feareth not the horrour of the graue, because he knoweth that his body is sowne a corruptible body, but shall rise againe an incorruptible body. And after this manner prayse is sung in the end. The last day iudgeth all the praecedent, as Seneca sayth, and giueth sentence of the life past; for this is it, which eyther iustifieth, or condemneth: but seeing that the end of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous is so quiet and peaceable, and the death of the wicked so troublesome and dangerous, what is further required to make vs flye an euill life, and to embrace a good, besides this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? What doe all pleasures,<note place="margin">In death prosperity doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing profit, nor aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hurt.</note> riches, and sauours of this world profit? and what auaileth prosperity, if I am at the last to be cast into hell fire? And what haue all the miseries and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this life hurt me, if I shall sleepe and rest in peace &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, and if I shall passe hence hauing a pledge and pawne
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:9369:138"/>
of eternall life? Albeit a sinner be wise in the busines of this life, vvhat profit reapeth he by this wisedome, vnlesse he heape and scrape together those things, whereby he becommeth prouder, vainer, more delicate, and of greater power to worke mischiefe, but more vnfitte and vnapt to any good worke? Hence death is so much the more bitter vnto him, by howe much lyfe vvas sweeter. There is no wisedome, nor prudence more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in this life, then so to dispose of all affaires, that the end may be ioyfull and happy. For it is the propertie of a wise man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently and fitly to direct the meanes to the end.<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> Wherefore, if he be called a skilfull Phisitian who can so temper his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, that it bringeth health, which is the end of his medicine: so he shall be termed truly wise, who hath so learned to lead his life, that a good death may follow: that is, that he be prepared to giue an account, which in that day shall be exacted, vnto which all the life is to be disposed, aymed, and leuelled at.</p>

Surely, each one of these priuiledges, is so

great and so excellent of it selfe, that if it were thorowly known, each I say, were sufficient to moue a man to embrace Vertue, &amp; to alter and change his life; and it would make a man truelie to vnderstand, how well it was said of our Sauiour; That whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer shall forsake the worlde for his sake,<note place="margin">Math, 19,</note> shall receaue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth fold heere, and shall inherite euerlasting life.</p>

But thys good maketh his possesser good and happy, and doth noe lesse warme &amp; heate his hart, when he knoweth of it alone, then when the whole world knoweth it. But my tongue is not the key of the Casket of this secret; and much lesse of all those things, which hetherto haue been spoken: for whatsoeuer mans tongue can vtter, is much lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truth of the thing it selfe. The Diuine light, experience and vse is the key of vertues. I would that thou shouldest desire thys key of GOD, that thou mayst finde this treasure, yea God himselfe, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou shalt finde all things, and thou shalt see with what great reason the Prophet said;<note place="margin">Psalm, 144.</note>

some cheere vp themselues through the hope of the Diuine mercy, supposing that they shall be saued by a naked and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse fayth, and a dead hope without charity: to be briefe, others being inamoured of this world, will not change the felicity, which they think they possesse in it, with the promises of Gods word.

So Saint Augustine saith of himselfe;<note place="margin">August. in the 8 booke of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions, the 5. chap.</note> O Lord, I had not wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to aunswere thee, when thou saydst vnto me; Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate &amp; enlighten thee: and thou demonstrating in euery poynt those things to be true, which thou spakest vnto me, I beeing conuinced with the truth, had not any aunswere at all, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the words and speaches of a loytering sluggard, &amp; of a drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie sleeper; <hi>By and by, and behold anone: and let me alone a little:</hi> But by and by, and behold anone, had neyther measure nor moderation, and let me alone a little, held on a long time.

For we all know that nothing ought more to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed of Christian men, then the health of their soules: and for this respect the amendment of their lifes is necessarily required; for without this it is most certaine that no man can be saued.

Verily I suppose that innumerable soules haue perished through this vaine perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

The ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> accustoming our selues vnto vices, sayth Saint Ierome, doth make the way of Vertue hard and vnpleasant vnto vs. For custome is another nature:<note place="margin">Ierome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Celantia. Chap. 4. Bernard.</note> and to expell it, is as it were to ouercome Nature herselfe, then the which there cannot be a greater victory. Hence it is that Saint Bernard sayth; After that any one vice hath been co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed &amp; rooted in vs by the custome of many yeeres, we haue neede of the speciall and miraculous helpe of the Diuine grace, to ouercome and roote it vp. And therefore a Christian ought to be very wary and circumspect, that he doth not fall into the custome of any vice: for when as anything commeth vnto an habit, it is very hardly thrust forth and expelled: so also vice being confirmed by daily vse and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, cannot be eschewed and forsaken without the especiall
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:9369:142"/>
grace of GOD, as sayth Bernard.</p>
                        <p>Also, this difficulty proceedeth from the power of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> who hath a certaine peculier rule in that soule, which is held vnder the slauery of sinne.<note place="margin">Luke, 11,</note> For he is that strong man armed, of whom the Gospell speaketh, who keepeth his pallace with a vigilant and a most especiall care.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, it proceedeth from that, that God is farre of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a soule polluted with the filth of sinne. For this is the watch and gard,<note place="margin">Esay, 62,</note> that the Lord sette ouer the walles of Ierusalem: which is so much the further of from a sinner, by how much a sinner is heauilier loaden and burthened with sinnes. From this absence great &amp; mighty miseries are deriued, as the Lord himselfe saith by his Prophet;<note place="margin">Osea, 7, and the 9. Apoc, 11,</note> 
                           <hi>Woe vnto them who haue forsaken me.</hi> And, <hi>Woe vnto them when I shall forsake them.</hi> Thys is according and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent to that Woe, of which Iohn maketh mention in his Reuelation.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, this difficultie arriseth from the corruption of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the powers of our soule, which are grieuously disturbed and corrupted through sin, although not in themselues, yet in theyr operations and effects.<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> For euen as Wine is marred by vineger, and fruites are spoyled of wormes; and euery contrary is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted of his contrarie: so also all the powers of our soule are disturbed and infected through sinne: which is an especiall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, and most contrarie to our soules.

                        <p>If therefore these be the causes of this difficultie, who is of so corrupt a iudgement amongst vs, that hee should suppose that his conuersion should hereafter be easier, the causes of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties encreasing on euery side?

The vnderstanding for the time to come, through the vse of sinning, will be more darke and obscure; the will wilbe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to worke well; the appetite will be more ready and prone to all euill, and all the faculties of the soule will be so weakened, that they shall not be able to defend themselues from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of sin.

                        <p>Let vs put the case: That now thou must fight with an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth sinnes, but hereafter the time shall be that thou must fight with a thousand: that now thou art to fight with the corrupt &amp; depraued custome of one or two yeeres, but perhaps hereafter with the naughty inueterate custome of ten yeares.

                        </p>
                        <p>There is a pretty Story in the liues of the Fathers, wherin an Angell excellently sheweth this guile and legerdemaine, to a certaine holy Father lyuing in the Wildernes. For the Angell taking this Anchorite, carried him abroade into the fields, and there shewed him a man cutting downe of vvood. When he had gathered together a great bundle of the vvood, he assayed, whether lie would lift it vp, and lay it on his shoulders, and goe away with it: but when he found himselfe vnable to doe it, he returned againe, and cut downe more vvood, and a great deale more encreased his burthen. When he was now lesseable to support his burthen, (for now his bundle was farre greater, then it was before) hee againe augmented it; and this he did often with a firme and a resolute purpose. The Anchorite meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the great madnes of the man, demaunded, what was the meaning of it. The Angell aunswered, that such was the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and dotage of men, who when they cannot beare the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of sinnes by reason of the intollerable heauines of the weight, yet they daily adde new to old, and almost euery mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment encrease the burthen, heaping sinnes vpon sinnes, and burthen vpon burthen, thinking that they can beare many, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <pb n="272" facs="tcp:9369:144"/>
as they are not able to beare a few. But what shall I speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many other things of naughty and corrupt custome,<note place="margin">The force of euillcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome.</note> and of the violent tiranny thereof, which so surely detayneth men growne old in wickednes? It is familiar and knowne vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body, that he that driueth a nayle into a post, that he faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it at the first stroke that he giueth with his malet,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> but more firmely at the second stroke, but so fast at the third, that it can hardly be pulled out againe, and the oftner that he knocketh it, the faster it sticketh, and is pulled out againe with the greater difficulty: so in euery one of our wicked actions which we doe, vice is driuen deepelier into our soules, as if it were with a great mallet, and there it sticketh so fast, that scarcely any thing may be found, by which it may be haled and pulled out.</p>
                        <p>Hence it is, that not seldome we see, that the old age of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who haue trifled and spent all their time in vices and wickednes, waxeth childish againe through the dissolutenes of theyr fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed life, although that age dooth refuse that inordinatenesse, and nature herselfe abhorre that former lewdnes. And when as theyr nature is tyred, and barren through vices, yet Custome, which as yet rideth on horse-backe, posteth about, seeing for vnpossible pleasures: so great is the impatient tyrannie of euill Custome. Hence it is said in the booke of Iob, <hi>His bones shall be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Hence is that of Aristotle; That as for the byting of an Aspe there is no remedy, vnlesse the parts infected be cut away; so certaine vices are healed only by death. Then by death these vices are ended, although (if we will confesse the truth) neyther by death they take theyr finall farwell: for they indure alwayes; wherfore Iob saith; <hi>And they shall lye downe in the dust with him.</hi> The reason of this is, because through the diuturnitie of inueterate custome (which nowe is turned into nature) the appetites and lusts of vices are now roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the very bones &amp; marrow of the soule, no otherwise, then the plague, or a consumption, which sticketh in the bowels of a man, carelesse of any cure, neyther admitting any medicine. This same thing our Sauiour showed in the raising of Lazarus

The first of these foure dayes, as sayth Augustine, is the delight of the pleasure in the hart: the second is the consent: the third the deed: the fourth custome: and he that hath come to this fourth day, as Lazarus, is not raysed vp, vnlesse it be with the loude voyce &amp; teares of our Sauiour. All these things do most euidently declare the exceeding great difficulty, which procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination of repentance and conuersion bringeth with it: and by how much the longer repentance is deferred, by so much it becommeth more difficult. Also consequently it is gathered of these, how manifest their errour is, who say, that the amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theyr life, will hereafter be the easier, and doone vvith greater conuenience.</p>
                        <p>But let vs yeeld (which yet we do not grant) that all things should succeed according to thy dreames,<note place="margin">The losse of time.</note> and that thy vaine hope should not delude thee; what wilt thou say of the tyme, which in the meane time thou wretchedly loosest, and slyppeth away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee without any fruite? especially, seeing that in thys time thou mightest haue gained vnto thee an incomparable treasure?<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> What madnes will it be thought (that we may speak according to the iudgement of the world) if at that time, when a most faire and rich Cittie by force is sacked, whilst other soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours with great furie and violence carry out of it gold, siluer, and euery precious thing, some should sitte by playing at Dice with scullions and slaues? It is certaine that they should make no gaine by it. Therefore, how farre greater madnesse is it, that thou, whilst all other good men are painfull &amp; carefull to gaine heauen, that thou, I say, sittest idely playing and sporting vvith chyldren, and onely delighting in the vaine toyes of this world, when as in the meane season thou mightest haue gained that that they enioy?</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, what wilt thou aunswer me, not only for those good things, which thou loosest; but also for those euills, which
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:9369:145"/>
in the meane while thou committest? For according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Saint Augustine,<note place="margin">See August. his tenne strings.</note> not one sinne is to be committed for the gold of the whole world.

Why then blushest thou not to anger and prouoke him, of whose helpe thou hast need euery moment? And whom thou shalt finde so much the lesse fauourable vnto thee, by howe much the more thou hast prouoked him vnto wrath?</p>
                        <p>Very vvell dooth Saint Bearnard reason against such men, saying: Thou who takest so prepostorous a course, perseuering in thy wicked and vngodly life, tell me; Beleeuest thou that the Lord GOD will forgiue thee thy sinnes, or beleeuest thou not? If thou beleeuest not that thou shalt finde pardon vvith God, what greater foolishnesse can there be, then to sinne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of forgiuenes? But if thou beleeuest that thou shalt finde him good, gracious, fauourable, and mercifull vnto thee, who albeit thou offendest him often, yet he is ready to forgiue thee thy sinnes; tell me, I pray thee, what greater frowardnesse, or peeuishnesse can there be, then to take further occasion to offend him, where there is greater cause that thou shouldest loue him? What can be aunswered to this argument?</p>
                        <p>What wilt thou say vnto mee as concerning those reares, which hereafter thou must plentifully shed for the sinnes,<note place="margin">The sinnes which wee nowe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, wee heereafter shal deplore &amp; lament in vaine.</note> which now thou committest? For if God call thee out of this life, or visit thee, euery morsell that thou now eatest, shall then be more bitter vnto thee then gall: and remember that then thou shalt alwayes lament and deplore that, which but once thou didst commit. That day at length will come, make no doubt of it, when thou shalt wish to haue suffered a thousand kinde of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, then once to haue offended God. The time that Dauid enioyed his pleasures was very short: but the time that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:9369:145"/>
he lyued in sorrow and dolour for them, was exceeding long: as he testifieth of himselfe, saying:<note place="margin">Psal. 6.</note>

                        <p>Why then doest thou vnprofitably consume the time in sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, of which thou shalt gather no other fruite but teares?

What great madnes I pray thee would it be thought, if a man had many and weighty burthens to be carried to some certaine place, and he had many Horses sufficient to carry them, yet he should lay all the burthens vpon one of the weakest and worst Horses, the other being sent away empty? like, or rather greater is their madnes, who doe impose the burthen of repentance to be carried of olde age; sparing youth, and manly age, and letting them goe empty, which are much stronger, and farre more fit to carry then old age: seeing that old age is scarce able to support her owne infirmities.

And what surety doost thou take for a longer life? Who will suffer these things so to passe, as thou hast disposed them? Doth it not shame thee, to reserue thy selfe to the reliques and dregs of thy life; and onely to destinate that time to a good and vertuous minde, which is fit for nothing?

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Vstly and rightlie ought those things which we haue spoken to be sufficient, to confound them, who deferre and put off their repentance to the houre of death. For if it be so dangerous to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue and deferre it to certaine yeeres; what wil it be I pray thee, to driue it of, and reserue it for that most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous time? But because this errour is too familiar and vsuall in the world; and seeing that very many soules doe perrish, beeing miserably deceiued by this errour, I thought it very necessary to speake somewhat of this vaine opinion of men.<note place="margin">It is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> And although it is very dangerous to speake of this matter (for it may minister occasion to weake and fearefull consciences to distrust and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spayre) yet greater shall the danger be, that men know not, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what hazard they cast themselues, when they deferre theyr repentance to that time. So that weighing both dangers in an equall ballance, we may manifestly see, that this is greater then that by manie degrees. For experience teacheth vs, that moe soules doe perrish through too much confidence, then by too much feare or faint-hartednes. For wee are appointed Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as Ezechiell saith,<note place="margin">Ezech. 35,</note> that when we see the sword comming, we should tell the people of it; least those that should be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished of vs, be deceaued: and their blood should be required at our hands.</p>

                           <p>BEfore we enter into this disputation, let vs presuppose that, which Saint Augustine, and all the Doctors of the Church do say; that we must necessarilie know, that as true repentance is properly the worke of God, so he can giue it to whom he wil, and when he pleaseth. Therefore, according to this sentence, repentance shall be true, and sufficient to saluation at what time soeuer it be; yea in the houre of death. But how sildome thys happeneth, I would not that thou shouldest beleeue me or thy selfe, but the Saints, by whose mouth the holy Ghost hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.

But God requireth the libertie of thy will. Wherefore, they that will not be conuerted vnto the Lord, so long as they can sinne;<note place="margin">In the same place.</note> and afterwards come vnto conuersion whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they can sin no longer: they shall not so easily obtaine that they desire. And then a little after, Augustine declaring how that conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is wrought,<note place="margin">To be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted what it is.</note> sayth thus: Hee is conuerted, that is, he is who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and altogether changed, who now not onely feareth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, but hasteth to returne to a good and gracious God. Which conuersion albeit it happeneth to any one at the end of his life, we are not to despaire of the remission of his sinnes. But because so faithfull and absolute a conuersion sildome or neuer happeneth, so late repentance is suspicious, and to be feared. For whom the disease constraineth, and the paine terrifieth, he shall scarcelie euer come to true conuersion; especially when hys children are present, whom he hath too much doted on, &amp; his wife and the world doe call him vnto them. For this late repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is wont to deceaue manie. But because God is alwayes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie,
<pb facs="tcp:9369:149"/>
he can alwaies help in death, whom he pleaseth. But because there be many things that doe hinder, and doe draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the languishing and fainting spirit, it is most dangerous, &amp; next to destruction to put of repentance vntill death. But it is a very great thing that God should then inspire thee, and deale so fauourably with thee. If therefore there be any one, who then doth seeke for true repentance, let him expect the friendly cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of God, well vnderstanding and feeling, that the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God is greater then his wickednes. He that thus escapeth, let him liue and not die. Hetherto Saint Augustine, by whose words it is manifest, into how great dangers they do cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues headlong, who of purpose leaue of their repentance to the houre of death.</p>

I doe not presume, I doe not promise, I doe not say, I deceaue ye not, I doe not beguile you, I make no promise vnto you. A faithfull man liuing well, doth safely depart hence. He that repenteth, and is reconciled, whilst he is in health, if after he liue well, is safe.</p>
                           <p>Repeating the same thing a little after, he saith; But he that repenteth at the last, and shall passe hence, whether hee safelie passeth or no, I am not certaine: I can assure him of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but of further securitie I cannot assure him. Marke what I say; I will lay downe this more plainly, least any one should misse my meaning: Doe I say that he shalbe damned? I doe not say so. Neither doe I say that he shall be saued. O ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Bishop, what other thing doost thou say vnto me? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie I know not what I shall say vnto thee. I haue said, I presume not, I promise not, I know not Gods determination. Wilt thou my brother be deliuered from all doubt, wilt thou escape thys ambiguous incertaintie? Repent whilst thou art strong and in health. For if thou truly repentest, whilst thou art in health, &amp;

so the last day finde thee, thou art safe. Therefore runne, that thou maist be reconciled. If thou doost so, thou art safe. Why safe? Wilt thou that I shal tell thee? Because thou repentedst at that time, when thou mightest haue sinned. Behold, I haue told thee, why thou art safe. But if then thou wilt repent when thou canst sinne no longer, thy sinnes haue dismissed thee, and not thou them.</p>
                           <p>Saint Isidore doth consent vnto this.<note place="margin">The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidore.</note> He that would, sayth he, be certaine of the remission of his sins in the houre of death, let him repent whilst he is in health, and then let him lament &amp; deplore his iniquitie and wickednes. But he that hath liued wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, and repenteth at the houre of his death; it is most certaine that he is in very great ieopardy. For euen as his damnation is vncertaine, so also his saluation is doubtfull. Surely these words are very dreadfull: but those more fearefull, which Eusebius the Scholler of Saint Ierome writeth, and which his glorious &amp; holy Maister spoke being at the poynt of death, stretching him selfe vpon the earth, arrayed in rugged and course Sack-cloth: but because I dare not relate them, with that rigour that they are written, least I should minister occasion of distrust and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire to those that be weake and faint-harted, let him that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth reade them:<note place="margin">In the ninth tome of Plantynes edition, a little before the end.</note> he shall finde them in the fourth tome of saint Ieromes workes, in a certaine Epistle of Eusebius, to Byshoppe Damasus as touching the death of Saint Ierome, whose begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, To the most reuerent Father &amp;c. Where amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things hee sayth; But some man will say; That man that hath done wickedly all the time that he liued, and repenting at the houre of his death, he shall obtaine pardon of God. Alas, how vaine a supposall, and how false a meditation. Scarcely of an hundred thousand men, whose lifes haue alwaies beene wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly led, scarcely I say one deserueth fauour at Gods hands. A man altogether borne and brought vp in sin, who hath neither seene, nor acknowledged GOD, neither is willing to heare of him, neither knoweth when he sinneth, nor what repentance is, vnlesse perhaps he sometimes dreame of it: and altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in worldly busines, whom the loue of his children who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he must forsake, oppresseth, whom infirmitie amateth, vvhom the losse and griefe of riches and temporall blessings shaketh &amp;
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:9369:150"/>
excruciateth, because he seeth that he can no longer enioy them, what repentance can he bring forth acceptable to God? which he at all would not bring forth, nor once medle with, if he had any hope of recouery. Certainly I will conclude as I thinke; he that whilst he is young &amp; strong feareth not to offend God, in death he deserueth not to finde any fauour of God. What repentance is that, my beloued children, which a man onely maketh for this respect, because he seeth that hee can liue no longer? Who if he should recouer of his sicknes, would becom worser then he was before? I haue knowne many peny-fathers and helhound vsurers, who may rightly be termed the deuils Alcumists, or the deuils Mint-maisters, that haue beene sorry and penitent, when they haue thought that there was no way with them but death, but after that they haue beene recouered, their lifes haue beene a great deale more wicked and detestable then it was before. This I hold, this I thinke to be true: this I haue lerned by long experience, that his end is not good, whose life was alwayes euill: who feared not to sinne, but alwaies liued in the vanities of the world.</p>

more mercy hath now beene extended: and then iudgement shall be seuerely and strictly executed vpon them, whom now persisting in sinne mercy patiently wayted vpon. These be S. Gregories words. Another Doctour of the Church sayth; It is a hard thing, that then (that is at the poynt of death) true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance should be, when it commeth so late. When as anguish and payne tormenteth the body, and greefe oppresseth the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, scarcely can a man thinke of any other thing. Greatly suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ought that repentance to be, which seemeth constrayned. The coniecture is easie, that a man should thinke that himselfe is vnwilling to doe that, which he hath no ability to doe. Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility doth very well proue the willingnes. If thou doost not whilst thou mayst, thou manifestly shewest that thou art vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to doe. Another Doctour of the Church doth also sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to all this. Seeing therefore, sayth he, that a fruitfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is not the worke of a man, but of God: by his mercy he can inspire it, whensoeuer he will: and reward those by his mercy, whom he could condemne by his iustice. But because there are many things that hinder, and hold backe the sicke par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and him that languisheth and faynteth through sicknes, it is dangerous, and neere vnto destruction, to protract and defer repentance till death. But a meruailous great thing is it, if God at that time inspire any man with true repentance. Consider I pray thee how fearefull and dreadfull these words be? Who then is so bold and audacious, that dare expose this great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to so great hazard? Is there any thing more precious in this world then saluation? Who therfore is so inconsiderate and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduized, that dareth presume to say, that he doth not passing ill, that committeth so great treasure to such danger?</p>
                           <p>These be the iudgements of the holy Doctours, by whom we may euidently gather, how great theyr folly and madnes is, without an especiall care to sayle ouer this so dangerous a Sea, of which the most expert and experienced Mariners haue spoken so doubtfully, and with so great feare.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others there is one that excellently handleth this matter, agreeing in all things vnto vs, putting and inferring this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: Repentance, which is made at the poynt of death,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the Schoole man.</note> and in extreamity, is sildome true, by reason of the great difficulty that happeneth at this time. He prooueth this conclusion by foure reasons or arguments.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">The first reason of the Schoole man.</note> The first is, by reason of the great perturbations, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise out of the greatnes of griefes, sicknes, and the presence of Death, through which the hart is lesse able to lift vp it selfe to God, and rightly to busie it selfe in the exercises of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For the better vnderstanding of this argument we must know, that all the perturbations of our hart haue great force to disturbe and hinder our will and sences: and according to the rule of Philosophy, in this effect and euent the affections or passions are much more powerfull, which cause sorrow and sadnes, then those that procure mirth and ioy. Hence it is that the perturbations or affections of one dying are exceeding strong, and of all other most powerfull. For (as Aristotle saith) death is the most dreadfull of all terrible things: there being so many dolours &amp; discruciatements in the body, so many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and anguishes in the soule, so great sorrow and care for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, wife, &amp; the world, all which are to be forsaken. Amongst so many and so tempestuous winds of the passions, where shall the sences be, and where the cogitations, but where these do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and perturbations doe carry and whirle them? Daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth vs, that if any one be tormented with the tooth-ach, or by any other sharpe payne, although he be a very godly and a religious man, yet scarcely then can he stedfastly lift vp his hart to God, nay all the sences &amp; thoughts haue recourse thither, where the griefe is. If this happeneth to the righteous, what will he doe, who neuer accustomed himselfe to thinke of God, and who so much is readier to endanger his greater friend then his lesser, by how much he is apter and proner to loue his

Bernard doth reckon vp, one is the euill disposition and temperature of the body. For then the soule is so vrged and occupied with the dolours of the flesh, that scarce it permitteth a man to thinke vpon any other thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, which then greeueth and excruciateth him.

I knew a certaine man, who being at the poynt of death, when he was willed and admonished to prepare himselfe for his end, for the glasse of his life was now runned out, he was so affrighted and ouerwhelmed with the presence of death, that he thought vpon nothing els, then how he might escape the danger of death, as if the date of his life had beene put in his owne hands, and he had the ordering and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of it. All his care was, how he might remedy and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde this danger, if possibly it might be. But when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister saw him so little carefull and troubled with those things which were necessary for that time, he admonished him, that he should let passe such thoughts, and begin earnestly to call vpon God.

Of this kinde and nature, seemeth the repentance of many wicked Christians to be, who when they haue perscuered all theyr lyfe thorow in sinne, offending God, when the houre of rendering an account shall draw neere, when they see death approching, and the graue open, and the Iudge present; when they shall vnderstand that no strength or power, can be founde against that infinite power &amp; omnipotencie; and that that shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in that moment which is for euer irreuocable, then they turne themselues vnto the Iudge with prayers and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations: which if they be true, certainly they are profitable. But the common euent teacheth, what manner of prayers and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:9369:152"/>
they were, and are: for we haue learned by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that many of them hauing escaped this danger, forthwith haue forgot all that they promised; and as Swine haue returned to theyr wallowing in the myre, yea they haue reuersed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called that good, which then they purposed; and haue againe embraced those things, which then they estimated preiudiciall to their soules, as if they were the men that had not doone, that they did for the loue of God, but onely for feare of the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, in which at that time they were: which ceasing, also the effect ceaseth,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> which thereupon followed. Whereby it most manifestly appeareth, that this repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance is like vnto that which Saylers make: who when they are in extreamity and danger of shypwrack, they promise to change their lifes, to embrace ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and I know not what protestations they make: but vvhen the storme is appeased and ouer-past, and a wished calme com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and they are without ieopardy, byand by they returne to theyr former vomit: they laugh, they trifle, they blaspheme, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouse and sweare, and become worser then they were before, making no account of their vowes and protestations, yea, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them as dreames and toyes.</p>
                           <p>The third reason is,<note place="margin">The thyrd reason of the Schole-man.</note> because the custome of sinne, in vvhich the sinner hath hetherto liued, will almost neuer forsake a man, but euen till death waiteth vpon him: and followeth him no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then the shadow doth the body. For custome is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, which is not ouercome without very great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And so we see by experience, that many at the houre of theyr deaths, are so little carefull for the saluation of their soules, are so couetous, so drowned in carnall and wordly things, such louers of this life, that they would still enioy it, if at any price they might buy it; so captiuated in the loue of this world, &amp; so enamoured with all those things that they loued in it, as if they vvere not at all at this passe, or in this danger.</p>
                           <p>Haue you not often-times seene old men so greedy and so couetous, that they haue neuer intermitted one houre, nor slac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked any time, to hourd vp the pelfe of this worlde; who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding are vnmercifull, and haue theyr hands shut when they should doe any good: and whose affections and appetites are very fresh and liuely in prosecuting the businesse of thys

world, &amp; heaping vp riches without end or meane, which they must leaue in the world, GOD knowes to whom, but to anie good worke reprobate and dull? This is a punishment not the least, by which God punisheth sinne; permitting it to attend vpon the offender to the graue; according to that of S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, God chastiseth a sinner with this kinde of punishment, that he permitteth him to forget and be vnmindfull of himselfe in the houre of death, because he remembred not God in his lyfe. And so one negligence or obliuion is punished by another: the forgetfulnes of the fault, is punished with that obliuion which is both a punishment and a fault: which we see and heare veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by daily experience: for how often doe we heare, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue wished to die, and haue died in the armes of theyr har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, whom they tenderly loued, that as in theyr life time they would not expell them out of their houses, so in death they would not forsake them, because by the iust iudgement of God, they are become vtterly vnmindfull &amp; obliuious, both of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and of their soules.</p>
                           <p>The fourth reason of the Schoole-man is founded in the qualitie of the valour of the workes,<note place="margin">The fourth reason of the School-man.</note> which are commonly done at that houre: for euery one, who hath but a sparke of Diuine light, seeth plainly, how farre different the works that then are done, are from the works, which are done of a man sound and in health: he acknowledgeth I say, that those much lesse please God then these. That gift cannot be very acceptable to God, (as saith a certaine holy woman) which therefore is offered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the last day so enioynes it, for it is not of the right nature of a gift. What I pray thee is it to pardon an iniury at that houre, when not to pardon it is a great reproch? Doost thou thinke it praise worthy, that then thou leauest thy Concubine, when thou must leaue her whether thou wilt or no, neither may shee stay any longer in thine house?</p>
                           <p>By these reasons this subtile Doctor concludeth, that a man with great difficultie in that houre truely repenteth. Yea he saith that a Christian, who of a set purpose deferreth his repentance to the houre of death, doth very highly sinne, by reason of the great iniury that he offereth to his owne soule: and by reason of the great danger, vnto which he exposeth his saluation.

But all my counsailes haue ye despised, and sette my correction at naught. Therefore will I also laugh at your destruction, &amp; mocke you, when the thing that ye feare commeth vpon you.

                           <p>Hetherto be the wordes of Salomon, or that I may speake better, of God himselfe. Which Saint Gregory in his Morrall bookes doth expound to be spoken of this repentance, which heere we handle. What can be aunswered vnto this? Are not these threatnings sufficient, being from God himselfe, to make thee to feare, and to admonish thee, that betimes thou prepare thy selfe for that houre? But heare also another testimony not lesse plaine then this. The Lord reasoning in the Gospell of his comming to iudgement, he aduiseth and counsaileth his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with great instancie, that they prepare themselues against that day, hauing vsed many parables and similitudes to that end, that by them they might vnderstand, of what great weight that matter was.<note place="margin">Math, 24,</note> His words be these: <hi>Blessed is that seruant, whom his Lord when he commeth, shall finde watching. But if that euill seruant shall say in his hart: My Lord will be long a comming: and so beginne
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:9369:154"/>
to finite his fellowes, yea, and to care and drinke with the drunken. The same seruants Lord shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an houre that he is not ware of, and shall hew him in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and giue him his portion with the Hipocrites.</hi> It is playne and euident by this, that the Lord very well knew of the counsailes, inuentions, and excuses of the wicked, which they finde out to excuse and bolster out their bad matters: and therefore he doth preuent them, and shut the way before them, and admonisheth them how their wickednes shall prosper with them, and what euent their hope shall haue.</p>
                           <p>What do these things differ from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which here we handle? What other things doe we speake here, but those that the Lord himselfe speaketh? Thou art that euill seruant, who meditatest in thine hart such like things, as he did; thou delayest thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and thinkest that there is time enough left for thee, thou eatest, drinkest, and perseuerest in thy sinnes. Doest thou not feare these threatnings, which he threatneth, who is no lesse able to effect them, then to speake them? Who is of might to execute all things that he speaketh, sooner &amp; more readily then to speake them? He himselfe speaketh vnto thee, he reasoneth the matter with thee, he calleth thee, he hath busines with thee, he sayth vnto thee: Watch miserable man, and whilst thou hast time prepare thy selfe, least thou miserably perishest in that houre of Gods iust iudgement.</p>
                           <p>But I seeme to bestow too much time and labour vpon a matter so manifest. But what shall I doe, when I see the greater part of the world couer their sinne and error vnder this cloake? But that thou mayest more manifestly know the greatnes of this danger,<note place="margin">Math. 25.</note> heare another testimony of the same Lord? <hi>Then shall the kingdome of heauen be likened vnto tenne Virgines. &amp;c.</hi> Then; when shall that then be?

At that time therfore, saith our Sauiour, it shall happen vnto vs, as vnto the tenne Virgins, fiue of which were fooles, and fiue wise, which taking theyr
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:9369:154"/>
Lamps went out to meete the Bridegrome: The wise whilst they had time, tooke oyle in their vessels: But the foolish, as it oftentimes happeneth, had no care nor regard of any oyle. At midnight, when men sleepe soundlie, or when they are most negligent and voyde of care, and least thinke of the day of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a cry was made. Behold the Bridegrome commeth, goe yee out to meete him. Then all those Virgins arose, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their Lamps: And those that were ready went in with the Bridegrome to the mariage, &amp; the dore was shut vp. But those that were not ready at that time, began to prouide and prepare themselues, and at length came, saying; <hi>Lord, Lord, open to vs. But he aunswering sayd: Verily I say vnto you, I know you not.</hi> And the Lord concluding this parable, sayth: <hi>Watch therfore, for yee know neyther the day, nor the houre.</hi> As if he should say; Ye haue seene how happy the euent was of these wise Virgins, who were ready, and how vnhappy the foolish Virgins were, who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted oyle. Seeing that therefore yee know not the day nor the houre of the comming of the Bridegrome, and seeing the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of your saluation dependeth only of this preparation, watch and be ye ready at all times, least that day finde you vnprepared, as it found these fiue Virgins, and the dore be shut against you, and yee be excluded from the marriage, as they were excluded. This is the litterall sence of this parable, as a learned man doth expound this place, saying: Let vs take heede to our selues, if it were but onely for this respect, that the repentance, which is deferred vnto death, when that voyce is heard which sayth; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Bridegrome commeth:</hi> is not safe, yea, as it is described in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At the length he speaking of the end of this similitude, sayth: The conclusion of this doctrine is, that we may vnderstand how these fiue Virgins were reprobated and refused, because they were not ready at the comming of the Bridegrome. But the other fiue were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and let in, because they had prouided.

For before this testimony was brought forth, I did not so much meruaile, if they did perswade themselues the contrary, or if they desired willingly to deceaue themselues. But after that this heauenly Doctor and Teacher hath determined this question, when as the Iudge himselfe hath manifested vnto vs the order and manner of his iudgement by so many examples, who is so extreamely impudent or shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, without wit or reason, that will thinke that it shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen otherwise, then hee hath foretold, who himselfe shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the sentence?</p>

In which worke his confession was no lesse admirable and miraculous, then his saluation: for his Nouell and Puny new sprung fayth, acknowledged that which his Disciples gayne-sayed. At that time the guilty theefe beleeued that, which the elect denied. The impiety of the persecutours raged, the wickednes of the blasphemers exceeded, the stripes and wounds shewed Christ onely to be but a man, and the Apostles despayring after so
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:9369:155"/>
many Diuine miracles, onely this theefe resteth not, nor stayed in the scandale of his crosse and death; onely he is the witnes of his Maiesty, who was a companion of his distres and heauines. Seeing that therefore these wonderfull and miraculous things belong to the dignity of this Lord, and to the mistery of that time, it will be counted a ridiculous thing to thinke, that these are matters for all times and places, which were onely proper for that time.</p>
                           <p>We see also in all well ordered common wealths,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> that some things be done ordinarily, and alwayes after the same manner, and some things that are vsed extraordinarily. Ordinary things are common to all, but the extraordinary are proper to some certaine. The same thing also commeth in vse in the common wealth of God, which is his Church. And so that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle is regular and ordinary;<note place="margin">2, Cor. 11.</note>

And it is an ordinary thing that those that embrace Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and leade a godly life, doe enter into an eternal life; and those that liue viciously and wickedly, to be cast into hell fire. This sentence is common and true, which the holy Scripture doth beate vpon in many places. This the Psalmes doe sing of, this the Prophets doe celebrate, this the Apostles doe preach of, this the Euangelists haue noted. The kingly Prophet hath comprehended this in few words,<note place="margin">Psal. 62.</note> when he sayd: <hi>God spake once and twice: I haue also heard the same, that power belongeth vnto God: And that thou Lord art mercifull: for thou rewardest euery man according to his worke.</hi> This is the summe of all Christian Philosophy. Therfore according to this speach of Dauid, we say that it is an ordinary thing, that as well the righteous as the sinner, should receaue a reward at the end of their lifes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the works,<note place="margin">The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</note> which they haue done. Yet besides this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall law, God can by his especiall grace and fauour bestow mercy vpon some, that they should dye the death of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, who haue liued the life of sinners: as also it may come to passe, that he that hath liued like a righteous man in this world, by the secret iudgement of God,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> may dye as a sinner. As it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth vnto them, who haue sayled very fortunately in a long

that will helpe thee in this ieopardy? Perhaps thou placest thy hope in thy preparations, in thine almes, and in thy prayers.

Thou sayest that the mercy of God is vnmeasurable &amp; infinite, for he willingly would be crucified as a malefactour for sinners. I confesse indeede that his mercy is exceeding great; for it suffereth thee to vtter so lauishlie such cursed blasphemie; as that thou wouldest his goodnes &amp; boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, should be a fautour and a fauourer of thy wickednesse:
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:9369:157"/>
and that his Crosse, which hee apprehended as a meane to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the kingdome of sinne, should be made of thee a meane to strengthen and defence sinne: and whereas thou shouldest offer a thousand lifes vnto him, if thou haddest so many, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath sacrificed his life for thee, there thou takest an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to denie that one vnto him which thou hast, yea vvhich thou hast receiued of him. This grieueth thy Sauiour more, then the death did, which he suffered for thee: for hee who neyther lamented nor deplored his own death, most greeuously lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and bewaileth thy sinnes in the Prophet,<note place="margin">Psalm, 129,</note> saying; <hi>The plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers plowed vpon my backe, and made long furrowes.</hi> Tell me I pray thee, who hath taught thee thus to argue, that because God is good and gracious, thou shouldest conclude, that it is lawful for thee to sinne, and to follow wickednes? The holy Ghost see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnto me to conclude after another manner; that because God is good and gracious, he gathereth that he is worthy to be worshipped, obeyed, and to be loued aboue all things. And because God is good, it is meete that I be good also; and that I should trust in him: who although I be a most greeuous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet is ready to receiue me into fauour, if I with all my hart will be conuerted vnto him. Because God is good and so good, it is double wickednes to offend so great &amp; magnificent a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Therefore, by how much the more thou doost exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the goodnes of GOD, by so much the more thou doost ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate thy sinne, which thou committest against him. And it is meet and equall that so great a sinne should be punished: for it is the nature and dutie of the Diuine iustice, (which also thou esteemest not to be contrary, but the sister and the auen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Diuine goodnesse) that it should not leaue so enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous an iniury vnpunished.</p>
                        <p>Thys kinde of excuse is not newe, or sprung vp of late, but very old, and vsuall in the world.

Neither doe we know God himselfe in this worlde, but by hys workes. Therefore let vs enter into the spirituall world of the holy Scripture, &amp; then let vs goe out into this corporall world, wherein we liue, and let vs out of them both reason, what the Diuine iustice is, that by this meanes we may know it. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this consideration will be most profitable; For besides thys end which now we propose vnto our selues, we shall reape also out of it another fruite: for it will a fresh stirre vp in our harts the feare of the Lord, which as the Doctors say, is the treasure, the keeper,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> and burthen of our soules.

This feare poyzeth the soule, that the windes of worldly fauour, or of diuine graces, doe not tosse and pusse it vp, and so ouerthrowe it.

                           <head>¶ Of the workes of the Diuine iustice, whereof mention is made in the holy Scripture.</head>
                           <p>THE first worke of the Diuine iustice, which the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture remembreth,<note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the wayes of the Lord.</note> is the damnation of Angels. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the wayes of the Lord was that terrible &amp; bloudy beast, the Prince of deuils, as it is written in the booke of Iob. For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all the waies of the Lord are mercy and iustice, vntill this first sinne, the iustice of GOD was not yet reuealed, which was hid in the bosome of the Lord, as a sword in a scabberd.</p>
                           <p>This first sinne was the cause, why this sword was vnshea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed.<note place="margin">The fall of deuills.</note> Consider now how grieuous and terrible this first plague and punishment was: lift vp thine eyes, and thou shalt behold wonderfull things; thou shalt see I say, the most precious iewel of the house of God, thou shalt see the chiefest beauty of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, thou shalt see that Image in which the Diuine beauty shy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so cleerly; this I say thou shalt see, falling from heauen like an arrow, and that for the onely thought of pride. The Prince of all the Angels, is made the Prince of deuils, of most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, he is made most horrible and deformed, of most glorious, he is made most vilde and disgracious, of one most acceptable &amp; gracious of all those creatures which God had made, or euer would make, he is made the greatest &amp; the most malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. What astonishment thinkest thou, and what admiration was this to the heauenly Spirits, who know from whence and whether this so noble a creature fell? With what feare did they all pronounce that of Esay;<note place="margin">Esay, 14,</note> 
                              <hi>Howe art thou fallen from heauen, ô Lucifer, sonne of the Morning?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Descend afterward a little lower to the earthly Paradice, and there thou shalt see a case no lesse feareful, vnlesse there had been a remedy vsed for this mischiefe. For that the Angels should fall,<note place="margin">The fall of Adam.</note> it was needfull that they all should actually offend. But what hath the creature which is borne, actually offended in,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:9369:159"/>
why he should be borne the child of wrath? It is not needfull that he should haue actuall sinne, it sufficeth onely that he be borne of that man, that had offended, and by offending had corrupted the common roote of all mankind, which was in him: this I say is sufficient, why he is borne in sinne.</p>
                           <p>The glory and Maiesty of God is so great, that when as one onely creature had offended him, the whole kinde deserued so seuerely to be punished. For if it was not sufficient to Haman that great friend of King Assuerus, that he might reuenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of Mardocheus, of whom he supposed that he had recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued an iniury, not only to punish Mardocheus, but for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his honour to cut off the whole nation of the Iewes, for the deniall (as he iudged) of a small reuerence; why doest thou meruaile if the glory and maiesty of God, which is infinite, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth like punishment? Behold therfore the first man is bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed out of Paradice for a bit of an apple, for which euen to this day the whole world is punished. And after so many thousand yeares the sonne that is borne, bringeth with him out of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe the staine and blemish of his father, and not when he can offend himselfe by reason of age, but in his very natiuity he is borne the child of wrath, and that, as I haue sayd, after so many thousand yeares. After so long time this iniury could not be buried in obliuion, being deuided among so many thousand thousands of men, and punished with so many scourges. Yea, all the torments, which men haue suffered from the beginning of the world to this day, all the deaths which they haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, and all the soules which burne and shall burne in hell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastingly, are sparks, which haue originally proceeded from that first sinne; all which are arguments and testimonies of the Diuine iustice. And all these things are also done and brought vpon vs, after the redemption of mankind wrought, and made by the blood of our Sauiour Iesus Christ: Which remedy if it had not beene wrought, there had been no difference betweene men and deuils: for of themselues there had beene as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy and hope of saluation to the one as to the other. What doest thou think of this punishment? I thinke that it is a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable sound argument of the Diuine iustice.</p>
                           <p>But because this heauy and greeuous yoke is not taken away

What is more fearefull then this? But if thou shouldest know of moe iudgements of this kinde, which daily happen in the Church, perhaps thou wouldest no lesse feare these, then thou dreadest that: Because thou shouldest see many starres falling from heauen to the earth; thou shouldest see many, who did eate the bread of Angels vpon the Lords ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to fall and slip into such calamities, that they rather desire to fill their bellies with the drasse and swash of Swine; thou shouldest see many, whose chastity was purer and more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then a Porphirite, to be blacker then a cole.

So we see that that great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment was no other, which was inflicted for the greatest wickednes in the world (that is, for the death of our Sauiour,) then that which the Prophet denounceth against the workers of it,<note place="margin">Psalm, 69,</note> saying: <hi>Lay iniquitie vpon theyr iniquitie, and let not them come into thy righteousnes:</hi> that is, to the keeping of thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. And what followeth? The same Prophet straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes after telleth, and expoundeth himselfe; <hi>Let them be put,</hi> saith he, <hi>out of the booke of life, neither let them be written with the righteous.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If therefore the punishment be so great, and the tokens of Gods wrath so notorious, that he punisheth sinnes with sinnes, how is it that thou seest not so great arguments of the Diuine iustice amongst so many kinde of sinnes, with which this world now in this age doth flow and swell? If so it pleaseth thee, cast thine eyes about after the manner of them who are in the midst of the maine Ocea, to whom nothing is seene but the sea and heauen, as the Poet sayth, and scarcely thou shalt see any other thing besides sinnes: and thou seeing so many sinnes, wilt thou not see the Diuine iustice? Doost thou not see water, beeing in the midst of the Sea? Yes certainly. And if all the worlde be a Sea of sinnes, what els shall it be but a sea of the Diuine iustice? It is not needfull that I should descend into hell, and there see, how the Diuine iustice rageth: it suffiseth that I onely behold it in thys world. But if thou wilt be blinde and see nothing that is without thee, at least looke into thy selfe: For if thou beest
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:9369:162"/>
endangered with sinne, thou art within the reach of the Diuine iustice: and as long as thou liuest secure vnder it, so long art thou endangered, and so much the more perrillous is thy dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by how much longer thou hast beene endangered with it. So Saint Augustine liued some-times in this most wretched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, as he testifieth of himselfe,<note place="margin">Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</note> saying: I was drowned in the Sea of my sinnes, and thy wrath had preuailed against me, and I knewe not. I was made deafe with the noyse of the chaines of my mortality, and of thy wrath, and the ignorance of my fault was the punishment of my pride. Wherefore, if God punish thee with this kind of punishment, permitting thee to lie drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the deepe sea of sinnes, and so to blindfolde thee in the midst of thine iniquities, what doost thou speake of a thing so contrary to thy selfe? Let him speake and make his boast of the mercy of God, who is worthy of mercy: and let him that is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the iustice of the Lord, speake of iustice. Doth the mercy of God so patiently permit thee to liue in thy sinnes, and will it not permit thee, that at length thou fall into hell? O that thou wouldest be wise, and know how short the way is, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the fault to the punishment, and from grace to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. What great thing is it for a man in the state of grace to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into heauen: and what maruell is it, if a sinner descend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell? Grace is the beginning of glory, and sin of hell; &amp; hell is the reward of it.</p>
                           <p>Furthermore, what is more horrible &amp; fearfull, then when as the paines of hell are so intollerable, as before we haue sayde, yet neuerthelesse, God permitteth the number of the damned to be so great, and the number of the elect so few? How small the number of these is, (least thou shouldest suppose that it is a deuise of mine owne) hee himselfe telleth vs, who numbereth the multitude of the starres,<note place="margin">Psalm, 147,</note> and calleth them all by their names. Who trembleth and quaketh not at those words, which are knowen to all, but eyther ill vnderstood, or sildome called to remembrance? For when as certaine had asked Christ, &amp; said; <hi>Lord,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Luke, 13,</note> 
                              <hi>are there but fewe that shall be saued?</hi> he aunswered; <hi>Enter in at the straite gate: for it is the wide gate and broade way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to destruction:</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Math, 7,</note> 
                              <hi>&amp; many there be which goe in thereat. Because the gate is strait and the way narrow that leadeth vnto life, few there
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:9369:162"/>
be that finde it.</hi> Who would haue vnderstood this in these words, that our Sauiour vnderstood, if simply he had spoken it, &amp; not with an exclamation and an emphasis; O how strait is the gate and narrow the way? The whole world perished in the waters of the deluge, onely eyght persons were saued: which, as Saint Peter testifieth in his Canonicall Epistle,<note place="margin">1, Pet, 3.</note> was a signe, by vvhich is signified how small the number is, that is saued, if they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the number of those that are damned. Sixe hundred thousand men the Lord brought out of Egipt into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, that he might bring them into the promised Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides women and chyldren, who were not numbred; &amp; in thys iourney they were many thousand wayes helped of the Lord, notwithstanding, by their sinnes they lost thys Land, which the Lord of his grace and fauour had promised them; and so of so many hundred thousand men, onely two entred into that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Land. Which almost all the Doctors doe thus interpret, that by it the multitude of the damned is insinuated, and the paucity of those that are to be saued, that is, <hi>That many are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and few chosen.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For this cause, not sildome in the sacred Scripture the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous are called Iemmes or precious stones, that thereby might be signified, that theyr rarenes is as great in the world, as preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stones be; and by as great a quantitie as other stones exceed precious stones, by as great the number of the wicked excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the number of the righteous: which Salomon closely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuateth, when he sayth:<note place="margin">Eccles, 1,</note> 
                              <hi>That the number of fooles is infinite.</hi> Tell me then, if the number of the righteous be so small, vvhich both the figure &amp; the truth testifie to be true; when thou seest by the iust iudgement of GOD, that so many are depriued of that felicity, to which they were created, why doost thou not feare that common danger, and that vniuersall deluge? If the number were alike, yet there were great cause of feare. Why do I say alike? Yea such &amp; so great are the euerlasting torments of hell, that if onely one man of all man-kind were to be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed thether, yet we all should tremble and feare. When our Sauiour did eate his last Supper with his Disciples, and sayd; <hi>One of you shall betray me</hi>;<note place="margin">Math, 26,</note> they were all exceeding sorrowful, &amp; began to feare, although theyr conscience witnessed their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:9369:163"/>
For when as an imminent mischiefe is grieuous &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, although there be but few to whom it is threatned, yet all and euery one feareth, least it should happen to him. If there were a great Army of men in a fielde,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> and it should bee reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from heauen to them all, that a little after an Arrow should fall from heauen, and should kill one of them, neyther was it known, whom it should be, there is no doubt, but that euery one would feare himselfe least it should fal vpon him. But what would they do, if the greater part of them should be in danger and ieopardy? How much greater would thys feare be? Tell me ô man, thou that art so cunning in fleshly wisedome, and so vnskilfull in the busines of thy saluation, did God euer reueale vnto thee that there should be so many, whom the thunder or sword of the Diuine iustice should smite?

Or doth hell seeme more tollerable vnto thee then the wound of an arrow? Or hath God secured thee? or hast thou letters of thy securitie? or is an infallible charter of thy saluation graunted vnto thee? or a priuiledge of immunity and freedom? Hetherto there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that promiseth any such like thing vnto thee, moreouer, thy works condemne thee, and according to the present iustice (vnlesse thou turne ouer a new lease) thou art reprobated, and doost thou not yet feare? or wilt thou say, that the Diuine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie doth comfort thee? Surely that doth not dissolue the works of iustice, neither is contrary to them; yea if it suffer so many to be damned, will it not also suffer thee to be one of them, if thou together sinnest with them? Doost thou not see that thys vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy loue of thy selfe, doth blinde thee, and miserably deceaue thee, whilst it maketh thee to presume other things, then are seene in the whole world?

                           <p>But if God be to be known by his works, I know what I wil say. For although there be many comparisons, by which the mercy of God, &amp; his iustice may be compared between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:9369:163"/>
in which the works of mercy doe preuaile, yet at the length we finde, that in the posterity of Adam, of whose seede thou also art borne, that there are found many moe vessels of wrath, then of mercy, seeing that there are so many that are damned, and so few that are saued. The cause of which is, not because the grace and helpe of God forsaketh them, or is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto them,<note place="margin">1, Tim. 2.</note> (<hi>For God,</hi> as the Apostle sayth, <hi>would haue all to be saued, and to come to the knowledge of his truth</hi>) but because the wicked are wanting to themselues, and the grace of God is of none effect in them.</p>
                           <p>All these things are remembred more largely and prolixely of me, that thou mayest vnderstand, that notwithstanding the mercy of God, which thou pretendest, God suffereth so many to be Infidels, and in the Church so many euill Christians, and so many Infidels, and so many euill Christians to perish, so also he will permit thee to perish with them, if thou imitatest theyr life. Or when thou wast borne did the heauens reioyce, or shal the iudgements and decrees of God be changed, that the world may be peculier to thee, and another to others? If therfore not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the mercy of God hell be so enlarged, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousand soules be daily swallowed vp of it, shall not thy soule also come thether, if thou continuest in thy sinnes? But that thou mayest not say that God in times past was seuere and sharpe, but now gentle and mild: consider that also with this gentlenes and clemencie he suffereth all that thou hast heard, neyther shalt thou be free and exempted from it, but also thy punishment remayneth for thee, yea, although thou beest called a Christian, if thou beest found a sinner. Or therfore shal God lose his glory if he shall condemne thee? Hast thou I pray thee any singuler thing in thee, for which God aboue others ought to spare thee? Or hast thou any priuiledge, which others haue not, for which he should not destroy thee with others, if thou beest not lesse euill then others be? Consider I pray thee the sonnes of Dauid, for their fathers sake many priuiledges were promised vnto them, but neyther for that cause would the Lord suffer their wickednes vnpunished: wherefore many of them had but sorrowfull ends. Where then is thy vaine trust? Why doest thou vainely hope, they perishing, that thou shalt not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:9369:164"/>
seeing thou art pertaker of their wickednes? Thou errest my brother, thou errest, if thou thinkest that this is to hope in God.<note place="margin">What it is to trust in God.</note> This is not hope, but presumption. For hope is to trust, that God will forgiue thee thy sinnes, if thou be repentant and sorrowfull for them, and turnest from thy wickednes, and that then he will receaue thee into fauour. But it is exceeding great presumption to beleeue that thou shalt be saued, and happy perseuering and continuing in thy sinnes. Doe not think that this is a small sinne; for it is numbred amongst those, which are committed against the holy Ghost: for he that presumeth after this maner, he offereth no smal ignominy &amp; reproch to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine goodnes, which especially is attributed to the holy Ghost. Such sinnes, as our Sauiour testifieth, are not forgiuen in this world, nor in that to come, insinuating that they are remitted with great difficulty; for as much as they shut against them the gate of grace, and offend a Phisitian, who can giue life, &amp; apply the medicine to the wound.</p>

                              <hi>I haue had as great delight in the way of thy testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as in all riches.</hi> And in another place; <hi>The iudgements of the Lord are truth,</hi>

For thys cause not without good reason thou mayst perswade thy selfe that those, who doe so ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate and exaggerate this burthen, and doe imagine to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues that it is so heauy and so vnsupportable, (although they be Christians, and liue vnder the couenaunt of grace) yet they haue not tasted of thys misterie.</p>
                           <p>O thou wretched man, thou that sayest thou art a Christian, tell me why Christ came into the world? Why he shedde his blood? why he ordained his Sacraments? why he sent his holy Spirit into the world? what is meant by the word Gospell? what by the word Grace? and what is the meaning of this most famous and excellent name IESVS? If thou knowest not, enquire of the Euangelist,<note place="margin">Math, 1,</note> and he will tell thee: <hi>Thou shalt call his Name IESVS, for hee shall saue his people from their sinnes.</hi> What other thing meaneth the name of Sauiour &amp; Deliuerer? What other thing to be saued and deliuered from sinnes, then to obtaine pardon for vs for our sinnes past, &amp; grace to eschew those to come? For what other cause came the Sauiour into the world, but that he might helpe thee, and further thy salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Why would he dye vppon the Crosse, but that he might kill sinne? Why would he rise from the dead, but that he might raise thee, and might make thee to walke in newnesse of lyfe? Why did he shed his blood, but that he might make a medicine or a plaister, to heale and cure thy woundes? For what other cause did he institute &amp; ordaine Sacraments in his Church, but to strengthen thee in the progresse of righteousnesse? What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the fruite of his most bitter passion, and comming into this world, but that he might make the way to heauen plaine &amp; smooth, which before was sharpe and rough with thornes, and that he might make it passable and easie to be iourneyed? This
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:9369:166"/>
is that which Esay fore-told should come, that in the dayes of the Messias,<note place="margin">Esay, 40,</note> 
                              <hi>Euery valley should be exalted, and euery mountaine &amp; hill should be made low, and the crooked should be strait, &amp; the rough places playne.</hi> To be briefe, besides all these, why was the holie Ghost sent from heauen, but that thy flesh might be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to spirit? And why did he send him in the forme of fire, but that he might inflame thee as fire, and illuminate thee, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thee into himselfe, and lift thee on high, from whence he himselfe first came? To what end profiteth grace, &amp; all the vertues which proceede from it, but that they may make easie and light the yoke of the Lord? that they might make his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice tollerable? that they might make men couragious in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations? to hope in perrils, and ouercome in temptations? This is the beginning, thys the middle, and this the end of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
                           <p>It is necessary also to know, that as Adam an earthly man &amp; a sinner, made all men earthly and sinners; so Christ a heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man and a righteous, made all men heauenly and righteous. What other thing haue the Euangelists written? What other thing be the promises sent vnto vs from the Prophets? &amp; what other thing haue the Apostles preached? This is the summe of all Christian Diuinitie, thys is that abreuiated worde, which the Lord made vpon the earth. Thys is that consummation and abreuiation,<note place="margin">Esay, 10,</note> which Esay sayth he heard of the Lord, vppon which followed so great riches of righteousnes &amp; vertues in the world.</p>
                           <p>But let vs declare a little more plainly those things which we haue spoken.<note place="margin">Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ariseth.</note> I demaund of thee, from whence thinkest thou that this difficulty ariseth, which is found in Vertue? Thou wilt say, from the wicked inclination of the hart, and from our flesh conceaued in sinne: for the flesh gainesayeth the spirit, and the spirit resisteth the flesh, as two contraries between themselues. Let vs imagine that God calleth thee, and saith vnto thee; Man come hether; I will take from thee that hart thou hast, and will giue thee a new one, I will giue thee strength also, by vvhich thou shalt be able to represse and hold vnder thy appetites and euill concupiscences. If God promise this vnto thee, shall the way of Vertue yet seeme difficult vnto thee? It is certaine that
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:9369:167"/>
it shall not. I pray thee what other thing is it, that God so often hath promised vnto thee? that he hath so often auerred in the holy Scriptures? Heare what the Lord spake in times past by his Prophet Ezechiell, speaking especially to them, vvho lyue vnder the couenaunt of grace. <hi>And I will giue them,</hi> sath he, <hi>a new hart,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Ezech, 11.</note> 
                              <hi>and I will put a new spirit within theyr bowels: and I vvill take the stony hart out of their bodies, &amp; will giue them a hart of flesh, that they may walke in my statutes, and keepe my iudgements, &amp; exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them: and they shall be my people, and I will bee their GOD.</hi> Hetherto the Prophet. Why then doost thou doubt ô man? Is not God sufficient to performe his promise? And if he shall performe his promise, and keepe his credite with thee, shalt thou not be able with his helpe and ayde, to walke in his statutes? If thou shalt deny the first, thou wilt make God a rash and false promiser, and that is exceeding great blasphemie: but if thou shalt say, that thou are not yet with all his helpe able to walke in his statutes and obserue his iudgements, thou makest GOD an impotent prouider and fore-seer, whilst he would haue man to sweare to that he is not able to doe, by giuing him a remedie vnsufficient, which in like manner is false. What other doubt then is there? Why should not Vertue haue force to mortifie these euill inclinations, which fight with thee, and which make the way of Vertue seeme difficult?</p>
                           <p>Thys is one of the chiefest fruites of the tree of Lyfe, vvhich the Lorde hath sanctified by his blood. The Apostle confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this,<note place="margin">Rom, 4.</note> when he saith; <hi>Our old man is crucified with Christ, that the body of sinne might be destroyed, that hencefoorth wee should not serue sinne.</hi> The Apostle in thys place, by the old man and the body of sinne, vnderstandeth our sensuall appetite, with all the euill inclinations that proceede from it. Hee sayth, that thys to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Christ is crucified-vppon the Crosse: for by thys most noble and excellent sacrifice, we haue obtayned grace and strength to weaken and debilitate this Tyrant, so that wee are free from the seruitude of sinne, as before I haue shewed. Thys is that great victorie, &amp; that great benefit, which the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth by Esay, saying: <hi>Feare thou not, for I am with thee: be not afraid,</hi>

This question is aunswerrd by the words of Augustine,<note place="margin">Augustine.</note> who sayth: Lord giue that thou commaundest, and commaund what thou wilt. So that he be the same, vvho commaundeth me what I ought to doe, and he, that giueth me grace to doe it.

So that God in this busines carrieth himselfe to man as a Paynter, who guideth the pencill in the hand of his Scholler, and so maketh a perfect picture: two perfit this worke, but more honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the one then to the other.

Therefore let vs take a man, that hath tryed both estates: that is, who hath some-times serued the world, and hath carnally liued vnder the slauery of sinne; who afterwards by the mercy of God is changed, and becommeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together another man, quite altered from the former.

For these be they that descend into the Sea in shyps, and see the workes of God in many waters: which are the works of the Diuine grace, and the great changes and alterations, vvhich by the meanes of it are daily wrought in men: which certainlie are worthy of all admiration.

But that is most of all to be wondred at, that we see all these things to be doone in a very short time: so that it is not needfull by many yeeres to frequent the schooles of Phylosophers,<note place="margin">The disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ were on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine made learned.</note> and to expect gray hayres, that time and age may helpe the vnderstanding, and mortifie the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: but in the midst of the heate of youth, &amp; in the space of a few daies, a man is so changed, that he seemeth vtterly to be made another, and not the same man that he was before.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore, Saint Cyprian saith, that thys change is sooner felt then learned; neyther is it attained by the study of many yeeres, but by grace, and that in a very short time. Which grace we may worthily call a spirituall enchauntment, by which God after an admirable manner, dooth so change the hart of man, that with a most ardent longing he doth loue that, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the greatest hate he abhorred, I meane the exercise of Vertue; and he doth execrate &amp; detest that with an hate more then that which followed Vatinius, which before he most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly loued, that is, the pleasure of vices.</p>
                           <p>But for the greater confirmation, and more euidence of these things that haue been spoken, I will remember in this place the examples of two famous Doctors of the church, who almost at one and the selfe same time liued in this errour: but afterwards when it pleased the Diuine mercy, that they saw how they were deceaued, they were conuerted; and haue left in wryting both their error and their conuersion, to the edifying of all posterity. One of them is S. Cyprian, who writing to his friend Donatus, and relating the beginning and progresse of his conuersion,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:9369:173"/>
sayth:<note place="margin">Cyprian in his 2, book, and 2, Epist.</note> When I lay in darknes and in the blacknes of the night, and when I nodding and reeling floted vpon the Sea of this billowy and tempestuous world, &amp; walked staggering by blind and erroneous wayes, I being ignorant of mine owne life, and an alien and stranger vnto the truth, and vnto the light; I being at that passe thought that altogether difficult and hard, which the Diuine fauour and mercy promised for my saluation, that is, that any one should be borne againe, and made a new lyuing soule by the bath of that wholsome water; and should put off that he had on before, and although the same lineaments and ioynts of the body remayned, yet he should change his minde and disposition. I sayd, how may such a conuersion be possible, that that should speedily and on a sodaine be put off, which ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being bred in the bone, is soundly confirmed by reason of the solidity of naturall matter, or being accustomed, is so deeply rooted by the customary frequentation of continuall practise? These are firmely and profoundly fixed, and haue taken fast rooting. When shall he learne thriftines and frugality, who hath continually, accustomed himselfe to delicates, feasts, and large banquets? Or how shall hee fit himselfe to homely and simple attire, who hath vsually been inuested with glorious gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and shined in gold and purple? He being delighted and setting his pleasure vpon honours and dignities, cannot abide to be priuate or inglorious. Hee being wayted vpon with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of men, and honoured with a company of officious ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, thinketh it a punishment and a plague when he is alone. He that continually entangleth himselfe with the fast-hold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements of pleasures and vices, it becommeth a necessity vnto him, still to frequent them: his drunkennes inuiteth him, his pride puffeth him vp, his wrath inflameth him, his rapes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet him, his cruelty prouoketh him, his ambition allureth him, and his lust carrieth and driueth him headlong, whether it list. I often considered of these things with my selfe: for as I my selfe was wrapped in very many errors of my former life, which I thought vnpossible to be shut of; so also I was obsequious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vices that did sticke and cleaue vnto me, and despayring of a better estate I abounded with mine owne euils, as though they were proper and naturall vnto me. But afterwards the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:9369:173"/>
of my former life was washed away, by the helpe of that begetting water, and the heauenly light poured it selfe into my purged and clensed breast, and afterwards the second birth had made me a new man, by the operation of the heauenly spirit; after a wonderfull and strange manner, by and by doubtfull matters were confirmed vnto me, secret matters layd open, and matters altogether obscure and darke did appeare; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seemed difficult, now began to be easie; and that seemed possible, which before was thought impossible: as it was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; that to haue beene earthly, which before had liued carnally, was borne in sinne, and endangered with vices; and this to be of God, which now the holy Ghost hath quickened. Thou assuredly knowest, and in like manner thou canst recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize with me, what this death of vices hath hindered vs of, and what this life of vertues hath bestowed vpon vs. Thou thy selfe knowest, neyther need I publish it: because oftentation of selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayse is odious: albeit this cannot be taken as a boast or brag, but acceptably, for it is not ascribed to the vertue of man, but divulged to be the gift of God; that now not to sinne, began to be of fayth; which before to sinne, was of humane errour. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto be the words of Cyprian; by which both thine, and the errour of many others is layd open, who measure the difficulty of Vertue by their owne strength; and therefore they deeme it a thing difficult and impossible to attayne vnto; not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that if they runne to Gods armes, and firmely purpose to auoyde sinne, that the grace of God will embrace them: which maketh this way plaine and easie: as here it is manifest by this example remembred: seeing that it is most certaine, that heere no lyes are told: neyther shall that grace fayle thee, which fayled not this holy man, if thou wilt be conuerted vnto God, as he was conuerted.</p>

Trifles of trifles, sayth he, toyes of toyes, and vanities of vanities, my olde and auntient friends and louers held me backe, and pulled and shaked my
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:9369:174"/>
fleshly vesture, and whispered vnto me, saying: Doost thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse vs? and from this moment shall wee neuer any more be with thee? and from this moment shall it neuer any more be lawfull for thee to doe this and that? And what they suggested in this, that I call this and that; for this ô my God take not away thy mercy from the soule of thy seruant: what vncleannes ô my God, and what dishonesty did they suggest? And I heard them now not halfe so much as before, not so freely, nor so stoutly gayne-standing me in my way, but as muttering behinde my back, and priuily pulling me going on, that I might looke back: yet they hindered me, I lingering to escape &amp; rid my selfe from them, and to passe whether I was called, when as violent cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome sayd vnto me: Thinkest thou that thou shalt be able to passe without these? But this was spoken somwhat coldly. On the other side, he sayd, that Vertue appeared vnto him: The chast dignity of Continency appeared (sayth he) on that side to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which my face was, and whether I was afrayd to goe, of a cheerefull, peaceable, and quiet countenance, not garishly mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; honestly, and vertuously enticing mee, that I should not doubt, but come vnto her, stretching out her religious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout hands to take and embrace me hauing in them an army and a huge band of good examples. There were many young men and maydes, there was much youth, and men of all ages, also matronely widdowes, and graue virgins, and in them all Continency her selfe was not barren, but a fruitfull mother of ioyfull children, thou ô Lord being her husband. And she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided me with an exhortatory irrision, as if she would haue said: Canst not thou doe that which these and these can doe? Or doe these and these it of themselues, or not rather in the Lord their God? The Lord their God hath giuen me vnto them. Why doost thou stand in thy selfe, and not stand? Cast thy selfe vpon him, feare not, he will not withdraw himselfe from thee that thou shouldest fall. Cast thy selfe securely vpon him, hee will receaue thee, and will heale thee. In the midst of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, this holy man sayth,<note place="margin">Chap. 11.</note> that he began wonderfully to weepe, I, sayth he, cast my selfe prostrate vnder a certaine figge tree, I know not how, and I gaue my teares their fill, and floods gush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from mine eyes, thine acceptable sacrifice. And I sayd vnto
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:9369:174"/>
thee many things not in these words, but to this purpose: And how long ô Lord? How long ô Lord? vvilt thou be angry without end? Be not mindfull ô Lord of our olde iniquities. For I perceaued that I was held back of them, and therefore I cast out miserable and wofull plaints and bewaylings: Howe long, how long, to morrow, to morrow? Why not now, why not at this houre is an ende of mine vncleannes? I sayd these things, and I did weepe in the very bitternes of my hart. These and other things being past &amp; finished, which he remembreth, forth-with the light of security being infused into his hart, the darknes of al doubt fled away. The Lord so changed his mind, that afterwards he neyther desired any carnall vices, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanity in this world.<note place="margin">In the 9, book of his Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. chap. 1.</note> And being losed from these chaynes, he beginneth at the entrance of the booke following to giue thanks to God his deliuerer, saying: Lord, I am thy seruant, I am thy seruant, and the sonne of thine Hand-mayde: Thou hast broken my bonds, I will sacrifice vnto thee the sacrifice of prayse. My hart and my tongue doe prayse thee, and all my bones doe say: Lord, who is like vnto thee? Let them say so, and Lord aunswer me, and say to my soule, I am thy saluation. Who then am I, and what an one? What euill am I not? Or was it my deedes; or if not my deedes, was it my words, or if not my words, was it my will? But thou Lord art good and mercifull, and thy right hand respected the profundity of my death, and thou drewest the depth of corruption from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of my hart. And this was wholy that vnwillingnes, which thou willedst, and that willingnes which thou wouldest not. But where was all this long time my wil to doe wel, and from vvhat bottome and deepe Abysse didst thou in a moment call it forth, vvhereby I might submit my necke vnder thine easie yoke, and my shoulders vnder thy light burthen, ô Christ Iesus, my helper, and onely redeemer? How sweete on a sodaine was it for me to want the sweetnes of trifles, and which I was afrayd to lose, now it was a ioy vnto me to lose them. For thou being the true and chiefest sweetnes didst cast them from mee, thou didst cast them away, and for them entredst in thy selfe, being sweeter then any pleasure, but not to flesh &amp; blood: and brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any light, but to the inward secret man, and higher then

all honour, but not to those that are high in themselues. Hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to are the words of Saint Augustine. Tell me now, if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter standeth thus, if the vertue and efficacie of the Diuine grace be so powerfull, what is it that holdeth thee captiue, vvhereby thou canst not doe that, vvhich they haue done? If thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest that these things are true, &amp; that the grace of God is effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, to worke so admirable a change, if it be denied to no man that with all his hart desireth it, (because now also he is the same God, vvhich he vvas then, vvithout respect of persons) vvhat doth hinder thee, vvhy thou goest not out of this wretched ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude, and embracest that chiefest good, vvhich freely is offered thee? Why hadst thou rather vvith one hell to gayne another, then vvith one Paradice to gayne another Paradice? Be not negligent, or vvithout hope.

Whereupon beasts, which feare shadowes, flie all shadowie things, as hurtfull &amp; dangerous, when in deed they are not: So these men, on the contrary part, doe loue and embrace the things of this world, supposing &amp; estimating them to be louely and delectable, when in deed they are not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they that would bring beasts from their shadowie &amp; idle imagination, doe often leade them through those places which they feare: that they may see that that is but a vaine shadowe which they feared: So now it is necessary, that we leade these men through the shadowes of earthly things, who so ordinarily doe loue them, that we may make them to behold them vvith other eyes, that they may plainly see, how great a vanitie and a shadow all that is, which they so greatly admire and loue: and that as those dangers are not worthy that they should be feared, so also these good things are not worthy, that they should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired or loued.

                           <p>GOe to, thou canst not denie to me beginning to dispute of this worldly felicitie, but that all the felicitie and sweetnes of this world (or by what name so euer els thou wilt call it), is short, and of small continuance.<note place="margin">No felicitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world lasting.</note> For this felicitie cannot endure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a mans life. But how long the life of man is, we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared; seeing that it reacheath scarcely to an hundred yeeres. But how many be there that come to an hundred yeres? I haue seene diuers Bishops and Cardinals, who haue scarcelie liued two moneths in theyr dignitie; others elected Popes, who haue scarce sit one month. I haue seene others that haue marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wiues, louing, beautifull, rich, and vertuous, so that nothing seemed to be wanting in them, who haue not enioyed them one week. Very many such examples are remembred vnto vs in the histories of auncient time, which thing to be true, daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence also teacheth.</p>
                           <p>But let vs grant that thy lyfe is longer then other mens: let vs giue thee an hundred yeares (as saith Chrisostome) which is almost the longest time that man liueth: nay let vs adde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hundred yeeres: yea, further let vs ioyne to thee other two hundred yeares, what are so many yeares, if they be compared with eternitie?<note place="margin">Eccles, 11,</note>

By thys it plentifully appeareth, that all the delights, and all the felicity of the world, is vnto them as shadowes of pleasures, which they haue seene onely in a dreame, neyther to haue been so indeede.

                           <head>¶ Of the great miseries that are mingled with worldlie fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities.</head>
                           <p>THE felicity of this world, hath furthermore another euill and mischiefe mingled with it (besides that it is short) which is a thousand kinde of miseries, that as attendants at an inche waite vpon it; which in this lyfe, (or that I may speake better) in this valley of teares, in this wretched banishment, in this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome and turbulent sea cannot be auoyded. For there are
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:9369:177"/>
moe miseries then man hath dayes, or houres of life: for euery day hath his euill, and euery houre hath his misery. But vvhat tongue shall be able sufficiently to expresse all these miseries? Who can reckon vp all the infirmities of our body? all the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of our mind? or recount al the iniuries of man, or aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his life. One wrangleth with thee for thy riches, another lyeth in waite for thy life, a third slaundereth thee; some perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute thee with hatred and enuie; some, thirsting for reuenge, set vpon thee by suborned and false witnes; and this way not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing, assaile thee by force &amp; Armes; to be briefe, some make warre against thee with the tongue, which is worser and more dangerous then any weapon. Besides these calamities, there be infinite other, which haue no certaine names; for they are mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunces vnlooked for, and misfortunes vnexpected. One loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth an eye, another hath his arme cut off in fight, a third falleth from his horse, a fourth out of a window; some are drowned in the water, and others by other mischaunces and misfortunes. If thou desirest to be acquainted with moe mischiefes and euils, aske the men of this world, and they will giue thee many instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, out of the parcell of their pleasures, and out of the bundle of their miseries (the greater part of which they are) which they haue tryed and experimented in this world. For if all ioyes and sorrowes, all myrth and heauines should be weighed and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in equall ballance, thou shouldest euidently see, that these are moe then those; and thou shouldest vnderstand, that for one houre of pleasure, thou hast an hundred of miserie. Wherfore if all thy life be so short, and the greater part of it mingled with so many miseries, I pray thee how much is in thy life, that may challenge true felicitie?</p>
                           <p>But these miseries are common as well to the good as to the wicked;<note place="margin">Some mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, both to the good and euill, some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per onely to the wicked. Wisdom, 5,</note> for they both saile in one and the selfe same sea, &amp; are subiect to the same stormes and tempests. But there are other calamities to be found, which are proper to the wicked, (for they be the daughters of iniquities) the knowledge of vvhich more belongeth to our purpose; for they make their lifes more abhominable, who are within the compasse of such great mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. What they be, and how many, the sinners themselues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse in the booke of Wisedome; <hi>Wee haue wearied our selues in
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:9369:177"/>
the way of wickednesse and destruction, and wee haue gone through dangerous wayes: but wee haue not knowne the way of the Lorde.</hi> Therefore, as the righteous in this life haue a Paradice, and in another life hope for another, so the wicked in this life haue hel, and another attendeth them in the life to come: because, out of the hell of an euill conscience, they goe into the hell of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting torment. Such euils rise out of many causes. Some are of GOD,<note place="margin">Euils of GOD.</note> who, as a iust Iudge, suffereth not the euill of the fault, to passe without the euill of punishment; which although it be generally reserued vntill the other life, yet oftentimes it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in this. For it is most certaine, that God, as hee gouerneth the world by his generall prouidence, so also he swayeth and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth euery one by his speciall prouidence: and as we daily see, that the greater the store of sinners is, the greater is the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of punishments, as are famine, warre, pestilence, heresies, and such like calamities; so also oftentimes, according to the number of the sinnes of men, so is the number of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

Whence many calamities proceede, and many scourges of sinners: for without intermission they, as a wheele are rouled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and sorrance into another; from one necessity, anxietie, and tribulation, into another: which although they very well feele, yet they know not whence and from whom they are sent: and therefore they ascribe them rather to the condition of nature,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:9369:178"/>
then to their sinnes. For euen as they doe not account the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of nature, to be the gifts of God, neyther doe they giue thanks to God for them: so neyther doe they acknowledge the scourges of his wrath to be for the punishment of their sinnes, neyther doe they amend themselues.<note place="margin">Punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts inflicted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, by the Ministers of God.</note> Some punishments also are brought vpon them by Gods Ministers and Iusticers, vvho are the executioners of the Diuine iustice, who oftentimes meet with malefactors, and doe persecute and afflict them, vvith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonments, banishments, penalties, persecutions, and with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other kind of punishments, by which is brought to passe, that the insatiable appetites of sinners seemeth bitter vnto them: and doe afflict the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also in this life.<note place="margin">The euils that passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons bring.</note> There be also other afflictions, which flow out of their owne affections, and the perturbations of their soules, and from the inordinate appetites of their harts.

All these miseries are ingendered of man himselfe, that is, of his inordinate appetites: and of these thou seest, what is to be looked for of other, seeing that man hath these of himselfe: and consider what peace he can haue with others, who hath so great warre with himselfe.</p>

Such in deede, or rather greater is the darknes, in which the world now sitteth, and which now hath possessed the vvorld. But if thou doost not beleeue me, looke a little into the worlds darknes and blind guidance, and thou shalt soone discerne it. Tell me I pray thee, what is more blind, then that men should beleeue as they beleeue, and liue, as they liue? What greater blindnes, then so to reuerence and dread men, and so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly to contemne and despise God? So carefully to seeke and study for the commodities of the body, which is nothing else but a brutish creature, and to haue no care for the soule, which is the image of the Diuine maiefty, what greater blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes can there be?<note place="margin">The blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of men.</note> What greater blindnes, then when wee assuredly know, that we shall dye, neyther doe we know in that houre whether our felicity or misery shall be determined, which for euer shal stand ratified, yet we liue so negligently and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, as if we should alwayes liue? For sinners liue no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to day, then if they meant to liue alwayes, and that death would neuer come. What greater blindnes can be thought vpon then this, that men for the satisfying of one desire, should lose willingly their whole inheritance of heauen? So greatly to esteeme of riches, and so finally to set by their conscience.

                           <p>Such plenty of blindnes and palpable darknes is found in the world, that a man hath good cause to coniecture, that men are inchaunted and bewitched, who hauing eyes, see not, &amp; eares, yet heare not; who when they are cleare and bright sighted to behold earthly things, yet are more blind then Moles, in view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing celestiall things.

But sinne is the greatest of all the euils of this world, and ought to be the most effectuall motiue to mooue vs to forsake the world.<note place="margin">See Cyprian in his 2, booke and 2, Epistle.</note> By this only consideration that glorious Martir Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, endeuoured to perswade a friend of his to despise &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne this world, imagining him to be set on the top of a very high mountaine, whence he might view all things lying beneath him; his eyes being cast on euery side, the holy Martyr sheweth vnto him all Seas, Lands, Pallaces, and iudgement seates, to be fild and replished with a thousand kinde of sinnes and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which were committed in euery place; and when he had seene so many and great euils, which were daily perpetrated in the vvorld, he very well knew, with what great circumspection and care he ought to beware of the world, &amp; how great a debter he was to God, who had vouchsafed him such a caueat, wherby he might detest and abhorre the world.</p>
                           <p>Ascend thou therefore my brother to the top of this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, and cast thine eyes into euery corner of the vvorld, and behold the stormy vvhirle-winds of this boysterous Sea. Looke into the Pallaces of Princes, the Courts and publique meetings of this vvorld; and there thou shalt see so many kind of sinnes, so many lyes, so many cauilations, deceits, iniuries, thefts, enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, flatteries, vanities, and that which is greater, so great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnes of God, and so little care of saluation, that thou canst not but greatly vvonder, and stand amazed in beholding so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and so great euils. Thou shalt see the greater part of men to liue after the manner of beasts, ruled and swayed by the violence of their affections, hauing no respect eyther of iustice, or of the Diuine law, or of nature or reason: lyuing more filthily then the Heathen, who haue no knowledge of the true God, neyther
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:9369:181"/>
doe they thinke that any thing further remayneth then to be borne and to die. Thou shalt see Innocents wrongfully puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and malefactors escape vvithout danger: thou shalt see good men despised, and vvicked men honoured; thou shalt see poore men afflicted and humbled, and in all things fauour to be preferred before equity and vertue. Thou shalt see the lawe sold, no respect being had vnto the truth, thou shalt see vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Arts maintayned, offices peruerted and depraued, and all estates of men corrupted and turned vpside downe. Thou shalt see many dishonest and vild men woorthy to be seuerely puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, vvho by theft and frandulent means haue purchased store of vvealth, to be praysed and feared of all men. To be briefe, thou shalt see the vvorld more deuoutly vvorshipping and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a penny then God himselfe. And vvhen thou hast beheld and ouer-looked all things, thou shalt confesse that it is most truly and iustly spoken of the Psalmist:<note place="margin">Psal. 14.</note> 
                              <hi>The Lord looked downe from heaven vpon the children of men, to see if there were any that would vnderstand, and seeke God. All are gone out of the way: they are all corrupt: there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> Hosea doth no lesse deplore the estate of men:<note place="margin">Hosea, 4.</note> 
                              <hi>The Lord,</hi> sayth he, <hi>hath a controuersie with the inhabitants of the Land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the Land. By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and whooring they breake out, &amp; blood toucheth blood.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But that thou mayest more plainly discerne the condition and estate of this vvorld, take a view of the head, that gouerneth it, and beholding the Gouernour, thou shalt easily vnderstand, the condition of that thing that is gouerned. For if it be true that the Prince of this vvorld, that is of sinners, be the deuill, (vvhich Christ himselfe also affirmeth) vvhat is to be looked for of that body, vvhich hath such an head, and of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vvealth, vvhich hath such a Ruler? This one thing is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to let vs vnderstand, vvhat is to be expected of the louers of this vvorld. What neede we many words? tell me vvhat o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing is the vvorld, then a denne of theeues, an army of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, astie of Swine, a galley full of Pirates, and a lake of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, Cockatrices, and Basiliskes? If the vvorld be thus, and of this kind, why doe I not leaue a place so filthy and impure,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:9369:181"/>
(sayth a certaine Phylosopher) a place so full of traditions and deceits, wherein scarcely any pietie, faithfulnes, or iustice may be found? Wherein all vices raigne, where one brother lyeth in waite for another, where the sonne wisheth the death of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where the wife desireth the death of her husband, and the husband of his wife; to be briefe, where nothing beareth rule but gluttony; enuie, wrath, luxurie, ambition, and all other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils and enormities? Who would not wish to be deliuered from such a world? it is not to be doubted but that Prophet wished it, who said;<note place="margin">Ierem, 9,</note> 
                              <hi>O that I had in the wildernes a cottage of way-faring men, that I might leaue my people, and goe from them: for they bee all adulterers, and an assembly of rebels.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Whatsoeuer hath hetherto been spoken, generally apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth to wicked men: although it cannot be denied, but that in all estates of the world there are many good men, for vvhose sakes GOD spareth to destroy the world. Therefore, vvhen thou shalt see all these things, consider with thy selfe how iust a cause thou hast, to forsake and auoyde a thing so wicked, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and abhominable, in which, if GOD would fully open thine eyes, thou shouldest see more deuils, and moe sinnes, then there be moates in the Sunne-beames. Thys consideration will worke in thee, (at least in thy spirit) a desire to leaue this world, so that thou wilt take vp that of the Prophet,<note place="margin">Psalm, 55,</note> and say; <hi>O that I had winges like a Doue, then would I flie away, and be at rest.</hi>

And mad; for it taketh avvay his iudgement.

For it seemeth to be that it not, it promiseth that it performeth not, and yet these not hindering, it draweth vnto it the greater part of people. For euen as there is found both true gold and counterfeit gold; so there are found true good things, &amp; counterfeite good things: true felicity, and false, which appeareth to be such, but is not: of thys sort is this worldly felicity, which deceiueth vs by a vaine disguised apparition, and painted masking face. For as Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle sayth, many lyes meete with vs, which although they be lyes, yet they haue greater showe and apparance of truth, then the truth it selfe. So certainly (and it is matter worthy of obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) certaine euils and enormities are found, which albeit they be euils indeed, yet they haue greater semblance and apparance of good things, then the good things themselues. And of thys number is the felicity of this world: and by reason of this appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the ignorant are deceaued by the show of it, no otherwise then byrds and fishes by a false baite.

O how often dooth such like guile and fraude make heauie the hart of man, after it hath got that it desired; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as those things offer themselues in the progresse, which were not promised in the beginning.</p>
                           <p>But what shall I say of offices, dignities and honours? vvith what a smiling countenaunce, &amp; faire aspect do they first shew themselues? but afterwards, to howe many passions, care, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies and labours doe they expose their possessors? But of those that are entangled with vnhonest loues, we may iustly say, that at the beginning they finde a pleasant entrance into that darke and denious Laborinth, but when they haue passed in, alack, how many labours and troubles doe they beare? hovve many nights doe they passe ouer without sleepe? how many &amp; how great dangers are they compelled to vndergoe? For the fury of that venomous dragon (which is the sword of that cruel parent, and of that iealous husband) dooth alwayes keepe the fruite of that forbidden tree, and it often co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to passe, that such men in one moment, doe lose together theyr lifes, riches, honors, and soules.</p>
                           <p>After the same maner it were no hard matter to examine the lifes of couetous men, seruing the world, and catching at by all meanes by force and fauour, the vaine-glory of it, in whose tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies we might behold a merry protasis, but a lamentable and mournful epitasis: for this is the nature of that Babylonian cup, which without is gold, but within full of poyfon.

If the worlde fawne vpon thee, it doth it, that it may deceitie thee; if it exalt thee, it doth it, that thy fal may be the greater; if it make thee merry, it dooth it, that it afterwardes with sorrow may breake thy hart.

                           <p>NOW wee haue declared and showen how miserable and deceitfull the felicity of this world is, it remaineth now that we proue that true felicity &amp; tranquility, as it is not to be found in the world, so it is onely to be found in GOD alone: which demonstration, if it were rightly vnderstood of the men of thys world, they vvould not be so carefull for it, nor so tied and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ynto it, as they are. And therefore I thinke that it vvill be worth the labour, if I shall adde this manifest truth vnto the precedent, and establish it not so much by the authority and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of fayth, as by reasons. Therfore first we must know, that no creature can perfectly rest and be at quiet, so long as he commeth not to his last end, which is his last perfection agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vnto his nature. For so long as he commeth not thether, he must of necessity be vnquiet, as that creature, that suffereth violence by reason of some defect.</p>
                           <p>Doost thou then demaund what and who is the last end of man?<note place="margin">Obiectiue beatitude.</note> in whose hand his felicity is placed? vvhat is that, that the Diuines call the obiectiue beatitude? I cannot deny, but that it is God, who as he is the first beginning of man, so is he also his last end. And as it cannot be, that there should be two first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, so it is imposibble, that there should be two last ends. For this were to make two Gods. Furthermore, if God be the last end of man, he is also his last beatitude and felicity; but it is impossible that there should be two last ends, or two felicities. Therfore it cannot be, that without God there should any feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city be found.<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> For euen as a Gloue is made for the vse of the hand, and a scaberd, that a sword may be sheathed in it: So also the hart of man is created for the vse of God, neyther without him can any rest be found. The reason is, because seeing that the principall subiect of felicity is in the vnderstanding and will of man, so long as these two faculties are not quiet, so long can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not man be quiet. But because it is without controuersie, that these two faculties cannot be quiet, but onely in God, therfore these two faculties are neuer at quiet, vntill they finde out some
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:9369:184"/>
vniuersall obiect, wherein are all good things. Which when it is once knowne and loued, then there is nothing further, that the vnderstanding desireth to know,<note place="margin">Onely God can satisfie the hart of man.</note> or the will to loue. Hence it is, that nothing created, although it be the empire and rule of the vniuersall vvorld, can satisfie the hart of man, he onely being excepted, for whom it was created, that is God alone. Plutarch reporteth of a certaine Souldier, who through many degrees of dignity, at the length came to be made Emperour. Now when he had attayned so great honour, and found not that quiet and peace in it, which before he promised to himselfe to be in this estate, he sayd: I haue runned through al the degrees of all dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, but I haue not found quietnes and tranquillity in any of them. Neyther is it any meruaile, because that which is created for God, without him cannot finde any quiet or rest.</p>
                           <p>But that thou mayst vnderstand this the better and more manifestly, behold the Sea-mans needle, and it will teach thee this so necessary Philosophy.<note place="margin">The nature of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</note> It is the nature of that Iron, that in what part it hath touched the load-stone, that that part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes looketh towards the North. For God, who hath created this stone, hath bestowed vpon it this naturall inclination. Thou seest, the experience of the thing teaching thee, how that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle runneth, and turneth to and fro, and with great vnquietnes moueth to euery corner, vntill it hath found that poole, &amp; then it resteth and standeth vnmoueable, no otherwise, then if it was fastened downe with a nayle. So hath God created man, and hath infused into him a certaine naturall inclination and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that he should alwayes looke to his maker as to the poole and his last end. Therefore so long as he is without him, like that needle he is vnquiet, yea, if he was the Lord of the whole vvorld: But turning and directing his hart to God, forth-with he resteth, and as that needle standeth vnmoueable; for in him he findeth rest. Of this is followeth, that he is onely happy, who possesseth God, and that he commeth the nearer vnto happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, who goeth the lesser way from God. But because the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in this life are the nearer vnto God, therefore they are the more happy, albeit the world knoweth not their felicity. The reason is, because this felicity consisteth not in a sensible and corporall pleasure, as the Epicures sayde, and after them the
<pb facs="tcp:9369:184"/>
Moores of Mahometistes, and after them the wicked and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Christians, who with their mouthes deny the law of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet, but in their lifes follow it, and diligently obserue it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seeke for any other Paradice in this life, then that of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens. Therefore true felicity consisteth not eyther in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or in external things, but in the Spirit, and in spirituall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and inuisible, as both the Philosophers of sounder iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and also good Christians (although after a diuers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) doe auouch and affirme.

For it not to be doubted, but all that they possessed, dyd not so much gladde them, as that only appetite afflicted them, which had the deniall, because to possesse many things, maketh not a man quiet, but to haue satisfied &amp; contended hys will. Which thing amongst others, Saint Augustine doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently declare in a booke of the manners of the Church,<note place="margin">Aug. of the manners of the Church, 1. booke &amp; 3. chap.</note> in these words: In my iudgement, he is neyther sayd to be happy, who hath not that he loueth, whatsoeuer it be: neyther he that hath that he loueth, if it be hurtfull: neyther he that loueth not that he hath, although it be the best thing. For he that desireth that he cannot obtaine, is vexed: &amp; he that hath obtained what was not to be wished, is deceaued: and he that desireth not, that which is to be obtayned, hee is not of a well disposed minde. Whereupon it is inferred, that our felicity consisteth in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session and loue of the chiefest good, neyther any other to be true without it. So that these three things, possession, loue, and the chiefest good, make a man blessed and happy. Without which, no man at any time shall be blessed and happy, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he be.</p>
                           <p>Although I could alledge very many examples for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this conclusion, yet we will content ourselues, with that one of Haman so well beloued of King Assuerus: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he was happy in all things in the iudgement and sight of the world, he thought great iniury was offered vnto him, because Mardocheus dyd not rise vp vnto him when hee pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore, calling together his friends and his wife, he layd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen before them the greatnes of his riches, and the multitude of his chyldren, and what great glory and honour the King had bestowed on him, aboue all other Princes and seruants, how he had exalted him, and sette him aboue them all. <hi>Yea Hector the

But all this doth nothing auaile mee, as long as I see Mardocheus the Iew sitting at the Kings gate,</hi> not yeelding me that reuerence I desire. Marke then thys place, &amp; thou shalt see,<note place="margin">No man happy in this world.</note> that thys one small thing, more disturbed and troubled hys hart, then all his other prosperities could make it happy. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der also, how farre a man is of in this lyfe, from that peace and manquilitie of minde, and how neere vnto disturbance &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation. Who then in thys world is found, who can effect thys, that he should not be miserable? What Kings or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours are found, to whom all things succeed according to theyr desire, and to whom some thing happeneth not, which distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth and disquieteth their mindes? For although in this respect that a man is a man, no aduersity doth touch or come neer vnto him, yet who can escape all the mischaunces of fortune, vvho can auoyde the infirmities of the body, or eschew all the feares, fantasies, and vaine imaginations of the soule, which a man fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth without reason of feare, and so is many times afflicted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause.</p>
                           <p>If all these fore-sayd reasons beeing so euident cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince thee, and thou requirest moe reasons rather from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then reason, goe to wise Salomon, and he, as one that hath long sayled in thys Sea, with greater prosperity then any other, trying and experimenting all kindes of the delicacies and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of thys world: he, I say, will saythfully instruct thee in this matter, what he hath seene, and what he hath tryed; he will tell thee, if perhaps he hath other where found, that which satisfied his appetite, if thou shalt demaund of him what it was, hee will aunswer thee, saying:<note place="margin">Eccle, 1,</note> 
                              <hi>Vanitie of vanities, sayth the Preacher, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of vanities, all is vanitie.</hi> Beleeue him, thou shalt not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued: we may safely trust a man so well experimented. For he dooth not speak vnto thee of his theory and speculation, but of his experience and practice; hee dooth not tell thee of those things he heard, but which he saw and proued. Doe not think, that thou thy selfe, or any other, can discouer moe nouelties, and heretofore vnheard of, then he heath discouered and tryed. For what Prince euer lyued in the worlde, that was wiser, or
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:9369:186"/>
richer, or more glorious, or famouser then Salomon? Who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tryed moe kindes of delights, of sports, of huntings, of sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of women, of ornaments, of ridings, and of all other things, then he dyd? And when he had tryed them all, hee reaped no other fruite by them, then that thou hast heard. Why wilt thou now experiment that, which hath been already experimented? perswade not thy selfe that thou canst find that, which he found not. For thou hast none other world to search for it, then that that he had. And if all pleasures could not quench the thyrst of thys King in so plentifull a vintage, doe not thinke that thou canst quench it after him, in thys leane &amp; barren gleaning time of Grapes. He bestowed his time to thys onely study, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for thys he fell into Idolary: as sayth Saint Ierome, wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Eustochium. Why then wilt thou make such hauock of precious time, without expectation of any profit? Yea because men rather credit experience then reason, peraduenture God permitted, that this King should make tryall of all pleasures, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and recreations, and of whatsoeuer the world loueth, that after he had tryed them all, hee might giue that testimonie and verdit of them, which euen now thou hast heard: and that this one labour should be instead of all other labours, and this one mans error, should remedy the errour of many, that they might bestow theyr tyme, and cost more profitably.</p>

                              <hi>O yee sonnes of men, howe long will yee turne my glory into shame, louing vanitie, and seeking lyes?</hi> With good reason he nameth vanity and lyes. For if in the busines &amp; assayres of thys world, there were no other thing but vanity, it were a small euill: but there is another greater euill in it, that is, lyes, and the false &amp; counterfeit apparance of things, by which they perswade men that they are some-thing, vvhen they are nothing. Wherefore, the same Salomon sayth; <hi>Fauour is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull, and beautie is vanitie.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Psalm, 31.</note> It were some-what tollerable, if it were but vaine, but it is also deceitfull. For vanity being known, cannot much hurt: but that which is vaine, and appeareth not to be so,<note place="margin">The world an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</note> that is especially euill and dangerous. By this it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, how great an hypocrite this worlde is: for euen as hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are studious to couer and palliate theyr defects: so rich
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:9369:186"/>
men doe labour, that they may dissemble and hide theyr myse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by which they are excruciated. They would be accounted Saints, when they are sinners; and these happy when they are wretched.</p>
                           <p>Come neerer, and if you please open and search the vayne, put thine hand into theyr bosome, &amp; thou shalt see how those things striue and fight, which outwardly seeme so, wyth those things, which in verity lurke within. Certaine hearbes &amp; plants grow in the fieldes, which a farre of seeme very beautifull: but when thou commest neerer them, and gatherest of them, they are eyther altogether leaues, or send forth a stinking and pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent sauour, which a man forth-with casting away, correcteth the errour of his eyes by the touch of his hands. Such certainly are they, that seeme to be the rich and great men of this world: for if thou beholdest theyr magnificencie, pompe, &amp; the height of theyr dignity, the statelines of theyr houses, theyr seruant, &amp; flatterers, thou wilt thinke them the onely happy men; but if thou shalt come a little neerer vnto them, and shalt narrowlie pry into the secrets of theyr houses, and into the corners of their soules and consciences, thou shalt see that there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between these things, and the externall apparance &amp; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward show. Whereupon many, who haue thirstingly desired theyr estate and condition, viewing it a farre of, but a little after more neerely looking into it, haue reiected and refused it, as we reade in many histories of the Heathen. In the lifes also of the Emperours, it is reported, that there haue beene some of them, who when they were elected to that high estate of dignitie of theyr whole Armie, for a time haue resisted that election, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would accept of that soueraigntie offered vnto them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they very well knew, what pricking thornes lay hyd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Rose so faire and beautifull to the sight. Therefore, ô yee sonnes of men, created according to the Image and simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of GOD, redeemed by the blood of Christ, adopted that ye may be fellow cittizens with Angels, how long will yee loue vanitie? and seeke after lyes? Doe yee looke for peace and rest in these false and counterfeite apparitions, which they neuer gaue, nor will giue? To what end doe yee forsake the table of Angels, and seeke to fill your bellies with the swash of Swine?
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:9369:187"/>
To what end doe we leaue the sweetnesse and odoriferous fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancie of Paradice, for the bitternes and stinch of this world? Why are not the calamities and miseries which yoe suffer daily, sufficient to warne you to flye the outragiousnesse of this cruell Tyrant?</p>
                           <p>Pardon me (gentle Reader), we seeme in this respect not to be much vnlike a harlot, who hath prostituted herselfe vnto an Apple-squire or a Pandar, he eateth, drinketh, and sporteth with her, vntill all be consumed that she hath; after that he doth floute and beate her, neither vouchsafeth he her a faire word: the neuertheles doting on this knaue, the more he beateth her, the more she loueth him. Therefore, recapitulating all that hath beene spoken, if it hath beene prooued manifestly by so many reasons, examples, and experiences, that that peace and felicitie which we seeke for, cannot be found but onely in God, and not in the world; why doe we seeke for it without GOD, and not rather in him?<note place="margin">S.

For euen as God is a goodnes so vniuersall, that in him alone are found all the perfections of all good: so after a certaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the same are found in Vertue.

Which thing if it be so,<note place="margin">In vertue all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are found.</note> how great loue is Vertue worthy of, in which alone all these perfections are found? For if we speake of honesty, what is more honest then Vertue, which is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and roote of all honesty? if of honor, to what is more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reuerence due then to Vertue?

If thou desirest to be gracious, and acceptable among all men, there is not any thing more gracious or more conducent to it then Vertue.<note place="margin">Cicero in Loeli.</note> For, as Cicero sayth, nothing is more amiable then Vertue, nothing that more allureth men vnto loue; seeing that for vertue and honesty we loue them, whom we neuer saw.

embasie to a righteous man, which we haue set in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front of this booke, and now againe repeate in the end. <hi>Say yee, surely it shall be well with the iust.</hi> Say yee so, because he is borne vnder an happy starre, and that he shall die in a good houre; because his life and death is blessed, and whatsoeuer after death shall beside him. Say yee so vnto him, because all things shall goe well with him, as well prosperous as aduerfe; as well things pleasant,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> as heauy; both in quietnes and in labour. <hi>For all things worke together for the best vnto them that loue God.</hi> Say yee vnto him, although the vvorld be turned topsey turuey, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments confounded, if heauen be ruinated and disturbed, let not him feare: yea, then let him lift vp his head, because the day of his redemption is at hand. <hi>Say yee, surely it shall be well with the iust.</hi> Because a blessing is prepared for him, vvhich in excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie exccedeth all blessings, that is God himselfe: and that he is free from all euill, and from the tiranny of the deuill, which is the worst of all euils. <hi>Say yee, surely it shall be well with the iust.</hi> For his name is vvritten in the booke of life; and God the father hath adopted him for his sonne, &amp; the holy Ghost to be a liuely temple vnto him. <hi>Say yee, surely it shall be well with the iust.</hi> For that estate which he hath gotten, is happy &amp; blessed in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. And if at any time in any temporal matter it seemeth lesse happy, if this be patiently borne, it is turned vnto him for a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good: for that which seemed a loose, vnto him that is patient, is made a gayne vnto him; &amp; his labour becomes a reward, and his warre victory,<note place="margin">Gen. 31.</note> and a perpetuall crowne. As often as Laban changed the wages of Iacob his sonne in law, he thought that it was profitable vnto him, &amp; hurtfull to his sonne in law; but it fell out cleane contrary, for it was vnprofitable vnto him, and profitable to his sonne in law. Wilt thou then, my brother, be so cruell to thy selfe, and such an enemy, that thou shouldest linger to embrace so great a blessing, which promiseth on euery side so great good vnto thee? What counsaile is more wholsome? what more profitable condition or estate of life canst thou fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? <hi>Blessed are those that are vpright in their way,<note place="margin">Psalm. 119.</note> and walke in the law of the Lord,</hi> saith the Prophet: a thousand times blessed are they, and <hi>blessed</hi> againe, <hi>that keepe his testimonies, and seeke him with their whole hart.</hi> If a good thing, as the Philosophers say,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:9369:188"/>
be the obiect of our will, and by how much the more any thing is good, by so much the more it deserueth to be loued &amp; desired: What I pray thee doth make thy will so sottish and insencible, that it tasteth not, nor embraceth this so vniuersall a good? O how much better did that King, who sayd: <hi>I haue chosen: the way of thy truth,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">In the same Psalm.</note> 
                              <hi>and thy iudgements haue I layd before me. I haue clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to thy testimonies ô Lord.</hi> And in another place: <hi>O Lord, I haue layd vp thy commaundements in mine whole hart:</hi> He saith not in a corner, not in his hand, but in the midst or in his whole hart, which is the beginning of life; the chiefest &amp; the best place of all others: as if he had sayd, This is my best part, in which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue and determine of all my busines, and all my cogitations are in it. The men of this world do contrarily; for vanity possesseth the chiefest roome of their harts, and Gods law lyeth obscured and hid in some corner. But this holy man, albeit he was a King, and troubled with many businesses of his kingdome; yet he put them all vnder his feete; but placed the law of his Lord in the midst of his hart. What hindereth then, why thou doost not imitate this good example, and embrace so great a good. For if thou respectest the bond of the obligation, what greater obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can there be, then that which is betweene God and man, or only for that cause, that he is, what he is? All the obligations of this world are not worthy of this name, if they be compared with this, as we haue sayd in the beginning of this booke. If thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest vnto the benefits, what benefits can be greater or more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then those, that we receaue from the hand of the Lord? For besides that he hath created vs, and redeemed vs with his blood, we haue receaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him all that we possesse both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without, our body, our soule, life, health, riches, grace, (if so we haue it) the continuance of our life, our purposes, the desires of our harts, and all that which hath the name of essence, or of goodnes, we receaue it I say originally fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all essences and of all goodnes. Words are wanting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, by which I might set out her profit; let Angels vtter it, and not men. For what greater profit can there be then to enioy eternal glory, &amp; to be freed from euerlasting paine, which is the reward of Vertue? If the temporall commodities of this world doe rather moue vs, what commodities can be more excellent,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:9369:189"/>
or of greater valuation, then those twelue priuiledges and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues, which Vertue and the vertuous doe solace and delight themselues, the least of which is of more force and validity to quiet a disturbed mind, then al the dignities and treasuries of this world. I kow not truly, what more may be put into the ballance, to weigh and peise those things, which are promised to Vertue, and to her louers.</p>
                           <p>The excuses also &amp; cauillations, which the men of this world are wont to bring for their defence, are so ouerthrowne &amp; spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of vs, that I doe not see where such may find a small hole or crany to escape through, vnlesse perhaps of set purpose &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced malice they shut their eyes and eares; that they might not see nor heare this manifest and euident truth. What remaineth, but that the perfection and beauty of Vertue being seene and knowne; thou say with Salomon, speaking of Wisedome, the companion and sister of Vertue:<note place="margin">Wisdom. 8.</note> 
                              <hi>I haue loued her, and sought her from my youth: I desired to marry her, such loue had I vnto her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. In that she is conuersant with God, it commendeth her nobility: yea, the Lord of all things loueth her. For shee is the Schoolemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse of the knowledge of GOD, and the chooser out of his works. If riches be a possession to be desired in this lyfe, vvhat is richer then wisedome, that worketh all thinges? For if prudence worketh, what is it among all things, that worketh better then shee? If a man loue righteousnes, her labours are vertuous: for shee teacheth sobernes and prudence, righteousnes, and strength, which are the most profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things that men can haue in this life. If a man desire great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, shee can tell the things that are past, and discerne things to come: she knoweth the subtisties of words, and the solutions of darke sentences: she fore-seeth the signes and wonders, or euer they come to passe, and the successe of seasons and times. Therefore I purposed to take her vnto my company, knowing that shee would counsaile mee good things, and comfort mee in cares and greefes.</hi> Hetherto the Wise-man.</p>
                           <p>Therefore nothing remayneth, but that we conclude this matter with the words of Saint Cyprian,<note place="margin">Cyprian in his 2, book, and 2, Epist.</note> taken out of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to a friend of his, written of the contempt of this world; Therfore, sayth he, there is one peaceable and faythfull tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; one solide, firme, and perpetuall security, that if any one
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:9369:189"/>
be taken out of the whirle-winds of this turbulent world, and be founded and anchored in the hauen of safety, he lifteth vp his eyes from the earth to heauen, and being admitted to the Lords fellowship, and now being neere vnto his God in his minde, whatsoeuer amongst humane things seemeth great and lofty vnto others, he glorieth that it lyeth within the circumference of his conscience. Now he can desire, nor couet nothing of the world, who is greater then the world. How stable and vnfoyled a defence is it, how celestiall a gard abounding with perpetuall good things, to be deliuered from the snares of this entrapping and enthralling world, &amp; to be purged from these earthly dregs and incorporated into the light of eternal immortality? Let him consider of this, and view it well, ouer whom the deceitful dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerousnes of this pernicious enemy before raged &amp; tirannized; we are compelled more to loue, when we know and condemne what we were, and see what we now are and shal be. Neyther is this worke brought to passe by rewards, bribes, and the power of man, but it is the free gift of God, and easily obtayned. As the sunne shineth of his owne accord, the day is enlightned, a fountaine streameth, and a shower falleth; so the heauenly spirit infuseth it selfe. Afterwards the soule beholding heauen, and knowing her Maker, she being higher then the earth, and more noble then any earthly power, beginneth to be that, which she beleeueth her selfe to be. Onely thou whom the heauenly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare hath appoynted a Souldier in these spirituall warres, hold and keepe thy standing incorrupt, and fenced with religious vertues, vse continually eyther praying or reading: Somtimes talke thou with God, and somtimes God with thee: let him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct thee with his precepts, let him haue the guiding and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of thee: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he maketh rich, no man shal make poore. There can be no penury, where the heauenly bounty hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and blessed. Now coffers stuft with crownes, now stately Pallaces, and gay buildings will seeme base and vild vnto thee; when as thou knowest that thou thy selfe are more beautified and adorned, being a house in which the Lord sitteth as in his temple, and where the holy Ghost dwelleth.

It is the first steppe vnto Vertue (as a certaine VVise man saith) to flie vice; after which a man may speedily and without cumbrance, prepare himselfe to the exercise of Vertue. Therefore we will deuide this doctrine into two parts: In the first part wee will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of the commoner vices, and will sette downe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies conuenient for the same.

For albeit that it is true, that we haue many helps and supportations in this life, as we haue sayd before, neuertheles it cannot be denied, but that many difficulties doe offer themselues in the beginning, which the young Souldier of Christ ought to haue premeditated, least they come as at vnawares and discourage him: and let him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes haue in mind the reward and price, for which he fighteth, that it is of so great value, that it deserueth this, and much more.</p>

This is the chiefest foundation of a spirituall life; this is that by which the friendship and fauour of God is kept, and the hope of the kingdome of heauen. In this Charity consisteth, and the spirituall life of the soule. This is that that maketh the sonnes of men the sonnes of God, temples of the holy Ghost, liuely members of Christ, and maketh them perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of all the spirituall blessings of the Church. So long as the soule perseuereth in this determination, it abideth in Charity, &amp; in the state of saluation; but so soone as it steppeth back from it, it is blotted out of the booke of life, and is registred in the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of perdition, and is transported to the kingdome of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. So that this busines being well considered of, it seemeth, that as in all things as well naturall as artificiall there is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and an accident, betweene which there is this difference, that the accidents being changed the substance still remayneth; euen as the pictures of an house being defaced,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> and the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture spoyled, the house notwithstanding standeth firme on the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:9369:194"/>
foundations, albeit not with the same perfection; but if the house fall, which is the substance, then nothing remayneth: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same manner, as long as this holy and sanctified purpose standeth firme and fast in the soule, the substance of Vertue standeth vnmoueable; but if that faile, forth-with all things fall. The reason of this is, because the whole foundation of a godly life consisteth in Charity, which is to loue God aboue al things: but he loueth God aboue all things, who aboue all things hateth sinne: for only through sinne this charity and loue of God pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth. For euen as adultery is the most contrary thing to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; so that which is most contrary to a godly and vertuous life is sinne: for this killeth Charity, in which this life consisteth. For this cause the Martyrs haue suffered so greeuous and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible torments, not refusing to be rosted, to be fleane, and to be cut in peeces, to be bowelled, to be racked, to be torne in peeces of wild beasts, rather then they would sinne, by which they might lose the fauour of God, yea, although it was but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; not being ignorant in the meane time, but that they might repent after the offence done, and might be againe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned into fauour: as Saint Peter was, after that hee had thrice denied Christ. Neuerthelesse, they had rather suffer all the torments of the vvorld, then for so short a time to want the Diuine fauour. Of this euery where we haue many examples, but amongst others of three vvomen; one of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the mother of the seauen sonnes in the Machabees, and two vnder the new Testament, one of which is called Felicitas, the other Symphorosa, each of them in like manner the mother of seauen Sonnes. All these three were present, at the tortures and martyrdome of their sonnes, and seeing them to be rent and torne, and the flesh with the skinne to be pulld from the bones, vntill theyr bowels and intrals gushed out, they did not only not faynt, beholding so sorrowfull a spectacle, but they comforted their sonnes, and encouraged them, admonishing them to fight manfully for the fayth and obedience of God. At length they also with theyr sonnes for the same cause most constantly yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp their lifes.</p>
                        <p>But after these famous &amp; illustrious examples, I will here set downe another, which is rehearsed of S. Ierome, in the life of
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:9369:195"/>
Paule the first inhabiter of the Wildernes.<note place="margin">Iorome in the life of Paule the Hermite.</note> The Tyrant, saith he, commaunded another in the florish of his young yeeres to be brought into a most pleasant Garden, and there amongst the white Lillies and the redde Roses, where a bright Riuer made a delectable noyse, &amp; the winde made a pleasant ruffling among the leaues of trees, he commaunded a soft bed of Downe to be made, and that he might not roule himselfe off from it, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to be left lying vpon it, fettered with bonds of silke: to whom, when all the rest were departed, came a very beautifull harlot, who began to coll &amp; kisse him, &amp; vse al daliance to ripen lust, and that which is a shame to be spoken, shee dallied vvith his priuities, that his body beeing thus prouoked to lust, shee might gette the maistry ouer him. What this souldier of Christ might doe, and whether he might turne, he knew not: whom torments had not conquered, nowe pleasure ouercame. At length, beeing inspired from aboue, hee bit off his tongue, and spet it in the face of the harlot kissing him, and so he quenched the heate of his lust by the greatnes of his paine. Surely a deed maruailous heroick, and such an one as hetherto hath not been found eyther in the histories of the Greekes or Latines.</p>
                        <p>Let these suffise to shew, with howe cheerfull and manly a courage these Saints resisted sinne. I could also alledge other examples of them, who had rather be tumbled naked vppon thornes, and in the deepe of Winter be rouled vpon snow and Ice, then they would satisfie the lust of their flesh, which bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them, the deuill blowing the coales. Wherefore, that man that determineth to enter into this way, ought firmely to fasten this purpose in his mind, more to esteeme the fauour of God, (as a iust Iudge of things) then all the treasures of thys world, and alwayes to renounce the lesser, that the greater may be kept, when he is in the like need. In this he ought to ground his life; this ought to be his obiect in all his actions; let him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly craue thys of God in all his prayers; to this end he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Sacraments of the Church. Let him gather thys out of Sermons, and out of the reading of godly Bookes: let him take this out of the creation of the world, &amp; the forming of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: let him reape this fruite especially out of the passion of Christ, and out of the rest of the Diuine blessings; for the fruite
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:9369:195"/>
of these is not to offend him, to whom so great things are due: and according to the soundnes of this holy feare and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, let him measure the quantitie of his profit, equalizing the strength and firmnes of his purpose according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the profit, so that by how much that is greater or lesser, by so much his resolution may be greater or lesser. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, euen as he that would fasten a naile into a wall,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to haue giuen one, two or three strokes with a mallet, but he so long smiteth it and forceth it forwards, vntill it stick fast: so this purpose and resolution, ought not to be sufficient for a man, there to stay, let it be what it will, but he must daily labour and endeuour, that of all things that he seeth, heareth, readeth, or meditateth vpon, he take an occasion, whereby the loue of God may more and more increase in him, that hee may hate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre sinne more and more. For by how much the hatred of sinne shall more and more increase in him, by so much shall he perceiue himselfe to haue profited and fructified in the Diuine loue, and consequently in all vertue.</p>
                        <p>But that hee may more firmely persist and continue in thys resolution, let him perswade himselfe, &amp; assuredly beleeue, that if all the euils, paines, and sorrowes of the world, from that time it first began, to this present houre, were put in one ballance, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the punishments, which all the damned suffer in hell; and in the other ballance one onely sinne were put, it is certaine that he should rather preferre the escape from this sin, before all the rest, and flye from it more speedily then from all those tribulations and punishments; albeit the blindnes of thys Egipt, or of thys world is so great, that men thinke far otherwise. Neyther is it maruell, that the men of this world being blind, do not see this so great an euill, or that they being deade, doe not feele a wound so hideously gaping: for it is not giuen to blinde men to see any thing, although it be very great, neyther to the dead to feele a wound, albeit it be deadly.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, I beeing about to handle in this second Booke the doctrine of Vertue which hath sinne for her contrary, in the first part I will entreate of the irreconcileable hatred of sins, and specially of the remedies of them: for the rootes of sinnes beeing pluckt out of the soule, the plants of vertues may bee
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:9369:196"/>
more easily ingrafted, of which wee will speake in the second part.<note place="margin">The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of this Booke.</note> Neyther onely will we speake here of those sinnes, vvhich are accounted horrible and abhominable amongst men, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of those, which the world reckoneth not of, and which they make no scruple to commit. We will begin with those seauen mortall and deadly sinnes which are called capitall, because they are the heads and rootes of all other. This doctrine will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, that a man, when he is mightily assaulted and tempted, may haue refuge and recourse to this doctrine, as to a spirituall defence, and that out of many remedies, which are set downe in this part, hee may select and choose those for himselfe, vvhich are more conuenient for his purpose. It is true that many of these remedies are common for all kinde of vices, yet some are particuler, sette downe for certaine vices, as when I say against Pryde, against Couetousnes, and so in the rest. Of these in this part we will speake, setting downe speciall remedies for euerie sinne, that the prouision and furniture of spirituall Armor may be in a readinesse alwaies for vs to vse at all needes.</p>
                        <p>We must consider &amp; note in this place, that we haue no need of Hercules his strength to fight in this spiritual combat, neither of winged feete to flie away, but of cleere and bright eyes to see; for eyes are the chiefest weapons and instruments of this warre; for wee are not to fight against flesh &amp; blood, but against most peeuish and peruerse deuils, who are spirituall creatures. The reason is; because the first roote of all sinnes, is the errour of the vnderstanding, which is the counsailour of the vvill. For thys cause our aduersaries doe especially labour this, that they may corrupt our vnderstanding; for the vnderstanding beeing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, the vvill also is corrupted, which is gouerned and guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of it; therefore they endeuour to colour euill with good, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> vice vnder the show and semblance of vertue, and so to hide the temptation, that it seemeth not temptation, but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For if they assault any man by ambition, by couetousnesse, by wrath, or desire of reuenge, they perswade him, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together agreeable vnto reason to desire this, that this or that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection desireth; and that it is against reason not to lust after that, that it lusteth after. After this manner they pretend reason, that they may so much the more easily deceiue them, who are
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:9369:196"/>
ruled by reason. Wherefore, it is very necessary that we should haue sharpe-sighted eyes, that wee may see the hooke lurking within the baite, least wee be deceaued with the shadowe and likelihood of goodnes. Eyes also are necessary vnto vs, that wee may see the malignity, filthines, dangers and losses, which vices bring with them, that our desires may be restrained by this bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, &amp; may feare to tast that, which being tasted bringeth death. Hence it is that those beasts in Ezechiell,<note place="margin">Ezech, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>.</note> which are the figures of holy men, were full of eyes round about, that thereby might be signified, howe necessary these spirituall eyes are for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of GOD, that they may defend themselues from vices. Therefore of this remedy we will in this tractate especially en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate, to which we will also adioyne all others, which seeme to bring any profit, as shall be more plainly seene in the discourse following.</p>

For euen as the rootes of trees beeing cut vp,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> the boughes &amp; branches, which receiue life from the rootes, doe foorth-with wither and perish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so those seauen generall &amp; vniuersall rootes of all other vices beeing hewen in sunder, and vtterly eradicated, suddenly also the vices will dye, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued from them. For this cause Cassianus with great diligence writ eyght bookes against these vices: in which kinde of studie, many other learned and graue men haue imitated him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> they did see that these enemies being ouerthrowne, others could not lift vp their heads. The reason of this is, because all sinnes doe originally flow from selfe-loue: because euery one of them is committed through the loue &amp; desire of some particuler good, to desire which, this selfe-loue pricketh vs forwards. From this loue those three branches do spring, of which S. Iohn speaketh in his Canonicall Epistle:<note place="margin">1, Iohn, 2,</note> which are; <hi>The lust of the flesh, the lust
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:9369:197"/>
of the eyes, and the pride of life.</hi> Which (that I may expresse them by more known names) are the loue of carnall delights &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and the loue of riches and honours. These three loues are deriued from that first. For from the loue of pleasure three sins are engendered, Luxurie, Gluttony, &amp; Idlenes. From the loue of riches, Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tousnes ariseth, and from the loue of honour, Pride. The other two, Wrath and Enuye, serue each one of these peruerse &amp; corrupt loues. For Wrath proceedeth thence, that a man cannot obtaine that he desireth; and Enuye thence, that any one is preferred before vs, or that any one hath obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that we desired.</p>
                        <p>Seeing therefore that these three are as the vniuersall rootes of all euils, from which all these seauen sinnes proceede, these seauen beeing destroyed, the whole Armie of other vices shall be ouerthrowen. Therefore all our studie ought to be to thys end, that we fight valiantly against these Gyants, if we will try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ouer all other enemies, who possesse the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. Among these vices Pryde is the most powerfull, which is an inordinate appetite of our owne excellencie. The Saints doe call this the Mother and Queene of all other vices. Wherefore, not without cause amongst many other instructions, holy Toby said to his sonne:<note place="margin">Tob, 4.</note> 
                           <hi>Suffer not pride to raigne in thine hart, or in thy mouth: for in pride destruction tooke her beginning.</hi> Therefore, when as this pestilent beast doth assault thy hart, thou maist de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy selfe with the weapons following.</p>
                        <p>Consider first that horrible punishment, with which Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and his Angels are punished, because they were proude: for in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, hee with his Angels was cast from the highest heauen, downe to the deepest hell.

If it could doe so much in Angels, what can it not doe in thee, who art dust and ashes? For God is not contrary to himselfe, neyther is hee an accepter of persons; and as he suffered not pryde in Angels, so also in men it dooth displease him,<note place="margin">August. to a certaine Earle.</note> in whom he looketh for humilitie. Hence it is that Saint Augustine saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Humilitie maketh men
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:9369:197"/>
like vnto holy Angels, &amp; pride, of Angels maketh deuils. And that I may speake plainly, Pride is the beginning, end, &amp; cause of all sinnes, because it is not onely a sinne, but that no sinne is, or hath been, or shall be without it. This saith he. And Bernard saith;<note place="margin">Bernard in a certaine Sermon.</note> Pride casteth downe from heauen to hell, Humilitie ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from the lowest place to the highest: an Angell falleth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the loftiest height to the lowest pitte, and man ascendeth from out the world to heauen.</p>
                        <p>Then with this punishment let vs consider of the inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example of the humility of the sonne of God, who for vs tooke vpon him the most abiect nature of man, and for vs in like manner was obedient to his father euen to the death of the Crosse. Learne therfore ô man to be humble; learne ô earth to obey; learne ô dust to be despised. Learne ô man of thy God, for he is meeke and humble in spirit. If it seemeth not honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inough vnto thee to imitate the example of other men, imitate the example of the God of Gods, who became man, not only that he might redeeme vs, but also that he might teach vs humility.</p>
                        <p>Cast thine eyes also vpon thy selfe, for in thy selfe thou shalt finde that may perswade humility. Consider what thou wast before thou wast borne, what thou art now being borne, and what thou shalt be after death. Before thou wast borne, thou wast filthy and obscene matter, not worthy to be named; now thou art dung couered ouer with snow; and a while after thou shalt be meate for wormes. Why then art thou proud ô man, seeing that thy natiuity is sinne, thy life misery, and thine end putrefaction and corruption? If the possession of temporall goods doe puffe thee vp, stay a while, and death will come, who maketh the begger equall with the King, and the cottage with the crowne. For as we are all borne alike and equall, as much as pertayneth to the condition of nature; so we all dye alike and equall by reason of the common necessity, that being excepted, that after death they haue the greater count to render, who here haue possessed more. Wherfore Chrisostome sayth excellently well: Looke into the Sepulchers of the dead, &amp; seeke amongst them for tokens and notices of that magnificence, in which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:9369:198"/>
this world, which they enioyed whilst they liued. Tell me where are now their ornaments, their precious and costly apparell, their delights and pleasures? they are all past away, all gone, all their magnificent and riotous banquets, laughters, sports, and all the mirth of this world is faded and vanished away. Come neerer to the Sepulcher of whom so euer thou wilt, and thou shalt find no other thing here but dust, ashes, wormes, and putrified bones. Here then is an end of all bodies, yea, although fed and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with the greatest delicates and dainties of the world. And I would to God that here were an end of al euils: but that which followeth is much more dreadfull; that is, the fearefull tribunal of the Diuine iudgement; the sentence that there shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; the weeping and gnashing of teeth, the vtter darknes without hope of light, and the gnawing worme of conscience, which neuer shall dye; and to conclude, the fire, that neuer shall be quenched.</p>
                        <p>Consider moreouer of the danger, which vaine glory the daughter of Pride bringeth with it, of which Saint Bernard thus speaketh:<note place="margin">Bernard in a Sermon.</note> Feare an arrow, it flyeth lightly, and pierceth lightly, but I say vnto thee it maketh no small wound, it sodainly killeth. Vaine glory is this arrow. If men at any time doe prayse &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thee, forth-with enquire, whether that be in thee, which they so magnifie and extoll: for if that be not in thee, thou art praysed in vaine, and gloriest without cause. But if perhaps this be found in thee, for which they prayse thee; say with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle: <hi>By the grace of God I am that I am.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1, Cor, 15.</note> For thou mayst not be proud of it, but rather humbled, and giue the glory to God, to whom thou owest all that thou art, least perhaps thou makest thy selfe odious vnto God; for it is not to be doubted but both the honour, which is giuen vnto thee, and the cause for which it is giuen, are both of God, and belong vnto him. Therfore all the glory, that thou doost arrogate vnto thy selfe, thou stealest from God; but what seruant can be found more vnfaithfull then he, that stealeth the glory of his Lord?</p>
                        <p>Consider also what great folly it is, that thou shouldest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme of thine owne power and ability according to the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men, in whose will it is to encline the ballance to whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side they will: for he that praysed thee ere while, now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayseth
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:9369:198"/>
thee; and he that now disprayseth thee, will soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter set forth thy prayse with great honour. If thou thinkest that thine honour dependeth of their tongues, thou shalt finde that somtimes thou shalt be extolled to the skie, and somtimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed euen to hell, and thy glory euen beate to dust and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: euen as it shall please the mutable tongues of men. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neuer measure thy selfe by the prayses of men, which are giuen out of thee but according to that thou art, and which is in thy selfe: albeit men extoll and magnifie thee, yet looke thou into thy selfe, what is in thee, and what thy conscience telleth thee: Rather beleeue thy selfe, to whom thou art better known, then others, who see thee a farre of, and iudge of thee as it were by heare-say. Contemne therfore the iudgments of men, and commit all thy glory to the hands of the Lord, who is wise to keepe it; and faithfull to restore it.</p>
                        <p>Ponder also with thy selfe, ô thou vnhappy ambitious man, into what danger thou castest thy selfe, thou desiring to rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer others, who hast not yet learned to gouerne thy selfe. How canst thou giue an account for many, who canst not answer for thy selfe? Consider of the great danger, into which thou castest thy selfe headlong, by coueting to adde the sinnes of thy sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects vnto thine own, and by putting thine and theyrs into thine owne reckoning. Wherfore the Scripture also sayth: <hi>An hard iudgement shall they haue that beare rule:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Wisdom, 6.</note> 
                           <hi>For he that is most low is worthy mercy, but the mighty shall be mightily tormented.</hi> But who can recount the multitude of troubles, which they are encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with all, vnto whom the rule of others is committed. A certaine King of the Armenians very well vnderstood this,<note place="margin">A saying of Tigranes King of the Armenians.</note> who when he was to be crowned, considering of the cares &amp; paines, that Empire brought with it, taking in his hand that princely and dignified cloth, with which the Kings head was wont to be crowned, and long looking vpon it, sayd: O noble rather then happy cloath, which if any one throughly knew how stuffed it were with cares &amp; dangers, he would not stoope to the ground to take it vp.</p>
                        <p>Acknowledge, ô thou proud man, that thy pride doth please no body, because thou thy selfe art acceptable to no body. Thou doost not please God; for he is contrary vnto thee, <hi>Hee

resisteth the proude,</hi>

                           <hi>and giueth grace to the humble.</hi> Thou doost not please the humble, who without doubt doe exceedingly hate thee: for they abhorre all pride and ambition. Thou doost lesse please other proud men like vnto thy selfe: for by reason of that, that puffeth thee vp, thou art hatefull vnto them, for they cannot abide a greater then themselues. Neyther canst thou content thy selfe in this world, vnlesse thou repentest, and acknowledgest thy vanity and thy folly: and much lesse canst thou content and please thy selfe in the other world, where for thine execrable pride thou shalt be tortured with euerlasting torments. Wherfore the Lord sayth by the mouth of Saint Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard: O man, if thou well knewest thy selfe, thou wouldest displease thy selfe, and please me; but because thou doost not know thy selfe, thou pleasest thy selfe, and displeasest me. The time will come, in which thou shalt neyther please thy selfe, nor me. Thou shalt not please me, because thou hast sinned; thou shalt not please thy selfe, because for euer thou shalt burne in hell. Thy pride onely pleaseth the deuill, who when he was a most beautifull Angell, became a most terrible deuill. Wherefore naturally he is delighted with those that are lyke vnto him.</p>
                        <p>It will helpe thee also in the way of humility, if thou consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest, how few thy merrits are before God, and how few or none thy seruices, which may be truly and purely called so: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are many vices found in them, which haue a show of Vertue, and also vaine glory doth corrupt oftentimes many works which are good of themselues, neyther sildome is that vild in Gods eyes, which shineth most gloriously in the eyes of men.

For how can it be, that a man should not humble his thoughts,<note place="margin">See Bernard in his 36, Sermon vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Canticles.</note> who being enlightned with the brightnes of truth without flattery vnderstandeth himselfe to be loaden with sinnes, burdened with the masse of this mortall body, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with earthly cares, infected with the dreggs of carnall concupiscence, blind, weake, inwrapped in many errors, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to a thousand dangers, encompassed with a thousand ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, plunged in a thousand difficulties, prone vnto vices, and wayward vnto vertues.

Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture although he be lesse continent then thou, or weaker, yet he is more humble then thou art, or wiser, or more patient, or more feruent in charity. Therefore, thou oughtest rather to consider what thou lackest, then what thou hast: and to looke rather vpon the vertues, which are in another, then those that are in thy selfe. For such a consideration will preserue thee in humility, and will stirre vp in thee a desire of perfection. But contrarily, if thou shalt cast thine eyes vpon that that thou hast, &amp; which is wanting to another, thou wilt suppose thy selfe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he, and so thou shalt fayle in the study of Vertue.

                           <p>When thou shalt feele thine hart swell and lifted vp, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently thou must apply the remedy, in remembring thy greatest transgressions, and by thys meanes one venim is expelled vvith another, as Phisitians vse to doe. And so after the manner of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Peacocks, looking to that which is the filthiest and foulest in thee, thou maist suddenly cast downe thy Peacocke plumes of vanitie. By how much greater thou art, by so much behaue thy selfe more submissiuely: For if thou beest an inferiour man, and one of lowe degree, it is not so materiall if thou beest humble: but if thou beest of high degree, and famous through great and noble dignities, and yet neuerthelesse shalt be humble and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is thank-worthy, and thou purchasest to thy selfe a great and a rare vertue. For humility in honour, is the honour of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:9369:200"/>
and the dignity of dignity: but if humility be absent, the dignity of it selfe perisheth. If thou wilt aspire to the vertue of humility; folow the way of humiliation: for if thou wilt not be made low, neither euer shalt thou be said to be humble. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that many are made low &amp; abased, who are not truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet it is certaine, that humiliation, as Bernard sayth, is the way to humility,<note place="margin">Ber. in his 88. Epistle.</note> as patience is the way to peace, and as reading to knowledge. Therefore, if thou desirest the vertue of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, refuse not the way of humiliation. Therefore humble thy selfe vnto God, and, as Saint Peter admonisheth, vnto euery or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, for Gods sake.</p>
                           <p>Saint Bernard wisheth that three feares may alwayes dwell in our soules:<note place="margin">Ber. in hys 54.

When it is present, feare, least thou proue thy selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it: when it is gone, feare much more, because where grace fayleth, there thou faylest also: feare therefore grace bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, as though thou shouldest presently fall; feare, because thy guard hath forsaken thee. But if grace shall be so propitious vnto thee, as againe to returne, then much more feare, least thou haue another relapse, which is exceeding dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. And after this manner fearing, doe not presume any thing of thy selfe, being full of the feare of the Lord. Be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in all thy persecutions: for in the suffering of iniuries true humility is tryed. Doe not despise the poore: for the misery of thy neighbor, rather deserueth compassion then contempt. Let not thy garments be curious; for they that loue precious and costly garments, are sildome humble in hart; and they that put them on, loue to be seene of men: for, sayth Gregory, no body will there be clothed with sumptuous and rich apparrell,<note place="margin">Greg. in his 40. homily vpon the Gospels.</note> where he may not be seene of others. Take heede also, that thy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be not too vild and base, and vnworthy of thy degree; least while thou seekest to shunne vaine-glory, thou fall into it.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ouetousnesse is an inordinate desire of riches. Wherefore, not onely he that stealeth, but also he that desireth another mans riches with an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate desire, and hee that inordinately keepeth them, is couetous. The Apostle condemneth this vice,<note place="margin">1, Tim, 6,</note> when he sayth: <hi>They that will be rich, fall into tentation and snares of the deuill, and into many foolish and noysome lusts, which drowne men in perdition and destruction. For the desire of money, is the roote of all euill.</hi> The naughtines and malignitie of this vice, cannot be described more cunningly or curiously. For it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by these words, that that vnhappy man, who is subiect to this euill, is the seruaunt and slaue of all other sinnes. Wherfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this vice doth assault thine hart, thou shalt defend thy selfe with these weapons following.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Christ an example pouertie.</note>First therefore, ô thou couetous man, consider, that vvhen the Lord and thy GOD descended from the highest heauen to the earth, he would not possesse riches, which thou so great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desirest; yea he loued pouerty so wel, that he would take flesh of a Virgin most poore and lowly, and not of a Queene rich &amp; mighty. When he was borne, he would not lodge in a stately and wealthy pallace; he would not lye vppon a soft bed; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused dainty swadling-clothes, &amp; embraced for his cradle a hard Cratch. So long as he lyued in the world, he alwayes loued po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, and contemned riches; He chose his Apostles and his Embassadours, not Princes and great men, but base and abiect Fishers. What preposterous order then is this, that the most vild worme should seeke riches, which the Lord of al the world, and of all creatures, contemned for his cause.</p>
                        <p>Consider furthermore, the exceeding great basenes of thine hart, that when as thy soule is created according to the image &amp;
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:9369:201"/>
similitude of God,<note place="margin">How vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, &amp; how vilde a thing it is, to lose thy soule for gold.</note> and redeemed by his owne blood, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of which all the world is nothing, yet thou art not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to lose it for so small a gaine. God would not haue gyuen his life for the whole world, which notwithstanding he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly layd downe for the soule of man. Therefore thy soule is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier, and of more price then the whole world. True riches are not gold, nor siluer, nor precious stones: but they are found in Vertue, which a good conscience bringeth with it. Relinquish the false opinion of men, and thou shalt see that gold and siluer are no other things, but yellow and white earth, which through the errour of men is crept into so great credit. That which hath been despised by all the Phylosophers of the world, doost thou beeing a disciple of Christ so much esteeme it, that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest make thy selfe a seruant and slaue vnto it? For as S. Ierome saith, he is a seruant vnto riches, who keepeth and tendeth them as a seruant; but he who hath cast off that yoke, deuideth them as a Lord.</p>
                        <p>Consider also what the Lord sayth in the Gospell:<note place="margin">Math, 6,</note> 
                           <hi>No man can serue two Maister, God and Mammon,</hi> that is, riches. The soule cannot freely serue God, if it follow and hunt after riches so greedily, and with so open a mouth. Spirituall delights, doe shunne a hart busied and occupied about earthly matters: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe things counterfeit and true, agree together, nor things hie and low, temporall and eternall, spirituall, and carnall, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any man reioyce and recreate himselfe, in them both together.</p>
                        <p>Consider in like manner,<note place="margin">Riches bring many euils, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with them.</note> that by howe much more prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously earthly matters succeede with thee, by so much perhaps thou art more miserable, by reason of that pledge which here is giuen vnto thee; that thou maist relye vpon vaine felicity, which heere is offered vnto thee. Ah that thou knewest what great euils, and how many inconueniences thys small prosperity brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with it, thou shouldest see the loue of riches more to afflict by desire, then to delight by vse. For it enwrappeth the soule in diuers temptations; and bindeth it in infinite cares: it allureth it with sundry delights, prouoketh it to sinne, and disturbeth the quiet no lesse of the body then of the soule. And that vvhich is greater, riches are neuer gotten without trouble, nor possessed
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:9369:202"/>
without care; nor lost without griefe; and that which is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, they are sildome gathered without sin and offence to God. Hence is that prouerbe; A rich man is eyther a wicked man, or the he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Consider moreouer, how great an errour it is, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to desire those things,<note place="margin">Riches doe not satisfie the appetite A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> which albeit they be most plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet they can neuer satisfie the desire of man, yea they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke it, and inflame it more, as drinke in a Dropsie is the cause of greater thirst; so that although thou hast, yet thou alwaies couetest that, which thou wantest, and alwaies couetest more and more. So that the miserable and wretched hart, wandering through all the things of this world, is wearied, but neuer satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: it drinketh, but the thirst is not quenched: for it estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not those things which it hath, vnlesse also it possesse in like manner those things, which further it may haue: and there is no lesse trouble for things, which it compasseth not, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is pleasure in things, which it possesseth; neyther is the heart more satisfied with gold, then the body with wind or ayre.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, not without cause Saint Augustine maruelleth, saying:<note place="margin">Aug. of the words of the Lord,</note> What greedines, sayth hee, of desire is this, seeing that the beastes haue a meane? For then they rauine, when they are hungry, but they spare the pray when they feele fulnes. Onely the couetousnes of riches is vnfatiable; it alwayes raueneth, and is neuer satisfied, neyther feareth GOD, nor reuerenceth man, neyther spareth Father, nor acknowledgeth Mother, neyther yeeldeth vnto brother, nor keepeth fayth with friend.</p>
                        <p>Consider that where much riches is, there are many that eate and deuoure them, many that couet them, and many that lye in waite to steale them.<note place="margin">Riches are not safe.</note> What hath the richest man of this world more of all his riches, then whereof he may necessarily lyue? &amp; of thys yrksome care thou maist disburthen thy selfe, if thou wilt cast thy care vpon God, and commit thy selfe to his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: for God neuer confoundeth them that trust in him. For whom God made, he will not suffer to die through hunger. He that feedeth the foules of heauen, and clotheth the Lillyes of the field, how is it possible that he should forsake man; especially, seeing that so small a thing sufficeth the necessity of man? The life is short, &amp; death followeth at our heeles; what need is there
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:9369:202"/>
then of so great prouision for so short a iourney? What wilt thou doe with so much riches, especially seeing that the lesse thou hast, the more lightly and freely thou mayest walke? and when thou shalt come to the end of thy pilgrimage, if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est poore, thy estate shall not be worser, then rich mens, who are loaden with much gold. Yea it shall be much better: for thou shalt feele lesser griefe in forsaking this trash and pelfe of the world, and a smaller account is to be rendered before God. On the contrary part, rich men in the end of their iourney, leaue their mountaines of gold not without great griefe of hart, which they adored as GOD: neyther without exceeding great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and hazard vnto them an account is to be rendered of those things they possessed.</p>
                        <p>Consider also,<note place="margin">Riches pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit nothing in death.</note> ô thou couetous man, for whom thou gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest so great riches: for it is most certaine that like as thou camst naked into this vvorld, so thou shalt depart naked hence: thou entrest poore, and shalt returne poore. These things are often to be meditated of thee. For he easily contemneth all things, sayth Ierome, who perswadeth himselfe that he shal dye. At the houre of death thou must leaue all temporal things, onely thy works, which thou hast done, whether they be good or euill, shal waite vpon thee: then thou shalt remember how thou hast changed eternal things for things temporal, in heaping vp of which thou hast consumed thy time, thy affections, and all thy labours. Then thy goods shal be deuided into three parts; thy body shal be giuen to the wormes, thy soule to deuils, and thy temporal goods shal fall to thine heires, which perhaps shal be vngrateful, spend-thrifts, and wicked. Therfore it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and safer to follow the counsaile of our Sauiour, who willeth vs to deuide our goods amongst the poore, that they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare an entrance into life for vs;<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> as the Princes of this vvorld doe, who determining a voyage, doe send their furniture and treasure before them, and such prouision as would hinder theyr speede, and they themselues follow after. What greater folly and madnes I pray thee can be thought of, then to leaue thy treasure in a place, to the which thou shalt neuer returne againe: and not to send it before thee to that place, in which thou shalt alwayes abide?

For we are not only bound to restore, but also forth-with to restore; If so be we be able; but if we be not able forth-with to restore, or not able to restore the whole, by reason of pouerty, in such a case we are not bound to the one, nor to the other. For God compelleth no man to performe impossibilities.</p>
                           <p>To the confirmation of this conclusion I think that we need not many words,<note place="margin">Gregory in the 1. booke of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. chap. 2.</note> for that of Saint Gregory will be sufficient, who writing to Iustinus, a certaine Pretor of Sicilia, sayth: Let
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:9369:205"/>
not any bribes or gaines allure and hale thee to iniustice, let no mans threatnings or friendship make thee to decline from the right and straight way. It is a thing diligently and seriously to be thought of, that we leaue all gaines and bribes here behind vs, and carry to iudgement onely the pleas and actions of harmfull and hurtfull gaines. What greater madnes is there then, then here to leaue the profit, and to carry the losse with thee? to doe another man a commodity, and to disprofit thy selfe? to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure mirth to another, and torment to thy selfe? vvhat is more foolish, then to suffer punishment for that in another life, which of others is consumed in this? Furthermore, it is an intollerable error, that any man should more esteeme his riches then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and rather make shipwrack of his soule then of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; &amp; expose his body to the sword, that his garment might not be rent. Such an one whosoeuer he be, seemeth to me not much to differ from Iudas, who for a few pence sold iustice, sold grace, and sold his owne soule. To conclude, if it be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine (as we assuredly beleeue) that thou in the houre of death (if thou meanest to be saued) art bound of necessity to make restitution, what greater madnes can there be, then when thou art bound to restore and repay that thou owest, to persist and continue in sinne to the houre of death, to goe to bed in sinne, to rise in sinne, to liue and receaue the communion in sinne, and to lose all that he loseth, who perseuereth in sinne, rather then to restore forth-with? vvhat perdition can be greater in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersal world? He seemeth to haue no iudgment, who slenderly accounteth of so great a losse.</p>

doth tempt thy minde, and thy flesh beginneth to tickle and prouoke thee, thou shalt meete these motions with the cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions following.</p>
                        <p>First and formost consider with thy selfe, that this vice doth not onely pollute and contaminate thy soule,<note place="margin">Luxury polluteth the liu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if it be a great wickednes to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the materiall Church of GOD, what an hainous offence will it be to prophane this temple, which is the liuely habitation of the true God? For <hi>euery sinne,</hi> sayth the Apostle, <hi>that a man dooth,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1, Cor, 6,</note> 
                           <hi>is without the body, but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his owne body:</hi> that is, by prophaning and coinquinating it with carnall lust and fleshly sinne.</p>
                        <p>Consider that this sinne cannot be done without the scandall and preiudice of many persons, which concurre to the effecting of it: which thing wonderfully afflicteth the conscience at the houre of death. For if the Law of the Lord commaundeth that life is to be tendered for life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth: how can he giue a like recompence to God, who hath destroyed so many Christian soules? howe shall hee be able to make satisfaction for so many soules, which Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased vnto him by his precious blood?</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end bitter. Prou, 23,</note> See how many delights and pleasures this sinne hath in the beginning, but the end is most bitter: the entrance is easie, but the issue and egresse most difficult. Therefore the Wise-man sayth; <hi>A whore is as a deepe ditch, and a strange woman is as anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row pit.</hi> Ingresse to her is easie, but egresse difficult. For truely there is nothing found, in which men are more easily taken, then in the sweetnes of this sin, which appeareth by the beginnings and entrance into it. But when as hands haue strooken friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and this league is confirmed, and lust hath captiuated thy soule, who shall be able to deliuer and free it? Wherefore not without cause this sinne is sayd to be most like a fishers Weele or bow-net, which hath a large entrance into it, but a narrovve getting out; and therefore the fishes that once goe in, cannot get out. Hence it appeareth, how great is the multitude of sins which ariseth from this one, when as in all that time, in which
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:9369:206"/>
the way is prepared, and the deede committed, God is a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand wayes offended, by thoughts, desires, and workes.</p>
                        <p>Consider furthermore,<note place="margin">Mischiefes ioyned to this vice.</note> (as a certaine learned Doctor sayth) what a multitude of other mischiefes this deceitfull pestilence bringeth with it. First it spoyleth thy good name, which is the most precious thing that belongs to man, neyther is there any sinne, that pulleth more haynous infamy vpon thee, then luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie doth. After that it weakeneth and enfeebleth the strength of man, it taketh away the beauty, it hurteth the sound constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it bringeth infinite diseases, which are both filthy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull; it perisheth and blasteth the florish and blossome of thy youth, neyther suffereth it to bud and increase; it bringeth old age before the time, it breaketh the force &amp; strength of thy wit, it dulleth the subtiltie of thine vnderstanding, and maketh a man like vnto a brute beast. It with-draweth man from all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest studies and exercises, and drowneth him in the sea of carnal pleasures, so that miserable man dare not presume, nor offer to speake o
f +any other thing, then of dishonest and carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</p>
                        <p>It maketh young men foolish and reprochful, and exposeth old men to the scorne of men: Neither is this vice content thus to haue plunged men, vnlesse also it ouerthrow and squander a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode his riches and substance. There are no riches so aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, no treasures so infinite, which luxury will not exhaust &amp; consume in a short time. For the belly, and the instruments of lust are neere neighbours, and very well agree betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and are faythfull complices &amp; confederates in this work. Hence it is, that men giuen to luxurie, are for the most part prodigall and lauishers, and delight in banquets and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; and riches are chiefely consumed through gluttony, and sumptuosnesse of apparell. Thys also is common to all luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons: vnhonest women are neuer satisfied, neyther euer cry they hoe, albeit very many ouches, tablets, iewels, precious stones, rings, and such like be giuen them, and they take more delight to be honoured with such things, then with theyr wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched louers, who giue these vnto them. All these are proued to be true by the example of the prodigall chyld,<note place="margin">Luke, 15,</note> 
                           <hi>who spent all his substance by liuing riotously and luxuriously.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="394" facs="tcp:9369:207"/>Remember, that the oftner thou gyuest thy thoughts &amp; thy body for a pray to carnall lust, thou shalt finde the lesser satietie in them. For the delight doth not bring satietie vnto them, but doth procure and increase a further thirst: for the loue between a man and a woman is neuer altogether extinguished, yea the flame when it is supposed extinct, on a suddaine reuiueth, and burneth more fiercely.</p>
                        <p>Consider moreouer diligently, that the pleasure, which is reaped of thys vice, is short, and momentany, but the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which followeth, is eternall. Surely this change is too vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall, that for so filthy a pleasure, of so short continuance, thou shouldest lose in this lyfe the ioy of a good conscience, and in that to come euerlasting glory; besides, to suffer paines vvhich neuer shall haue end.

For to liue in the flesh without sensual car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, this is to liue rather an Angels life, then an humane lyfe. Thys is that which Bernard sayth;<note place="margin">Bernard, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, 42</note> It is onely chastity, that in this place and tyme of mortality, representeth a certaine state of immortall glory. For amongst the solemnities of marriage, it onely chalengeth the custome of that blessed Country, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they doe neyther marry, nor are marryed, shewing on the earth, after a certaine manner, an experience of that heauenly conuersation. For this cause that singuler priuiledge is giuen to virgins in heauen, of which S. Iohn writeth in his Reuelation: <hi>These are
they,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Apoc, 14,</note> sayth he, <hi>which are not defiled with women, for they are virgins: these follow the Lambe whether soeuer he goeth.</hi> And because they haue performed better things in the world then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, following the Lord Iesus Christ in pure virginity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the world to come they shal come more neere vnto him, and shall more familiarly conuerse with him, and shall singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly be delighted with the purity of theyr bodyes. Thys vertue maketh men not onely like vnto Christ, but also temples of the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:9369:207"/>
holy Ghost. For the holy Spirit being a louer of purity, as hee detesteth the pollution of luxurie, more then other vices (albeit all vices displease him) so in nothing more willingly or with greater ioy he resteth, then in a soule pure and cleane from all carnall pleasure. Wherefore the sonne of GOD conceaued by the holy Ghost, so loued and priced virginity, that for the loue of it he did this stupendious miracle, that is, he would be borne of a Mother being a Virgine. But if thou hast lost thy virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, at least after shipwracke feare the dangers, which now thou hast tried: and thou who wouldest not keepe the benefit of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture vncorrupted, now it is corrupted, stryue to repaire it, by conuerting thy selfe vnto the Lord, and so much the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently turne thy good workes vnto God, by how much for thy sins thou hast iudged thy selfe woorthy of greater punishment. For often-times, saith Saint Gregory, it commeth to passe, that the soule after sinne is more feruent, which in the state of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inn
ocencie, was luke-warme, and altogether negligent. And because GOD hath preserued thee, albeit thou hast commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so enormous sinnes and offences, commit them nowe no more, least God chastise thee together, both for thy sinnes past, and also for those present: and so the last errour be worse then the first. With these and such like considerations, man ought to arme himselfe against this sinne. And these be the remedies of the first kinde, which we haue gyuen against this sinne of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urie.</p>
                        <div type="section">
                           <head>¶ Other kind of remedies against Luxurie.</head>
                           <p>BEsides those remedies, which commonly are wont to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered against thys vice, there are others also more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and more particuler, of which wee will also speake in thys place. Let thys therefore be the first, stay the beginnings, kill the Serpent when it is young: for if the enemy be not repelled at the first onset, he increaseth and becommeth stronger. For, as Saint Gregory sayth, after the desire of pleasure is kindled and encreaseth in the hart, it suffereth a man to thinke on nothing els, but on filthy pleasures and vncleane lusts. Forthwith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the motiues of vices must be killed in the mind, whilst they are yet but onely in thought: for euen as wood preserueth fire,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:9369:208"/>
so the thought preserueth and nourisheth desires &amp; concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scences: and if the thoughts be good, they doe kindle the fire of charitie;<note place="margin">The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sences are to be kept.</note> if they be euill, they stirre vp the flame of lust. It is needfull also, that all the outward sences, but especially the sight, or the eyes be most diligently kept, least they see that, which may procure danger; for oftentimes a man simply seeth that, which when it is seene, woundeth the soule. Therefore vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly to looke on women, eyther peruerteth, or weakeneth the constancy of the beholder. Therefore Ecclesiasticus doth giue thee very good counsaile:<note place="margin">Ecclesi. 9.</note> 
                              <hi>Gaze not on a Mayde, that thou fall not by that that is precious in her. Goe not about gazing in the streetes of the Citty, neyther wander thou in the secret places thereof. Turne away thine eye from a beautifull woman, and looke not vpon others beauty.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>To perswade this, that doctrine of holy Iob ought to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, who although he was a most iust man, yet neuerthelesse he did keepe his eyes most diligently,<note place="margin">Iob, 31.</note> as he speaketh of himselfe, neyther did he trust to himselfe, neyther to the long experience of his good life. But if this be not sufficient for thee, ad also the example of Dauid; who although he was a most holy man, and a man according to Gods owne hart, yet when he beheld a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he fell into three most greeuous sinnes, into adultery, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, and murder. Thy eares also must be carefully kept, least they heare obscene &amp; vnhonest speaches; which if thou at any time shalt heare, let them displease thee; for a man is easily brought to effect that in his deede, which he with ioy heareth with his eares. Refraine also thy tongue, that thou speake not filthy and vncleane words: for euill words corrupt good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The tongue doth discouer the hart of a man, and bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his affections: for the tongue speaketh out of the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the hart. Let thy hart be alwayes busied with holy thoughts, &amp; thy body with godly exercises: for deuils cast into an idle soule dangerous thoughts, sayth Bernard, with which it is occupied, that although the offence be not in deede, yet it is in thought.</p>

For, as Chrisostome sayth, then the deuill more boldly insulteth ouer men and women, when he espieth them alone; and where many feareth not the reprehendour, hee is the bolder, and the tempter commeth the nearer: beware ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to conuerse with women, when no witnes is by; for solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines inuiteth to all mischiefe.

What strong Lyons hath this one delicate infirmity, which is luxurie, tamed, which being vild and miserable, yet maketh a pray of those that be great? And in another place: Beleeue me assuredly, I speake by experience, before the Lord I lye not, I haue knowne the Cedars of Libanus, the guides of the flocks to haue fallen by the pestilence of luxury, whose falls I did no more suspect, then I suspected the shamelesse rebuke of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose and Ierome.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Nuie is a greefe taken at the good of another man, and an irksomnes conceaued by another mans felicity: I meane at one greater then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; whom he enuies because he cannot be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall vnto him; and at his inferiour, because he thinks that he would be equall vnto him; and at his equall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his degree and state doth iumpe with his. So King Saule enuied Dauid, and the Pharises Christ, who lay in wayte for their lifes: for so cruell a beast is this enuy, that it cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, nor any way brooke those men, whom it enuieth. This sinne is mortall and deadly, and Diameter-wise is opposed vnto Charity; euen as hatred is. This sinne is one of the mightiest and most dangerous, and which most spaciously dominereth throughout the whole world, but especially in the Courts, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,<note place="margin">Enuy is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milier with euery age &amp; person.</note> and houses of Kings and Princes. Although also it is no stranger in Vniuersities, Colledges, and conuents of religious men. Who therefore may defend himselfe from this monster? Who is so happy, that runneth not into this vice, eyther by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into another mans enuy, or by enuying another man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? For he that considereth of the enuy, which was betweene those two brethren, I doe not say the founders of the Citty of Rome, but the sonnes of our first parents, which was so great, that one slew the other: or of that, which was betweene the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:9369:209"/>
of Ioseph,<note place="margin">Gen. 37.</note> which forced them to sell Ioseph for a seruant and a slaue; or that, which was betweene the very Disciples of Christ, before they had receaued the holy Ghost; and aboue all the enuy,<note place="margin">Num. 12.</note> with which Aaron and Miriam being both elected of the Lord, burned against their brother Moses: He, I say, that readeth these examples, what thinkest thou that he will thinke of other men of this world, amongst whom there is not so great kindred, nor so much sanctitie? Assuredly this vice is one of the mightiest, and most powerfull, which without controuersie at this day most largely swayeth empire throughout the whole world, and more cruelly and tirannously ouerthroweth and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth kingdomes and dominions, then the other vices. For it is a proper effect of enuy to persecute the good, and those that are famous and held in honour for their vertues and excellent gifts. Against these the enuious doe direct their poysoned and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous arrowes as to a white, wherfore it is very well sayd of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon: <hi>I beheld all trauaile of men,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Eccles. 4.</note> 
                           <hi>and all perfection of works, to suffer the enuy of man.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore it is very requisite and necessary, that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest very well arme thy selfe, whereby thou mayst be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist so powerfull an enemy; by daily desiring ayd and assistance of the Lord, and by impugning this beast with all the strength of thy wit; which if it perseuere to sollicite thy minde, be thou so much the more cherefully instant to resist it, and fight with greater valiancy and fortitude of minde. For he that willingly consenteth not to this euill, is not hurt, albeit his malicious flesh doth hale and pull him to impure and odious conditions. But if thou shalt see that all things fall out more prosperously to thy neighbour or to thy friend, then to thy selfe, giue God thanks, and thinke that eyther thou art vnworthy of such prosperity; or at least that it is not profitable or conducent for thee; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thy businesses shall not succeede the more pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perously with thee, because thou enuiest the happy estate of thy neighbour: but that they will fall out more aduersly and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterously. But if thou desirest to knowe, with what armour and weapons thou mayst resist this vice, obserue the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions following.</p>
                        <p>First consider that all enuious men are like vnto the deuill,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:9369:210"/>
whom our good works doe exceedingly afflict,<note place="margin">Enuious men like vnto the deuill.</note> and whom our felicity doth torment with intollerable dolour: not because he can enioy it, albeit men should lose it, for hee hath lost it vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of recouery; but that men taken from dust and earth, should not possesse those blessings he lost. Hence is that of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine in his booke of Christian doctrine:<note place="margin">August. in his booke of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doctrine.</note> God turne, saith he, the plague of enuie from the mindes of all Christians: For en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie is the deuils sinne, of which alone the deuill is guilty, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonably guilty. For it is not sayd to the deuill that he is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, because thou hast committed adultery, because thou hast stolne, because thou hast violently taken away other mens goods, and possessions; but because thou falling thy selfe, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with didst enuy man standing. After thys manner men imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the deuill, are wont to enuie other men, not because they hope to translate theyr prosperitie to themselues, but because they desire that all may be as miserable and wretched, as they themselues are. Marke &amp; consider, ô thou enuious man, that although he, whom thou enuiest, should not haue those goods, for which enuy doth so haunt thee, yet it foloweth not that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently they should be thine. Because therefore that he possesseth them without thy losse or hurt, why doth it grieue thee, that he possesseth them without thy preiudice?</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Wee must not enuie the vertues of our neighbor.</note> But if peraduenture enuie hath possessed thy mind, because an other excelleth thee in some vertue and grace of mind, as in religion, and feruencie of prayer, I pray thee see what an enemy thou art to thy selfe. For thou art pertaker of all the good pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of thy neighbour, so that thou be in the fauour of GOD: and by howe much thy neighbour excelleth, in feruencie of spirit, by so much thou growest richer in spirituall things: and therefore thou enuiest him quite beyond all reason: but on the contrary part thou oughtest to reioyce, because the profit is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to you both, and thou also pertakest of his blessings.</p>
                        <p>Consider therefore how great thy misery is, that by hovve much thy neighbour profiteth in goodnes, by so much thou art the worser: but if thou didst loue the good thinges in thy neighbour, which thou hast not, the same good things should be thine by the vertue of Charitie, and so thou shouldest enioy another mans labours without thine owne labour. Thys Saint
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:9369:210"/>
Gregory showeth,<note place="margin">By Charity, other mens good things are made ours.</note> when he sayth; Charitie by louing another mans goodnes, maketh it her owne; but Enuy, by hating that same goodnes, turneth it to the wounding of her own breast.</p>
                        <p>Perpend also, and ponder I pray thee, howe enuie burneth the hart,<note place="margin">The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes of Enuie.</note> dryeth the flesh, tortureth the vnderstanding, distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the peace of conscience, maketh all the daies of the life sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull and heauie, and banisheth all tranquility &amp; all ioy from the hart of man. For enuie is like a worme in wood, which as it is bred in the wood,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> so it consumeth it: so also enuy is bredde in the hart, and the hart is the first thing that it excruciateth, and when it hath corrupted the hart, it also taketh away the naturall colour of the countenaunce: for the pale and wanne colour of the face, is a token of the greatnes of the enuy, that tormenteth man within. There is no Iudge so seuere against a man as enuy: for it continually afflicteth him,<note place="margin">Enuy is a iust sinne.</note> and tortureth her owne Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour. For this cause some Authors call this vice iust, not that it is iust (for it is a sinne) but because by her owne torment shee chastiseth him, in whom she is, and exerciseth punishment vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him.</p>
                        <p>See also howe contrary this vice is vnto Charitie, which is God, and to the common good, which God euery where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth and promoteth. For it enuyeth the good things of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, and abhorreth those, whom God hath made and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, and on whom GOD bestoweth his blessings, which thing is manifestly condemned: for it dissolueth that, that is made of God, if not indeede, yet in will. But if thou will vse a present remedy for this disease, loue Humility, and flye Pride, which is the mother of this deadly plague. For when as a proud man cannot away with a superiour or an equall, enuy is easily inflamed against them, who excell in any thing; for if it see any man eyther superiour or better, it thinketh it selfe worser &amp; ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser. The Apostle vnderstood this well,<note place="margin">Gala, 5,</note> when he sayd; <hi>Let vs not be desirous of vaine-glory, prouoking one another, enuying one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> He therefore that would cut off the branches of enuy, it is needfull that first he dig vp the roote of ambition, from vvhich enuy ariseth. Furthermore, thou must also withdraw thy minde from an inordinate desire of temporall goods, and thou must only loue the celestiall inheritance, &amp; spirituall blessings; which
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:9369:211"/>
are not diminished, albeit there are many, who loue and possesse them; yea, they so much the more increase, by how much the possessors are multiplied. On the contrary part, temporall goods are so much the more diminished, by how much they are moe amongst who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are diuided: &amp; therfore enuie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciateth the mind of him that lusteth after them. For when as another receaueth that that he desired, or it altogether perisheth, or is diminished, it certainly cannot be done without griefe. But it sufficeth not that thou shouldest not greeue at the good of thy neighbour, but it is necessary that thou shouldest doe well vnto him, as much as lyeth in thy power; and moreouer, thou shouldest pray vnto the Lord God, that he would supply, those things that thou art not able to doe. Thou must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne any man. Loue thy friends in the Lord, and thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for the Lords sake: vvho, when thou wast his enemy, he so loued thee, that to redeeme thee, and deliuer thee out of the hands of thine enemies, he gaue his owne life. Although thy neighbour be euill, yet for all this he must not be contemned: but in this thou must imitate the Phisitian,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note> who hateth the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, yet loueth the person of the diseased: So doe thou, louing that which is made of GOD, and abhorring that, which man hath made euill.</p>
                        <p>But perhaps thou wilt reason with thy selfe,<note place="margin">An obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and say: What haue I to doe with him? in what thing am I bound to him? I know him not: he is not my father nor my kinsman: he neuer pleasured me, nor performed any duty vnto me, yea, he hath some-time endamaged me.<note place="margin">The answer.</note> But remember that GOD with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any desert of thine hath heaped many benefits vpon thee, and therefore hath commaunded thee, that in being thankfull, and making some recompence for this his bounty, thou in like manner shouldest be liberall, not towards him (for he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth none of thy goods) but towards thy neighbour, whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <head>Of the remedies against Gluttony. CHAP. VIII.</head>
                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Luttony is an inordinate desire or appetite of meate and drinke. Christ exhorteth vs to beware of this vice,<note place="margin">Luke, 21.</note> when he sayth: <hi>Take heede to your selues, least at any time your harts be oppressed with surfetting and drunkennes, and cares of this life.</hi> When as this vice doth knock at the gates of thy hart, resist it with these considerations. First consider how for one sinne of gluttony death entred vpon all mankind:<note place="margin">Gluttony the cause of death.</note> and therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that thou shouldest be superiour, and haue the vpper hand in this first combat, in which if thou fayntest or yeeldest, thou shalt be impugned more noisomly of ther vices, and shalt be much more weake and vnable to make resistance. Therfore aboue all things resist the temptation of gluttony with a manly courage: which vnlesse thou conquerest, thou shalt in vaine oppose thy selfe against other vices. But thou shalt easily ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all other enemies, which are without, if first thou shalt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow and kill those, that are bred in thee. For he to no end fighteth with them, that are without, if he hath an enemy within. Wherefore the deuil first tempted Christ with gluttony, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king so to open a gate for other vices.</p>
                        <p>Consider also the rare and singuler abstinence of our Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">The Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of Christ.</note> who not onely after his fast in the Wildernes, but also other where oftentimes handled his most holy and sacred flesh most sharply, and suffered hunger for our comfort, that he might giue vs an example. For if he that by his onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence nourisheth Angels, and feedeth the fowles of heauen, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered hunger for thee; how much more oughtest thou to suffer somthing for thy selfe? by what title wilt thou glory that thou art the seruant of Christ, if he hungered, and thou consumest thy whole life in gluttony and drunkennes? he suffered trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and punishments for thy saluation, and wilt not thou suffer for the same? If the crosse of abstinence seeme too greeuous vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, remember the gall and Vineger, which Christ tasted vpon the Crosse: because as Bernard sayth: No meate is so
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:9369:212"/>
bitter, vvhich if it be tempered with the remembrance of the Vineger and gall of Christ, is not forth-with made sweeter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of the holy fathers</note>Recall also into thy memory the abstinence of all the holy Fathers in the Wildernes, who frequenting desert places, haue with Christ crucified their flesh with all the lusts and concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences, and by the grace of God haue sustained themselues ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares onely with the rootes of hearbs, and haue macerated themselues with so great abstinence, that almost it seemeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible. If therfore our fathers haue thus imitated Christ, and after this manner haue followed him into heauen, how thinkest thou to come thether by the way of deliciousnes and pleasure.</p>
                        <p>Remember how many poore there be in the world, who thinke themselues happy, if they may satisfie their bellies with bread and water, and thou shalt vnderstand how bountifully the Lord hath dealt with thee, who hath bestowed much more vpon thee, then vpon them. Therefore there is no reason, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it meete that thou shouldest conuert this liberality of thy Lord, to be an instrument of thy gluttony.</p>
                        <p>To be briefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> consider that the delight of gluttony doth not consist in a greater place,<note place="margin">The delight of gluttony very short.</note> then of two fingers, nor in a longer time, then of two minutes, in which the meate passeth downe and is gone: neyther is it meete that for a place of mans glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny so narrow, and for a pleasure so short and momentany, that the Land, the Sea, nor the ayre should suffice. To satisfie this gourmandizing gluttony oftentimes the poore are spoyled, and many iniuries are done, that the hunger of the feeble may be conuerted into the delicates of the mighty. Certainly it is a thing miserable and lamentable, and much to be deplored, that a pleasure of so small a part of mans body should cast the whole man into hell, and that all the members and sences of the body should suffer eternall punishment, for the momentany greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of one member. Thou doost not marke how shamefully thou errest, nourishing thy body so delicately and with such costly meates, (which ere it be long shall be meate for wormes) but neglectest thy soule, which before it be long shall stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Diuine tribunall, which being voyde of vertues, when as the body is full of delicate meates, shal be punished with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall torments. And if thy soule be damned, be sure that thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:9369:212"/>
also shall haue her punishment: for euen as the body is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for the soule, so it shall be punished with the soule. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou contemning the nobler part of thy selfe, and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing in delicacie the ignobler, thou doost destroy them both, and thou killest thy selfe with thine owne sword. For thy flesh, which is giuen to be an helpe vnto thee, doth lay a snare for thy life, and doth attend thee vnto torments, as it followed thee here in vices.</p>
                        <p>Remember the hunger of Lazarus,<note place="margin">Luke, 16.</note> who desired to be relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the crums that fell from the rich mans table, and there was no man, that gaue them vnto him. Wherfore when he was dead, he was carried by the hands of Angels into Abrahams bosome; but on the contrary part the rich Glutton, who was clothed in purple and fine linnen, and fared well and delicately, euery day, was buried in hell: for hunger &amp; fulnes, pleasure and continency, haue not the same euent: for after death misery fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth pleasure, and pleasure misery. Let vs put the case; thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that thou hast prodigally wasted and deuoured beyond reason and measure, all that thou hast vtterly lost: and that thou hast with-drawne from thy selfe, and distributed to the poore, that is very well disposed and bestowed, and as a treasure layd vp for thine owne vse, which shall be restored and repayed vnto thee in the heauenly Citty.</p>
                        <p>Least thou be entrapped by ouer-sight and at vnawares in this vice,<note place="margin">We must be wary in the refecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our bodies.</note> thou must very heedfully beware, because often-times when as necessity desireth to be satisfied and relee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore very especiall warines and wisedome is here to be vsed, to bridle the appetite of pleasure, and to subiect and subingate the sensuality vnder the rule of reason. If therefore thou desirest that thy flesh should be a seruant and a subiect
<pb facs="tcp:9369:213"/>
vnder the soueranity of thy soule, looke that thy soule be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto God: for it is requisite that thy soule be gouerned of God, that it may in like manner rule ouer the flesh. And by this admirable &amp; amiable order, man shall be reformed, that is, that GOD may rule ouer his reason,<note place="margin">How man is reformed</note> the reason may gouerne the soule, and the soule the body; and so man shall be wholy refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But the body striueth and strugleth against the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the soule, if the soule be not subiect vnder the rule of reason, and if the reason be not conformable to the diuine will. When thou art tempted of Gluttony, thinke and consider that thou enioyest a very short delight, which soone passeth away: and that the pleasure of the taste, is like a dreame of the night, vanishing away, and flying fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eyes; and consider that thys pleasure, when it is past, leaueth the soule heauy in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: but if that pleasure be conquered, the soule reioyceth, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licketh, and the conscience is quiet, and ful of peace: according to that most excellent and egregious sentence of that wise man.

Therefore, when this outragious vice doth solicite and disquiet thy minde, repell it by these considerations following.</p>
                        <p>First consider,<note place="margin">Man more wrathful then beasts.</note> that brute beastes doe liue peaceably vvith those that are of the same kinde. Elephants accompany with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants: in like maner, Kine and Sheepe feed rogether in their heards and flocks. Byrds of a feather flie together. Cranes on the day time flie together, and at night one plaieth the Sentinell for the other. The same thing also doe Storkes, Harts, Delphins, and many other creatures. The concord and order of Ants and Bees, is knowen vnto euery body. And amongst wilde beastes there is a certaine peace and agreement: The fiercenes of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is not exercised against them of the same kinde: the Boare is not spightfull and hurtfull to the Boare: the Linx vvarreth not with the Linx, nor the Dragon with the Dragon. VVhat need we many words? the wicked spirits themselues, vvho are the authors of all our discord, obserue the league between them selues, and by common consent do exercise their tyrannie. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, to whom curtesie and peace are very necessary, &amp; most conducent, nourish deadly discords and cruell variance. These things are worthy of great consideration.</p>
                        <p>Neyther is it lesse to be considered of, that nature hath giuen weapons to all liuing creatures to fight:<note place="margin">Man hath no weapons giuen him of nature.</note> hoofes to horses, horns to Bulls, tusks to Boares, a sting to Bees, clawes and beakes to birds, yea to Gnats and fleas, nature hath giuen weapons to bite and sting, by which they fetch out blood. But thou ô man, because thou art created to peace and concord, are created vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed and naked, that thou maist not haue any thing to hurt or offend another. Therefore consider howe vnnaturall it is, that thou shouldest reuenge, and hurt him of whom thou art offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; especially, by seeking for weapons which are without thee, which nature hath denied vnto thee.</p>
                        <p>Remember that anger and desire of reuenge is proper vnto wilde beasts, of whose anger thus speaketh a certaine wise man: O man, why doost thou degenerate from the nobility of thine estate and condition, by following the nature of Lyons, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, and other fierce and cruell beasts?<note place="margin">The anger of a certain Lyon.</note> Aelianus writeth of a certaine Lyon, who beeing wounded in hunting with a launce, more then a yeere after espied him a farre of that had wounded
<pb facs="tcp:9369:214"/>
him, passing that way in the company of the King of Iuba, and many other men; the Lyon forth-with knew him, and rushing violently through the ranckes of the men, they with all theyr forces resisting him, he rested not till he came vnto him, who had hurt him, whom presently he rent and tare in peeces. The same thing we haue seene done of a certaine Bull, against them of whom he was smitten and hurt. Wrathfull and angry men, are the imitators of these fierce and cruell beasts; who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they might mitigate theyr wrath by reason and discretion, (as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth men) they had rather follow their beastly force &amp; fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, glorying in their ignobler part, which is common vnto them with beasts, when as they should vse diuine reason, in vvhich they pertake with Angels.</p>
                        <p>If thou shalt say, that it is an hard thing for thee to mitigate and asswage thine angry hart:<note place="margin">From the example of Christ.</note> I answere, that thou oughtest in like manner to consider, that it was much more difficult that the sonne of GOD should suffer for the loue of thee. What wast thou when hee shed his blood for thee? wast not thou his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie? Doost thou not see with what great clemency and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he suffereth thee, sinning daily, and with what great benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and goodnes he receaueth thee turning vnto him? Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture thou wilt say, that thine enemy is not woorthy to haue his fault forgiuen. Tell me, deseruest thou, or art thou worthy, that God should pardon thee? Wouldest thou that God shold pardon thee, and wilt thou vse extreamitie against thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? If thine enemy be not worthy that hee should haue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, yet thou art worthy to pardon him, and Christ most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, for whose loue thou oughtest to forgiue him.</p>
                        <p>

Math, 5,</note>Further obserue, that all the time that thou burnest with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and rancour against thy neighbour, thou art not worthy to offer any sacrifice to the Lord, gratefull &amp; acceptable vnto him, which our Sauiour intimateth when he saith; <hi>If then thou bring thy gift to the altar, &amp; there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leaue there thine offering before the altar, and goe thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> By which precept, we know more cleerely then the noone day, how great a sinne discord with our neighbour is: man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the fauour of God, so long as this contention lasteth,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:9369:214"/>
and therefore he doth nothing pleasing vnto him, whilst hee is guilty of this crime.<note place="margin">In his 8. homily vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ezech.</note> Such a like thing Gregory insinuateth whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saith; Because nothing pleaseth God without concord, the good things that are done of vs profit nothing, vnlesse we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with a quiet minde the wrongs done vnto vs.</p>
                        <p>Consider also who is he, whom thou supposest to bee thine enemy: for it is of necessity, that he is eyther iust or vniust. If he be iust, certainly it is an euill and a vild thing, to wish and do ill to a righteous man, and to be an enemy vnto him, who hath God for his friend: but if he be vniust, it is a thing also altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be detested, that thou shouldest reuenge another mans maliciousnes with thine owne maliciousnes; &amp; appointing thy selfe Iudge in thine own cause, shouldest chastice another mans iniustice with thine owne. If thou reuengest thine owne iniurie vpon thine enemy, and thine enemy his vpon thee, there shall neuer be an end of discord and reuengement. But that is the most glorious kinde of reuenge which the Apostle teacheth, saying: <hi>Ouercome euill with good:</hi> that is, ouercome other mens vices with thine owne vertues.<note place="margin">How wee must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.</note> For whilst men render euill for euill, neither will be brought to yeeld, it commeth to passe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times, that at length they are ouercome by ignominie &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch: for anger afflicteth them, and they are shamefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered of theyr owne passions, which if they had ouercome &amp; tamed, theyr victory had been more glorious then his, that hath wonne and vanquished a Citty by force of Armes: yea the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory is much lesser to haue taken one or many Citties, which are without vs, then to conquer our owne affections, which rule &amp; reuell within vs; and to bridle our proud disdaine and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is shut within vs: which except wee holde vnder, it will rise against vs, and will force vs to assay those things, which afterwards we shall repent vs of, and be ashamed of: and that which is worser, we our selues shall scarcely vnderstand of the euill that we doe: for he that is angry, thinketh all reuenge iust, and is often deceiued, supposing the pricke of anger to be the zeale of iustice, and by this meanes the vice is couered with the semblance of vertue.</p>
                        <p>Therefore to ouercome this vice, it is the best remedy that thou be very carefull and diligent to pull vp by the rootes all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:9369:215"/>
loue of thy selfe,<note place="margin">Selfe-loue is to be pulld vp by the roots.</note> and of thine affayres. for otherwise anger will easily waxe hote, if eyther thou, or any of thine be hurt, although with the least word. Furthermore, when thou feelest the beginnings of the temptation of anger, thou must prepare thy selfe vnto patience, fore-seeing wisely all the kinds of euill, which may arise in any busines; because a dart fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene doth lesse hurt.<note place="margin">We must do nothing in our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> Thou must firmely purpose in thy mind, that as often as choller fumeth and heateth in thee, that thou neyther say nor doe any thing; yea, beleeue not, nor trust to thy selfe; but let all things be suspected of thee, which thy hart per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth thee at this time, albeit they seeme to agree vnto reason. Deferre the execution of thy will whilst anger boyleth, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till thou hast once or oftner sayd ouer the Lords prayer, or some other thing. That wholsome counsaile of Athenodorus, which is reported by Plutarch,<note place="margin">Plutarch in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegs of the Romanes.</note> ought here to be obserued. For when as he by reason of his old age, desired leaue to returne to his owne house, and Augustus the Emperour had graunted him leaue. When he tooke his farewell of Caesar, desirous to leaue behind him some memoriall worthy a Philosopher, he sayd; O Caesar when thou art angry, before thou shalt say or doe any thing, repeate ouer in thy minde the foure and twenty Greeke letters. Caesar taking the Philosopher by the right hand, sayd; Yet I haue neede of thy presence; and so retayned him with him another whole yeare. For the Philosopher by this aduice taught, that those things were done mithout reason, which were done at such time as anger boyleth in the hart.<note place="margin">In the time of anger we must decree of nothing.</note> And it is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be marked, that there is not a worser time to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in, what should be done, then when a man is angry; and yet all men especially would then dispatch what they haue to doe. Therefore it is very meete that a man at that time when fury and wrath hath possessed his mind, should resist such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes with a manly courage.<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> For as it is knowne to all men, that a drunken man cannot doe any thing wisely and with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and of which he doth not afterwards repent him (as we read of Alexander the great) so when a man is disturbed and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with anger, and blinded with the smoke of this passion, he cannot rest, neyther take aduisement, which to day although it seeme iust and reasonable vnto him, yet to morrow, when the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:9369:215"/>
fury of his passion shall be ouer, he shall confesse that it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust and vnreasonable: for it is without controuesie, that anger, vvine, and loue, that is carnall concupiscence, are the worst counsailers, that may be found. Where-vpon the Wise-man sayth very well: <hi>Wine and women leade wise-men out of the way, and put men of vnderstanding to reproofe.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ecclesi. 19.</note> By vvine the vvise-man vnderstandeth, not only materiall vvine, which is wont to blind and obscure the reason; but any passion that stragleth out of the right way, which in like manner blindeth and obscureth the reason, albeit not euery thing that then is done is alwayes culpable.</p>
                        <p>And this aduice is not to be contemned; if when thou art angry,<note place="margin">Another aduice.</note> thou shalt forth-with occupy thy selfe with some man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of busines, and so diuert and turne thy cogitations from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for if thou doost with-draw wood from the fire, the flame is extinguished. And with al thy strength contend to loue them, whom thou must necessarily suffer: for if that sufferance be not ioyned to loue, the patience which outwardly appeareth, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes conuerted into rancour. Therfore when Saint Paule sayth,<note place="margin">1, Cor. 13.</note> 
                           <hi>Loue is patient:</hi> he presently addeth, <hi>and bountifull:</hi> For true loue omitteth not to loue those bountifully, whom it suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth patiently. In like manner it is wisedome to giue place to the wrath of thy brother: for if thou shalt seperate thy selfe from him being angry, thou shalt giue him place, till his anger be ouer; or at least if thou wilt not depart, aunswer him curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously. For as Salomon sayth:<note place="margin">Prou, 15.</note> 
                           <hi>A soft aunswere putteth away wrath.</hi>

But if at any time thou shalt feele thy soule wounded,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> beware that thou cast not away thine armour and shield, and shake hands with thine enemy, &amp; yeeld thy selfe vnto him: but imitate valiant and braue men of Arms, who often-times through shame to be ouercome, and through greefe of their wounds are forced not to flye, but to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; and so taking hart at grasse, and calling to thee thy spirits a fresh, thou shalt forth-with see that by thine owne misfortune and mischaunce, thou shalt cause them to flie from thee, whom a little before thou didst flie from, and thou shalt prosecute them, who prosecuted thee. And if peraduenture thou beest wounded the second time, (which often-times happeneth in warre) yet be not discouraged, but remember, that the same thing happeneth often to them that fight most valiantly, not because they are neuer wounded, but because they are neuer conquered. For he is not sayd to be conquered, that is often wounded, but he, that looseth his armour and his courage. If thou beest wounded, seeke presently for remedy; for a fresh and new wound is sooner cured, then anolde vlcer, and that which is putrified: and one is easilier cured, then many.</p>
                        <p>If thou beest tempted at any time,<note place="margin">How temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is to be turned into good.</note> it is not inough for thee not to haue entertayned the temptation, but endeuour by the same temptation to take a greater occasion to embrace Vertue; so by this diligence and the Diuine grace by temptation thou shalt not be made worser, but much better, and all things shall fall out with thee more happily and currantly. If thou beest tempted of Luxury and Gluttony, cease a while from thine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed delicates, yea, albeit they be lawfull, and entertaine fasting, and holy and godly exercises. If couetousnes assault thee, giue larger almes, and doe other works of mercy oftner then thou wast wont. If vaine-glory assaile thee, in all things humble thy selfe more lowly. Doing thus, perhaps the deuill will not dare further to tempt thee, least he should giue thee an

                           <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Esides the seauen sinnes, which are called capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, there are others, which depend of them, which a Christian ought to eschew with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence no lesse then the former. Amongst these one of the chiefest is, to sweare vainely by God: for this sinne is directly against God, and therefore in his owne nature it is more greeuous then any other sinne, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against thy neighbour, albeit it be enormous and very farre out ofsquare. And this is done not onely when the name of God is sworne by, but when we sweare by the Crosse, Masse, Sacraments, Saints, or by our owne life, for euery one of these are haynous sinnes also &amp; idolatrous, for by protesting by them we place them in Gods stead, vvhich vnlawfull oaths are much reprehended in the holy Scriptures, because of the iniury, which is offered to the Diuine maiestie. Greatly to blame are they, and much haue they to aunswer for, who sweare of custome for euery light matter, hauing no respect how or wherefore they sweare, neyther doe repent themselues of this custome, neyther endeuour to roote out this corrupt and depraued vse. Neyther are they to be excused, if they say, that they doe not sweare of set purpose or it was not their mind and intent to sweate vainly: for the case being put, that they are willing to entertaine this naughty and corrupt custom, they are also willing to entertaine that, which followeth of it, that is this, and such lyke euills, and therfore they are not free from great and enormous wickednes.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore a Christian ought to endeuour himselfe as much
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:9369:218"/>

That this may be done the more easily, we must diligently obserue and marke that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile of Christ,<note place="margin">Iames, 5,</note> and of his most louing Disciple Iames, saying;
<hi>Before all things, my brethren, sweare not, neyther by heauen; nor by earth, nor by any other oath: but let your yea, be yea, and your nay, nay, least yee fall into condemnation:</hi> He meaneth, that the custome of swearing should not draw them to false swearing, and therefore should be iudged, and condemned to euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting death:</p>
                        <p>Neyther ought any man to sweare by the lyfe of his sonnes,<note place="margin">We must not sweare by the life of another.</note> or of any other in his family. And hee must also diligently take heede, that as no man sweare after this manner in his family, so let him cast out of his house all such oathes, by admonishing &amp; chasticing all, that are vnder his iurisdiction. And if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, to whom this custome is so turned into a nature, that he can hardly expell it, let him accustome himselfe, that for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry such offence he giue some thing to the poore, or exact some other thing of himselfe, that by it hee may not onely be put in minde of his repentance, but also, that it may be an admonition vnto him, not to incurre the same fault againe.</p>

                           <head>¶ Of murmuring, detraction, and rash iudgement.</head>
                           <p>ANother sinne, which euery one ought to flie and auoyde, is murmuring: which vice doth no lesse raigne in the world at thys day, then that before. For there is neither house, nor as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of religious persons, nor holy place, which is altogether free from murmuring. And although this vice is acquainted &amp; familiar with all estates of men, (for the world through her wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering and mutability, ministreth matter of teares to the good, and an occasion of murmuring to the weake) yet some are more inclined to this vice of their own nature,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> then others. For euen as mens tastes are diuers, for all things tast not alike to all men; sweet tastes displease this man, and sower tastes please another, and some please theyr tastes in sweet things: so the wils of some men are so corrupt, and repleate with hurtfull and melancholy humors, that they haue not any pleasure in any thing that is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with vertue, they cannot away to heare theyr neighbour
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:9369:219"/>
praysed, and nothing doth please them but euill speaking, and scorning others; so that in all their conuersation they seeme dul, and benummed; but if they light in a vaine of euill speaking, and spightfull reproching, in this they seeme as though they were waked out of sleepe, and they quicken vp theyr spirits to descant on this theame.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">Three euils spring fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> murmuring</note> That an hatred of this abhominable and hurtfull sinne may be bred in thine hart, marke how this vice bringeth with it three kinde of euils. The first is, it brings forth detraction and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>, for from murmuring to detraction, the way is short, and the accesse easie from that to this. The Phylosophers say, that in elements the transmutation is easie, which agree and symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize in any quality:<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> So we often see, when men begin to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, that they most easily descend from more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon defects to particuler, and from publique defects, to defects more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete and priuate, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> small to great: and by infamy they wrong the fame of theyr neyghbour. For after the tongue hath begun to waxe hote through speaking, it is a hard matter so much to restraine the lust and desire of the hart, as the flame encreaseth the winde raising and puffing it; as it is hard to hinder and hold in an vnbroken and an vnbrideled Colt foming and chafing in the midst of his race. Then the murmurer respecteth not any body, neyther feareth to proceed, vntill he hath entred into the secretest places of the house. Wherefore, Ecclesiasticus earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayed, that God would set a watch before this gate; <hi>Who</hi> sayth he,<note place="margin">Ecclus, 22,</note> 
                              <hi>shall sette a watch before my mouth, and a seale of wisdom vpon my lips, that I fall not suddainly by them, &amp; that my tongue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy mee not?</hi> Hee that spake this, knewe very well the great weight, moment, and difficulty of this thing: for he looked for remedy of thys from GOD alone, who is the true Phisitian of this disease,<note place="margin">Prou, 16,</note> as Salomon testifieth, saying: <hi>The preparations of the hart are in man, but the aunswer of the tongue is of the Lord.</hi> Of so great moment is this busines.</p>
                           <p>
                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second euill is; because it is very hurtfull; for at the least three very great dammages &amp; hurts are found in murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: One is of them, who are the speakers; another of them, who are the hearers and consenters; the third of them, of whom the words are spoken. For albeit walls haue not eares, yet word
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:9369:219"/>
words haue wings, and men are desirous of fauour and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and by broching such trifles, they hunt for the fauour and familiarity of others, vnder pretence as though they had a great care of his honour, whose fame is hurt and wronged. Hence it ariseth, that when such wordes are carryed to the eares of him that is defamed, he is offended, and to his owne griefe he rageth against him, of whom he is defamed. Hence come perpetuall enmities, hence continuall hatred, hence warres and slaughters proceed.<note place="margin">Ecclus, 28,</note> Wherefore worthily sayd the Wise-man; <hi>Abhorre the slaunderer and double tongued: for such haue destroyed many that were at peace.</hi> And all this mischiefe, as thou seest, oftentimes is deriued from one word ill spoken,<note place="margin">Ecclus, 11,</note> as the Wise-man sayth; <hi>Of one little sparke is made a great fire, and of one deceitfull man, is blood increased.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In regard of thys mischiefe, the holy Scripture compareth the words of detractors and murmurers to sharpe rasers, which shaue the hayres, he not feeling that is shaued; after that also to Bow &amp; arrowes, which are sent from farre, and wound the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: sometimes slaunderers and reprochers are called serpents, which bite priuily, and leaue poyson in the wound: by vvhich similitudes, the holy Ghost would intimate vnto vs, the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and harmes of this vice, which is so great, that the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man sayth;<note place="margin">Ecclus. 28,</note> 
                              <hi>The stroke of the rod, maketh markes in the flesh, but the stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The third euill that murmuring bringeth with it, is, that it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> maketh the murmurer execrable &amp; infamous among men: for naturally men shunne him that is foule-mouthed and euill ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, no otherwise then they doe a venemous serpent. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wise-man sayth;<note place="margin">Ecclus, 9,</note> 
                              <hi>A man full of words, is dangerous in his Cittie.</hi> Although there were no other cause to hate thys vice, neyther that it were very hurtfull on the one part, nor fruitlesse on the other, yet who is he that would be infamous, and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to God and men? especially for a vice so common and vsuall, into danger of which a man doth runne, so often as hee conferreth with another.</p>
                           <p>Therefore perswade thy selfe, that the lyfe of thy neighbour, as much as it pertaines to thee, is as a forbidden tree, whose fruit it is not lawfull for thee to touch, nor tast. Beware therfore, that
<pb facs="tcp:9369:220"/>
thou doe not speake well of thy selfe, and ill of another: for this is the property of slaunderers and backbiters, and that of brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arts and vaine-glorious Thrasoes. In thy mouth let all men be honest and honourable, and let all the worlde beleeue by thy words, that there is not an euill man in it. By this meanes thou shalt eschew many sinnes, and infinite scruples and bytings of conscience, and thou shalt be acceptable to God, and loued of men: and as all are honoured by thee, so in like manner thou shalt be honoured of all. Bridle thy tongue, and be thou careful to keepe in those words that thy stomacke belcheth vp:<note place="margin">The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test souera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be able to rule thy tongue.</note> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when thou seest that by them there is danger of bloodshed. And constantly beleeue thys, that it is the greatest wisedome, &amp; the most soueraigne empyre, to be able to bridle and restraine thy tongue.</p>
                           <p>Neyther thinke that thou art freed from this vice, when thou murmurest artificially, first praysing the man, whom thou hast purposed to dispraise:<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> For there are some murmurers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piners, that imitate Chirurgians; who beeing about to open a vaine, doe first annoynt it with oyle, &amp; presently make incision, and extract blood.<note place="margin">Psalm, 55,</note> Of these the Prophet speaketh: <hi>His wordes were more gentle then oyle, yet they were swords.</hi> And euen as it is landable to abstaine from all kind of murmuring and repining, so it is much more praise-worthy, to moderate and temper our selfes from rayling and reproching them, who haue offended vs: for by how much more the desire of rayling is violenter, by so much more it is an euidenter signe of a generous minde, to be able to containe himselfe in thys, and to restraine this affection; therefore,<note place="margin">Murmurers &amp; detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, are not to be heard. Ecclus, 29,</note> where the danger is greater, there wee ought to be more cautelous and wary. Neyther ought we onely to abstaine from reproching and murmuring, but our eares ought not to be open to detractors and slaunderers, that we may follow the counsaile of Ecclesiasticus, saying; <hi>Hedge in thine eares vvith thornes, and doe not beare a wicked tongue.</hi> By which words it is manifest, of what great moment it is, not to heare cursed and slaunderous speakers. For he saith not, shutte, or stoppe thyne eares with Cotton, Woll, or with soft Furre or Downe; but he would haue them hedged about with thornes, that not onely such reprochfull speeches may not enter into thine hart, by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

                        <p>Against Anger, he said; No iniury done vnto me of men, shall disturbe or vexe me, if I remember mine owne iniuries, by which I haue offended my God.</p>
                        <p>Against Hatred and Enuy, he said; After that I haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that God hath receaued into fauour so great a sinner, as I am, I cannot wish ill to any one, I cannot deny pardon of an offence to any body.</p>
                        <p>Against Gluttony, he said; He that considereth of that most bitter gall and vineger, which in the midst of his torments was giuen to the sonne of God in stead of his last refreshing, whilst he suffered for the sinnes of others, it will make him ashamed to liue delicately, seeing he is bound to suffer something for his owne sinnes.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, against Idlenes, he said; As often as I thinke, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter these short labours I shall haue eternall glory, I thinke that all troubles and vvearines is but small, which any one suffereth for that euerlasting rest.</p>

                           <p>The Apostle would haue vs to be a good sauour, which may communicate &amp; participate hys sweet smell to euery thing that it partaketh with. The hands which haue handled any fragrant

and odoriferous thing, participate of the smell: so the wordes, the deedes, the iestures, and the conuersation of the seruants of God ought to be such, that what man soeuer vseth them fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, may be edified; and after a certaine manner be sanctified by their examples and conuersation.<note place="margin">The first fruit of this modesty.</note> Thys is the especiallest fruite, which springeth of this modestie: which is as a silent Preacher: for not by the noyse of words, but by the examples of vertues he inuiteth man to glorifie GOD, and to embrace Vertue. Wherefore also our Sauiour himselfe stirreth vs vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thys, when he sayth;<note place="margin">Math, 5,</note>

                           <p>We must heere obserue, that a man ought not therefore to doe good workes,<note place="margin">A caution.</note> that hee may be seene: but as Saint Gregory sayth, Good workes are so to be doone in publique, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent may remaine in secret: that by our good workes wee may giue an example to our neighbour, and by our intent to please God onely, we may alwaies wish that they may remaine secret.</p>

                           <p>These be the commodities, which this modestie bringeth with her, and certainly they be very great.

For euen as a dead body is preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Mirrh,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</note> which is bitter, otherwise it would putrifie and breed wormes; so also our flesh is corrupted through delicacies and effeminacy, and bringeth forth vices; which otherwise by austerity is kept in the duty of vertue. Therefore in this place we will handle Abstinence, which is one of the principall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which are necessary to the attainment of others. It is very true, that it is a most difficult thing to attaine it, by reason of the rebellion of our corrupt nature against it. Albeit therfore that we haue before sufficiently spoken of gluttony, so that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and excellency of this vertue of abstinence may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood: for he that knoweth one of the contraries, knoweth also the other; seeing that there is the same reason of contraries: yet for the more manifestation of this doctrine, I account it worth the labour to entreate peculierly of it: teaching how this vertue may be gotten, and how exercised. Therefore beginning to speake of modesty,<note place="margin">Rules to be obserued in eating.</note> which ought to be obserued at the table, I say that Ecclesiasticus teacheth it after a singuler maner in these words;<note place="margin">Ecclesi. 31.</note> 
                              <hi>Eate modestly that which is set before thee, and deuoure not, least thou be hated. Leaue thou of first for nurtures sake, and be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be not insatiable least thou offend.

The measure is to be obserued, that he that eateth doe not poure forth his soule vpon euery dish. The time, not before the houre. The quality, such as our brethren eate, if infirmity doth not will otherwise. This is the rule of S. Bernard.</p>

Hetherto be the words of S. Gregory.</p>

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Another learned man more largely and copiously handleth this matter, who teaching the modesty that ought to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in eating, saith; Two things ought to be considered of in eating, the meat, and him that eateth it. For he that eateth, ought to keepe modesty in eating, in silence, in seeing, and in framing the gesture of his body; that he eate not greedily, that he be not irksome and importunate through much babling, that he rowle not his eyes to euery corner, that all his members and parts be kept in good order. For there are some, who as soone as they are set, doe forth-with show their greedines, and the insatiable gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandizing of their gluttony, their immoderate minde, and the vnseemely mouing of all their members. They shake theyr heads, pull their sleeues this way and that, and lift vp and tosse their hands, as if they would deuoure all the meate, and through their vnusuall gestures they betray and bewray the insatiable voracity of their bellies. They sitting in one place with theyr hands and eyes wander and reach throughout the whole table, together they call for vvine, breake bread, and marshall this dish this way and that way; and like vnto a Captaine or leader, who is to besiege some Fort,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> on euery side vieweth it, so they sit mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and consulting with themselues, of what meate they should begin, that they may goe the currantlier through all. All this inciuility he ought to auoyde that eateth, and in eating he ought to see what he eateth, and that with modesty, lesse he passe the
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:9369:231"/>
bonds and limits of honesty and ciuility, and offend those that sit at meate with him.</p>
                           <p>And although at all times we ought to come to meate with this ciuility, yet especially when hunger doth more prouoke vs, and delicates doe stirre vp our appetites: for then there are greater motiues of gluttony, both in respect of the good dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the organ of tasting, and in respect of the excellency of the obiect. Then let a man diligently take heede, least in this case his rauenous gullet perswade him, that he is so hungry, that he thinketh that he is able to deuoure both the meate and the trenchers. Therfore a learned man very well callet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He calleth it also a seducer of the eyes, receauing a little, but in conceit prouoking to deuoure all. At the first when a man beginneth to eate, he supposeth that he is more hungry, then he is in very deede: and therefore he thinketh that he can deuoure all; but a little after being satisfied with a smal pittance, all this appetite is gone.</p>
                           <p>Against this euill, when thou commest to the table, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the saying of a certaine Philosopher,<note place="margin">Epictetes.</note> that two guests are to be refreshed of thee, that is, the body and the soule: the body by receauing meate; but the soule, by taking it temperatly and soberly, not for pleasure and satiety, but according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script rule of temperance, for euen as the body is satisfied and filled with meate, so the soule is refreshed with this sobriety and parsimony, as with vertue.</p>
                           <p>No lesse remedy against gluttony is it, if any one would weigh in equall ballance all the fruites of abstinence, with the short pleasure of rauenous gurmandizing: then he should ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly see, how vniust and how vnequall a thing it is to lose such excellent fruites, for so momentany and perishing a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. But that thou mayst more euidently vnderstand this, thou must know that among the fiue corporall sences,<note place="margin">The touch and the tast are the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noblest sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> that the touch and the tast are the ignoblest: for there is not a liuing creature in all the world, although most vnperfect, which is not endued with these two sences: although there be many, which haue not the other three, the sight, the smelling, and the hearing: and as
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:9369:232"/>
these two sences are most grosse and materiall, and vnworthier then the rest; so the delights, which are deriued from them, are baser, and more beastly; seeing there is found no liuing creature, which doth not enioy them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">The ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>sure of the tast short.</note> These delights are not onely most vild, but also exceeding short: for they doe no longer delight, then the obiect is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially ioyned with the organs and instruments of the sences; as we see in the pleasure of the tast, which doth no longer endure, then the meate toucheth the pallate; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which as soone as it is seperated, all the delight fadeth and perisheth. Wherefore seeing that this pleasure is so beast-like and short; what man wil be so sottish, and so like to brute beasts, that will abandon the vertue of abstinence (of which so great things are spoken, and so excellent fruites doe arise) for so vild, so abiect, and so vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a pleasure.</p>
                           <p>This one thing ought to be sufficient to restraine this appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. And much more, if other reasons also be brought hether, which make vs bound to abstinence. Therfore, as we haue said, let the seruant of the Lord hang vp the ballance, and in one ballance let the shortnes and profit of this pleasure be put: and in the other the beauty of abstinence, with the fruites, which come of it: the examples also of the Saints, and the labours of Martirs, who haue gone to heauen through fire and water; the memory of sinners with the paines of hell, and in each conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he will say, that the crosse is to be embraced, and the flesh to be afflicted, that gluttony is to be auoyded, and that God is to be satisfied with the sorrowes of repentance for the pleasure of the fault. If thou shalt come thus prepared to the table, thou shalt see, how easie a thing it shall be vnto thee to renounce all these pleasures and delights.</p>

two fires of pleasure.<note place="margin">In an Epistle to Eusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chium of keeping vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity.</note> Why doe we cast oyle into the flame? vvhy doe we minister fewell to a fire flaming? For seeing that wine is most hote, it inflameth all the humours and all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body, but especially the hart, whether it directly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: and in the hart is the seate of all our affections: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inflamed by the strength of vvine, for euery light matter there ariseth great ioy, anger, fury, loue, rashnes, delight, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like perturbations. Wherfore it appeareth, that seeing that it is the chiefest duty of morall vertue, to moderate and mitigate the misgouernment of these perturbations, that vvine is of an opposite nature, and doth all things contrarily. For by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of this heate that is againe reuiued, which by vertue was mortified: and that quickned, which before was extinct. Therfore a man must very carefully abstaine from drinking too much wine. From bibbing of wine are wont to proceede vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable laughter, superfluous iering, ostentation, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, clamours, reuealing of secrets, and other like vices. For then the perturbations of the minde be greater, and the reason is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured through the vapours of wine. Here also occasion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to passe the bonds of decency, that thou mayst please the company who sitteth with thee, and with whom thou drinkest. All these and many other discommodities come from too much drinking of vvine. Wherefore very excellent well a certaine Philosopher sayd,<note place="margin">The Vine bringeth forth three kinde of Grapes.</note> that the vine brigeth forth three kinde of Grapes, one of necessity, another of delight, and the third of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: by which kinde of speach he would intimate vnto vs, that to drinke a little vvine doth serue our naturall necessity; som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to exceed measure, is more for delight, then necessity; but to keepe no meane nor measure, is the cause of fury and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And therfore whatsoeuer a man doth at that time, ought worthily to be suspected: for then after our common manner of speaking not onely reason hath no place in man, which lieth buried; but also the heate of wine ruleth and raigneth in him, which is a very bad counsaylour.<note place="margin">Wine a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad counsayler. Much talke to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded.</note>

                           <p>No lesse also a man ought to abstaine from much talke, and from contention and altercation at the table, who after he is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen from the table, would be free from all danger. For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this disputation beginneth in peace, but endeth in warre.
<pb facs="tcp:9369:233"/>
And oftentimes in the heat of vvine a man speaketh that, which afterwards he wisheth that he had kept in: wherefore Salomon sayth;<note place="margin">Prou, 31,</note> 
                              <hi>Where drunkennesse raigneth, there are no secrets kept.</hi> And albeit at that time all superfluous talke, and vaine multiplying of words is worthily to be reprehended, yet much more that, that a man speaketh of eating &amp; drinking, in praysing the wine, fruites, fishes, or any other thing that he eateth or drinketh: or in discoursing of the diuersity of these &amp; those country meates, or of the fishes of thys and that Riuer: for all such speeches are tokens of the minde of an intemperate man, who is willing to spend the whole course of his life in deuouring and gurmadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, not onely with his mouth, but also with his hart, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, with his memory, and words.</p>
                           <p>But he that sitteth at meat, ought especially to take heed, that he eate not the life of his neighbour: for this pearceth deepely, and teareth the bowels of a man.

                           <p>In the manner of our speaking wee must be circumspect,<note place="margin">The maner is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in speaking.</note> that we speake not too finely &amp; delicately, too vnaduisedly, too affectedly, too curiously, and with wordes too exquisite: but with grauity, leysurely, and with gentlenes, simple and plaine wordes.

It is the part of wise and discreet men, to follow the counsaile of the VVise-man, who sayth,<note place="margin">Ecclus, 32,</note> 
                              <hi>In many things be as one that is ignorant be as one that vnderstandeth, and yet hold thy tongue. If thou be among great men, compare not thy selfe vnto them, and when an Elder speaketh, babble not much.</hi>

                           </p>

For some speak good things, that they may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Saints: others, that they may make boast of their eloquence and subtilty of wit; the first is an hypocrite, &amp; the other a vaine-glorious

But then the end is good, when the glory of GOD, and the profit of our neighbour are onely sought. Also we must respect who speaketh: whether a young man amongst old men, an idiote among wise men, or a prophane man among those that be religious. To be briefe, when the wordes of the Speaker are not heard, silence may be laudably kept. All these things hee ought to obserue who spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, least hee offend: and because all men are not able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue all these, therefore it is the safest remedy, to take refuge in the Hauen of silence: for by silence and sole cogitations, a man may satisfie all these precepts.

                           <p>AFter that we haue thus ordered &amp; reformed the body, with all the sences, yet the greater part of busines stil remaineth: that is, the moderating of the soule, with all her faculties and powers. And first of all the sensuall appetite offereth it selfe, which comprehendeth and containeth all the lustes and carnall motions: as are loue, hatred, mirth, mourning, lust, feare, hope, indignation, and such like perturbations. This appetite is the ignobler part of our soule, which maketh vs like vnto beastes, which are led in all things by their affections &amp; appetites. Thys appetite maketh vs waxe brutish,<note place="margin">The euils and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes of our owne will.</note> and mightily draweth vs to earthly things, whilst it with-holdeth vs a farre of from heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. This is the vaine, this is the fountaine of all euills and mischiefes, that are in the world, and the chiefest cause of our destruction.<note place="margin">Bernard in his thyrd sermon of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Lord.</note> Therefore Saint Bernard said: Let thine owne will cease and giue place, and there shall be no hell. For against who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should that fire rage, but against thine owne will? For thyne owne will impugneth God, and is lifted vp against him. It is it that robbeth Paradice, &amp; enricheth hell, that maketh the blood of Christ of none effect,<note place="margin">The inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our part of the soule is to be wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched &amp; kept</note> and subdueth the world vnder the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of the deuill. For in thys part is the shop and Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of sinne: for out of it sinne draweth strength and armor, to wound more cruelly.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="451" facs="tcp:9369:235"/>This is in vs another Eue, which is the weaker part, &amp; more inclined to the inferiour matters of our soule; by which the old serpent inuadeth our Adam, that is, the superiour part of our soule, in which the vnderstanding and the will is, inuiting it to lift vp his eyes to the forbidden tree. This is that part, in which originall sinne doth especially show his strength, and in which it hideth the greater aboundance of his poyson. Heere are fights, here are fallings, here victories, and here crownes. Heere I say, are fallings of the weake, victories of the strong, crownes of the Conquerers: to be briefe, here is the whole warfare &amp; exercise of vertue. For in taming and restraining this cruell and fierce beast, a great part of the exercise of morrall vertues consist. This is the Vineyard in which we must continually labour: and the Garden which we must without intermission till. Here are sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry weedes and noysome plants, which must be pulled vp, that the young &amp; tender sprigs of Vertue may be grafted into their place. It behooueth therefore the seruant of the Lord alwayes to walke in thys Garden with his weeding-knife in his hande, with which he may cutte vp and eradicate the superfluous and pernicious plants, which grow and spring vp among the good: or that like a wise Leader &amp; a good Captaine marching among these affections, he may restraine, guide, and direct them, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by enlarging, sometimes by brideling and plucking in the raynes: that they may not wander as they list; but that they may be led and guided according to the prescript and lawe of reason.</p>
                           <p>Thys is an especiall exercise of the sonnes of God,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the sonnes of God, &amp; the children of the world.</note> who are no more gouerned by the affections of flesh and blood: but by the spirit of GOD. Thys is the difference between spirituall and carnall men: for these are ruled by the lusts of the flesh, like brute beastes: the other are mooued by the spirit of God; and by reason. Thys is that mortification, and laudable mirth, which the Scripture doth often mention. This is that mortification &amp; sepulture to which the Apostle inuiteth vs so often. This is that Crosse, and the denyall of our selues, which the Gospell prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vnto vs. Thys is to doe iudgement and iustice, which so often is repeated in the Psalmes and in the Prophets. Heere all our strength is to be expressed; hether our labours prayers, and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:9369:236"/>
exercises must be intended.</p>
                           <p>It is here also necessary that euery one very well know and discerne his owne disposition, and naturall inclination: for in what part so euer he feeleth chiefely this inclination, let him know that in that part he is most endangered. And although we are continually to warre with all affections,<note place="margin">With what affections we are es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to warre.</note> yet especially vve are to fight with the appetites of honours, pleasures, and riches. For these be the three fountaines, and vaines of all euils. Let vs beware that we doe not couet or desire alwayes that our owne will may be done, and our owne affections satisfied: for this is a most dangerous vice, most powerfull to cast a man out of his right vvits, and to mad his mind. Which vice is very common and familier to mighty and great men, and to those that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to raigne and rule ouer others. Wherfore it shall be very profitable for them to exercise themselues in matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their appetites and humours, and to depriue their will, yea of things lawfull, that they may be more prompt and ready to temper and moderate themselues in things vnlawfull. For this exercise is no whit lesse required, that a man may as well be ready in spirituall armes, as in carnall: yea, so much the more, as the victory is greater and more difficult to conquer himselfe and the deuill, then all other things. We must also be exercised in humble and contemptible duties and offices: and not aspire to dignities and honours: for the world can giue nothing, nor take away any thing from him,<note place="margin">Note.</note> vvho hath God for his inheritance, and his treasure.</p>

                           <head>¶ Of the reforming of the Will.</head>
                           <p>TO the attainment of this fore-sayd mortification the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and reforming of the superiour vvill, which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable appetite, is much auaileable: which among others we ought to moderate and adorne with three holy affections; as are,<note place="margin">How the superiour part of the soule is to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> Humility of hart, Poorenes of spirit, and an holy Hatred of our selues. For these three doe make the busines of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation very easie. Humility, as Saint Bernard defineth, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of our selues, which springeth of a deepe and true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our selues. For it is the property of this vertue to cast out of the soule all the branches, and all the daughters of Pride,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:9369:236"/>
with the whole progeny of ambition; and to cast vs downe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all creatures, and to think that any other creature, if so it were giuen vnto him of God to worke well (as it is giuen vnto vs) would be much more gratefull, and would bring forth many moe fruites, then we doe. Neyther is it sufficient that man hath this contempt of himselfe hid within him; but it is necessary, that it should appeare and show it selfe in his conuersation, so that in all things as much as may be hee show himselfe most humble, according to the quality of his estate, hauing no regard of the iudgement and estimation of this world, which perhaps opposeth her selfe against him. Wherfore it is necessary, that all our actions and affaires haue a relish of humility and pouerty; and that we submit our selues for the loue of God, not onely to our elders and equals, but also to our inferiours.</p>
                           <p>The second thing which is required in this place, is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty of spirit,<note place="margin">The pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of spirit.</note> which is a voluntary contempt of the things of this world, and a minde content with that estate, which is alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, although it be meane and low. At this stroke that roote of all mischiefe is cut vp, which they call couetousnes, and it bringeth to man so great peace and tranquillity of hart,<note place="margin">Seneca in his 18. Epist.</note> that Seneca is not afraid to say; He that hath his gate shut to the lust of his desires, may for felicity contend with Iupiter himselfe. And in another place; No man else is worthy of God, but he that hath contemned riches. Hath he little, that chilleth not for cold, that hungreth not, that thirsteth not? Iupiter hath no more. He hath neuer little that hath inough. This sayth Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. By which words he intimateth that the felicity of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the satiety and contentednes of the harts desire. He that commeth to this stayednes and quiet of desire, he may say, that he is come to the height of felicity, or at least hath attayned a great part of it.</p>
                           <p>The third affection is, an holy Hatred of our selues; of which our Sauiour sayth,<note place="margin">Iohn, 12.</note> 
                              <hi>He that loueth his life, shall lose it, and he that hateth his life in this world, shall keepe it vnto life eternall.</hi> Which doctrine is not to be vnderstoode of a peeuish and a peruerse hate, as the desperate doe hate themselues: but it must be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of an hate, which the Saints beare towards their owne flesh, as against a thing, which was the cause of many and great
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:9369:237"/>
euils, and which hindred much good: and therefore they han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled it not according to the will and lust of it, but according to the prescription of reason; which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth, that we should often handle it, not as a Mistres, but as a seruant of the spirit; otherwise that of the Wise-man will happen vnto vs; <hi>He that delicately bringeth vp his seruant,</hi>

                              <note place="margin">Eccles. 33.</note> sayth Ecclesiasticus, <hi>bow downe the hard necke: so tame thine euill seruant</hi> (that is thy body) <hi>with the whips and correction.

Send him to worke, for that belongeth vnto him: if he be not obedient, put on moe heauy fetters.</hi> That he insult not, nor waxe proud, that he be not idle, and rush into open wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes. This holy hatred is much auaileable in the busines of mortification: that is, it is very conducent to the mortifying and cutting away of our euill desires, although it be hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. For without this hatred how can we make incision,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> and draw forth blood, and greeuously wound a thing so dearely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of vs? For the arme and strength of mortification getteth valour not onely from the loue God, but also from the hate of our selues: by vertue of which strength and valour man doth not excruciate his soule of passion, but as a seuere Chirurgian doth cleanse and wipe away the corruption of a member affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and putrified.</p>

Imagination, which is the ignobler of these two, is called a power of our soule, greatly weakened through sinne, &amp; which is very haggard to be subiected vnto reason. For oftentimes as a fugitiue seruant, that departeth without licence, it rusheth out of dores, and wandreth throughout the whole world, before we vnderstand where it is.

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this licenciousnes and naturall wildnes, there are some,<note place="margin">A simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</note> that daily make it worser: as they, that bring vp their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren most deliciously &amp; daintily, permitting them to vage free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether so euer they list, and to doe whatsoeuer pleasure wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them, without any reprehension. Wherefore when as man would, that this imagination should quietly persist in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Diuine things, it is disobedient and immorige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, because it hath accustomed to wander licentiously, neither acknowledgeth it any moderation. Therfore it is needfull that after we haue acquainted our selues with the bad conditions of this beast, that we restraine it, and that we bind it to a cratch, that is, to the consideration of good &amp; necessary things, and that we commaund it perpetuall silence in all-other things. So that, as a little before we haue bound the tongue, that it speaketh not any thing, but good words and to the purpose; so let vs bind our imagination, that it may remaine and continue in good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cogitations, and to all other that we shut the gate against it. Herein we are to vse great discretion, to examine what cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are to be admitted, and what to be excluded: that these may be entertained as friends, and those expelled as enemies. They that are negligent and remisse in this respect, doe let of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes those things enter into their soules, which doe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take away the deuotion and feruour of the spirit, but also cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and loue, in which the life of the soule consisteth. Whilst Isboseth the son of Saul slept on his bed,<note place="margin">2, Kings, 4.</note> his murdering seruants came in vpon him, slew him, and tooke away his head. In like manner when as discretion lyeth slumbering, whose duty it is to purge and seuer the fruite from the chaffe, that is, profitable and good cogitations from the bad and hurtfull, those often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

enter into the soule, which kill it, and depriue it of life. This diligence is not onely conducent for the preseruation of life, but to keepe silence, and it much furthereth prayer.

The duty and office of this vertue in a spirituall life hath great proportion with that,<note place="margin">The duty and office of wisdom. Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</note> which the eyes are in the body, the Pilot in a ship, the King in his kingdome, and the Charret-man in his Charret, who holding his whip in his right hand, and the raines of the bridels in his left, directeth and driueth his Horses whether he will.

For this cause a certaine excellent writer doth place this vertue in the first place, as the Captayne and guide of all others. Wherefore all the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of vertue before all things ought to cast their eyes hether, and diligently behold this vertue, that they may proceede with greater fruite in all others. This vertue not onely hath one du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and office, but many, and those diuers: for it is not only a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler vertue, but a generall, which concurreth with the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of all vertues, conueniently and fitly reducing and bringing them into order. According to this generall duty we will heere speake of certaine actions, which belong vnto it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">The first du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note>First and formost it belongeth vnto wisedome (fayth and charity being presupposed) to direct all our actions to God, as to the last end: by examining subtilly and ingeniously the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which we haue in working and acting: that we may see, if we simply and purely seeke God, or rather our selues. For the nature of our owne selfe-loue (as a certaine famous Doctour
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:9369:238"/>
sayth) is very subtill and full of fetches, and seeketh it selfe in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing, yea in the noblest exercises.</p>
                           <p>It is also the dutie of Wisedome,<note place="margin">The second dutie.</note> to know how to conuerse with thy neighbour without quarrell or complaint: to helpe him, and not to offend him and scandalize him. It is needfull therfore, wisely to discouer euery mans vaine, that is, euery mans condition, and of what spirit he is, and to leade &amp; conduct him by those meanes, which are most profitable for him.</p>
                           <p>It is vvisedome,<note place="margin">The thyrd dutie.</note> to know how to beare patiently other mens defects, and to dissemble them, not to take knowledge of them, and not to search theyr wounds to the bones: remembring that all humane affayres are composed of act and potentiall power, that is, of perfection and imperfection: neyther that it can bee otherwise, but that alwayes there must be infinite imperfections and defects in mans life, especially after that great and grieuous lapse of nature by sinne. And therefore Aristotle sayth, that it is not the part of a Wiseman, in euery matter to seeke for like cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and demonstration. For some things may be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and some cannot: the truth and certainty of one thing may be found out, which of another thing cannot. In like manner it is not the part of a wise man, to looke that all the affayres of man should be peysed in a like ballance, neyther that any thing should bee wanting, for some things can carry this, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things cannot. He that stiflie vrgeth the contrary, perhaps shall more hurt those meanes, that he worketh by, then he shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the end hee intendeth, albeit the thing take effect accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his minde.</p>
                           <p>It is wisedome,<note place="margin">The fourth dutie.</note> if a man know himselfe, and all things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him: that is, all his sences, cogitations, euill appetites, and his sinister intents, to be briefe, his owne ignorance, and his small vertues: that his soule be not puffed vp with vaine glory, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume any thing of it selfe rashly: and that he may better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, with what enemies he is continually to warre: vntill hee hath cast them all out of the land of Promise, that is, out of his soule. It is also vvisedome to consider with what great diligence a man ought to prosecute and attend this worke.</p>
                           <p>It is wisedome,<note place="margin">The fift dutie.</note> to be able to gouerne the tongue according to the prescript of Gods law, and the circumstances before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:9369:239"/>
To know also what is to be spoken, and what to bee concealed, with their due times and seasons. For as Salomon sayth,<note place="margin">Eccles, 3,</note> 
                              <hi>There is a time to keepe silence, and a time to speake.</hi> For it is certaine, that a wise man may with greater praise hold his peace, then speake, at the table, at bankets, and at such like places and oppertunities. It is wisedome also, not to beleeue euery body: not forth-with to poure foorth all the spirit in the beginning &amp; heate of disputation; neyther to speak rashly, or giue iudgment on a suddaine what he thinketh of matters: for Salomon sayth: <hi>A foole vttereth all his minde at once,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Prou, 29.</note> 
                              <hi>but a wise man keepeth it in till afterward.</hi>

                           <p>It is wisedome, if a man hath learned to fore-see a farre of dangers comming;<note place="margin">The 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> duty</note> to diminish blood in the time of health, and to discerne warre a farre of.

                              <hi>Before the griefe be growen, vse Phisicke.</hi> Therfore, when thou art to goe to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, or to any solemnitie, when thou art to haue busines vvith litigious or contentious men, or with those of a peruerse dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition: or if thou art to goe to any other place, where perhaps thou mayst be endangered, alwayes come aduisedly thether, and prepared for all things which may happen.</p>
                           <p>It is wisedome,<note place="margin">The 7. duty</note> to know how to handle the body with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and temperance, that it neither be nourished too deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately, nor be killed through hunger. That wee neither vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw necessary things from it, neyther that we giue it that which is superfluous: that we carry it about chastised, but not almost dead: that through too much weakenes it faint not in the way, nor that through too much abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance it grow restie &amp; iadish, and cast the ryder.</p>
                           <p>It is wisedom,<note place="margin">The 8. duty</note> moderately to labor &amp; exercise, least through the grieuousnes of the burden, the spirit (whose turne all exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises ought to serue) be oppressed: that so we apply our selues to outward things, that we lose not the inward: and so intend the loue of our neighbour, that we doe not lose the diuine loue.
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:9369:239"/>
For if the Apostles themselues,<note place="margin">Acts, 6,</note> who had great measure of Gods Spirit, and great strength, sufficient to carry out all matters, did disburthen themselves of matters of lesser moment, that they might not faile nor faint in greater: no man ought so to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume of his owne strength, that hee should thinke himselfe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for all things: seeing that many times commeth to passe, which is wont to be sayd,

                           </p>
                           <p>It is wisedome,<note place="margin">The 9. duty</note> to obserue the crafts and subtill deceits of the old enemy: to obserue his out-roades and in-roades, and all his stratagems; not to beleeue euery spirit, neither to be deceaued by any apparence and glozing of that which seemes good. For often-times the Angell of sathan transformeth himselfe into an Angell of light, and alwayes endeuoureth to deceaue the good by some semblance and show of good.<note place="margin">No man hurteth more, then hee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnder the show of pietie.</note> Therefore in no danger we ought to be more carefull of our selues, then in that, which is offered vnto vs vnder the vizard and disguise of Vertue.

                           <p>To conclude,<note place="margin">The tenth dutie.</note> it is wisedome, to knowe howe to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and how to retire: to know when it is expedient to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and when to be ouercome: and especially to be able to contemne the iudgement of the world, the censures of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar sort, and to passe by with a deafe eare, the barkings of most vild dogges: who alwayes barke and bawle without a cause, &amp; to remember that of Paule,<note place="margin">Gala, 1,</note>

In which matter, these counsailes that follow may bring vs some helpe. Of the first of which the Wise-man sayth: <hi>Let thine eyes behold that thing that is right,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Prou. 4.</note> 
                              <hi>and let thine eye lids looke straight before thee.</hi> By which words the Wise-man counsayleth vs, that we should doe nothing inconsideratly &amp; vnaduisedly:<note place="margin">what things are required for this wisedome.</note> but that we should long deliberate, and act things by nature and ripe deliberation. For which purpose fiue aduices are necessarily required. First,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that we commend our businesses to the Lord God. Secondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that we consider with great diligence, and with equall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment expend, not onely the substance of the worke; but also all the circumstances of it; for if one of them alone be wanting, it is sufficient to subuert all the purposed worke. For although all the worke be well finished, with all the circumstances of it; yet if onely it be not done in due time, that is sufficient, that the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> worke may be dispraysed and reprehended. Thirdly, that we consult with others, of those things, which are to be done; but let such counsaylers be few in number, and those very choyce. For although it is behoofefull to heare the censures and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all, that the busines may be better examined: yet let the conclusion and determination of the thing be in few mens po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, least it proue faulty. Fourthly, it is very necessary that a

For oftentimes men in the beginning of their conuersation doe seeme to be that, which afterwards they are not found to be; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> being better examined they are refused and reiected.

                           <p>HE therefore that would satisfie the Diuine will, let him assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly knowe, that amongst all the principall matters that GOD commaundeth, there is not one so much beate vppon and so often required,<note place="margin">Charitie is not a naked and a bare affection.</note> as this commaundement of loue: yet so that we vnderstand not thys to be a bare and a naked affection, but to haue annexed vnto it all the effects, which are wont to concurre with true loue: for otherwise it were not woorthy of the name of loue,<note place="margin">1, Iohn 3,</note> as the same Euangelist showeth, saying: <hi>Who so hath this worlds good, and seeth his brother haue neede, and shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp his compassion from him: howe dwelleth the loue of God in him? My babes, let vs not loue in word, neyther in tongue, but in deed and in verity.</hi> Therefore vnder the name of loue, amongst many other,<note place="margin">Sixe duties of Charitie</note> sixe things are comprehended; To loue, to counsayle, to releeue, to beare, to pardon, and to teach by good examples: which workes are so ioyned with Charitie, that as any one hath moe or fewer of them, he hath more or lesse Charitie. Thys we say to this end, because there are found some who say; I loue. but theyr loue hath no effect, but the name onely. There be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who loue, and by good admonitions and counsailes, doe giue some relish of it: but they doe not open theyr coffers, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put theyr hands into theyr Chest, that they may releeue the necessities of theyr brethren and neyghbours. Againe, there be others that helpe theyr neyghbour with theyr aduice, &amp; releeue hym with that they possesse: yet they beare not the iniuries and infirmities of theyr brother, nor follow the counsaile of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, who sayth,<note place="margin">Gala, 6.</note> 
                              <hi>Beare ye one anothers burden, &amp; so fulfil the law of Christ.</hi> Some beare patiently the iniury offered vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but they do not pardon mercifully him that hath iniured them: and although in their harts they beare no hate, yet outwardly they doe not show forth their loue by benefits, by pliantnesse, and by
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:9369:243"/>
fauour. These, although they doe not faile in the first, yet they doe not profit in the second: neither doe they come to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this vertue. There be some that haue all the fore-said effects: but they edifie theyr neighbor neyther with words nor with good examples, which surely is the noblest among the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Charitie.</p>
                           <p>According to this order euery man may examine himselfe, that he may vnderstand what he hath, and what is wanting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in this vertue. For we may say, hee that loueth, is in the first degree of charitie: hee that loueth, and giueth counsell, in the second: he that loueth, counsaileth, and releeueth, in the third: he that loueth, counsaileth, releeueth, and suffereth, in the fourth: he that loueth, counsaileth, releeueth, suffereth, and pardoneth, in the fift: but he that loueth, counsaileth, succou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, suffereth, pardoneth, and teacheth edyfying by examples, or godly words, which is properly of those that are perfect, and who are Apostolike men, he hath ascended the sixt steppe, and standeth vpon the vpmost staire. And these be the positiue or affirmatiue acts, which are required in charitie: for they showe what we ought to doe for our neighbour.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">The nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue duties of Charitie.</note> There be others negatiue, which teach what wee ought not to doe to our neighbour; of which sort these are. Not to iudge another; not to detract another mans estimation; not to couet his goods; not to lust after the dignity or the wife of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: not to giue him an offence, or scandalize him, eyther by raylings, or vnhonest words, or those that are superfluous, much lesse by examples, or ill counsailes. He that diligently obserueth all these, he fulfilleth whatsoeuer is required in the perfection of this diuine commaundement. And if thou desirest a particuler and a briefe memory of all these comprehended in one worde, see that thou hast,<note place="margin">Wee must haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart of a mother towards our neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note> as wee sayd before, the hart of a mother to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thy neighbour, and thou shalt altogether fulfill whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hath hetherto been spoken. Consider how a wise &amp; a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious mother, louing her sonne, admonisheth him, if any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be neere vnto him; she succoureth him in need, she beareth his errors and faults with patience, sometimes chasticing them with iustice, some-times couering and concealing them vvith wisedom. For all vertues do waite vpon this one as the Queene
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:9369:243"/>
and mother of all other Vertues. Consider also howe the same mother reioyceth at the good, and sorroweth at the ill hap of her sonne; no otherwise then if they were her owne: With vvhat great zeale she affecteth his profit and honour; how deuoutly and diligently she alwayes prayeth vnto GOD for him; to be short, how shee is more carefull for the health and safety of her sonne, then for her owne: and that shee is cruell and seuere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards herselfe, that shee may be gentle and good to her sonne. If thou canst come thus farre, that thou louest thy neighbour with such an hart, then thou art come to the perfection of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: but if it be not giuen vnto thee to ascend so high, yet at least let this be the scope of thy desires, and alwayes direct thy lyfe hether; that thou maist be lifted higher and higher, and that thou mayst not sticke in lower matters.</p>
                           <p>But if thou shalt aske mee, howe thou mayest be induced with such an hart to loue a forreiner:<note place="margin">How such an hart is to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased.</note> I say that thou oughtest to consider of thy neighbour, not as a forreiner or an alian; but as the image of GOD, the workmanshyp of his hands, &amp; his sonne, and the liuely member of Christ. Hence it is that Saint Paule so often admonisheth vs, that all we are the members of Christ: therefore, by sinning against our neighbour, wee sinne against Christ; and by dooing good vnto our neighbour vvee do good vnto Christ. So that thou must consider of thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, not as a man, or such a man, but as of Christ himselfe, or a liuely member of him. And although thy neighbour be not such an one in respect of the matter of his body, yet hee is such an one in regard of the participation of the same spirit, and of the greatnes of the reward &amp; remuneration: seeing that Christ sayth, He that receaueth his neighbour, receiueth him; neyther shall his reward be other, then if hee had receiued Christ hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
                           <p>Remember also all the commendations of thys Vertue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sette downe of vs, and howe greatly it is commended of God. For if there be a liuely desire in thee to please God, wilt thou not endeuour to performe thys one thing so acceptable vnto him? Consider what the loue of one kinsman is to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the onely participation of flesh and blood which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them: and let it shame thee, if the grace of the spirituall

                        <p>The second thing, that is required after this holy loue, is feare,<note place="margin">2. Feare and reuerence.</note> which springeth of this loue: for by how much more we loue any one, by so much we feare, that we doe not onely not lose him, but also that we doe not offend him. This is manifest in the loue of a good sonne towards his father, and of a wife to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her husband: who by how much she more tenderly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him, so much the more diligently she endeuoureth, least any thing be found in the house, that may offend her husband. This feare is the keeper of innocency: and therefore it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that it take deepe rooting in our harts: which thing the Prophet Dauid long agoe desired of God, when hee sayde; <hi>Pierce through my flesh with thy feare:<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> for I am afrayde of thy iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> It was not inough for this most holy King to haue feare planted in his hart; but also he would haue it pierced and thrust through his flesh and bowels, that through it he might haue a smarting sence of it, as a naile fastned through, which might stick in his mind for a perpetuall memoriall, to stirre him vp that he might not sleepe, and so in some-thing offend his eyes, whom he feareth: therefore it is most fitly sayd of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus;
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:9369:245"/>
                           <hi>The feare of the Lord driueth out sinne.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ecclesi. 1.</note> For by how much any one is feared, by so much more diligently we take heed that we doe not offend him. It pertayneth to this holy feare, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not to commit euill deeds, but also to examine the good, least perhaps they be not pure, or want their necessary circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: least a thing of it selfe good, by our defect be made euill, and vnprofitable. For Saint Gregory sayd very well; It per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth to a righteous man to feare a fault, where no fault is. Such a feare holy Iob had, when he sayd, <hi>I did feare all my works, knowing,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Iob. 9.</note> 
                           <hi>that thou doost not spare the offender.</hi> It pertayneth also to this feare, that when we are present in the Church at Diuine seruice, especially where the holy Sacrament is administred, that we chat not, nor walke, nor vnreuerently gaze about, casting our eyes now hether, now thether, as many doe: but we ought to abide there with feare, and great reuerence in the presence of the Diuine maiestie,<note place="margin">How feare is bred in vs.</note> who is there after a speciall manner. But if thou askest me, how this holy affection is begot and bred in our soules; I say, as I sayd a little before, that the loue of God is the especiall roote of it. After which, seruile feare in like manner auayleth, which is the beginning of filiall feare, and doth bring it into the soule, no otherwise then the bristle doth bring the Shoomakers lyne into the shooe. To nourish and increase this holy affection, the consideration of the exceeding highnes of the Diuine maiesty is profitable, and the consideration of the depth and profundity of Gods iudgements, the greatnes of his iustice, and the multitude of our sinnes, but especially the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which we make against Diuine inspirations. Therfore it is great wisedome, to busie and occupy our minds with these foure considerations: for so this holy feare is begot and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in our soules. Of this feare we haue more copiously spoken in the eight and twenty Chapter of the precedent booke.</p>
                        <p>The third vertue,<note place="margin">3. Trust and confidence. A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> which is required in this Diuine worke, is trust and confidence: that is, euen as a sonne in all his troubles and necessities, which happen vnto him, trusteth and affianceth his repose in his father (especially if he be rich and powerfull) that his helpe and fatherly prouidence will not at any time faile him: so also in this matter let a man haue the hart of a sonne so enlarged, that considering he hath such a father, as he hath, in
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:9369:246"/>
 whose hands is all the power of heauen and earth, let him bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope and assuredly trust, that in all troubles, that betide him he shall finde helpe in that father; and let him constantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade himselfe, that if he turne vnto him, hoping in the mercy of this heauenly father, he shall altogether be deliuered from euill, or it shall be ordered to his greater good, and further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity. For if the sonne hath so great repose and security in his father; how much more ought to be our confidence and trust in God, who is our father after a better manner, then all earthly fathers; and is richer, then all the richest men of this world. But if thou shalt say,<note place="margin">An obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that the scarcity of thy good works and deserts, and the multitude of the sinnes of thy passed life doe strike a feare into thee, whereby thou darest not expect or promise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy selfe so great things from God;<note place="margin">The answer</note> the remedy will be, if (when this cogitation commeth into thy mind) thou forth-with turnest thy mind from it, &amp; turnest thy selfe wholy vnto God, and to his onely sonne our Sauiour and Mediatour. For then presently thou shalt recouer thy courage, and thy strength shall increase in him.<note place="margin">A simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</note> Euen as we add courage vnto them, who passe or ferry ouer any swift current or riuer, which with the swiftnes and velocity of the running, causeth the swimming and giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the head, and with some call or encouragement admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them that they should not behold the water, but the earth or heauen, that they may more securely and healthfully passe: so those that be faint-harted and weaklings, are to be dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in this busines, least heere they looke vpon themselues, or their sinnes.</p>
                        <p>But perhaps thou wilt say,<note place="margin">Another obiection.</note> whether shall I turne me, that I may procure this strength and confidence vnto me?<note place="margin">The answer</note> I aunswer, that aboue all things the infinite goodnes and mercy of God is to be considered, which extendeth it selfe to all the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of thys world. Then his infallible promises are to be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which he promiseth grace and helpe to those that call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Name, and doe flie vnto him. Neyther are we further to doubt.<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> For we see that the enemies themselues, doe not denie, their fauour &amp; beneuolence to them that flie vnto their Tents, because they are marked for banishment with some brand or incision, but they graciously defend them in the time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:9369:246"/>
and heale theyr woundes. Consider also the multitude of benefits, which hetherto thou hast receaued of his gracious and bountifull hands; and of his mercy, which thou hast already tryed in benefits past,<note place="margin">The merits of Christ.</note> learne to hope for things to come. But aboue all these looke vpon Christ with all his torments &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, in which there be especiall causes, why we may confidently presume to sue for the fauour of GOD; seeing that it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that those merrits on the one part are so great, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be greater; and on the other part are the treasuries of the Church, for remedy and releefe of all them, which stand in need of them. These are the cheefest props of our trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which haue so strengthened and encouraged the Saints in those things they hoped, that they were more stedfast and and more vnmoueable then mount Sion. But it is greatly to be wondered at, that we, when we haue so great motiues to moue vs to hope, and so iust reasons to perswade vs to trust, yet that we are so weake and faint-harted, that when we see present dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to hang ouer our heads, forth-with wee flie into Egypt, to the shadow of Pharaoes Charriots. So that many seruants of GOD are found strong and couragious in fastings, feruent in prayers, liberall in almes, deedes, and exercised, and expert in other vertues: but very few are found, who haue so steddy a confidence,<note place="margin">Dan. 13.</note> as that holy woman Susanna had; <hi>Whose hart</hi> (when she was condemned to death, and brought to the place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution) <hi>had confidence and trust in the Lord.</hi> Hee that desireth moe authorities for the perswasion of this vertue, he may bring the whole store-house of the holy Scripture: especially the Psalmes and the Prophets, in which nothing is so vsuall and common, as hope in God, and assurednes of the Diuine ayde and assistance, which remayneth for them that trust in him.</p>
                        <p>The fourth vertue is the zeale of Gods honour;<note place="margin">The 4, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which is the zeale of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> that is, if all our cogitations be to this end, that the honour of the Diuine maiesty may be encreased; and be preferred, sanctified; and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified before all other things; and that his will may be done in earth as it is in heauen: and that we haue this minde in vs, that no greater griefe can happen vnto vs, then to see the Diuine honour impugned or abused.

Therefore in this poynt we must diligently aduice our selues, and examine all our actions with an vpright and an impartiall iudgement, as men iealous: that our mind doth respect no other thing in working, but God himselfe: for the property of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall selfe-loue is very subtill (as we sayd before) &amp; seeketh it selfe in all things.

Many men in great places and dignities, placed as well in the common-wealth as in the Church, seeing vertue laudable and beautifull in her functions, haue endeuoured themselues so to walke in her trackt, that they haue been reputed for good men; and haue purged their hands from all filthy luker aud vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which might by any meanes haue polluted their honours. Yet they haue done it for this respect, that they might not fall from that authority, they were placed in; and that they might be fauoured of theyr Princes, and graced with great dignities and honours. And therfore theyr good works proceeded not from the liuely sparke of loue, or from the feare of God: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had they his obedience and glory theyr purposed end, but sought for their owne commodity, and the glory of man. But

what soeuer is doone after thys manner, although it seeme som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in mans eyes, yet in Gods sight it is as smoake, and a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of righteousnes, &amp; not true righteousnes.

In the Temple there was not any thing,<note place="margin">3, Regum, 6</note> which eyther was not gold, or that was not couered with pure gold: so it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that any thing should be in the liuely Temple of our soule, which is not eyther charitie, or ouer-guilded &amp; deaurated with charity.<note place="margin">The intent approueth &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the worke.</note> Therefore the seruant of God should not so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that he doth, as the end which he intendeth and destineth it for.

                           <head>¶ Of the foure degrees of obedience.</head>
                           <p>THE eyght Vertue,<note place="margin">8. Obedience.</note> which we owe to this heauenly Father, is a generall obedience in all those things, which hee hath commaunded: in which consisteth the sum and complement of all righteousnes. This Vertue hath three degrees; the first is, to obey the diuine commaundements: the second, the diuine counsailes: and the third, to obey the inspirations and inward callings of GOD. The obeying of the commaundements of God, are absolutely necessary vnto saluation: the counsailes do helpe a man to keepe them, without which, man is oftentimes endangered, and ieopardeth himselfe in them: for not to swear at all, although it be in a true and a iust matter, maketh vs that we neuer sweare falsely. Patience maketh vs, that we lose not the peace of minde and charitie. Not to possesse any thing of our owne, maketh vs that we doe not desire or couet any thing of anothers. To doe well vnto those that doe ill vnto vs, is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs that we doe not ill vnto our selues. Therefore the counsailes are as Bulwarkes and Fortresses vnto the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: and therefore let him that meaneth to hit his ayme &amp; obtaine his purposed scope, not be content with the keeping of one, but also let him contend, as much as he is able according to his degree and condition,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> to obserue the other. For euen as hee that would ferry ouer a swift Riuer, doth not directly ferry ouer it, but somewhat crooketh his course, and forceth his boat som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what vp the streame, that he may come the better to his roade: so the seruant of God ought not onely to consider what is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for saluation, but also he ought to begin &amp; keep a course some-what more straight and hard, that albeit he cannot attaine
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:9369:249"/>
the perfection proposed vnto himselfe, yet at the least hee may attaine saluation.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">The thyrd degree.</note> The thyrd degree that we spoke of, is to obey the Diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirations and callings. For good seruaunts doe not onely obey theyr Maisters in those things, which are commaunded vnto them by the voyce of theyr Maisters, but also in those thinges, which they signifie vnto them by some nod or token. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we may here easily be deceiued, supposing that it is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine inspiration, which is eyther of the deuill, or of man, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth vs to obserue diligently that of Saint Iohn; <hi>Beleeue not euery spirit,</hi>

We may say of that man, who hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained these foure degrees of obedience, that he hath come to that resignation of himselfe, which is commended with so great praises of those that sette downe and extoll a spirituall life, which deliuereth a man into Gods hands, no otherwise to be handled, then soft waxe is handled in the hands of an Artificer. It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Resignation,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> because euen as he that resigneth a benefice, vtterly depriueth himselfe of it, and committeth it wholy to the next incombent, that hee may dispose of it according to his minde, without contradiction of the former professour: so a perfect man rendereth himselfe ouer into the Diuine hands, so
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:9369:249"/>
that hereafter he will not be his owne, nor liue to himselfe; nor eate, nor sleepe, nor labour for himselfe, but for the only glorie of his Creator, conforming himselfe to the Diuine vvill, in all things as hee disposeth of him: receiuing from his handes all scourges, and tribulations, which are sent, and that with great quiet and tranquility of minde, depriuing himselfe of his owne liberty and will, that the will of the Lord may be onely doone, to whom he acknowledgeth himselfe to be infinitely bound. After this maner the Prophet signifyeth himselfe to haue beene resigned,<note place="margin">Psalm, 73,</note> when he saith; <hi>I am as a beast before thee: and I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by thee.</hi> For euen as a beast goeth not whether he will, nor resteth nor worketh when he pleaseth, but in all things obeyeth his Gouernour: so ought the seruant of God to do, by submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himselfe perfectly vnto God.</p>
                           <p>Thys is that whereof the Prophet Esay speaketh, saying: <hi>The Lord GOD hath opened myne eare,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Esay, 58,</note> 
                              <hi>and I will not gaine-say him, I haue not gone backewards:</hi> in those things he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded me, albeit they were sharpe and difficult. Those my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall beastes of Ezechiell doe signifie the same thing, of which it is written,<note place="margin">Ezech, 1,</note> that <hi>whether as the spirit ledde them,</hi> (that is, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of the holy Ghost) <hi>thether they went, and returned not in theyr going.</hi> By which figure is declared, with what great ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie of mind, and with what great ioy a man ought to runne to all those things, which he vnderstandeth to be according to the will of his Lord. Wherefore, the readines and promptnes of will is not onely here required, but also the discretion of the vnderstanding, and the discretion of the spirit, as we haue sayd before, least we be deceaued, embracing our owne will for the will of GOD: yea, speaking after the common manner, all that ought to be suspected of vs, to which at any time vvee are inclined by the guydance of our owne will: and that we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that there is more securitie in whatsoeuer is contrarie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                           <p>This is the noblest and the greatest sacrifice, that man can offer vnto God: for in other sacrifices, he offereth his, but in this he offereth himselfe; and the same difference which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man himselfe and his goods, is also found between these two kind of sacrifices. In such a sacrifice that of Saint Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine

is fulfilled; Although God is the Lord of all things, yet it is not lawfull for all to say with Dauid; <hi>O Lord I am thine</hi>: but for them onely, who haue put of their owne liberty, and haue wholy vowed and deuoted themselues to the Diuine worship, and after this manner are made his. This is the most conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent disposition and order to come to the perfection of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian life. For seeing that our Lord God of his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is alwayes ready to enrich and reforme man, when he resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth not, nor contradicteth his will, but is wholy dedicated to his obedience: he can easily worke in him whatsoeuer he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and make him as another Dauid, a man according to his owne hart.</p>

Therfore let it not seeme a cruell thing vnto thee, if thou miserable vild and abiect man sufferest scourges, which he sendeth vnto thee, who for thy sinnes would not depart out of this life without scourges; who came into it without sinnes.

For by it he shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue two great commodities: the first, because that which is to be borne shall not seeme so great, if it be fore-seene: for darts fore-seene, as sayth Seneca, doe lesse hurt.

that, vvhich Abraham offered, when he prepared himselfe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ffer his sonne Isaack. For as often as man doth set downe with himselfe, that this euil or that may happen vnto him from God, or from men, and he as the seruant of God prepareth himselfe, and hath determined already to receaue it with all humility and patience, and therfore resigneth himselfe into the hands of the Lord, and is ready to entertaine any tribulation, which way so euer it commeth, after that manner as Dauid did, the iniury of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and done vnto him of Semei, as though God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to doe it; let him be ascertayned, that if he haue his mind thus disposed, although that commeth not to passe he expected or supposed, yet it shall be as acceptable, as if it had happened vnto him. Therefore a Christian ought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that this is one of the especiall parts of Christian profession, which Saint Peter teacheth,<note place="margin">1, Pet. 2.</note> saying; <hi>If when yee doe well, yee suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer wrong, and shall take it patiently, then is there thanke with God: For heere-vnto verily were yee called.</hi> Therefore let a Christian, that liueth in this vvorld,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> thinke, that he is a rocke placed in the midst of the Sea, which on euery side is beate and crushed with vvaues and billowes, yet neuertheles he persisteth firme, neyther is remoued out of his place.</p>
                           <p>These things therfore are the more copiously handled of vs, because seeing that the profession of a Christian life (as Saint Bernard sayth) is diuided into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is further to be noted in this place, that in this vertue of Patience according to the Doctors,<note place="margin">Three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</note> that there are three most excellent degrees, and one more perfect then another. The first is, patiently to suffer afflictions. The second is, of own accord to desire them for the loue of Christ Iesus. The third is, to reioyce in the same afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Therfore the seruant of God must not be content be to be in the first degree of patience, but he must labour to come to the second; and when he is come vnto this, he must not rest, but proceede vntill he hath attayned the third. We haue an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the first degree in holy Iob; of the second, in the holy

Thys is one of the chiefest degrees of patience, charitie, and perfection, to which an humane creature may ascend: but fewe ascend so high: and therefore the Lord hath commaunded it vnto none.

For seeing that we haue spoken &amp; discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of many kinds of vertues, it is behoofefull that we teach, which is worthier, and which lesse worthy: that we may esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate matters according to their dignity, and assigne a proper place to euery one. For he that selleth precious pearles &amp; rich Iems,<note place="margin">A simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</note> ought very well to know them, that he be not deceaued in the price: and the ouer-seer and gouernour of any Princes house, ought to know the deserts of euery one in the house, that

                           <note place="margin">The two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold order of vertues.</note> Therfore we must know, that all the vertues, vvhich hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we haue spoken of, may be reduced into a two-fold order; for some of them be spirituall, inuisible, and internall; and some corporall, visible, and externall. In the first order are theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vetues, with all other, which are referred vnto God, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Charity, which among all other vertues possesseth the first and chiefe place, as the Queene of all other. To this are many other noble vertues ioyned, and which are nearest vnto Charity in dignity; as are, humility, chastity, mercy, patience, discretion, deuotion, poorenes of spirit, contempt of the world, denying of our owne will, the loue of the Crosse and of austeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and very many moe of this kind, which, by taking largely the signification of this vvord, we call vertues. They are called spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and internall vertues, because principally they reside and haue their being in the soule, although also they passe into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall works, as we see in Charity and deuotion: vvhich albeit they are altogether internall, yet they produce their external acts to the honour and glory of God.</p>
                        <p>Other vertues are more externall and visible, as are fasting discipline, silence, solitarines, reading, singing, preaching, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and a religious life. For albeit these vertues also reside and haue their being in the soule, yet their proper acts are more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, then the former,<note place="margin">The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vertues are more excellent then the externall.</note> which are often hid, and inuisible; as are to beleeue, to loue, to hope, to contemplate, to be humbled, to be inwardly contrite for sinnes, to iudge discreetly, and so in others. Among all these vertues there is no doubt, but that the former are farre more excellent, and more necessary then the latter. For

the Lord sayth vnto the vvoman of Samaria:<note place="margin">Iohn, 4.</note> 
                           <hi>Woman, beleeue me, the houre commeth, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit, and in the truth: for such the father also requireth to worship him.

                        <p>Wherfore also the Prophet Dauid describing the beauty of the Church, and of a soule, that is in the fauour of God, he saith; <hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psal. 45.</note> The same thing the Apostle insinuateth, when he sayth to his Disciple Timothy;<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note>

                        <p>This also the Heathen Philosophers vnderstood:<note place="margin">Aristotle.</note> For Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle, who albeit he writ very little concerning God, yet sayth; If humane affaires be regarded of God, as we may very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly gather that they are, it is very likely, that he ioyeth in the best things, and in those that are the likest vnto him: but those are the mind and spirit of man. Therfore they that haue their spirits beautified and adorned vvith the knowledge of the truth, and reformed affections, are most acceptable vnto God.</p>
                        <p>The same thing Galen the Prince of Phisitians vnderstood;<note place="margin">Galen.</note> for speaking in a certaine booke of the composition and frame of mans body, and of the vse and profit of the parts of it, when he had come to a certaine place, where the greatnes of the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and prouidence of the supreame and omniscient work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister shyned after a singuler and especiall manner; being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into a most deepe admiration of so great wonders, he as one forgetting his Phisick profession, on a sodaine flyeth to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, and exclayming sayth; Others honor and worship God by Frankensence &amp; Hecatombs (which is a sacrifice of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:9369:256"/>
beasts) but I will worship him by reuealing and publishing the greatnes of his vvisedome, which so wisely knew how to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der euery thing in the frame &amp; fructure of this admirable work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship; and by telling of the greatnes of his power, which could effect euery thing so well ordered; with the greatnes of his goodnes, which hath without any grudging or repining so aboundantly prouided for all creatures necessaries for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of themselues. This a Heathen Philosopher sayd: but I pray thee what could a Christian speake more perfectly? vvhat could he speake better, or more sacredly, yea, albeit he had reade that of the Prophet: <hi>I desire mercy and not sacrifice: and the knowledge of God more then whole burnt offerings?</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Ose 6.</note> Change the name of Hecatombe into a burnt offering, and thou shalt see that an Heathen Philosopher, and a Prophet of God doe speake one and the selfe same thing.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding that we haue spoken so great things of the vertues of the former kind, others also, which we haue bestowed in the second place, (although they be of lesser dignity) are of great waight &amp; moment, both to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe those that be greater, and also to preserue them: &amp; also some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are necessary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they fal vnder precept. This may be proued by running through those vertues, which ere-while we spake of. For solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes preserueth a man that he heareth not, seeth not, speaketh not, and that he doth not a thousand things, which might giue occasion to incurre danger, not only to lose the peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of conscience, but also to make shipwrack of chastity and innocency. Euery one knowes how profitable silence is both to preserue piety and deuotion, and also to keepe a man from the sinnes, which are committed in much babling. For the Wise-man sayth,<note place="margin">Prou. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>Where much babling is, there must needes be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi> Fasting, besides that it is an act of temperance, it also cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticeth the body, strengtheneth the spirit, weakneth our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and disposeth vnto prayer, reading, and contemplation; it spareth and auoydeth superfluous costs, and deliuereth from lusts and wanton desires, in which gluttons, and belly-gods doe liue, being louers of trifles, contentions, quarrels, and of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutenes, in all which gurmandizing Epicures are wont to be delighted. Furthermore, to reade godly bookes, to heare ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb facs="tcp:9369:256"/>
to attend on prayer, to sing Psalmes, and to be present at Diuine exercises, are plainly inough knowne to be acts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of Religion, and motiues vnto piety, and meanes further to enlighten the vnderstanding, and more and more to inflame the affections with the loue of spirituall things. This is conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by so manifest experience, that if the Heretikes would haue seene to it, they had not fallen into so absurd errors, as they haue. For we daily see with our eyes, and feele with our hands, and behold in euery place where discipline, and obseruance of these exteriour matters are kept and obserued, that there vertues flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish most, and that there is alwayes greater godlines, deuotion, and charity: and that there are seene more excellent persons, and that there the feare of the Lord, and Christianity her selfe are more perfect. But all things runne contrary, where no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard is had of them: For this obseruance being neglected, the conscience also, the manners, and life are neglected: for vvhere there is greater occasion of sinne, there also moe and greater sinnes are committed.</p>
                        <p>For wee all,<note place="margin">Terence.</note> as one sayth, become worser through liberty. Euen as in a Vineyard well kept,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> and fenced with a wall or an hedge, all things are in safety: so in that, which is ill kept, &amp; not fenced, all things lye open to the lust and pray of theeues. The like happeneth to man, that is disordered, and will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned within order and rule. What argument more manifest, I pray thee, may be desired for the dilucidation of this matter, that we may see the profit of these things, then that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from experience; For a man that desireth to obtayne and preserue that excellent vertue of deuotion, which maketh a man prompt and fit for all other vertues, and is as a spurre to all good, how shall it euer be possible, that an affection so super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, and so delicate should be obtayned and preserued of that man; vvho was neuer carefull for the safegard and keepe of himselfe?<note place="margin">The affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how tender and delicate.</note> For this affection is so delicate, and if it be lawfull so to speake, so fugitiue and fleeting, that in the twinkling or turning of an eye it sodainly vadeth and vanisheth. For one immoderate laughter, one superfluous word, one gluttons sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, a little wrath, contention, or other small distraction; or curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes to see, heare, or vnderstand a thing not necessary, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb facs="tcp:9369:257"/>
it be not euill, is sufficient to take away a good part of deuotion. Therfore not only pallable and grosse sinnes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so any superfluous imployment, or other matters, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our minds from God, doe extinguish and quench deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For he that would haue Iron alwayes to glow and shine, it is necessary that he alwayes apply it to the fire: For if he take it from the fire,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> forthwith it returneth to his naturall coldnesse: So this most noble affection, for dependeth of that, that man be continually vnited vnto God by actuall loue and contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if he turne himselfe but a little from him, forth-with he slideth back to the bosome of his mother, that is, to the old dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position which before he had.</p>

                        <p>But by this the difference may be plainly knowne, which is betweene these and those;<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the outward vertues, and the inward.</note> for those are as the end, these as the meanes to the end: those as health, these as a medicine, by bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of which we obtaine health. Those are as the spirit of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, these as the body of it: which albeit it is part of the whole, yet one part is more principall then another, and whose functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more especially required in working. Those are as the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, these as the keyes by which it is opened and shutte. Those are the fruite of the tree, these as leaues which adorne the tree, and doe preserue the fruite from the iniury of the ayre. Albeit in thys the comparison is lame and maimed, and somewhat fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: because the leaues of the tree, although they preserue the

The first is, that a perfect man and a true seruant of God, ought not onely to seeke for spirituall vertues (albeit they be excellent and noble) b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap> as well for the preseruation of them, as for the obtaining of absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and the whole complement of Christian righteousnes. Wherefore he ought to consider, that as man is not only a soule, nor onely a body, but a soule &amp; a body together: (for the soule without the body, maketh not a perfect man, &amp; the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the soule, is no other thing then a sacke full of earth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,) so also it is necessary, that hee know that true and perfect Christianitie, is not onely internall, nor externall; but internall and externall together. For the internall alone cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued without the externall, whether it be little or much, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the conueniencie of the bond of euery mans estate:<note place="margin">The exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vertues are to bee ioyned to the internal.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it sufficient for the fulfilling of all righteousnes. Much lesse can the externall without the internal make a man perfect: as neyther the body alone without the soule can make a man. Euen as therefore all the life of the body proceedeth from the soule;<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> so all the dignity and worth of the externall, proceedeth from the internall, but especially from Charity.</p>
                        <p>He therefore that will not erre from this scope and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned resolution, let him thinke that as he, that made man, would not separate the soule from the body; so he must not seuer the spirituall from the corporall, that would make a perfect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. The body is ioyned to the soule, the treasure is preserued in the Arke, the hedge compassing the Vineyard, dooth make it safe, and Vertue is defended by her Fortresses, Bulwarkes, &amp; defences, which are her owne parts. Otherwise, beleeue me, one will decay and perrish another. For one cannot be increased nor assisted, vnlesse both be ioyned together. Consider how nature,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:9369:258"/>
and Art the Ape and imitatour of Nature doe nothing, which hath not eyther a barke or some couer for a fortification &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and also for an ornament of it: after the same manner Grace also worketh, which is the most perfect forme, and most perfectly effecteth her operations. Remember also that it is written;<note place="margin">Eccles, 7,</note> 
                           <hi>He that feareth God, neglecteth not any thing</hi>: And, <hi>Hee that setteth naught by small things,</hi>

Remember the dangers which hee incurreth, that neglecteth small things: for this is the high-way that leadeth to great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Marke also the order of the plagues of Egipt, after harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and hurtlesse Frogs, came lyce, and great flyes, Gadbees, stinging Horse-flies, and byting Oxe-flies. Whereby it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the neglect and contempt of the lesser, doth prepare the way for greater: for they that feare not polluting and euill-sauouring Froggs, will not feare stinging Horse-flies, &amp; byting Oxe-flies.</p>

                           <head>¶ The second instruction.</head>
                           <p>BY that we learne also, to what vertues we ought most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to addict our endeuours and studies; vpon which we ought to bestow greater diligence, and vpon which lesser: as men doe, who make greater account of an heape of gold, then of siluer; and doe more esteeme an eye then a finger: so also it is meete and requisite, that with greater endeuour and diligence we should apply our selues to the woorthier vertues, and vvyth lesser to the lesse worthy: otherwise, if we more diligently stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and imploy our paines rather vppon the ignobler then the noble, the whole spirituall busines will be disordered. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I say, that those Bishops and Pastors do very wisely, that in theyr pulpits and Sermons doe often beate vpon these wordes; Silence, Fasting, Solitarines, Rites and Ceremonies, and that often stand vpon, and preach Charity, Humility, Prayer, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, Contemplation,<note place="margin">Internall vertues lesse known the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> externall.</note> the Feare of God, the Loue of our Neighbour, and such like. And this ought to be done so much the more often, by how much the inward defects are more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:9369:259"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the outward: and therefore rhe more dangerous. For euen as men are more diligent to amend defects that are seene of them, then those that are vnseene: so it is to be feared, that they haue no care of inward defects, which are not seene, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are most diligent in outward, which are publique, and openly discerned. Furthermore, the exteriour vertues, as they are more manifest vnto men, so also they are better known and had in greater esteeme; as are Abstinence, Watching, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline, &amp; corporall austeritie. But the interiour vertues, Hope, Charity, Humility, Discretion, the Feare of God, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, are more occult and hid: and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they be in greater honour with God, yet they are not so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued in mans iudgement.<note place="margin">Luke, 16,</note> And therefore our Sauiour sayth; <hi>Yee are they that iustifie your selues before men, but God knoweth your harts.</hi> Not dissonant to this, is that of Paule; <hi>Hee is not a Iewe which is a Iew outward.</hi>

                              <hi>Neyther is that circumcision which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the flesh. But he is a Iew which is one inwardly, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision of the hart, which consisteth in the spirit, and not in the letter, is circumcision, whose praise is not of men, but of God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Seeing therefore, that those externall are in so great estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among men, and are so admired of all, and the appetite of selfe honour and excellencie is so subtill, and the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of all the appetites, it is to be feared, least that affection draw a man rather to loue and seeke after those vertues, by which greater honour is expected, then those, by which lesser: yea perhaps among men none. For to the loue of these, the spirit inuiteth, but to the loue of the other, the spirit and the flesh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite together, which is exceeding vehement, and most vnpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in her desires. Which seeing that it is so, not without cause it is to be feared, least these two affections should ouer-come that one, and should carry the victory from it. To thys mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe the light of this doctrine opposeth it selfe, which defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and patronizeth a iuster cause, and notwithstanding these, commaundeth place to be giuen to this, which deserueth more: admonishing vs, that we loue that, and embrace it with greater feruency, which is more profitable, and more necessary.</p>

                           <p>BY that also wee gather, that as often as it happeneth that these vertues doe so concurre at one and the selfe same time, that we cannot entertaine and content them altogether; then according to the rule of Gods precepts, the lesser must giue place to the greater. Otherwise order will be inuerted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed.<note place="margin">Bernard in his booke of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation a little after y<hi rend="sup">c</hi> beginning.</note> This Saint Bernard teacheth in his booke of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and the dispensation; Furthermore, sayth he, many things are inuented and ordayned, not because we may not liue other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, but because so to liue is more expedient: neyther are they deuised for any other end, then for the preseruing and good of charity. So long therfore as they respect and ayme at charity, they stand firme and vnmoueable, and may not be changed without offence, no not of the inuenters and ordayners. But if contrarily at any time they seeme contrary vnto charity, they are to be changed and altered, but onely of those to whom it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to see this, and to whom this busines is committed to be ouer-seene; and not of euery ouer-weening Disciplinarian, and giddy-braind humorist: seemeth it not most meete and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, that those things that were inuented for Charity, should also for charity, when it seemeth conuenient, be eyther omitted, or intermitted, or be changed into some other thing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious? For otherwise without doubt it is most vniust, if or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and constitutions onely deuised for charity, should be held and maintayned against charity. Therefore let them be held assuredly and firmely immutable, yea, amongst Prelates, which are grounded vpon necessary considerations, but so farre forth as they serue vnto charity. Hetherto are the words of Saint Bernard.</p>

                           <p>TWo kinds of iustice and righteousnes are gathered out of this same Doctrine;<note place="margin">A two-fold righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> one is true, the other false. True righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes and iustice comprehendeth together both things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and externall, which are required to the preseruing of them.

<pb n="500" facs="tcp:9369:260"/>
without humility, without deuotion, and without other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vertues. Like to this was the righteousnes of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seis, of whom the Lord speaketh in Mathew;<note place="margin">Math. 23.</note>

                              <hi>but they haue despised my law.</hi> And in another place; <hi>Why offer ye so many sacrifices vnto me, sayth the Lord? I am full of the burnt offerings of vveathers, and of the fatnes of fed beasts, I haue no pleasure in the blood of bullocks, lambs, and goates. Offer me no moe oblations, for it is but lost labour: Incense is an abhominable thing vnto me, I may not away with your new moones, your Sabaoths, and solemne meetings, your solemne assemblies are wicked. I hate your new moones, and appointed feasts euen from my very hart, they make me weary, I cannot abide them.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>What meaneth this? vvhat doth God condemne, that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted, and expresly commaunded; especially seeing that they be the acts of the noblest vertue, which we call Religion: whose proper function and duty is to worship God with the seruice of adoration, and Religion? No certainly: but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the men, that contenting themselues with those exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ceremonies, had no regard nor care of true righteousnes, and the feare of the Lord, as forth-with he declareth, saying; <hi>Wash you, make you cleane, put away your euill thoughts out of my sight: cease from doing of euill, learne to doe well, apply your selues to equity, deliuer the oppressed, helpe the fatherles to his right, let the

widdowes complaine come before you: And then goe to, sayth the Lord, let vs talke together: though your sinnes be as red as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow: and though they were like purple, they shall be as white as wooll.</hi> In another place he repeateth the same thing, and that with greater vehemency: <hi>He that slayeth,</hi> sayth he,<note place="margin">Esay, 66.</note> 
                              <hi>an Oxe for me, doth me so great dishonour, as he that killeth a man: he that killeth a sheepe for me, knetcheth a dogge: hee that bringeth me meate offerings, offereth swines blood: who so maketh me a memoriall of incense, prayseth the thing that is vnright.</hi> O Lord, whence comes this? vvhy are they now abhominable and vild in thine eyes, which in times past thou didst ordaine and commaund? Presently after he addeth the reason saying; <hi>These haue they done according to their owne wayes, and their soule deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in these abhominations.</hi> Thou seest therefore, my brother, in what base account those outward works are with God without this inward foundation. Of these outward works he saith thus by another Prophet; <hi>Though yee offer me whole burnt offerings, and meate offerings,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Amos, 5.</note> 
                              <hi>I will not accept them, neyther will I regard the peace offering of your fat beasts. Take thou away from me the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thy songs, for I will not heare the melody of thy Vials.</hi> And in another place with greater vehemency;<note place="margin">Mal. 2.</note> 
                              <hi>And I will,</hi> sayth he, <hi>cast dung on your faces, euen the dung of your solemne feasts.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>What neede we moe words to vnderstand how little these externall works doe profit, although very excellent, if that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of righteousnes be wanting, which consisteth in the loue and feare of God, and in the hatred of sinne? But if any shall aske me, why GOD doth so greatly condemne this worship, comparing the sacrifices to murthers, and the incense to idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, calling the singing of Psalmes iangling, and their solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties dung? I aunswere, because besides that such works are not acceptable,<note place="margin">What euils doe arise from this false righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes.</note> wanting the foundation, of which we spake a little before; many also hence take an occasion to be proud, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume great matters of themselues, and to despise others, because they doe not like them: and that which is worser, at length they come into a false security, which ariseth from this counterfeit righteousnes: and this is the greatest danger, that meeteth with men in this life: for they being lulled a sleepe with this vaine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, doe not study, nor striue to compasse those things they

want, and which are of greater waight. I would not that thou shouldest credite me, reade that which the Gospell speaketh of the prayer of the Pharisey, who praying sayd; <hi>God I thanke thee, that I am not as other men are,</hi>

                              <hi>and doth not blesse their mother. There is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that thinke themselues cleane, and yet is not clensed from their filthines. There is a generation that hath a proud looke, and doth cast vp their eye lids. There is a generation whose teeth are as swords, and their iawes as kniues, to deuoure the poore from of the earth, and the needy from among men.</hi> Salomon here rehearseth these foure conditions of men, as the most peruerse and pernicious of all, that are in the world: and amongst them he also putteth in this hipocrisie, of which we now speake, that is, when as most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure men, as this Pharisey was, would be deemed pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The state of that man, that is entangled with this vice, is most dangerous. Certainly the euill is lesser, if a man be euill,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:9369:261"/>
and would not be accounted good, then if he be vniust, and would be esteemed iust. For be it that a man be wicked, yet the knowledge of himselfe will be the beginning of his saluation. But when his wickednes is not knowne, and he although sicke, would be accounted sound and in health, what remedy or what medicine shall be applied to him? Therfore our Sauionr sayth to the Phariseis; <hi>The Publicanes and harlots shall enter into the kingdome of heauen before you.</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Math. 21.</note> For <hi>Shall enter,</hi> the Greekes read, <hi>Doe enter</hi> in the present tense; and so that is more expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, which we would say. The same thing also those terrible &amp; fearefull words of the Lord in the Reuelation doe most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly testifie;<note place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> 
                              <hi>I would thou were hot or cold: but because thou art luke warme, &amp; ney<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ther cold not hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth.</hi> What meaneth this? Why doth God wish that man were cold, and sayth that luke warme is in worser estate, then cold, seeing that luke warme is nearer vnto hot? I will tell thee what is the reason of this.<note place="margin">who is hot, cold, and luke warme</note> He is hot, who by the fire of his charity, which he hath in himselfe, possesseth all vertues, as well internall as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall: as we haue sayd before. On the contrary part he is cold, who by reason of the absence &amp; want of charity, hath ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther internall nor externall vertues. He is luke warme, who hath some externall vertues, but not any internall, no not a spark of charity. Therfore the Lord signifieth here, that he that is luke warme is in much worser estate, then he that is cold: not because he is burthened with moe sinnes, but because he is more hardly deliuered from them. For he is so much the more far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of from remedy, by how much he thinketh himselfe more secure and freer from all euill: for from this superficiall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes (if I may so call it) which he hath, he taketh an occasion to beleeue that he is some body, when in truth he is no body. Wherfore the Lord expounding whom he had termed luke warme, addeth; <hi>Because thou sayest, I am rich, and encreased with goods, and haue neede of nothing: and knowest not how that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poore, and blind, and naked.</hi> Doe not these words liuely and in orient colours depaynt the image of the Pharisie, that sayd; <hi>God I thanke thee that I am not as other men are?</hi> Surely they do, for he thought in his hart that he was wealthy in spirituall riches; and therefore he gaue thanks to
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:9369:262"/>
God: but without doubt he was poore, blind, &amp; naked: for he did not know his owne faults.</p>
                           <p>Now therfore we haue declared that there are two kinds of righteousnes, one true, and the other false and counterfeit; and how noble the excellency of the true is; and how the false is exposed to many and great dangers. Let no man think that the labour and time, which we haue bestowed vppon this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, to haue been ill spent. For the holy Gospell, the purest doctrine of all the diuine Scriptures, and the most excellent, which as a glasse representeth the forme and rule of our life, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often reprehendeth thys false and counterfeit righteousnes, and so doe the Prophets, as before we haue shewed. Therefore it was not meete, that we should cursorily runne ouer it, which so often is beate vpon in the Scriptures: especially seeing that all men for the most part, doe shun manifest dangers; as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, doe Rocks that show themselues;<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> and here where there is such euidencie, lesse admonition will serue, but where the Rockes lie hid vnder the water, there is greater heede to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and therfore they are marked in the Maps and Sea-cards of Sailers, that they may not rush vpon them at vnawares. Let no man deceiue himselfe in thys, saying that then this doctrine was more copiously to be discoursed of, when this vice did raigne more spaciously and largely in the world: but now there is no need of it, because thys sinne is vnusuall, and vnfrequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For I thinke that the world hath continued alwaies in the same estate:<note place="margin">The world hath alwais been set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</note> for there are, and alwaies haue beene, men of the same nature, and of the same inclination, conceaued in the same originall sinne, which is the fountaine of all sinnes, and therfore alwaies produceth like effects.</p>
                           <p>And because there is so great likenes and similitude in the causes of euils, it followeth of necessary consequence, that the like should be in the effects. Therefore the same vices, which were then in the men of this and that condition, are now also, although perhaps the names be some-what changed: as the Comedies of Plautus &amp; Terence, are at thys day the very same Comedies,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> which they were a thousand yeres agoe, albeit, the persons, that then acted them, be changed. Therefore, as that rude and carnall people, did thinke that then they did especially
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:9369:262"/>
please GOD, when they did offer such sacrifices, and did fast after that manner, and did celebrate such feasts according to the letter, and not according to the spirit: so also now in our time, there are many Christians, which euery Sabaoth, and at all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions frequent the Church, who are called very good Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and doe run from sermon to sermon, and performe such like things, and that well. But in the meane-time theyr desires are so full of vaine-glory, they so gape after honors and riches; and are so desirous of reuenge, as any other that neuer obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth any such thing. They remember not what theyr professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on requireth, they haue no care of theyr neighbours good, they perseuere in hatred, and passions, they maintaine theyr honour with tooth and nayle, they will not humble themselues, to giue reuerence &amp; place vnto others, no not for the rule of the whole world.</p>
                           <p>Moreouer, there are others that disdaine to confer and enter talke with theyr neighbour, for euery small trifling cause: and there are others, that eyther doe not, or very vnwillingly and grudgingly doe satisfie their Creditors: much lesse pay the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges due vnto theyr painfull seruants and hirelings: and if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they be wronged in the least title of theyr honor, or riches, or such like things, good Lord, what hurly burleys doo they raise? Many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are most liberall in pouring forth long prayers, and very prodigall in discoursing Scripture matters, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes are exceeding miserable and very niggards in giuing almes, and helping theyr needy neighbours. Many of them hold vp theyr hands to heauen, and in the villany of theyr de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull hypocrisie, turne vp the white of theyr eyes in theyr prayers, as though they were rauished with the heauenlinesse of theyr meditations, when theyr harts are sette vppon mischiefe, being full of hatred, bitternes, and selfe-conceited singularitie. There are others that will not eate flesh in Lent, &amp; vpon dayes prohibited, not for any thing, no not for a thousand pound: neuerthelesse, they mutter, murmurre, and repine without any feare of GOD, and most cruelly cut the throates of theyr neighbours, by enhancing of rents, by taking vnmerciful fines, and by other extortions, so that they grinde theyr faces, &amp; make their lifes irkesome vnto them. So that there be some that count
<pb facs="tcp:9369:263"/>
it a religion, and make very holy of it to eate the flesh of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures permitted of God for the foode of man; but they make no bones of it to eate vp and deuoure the flesh of men, and to ridde them, like cruell Caniballs, out of theyr lifes; then the which thing I know not whether any thing is more strictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden of God. And yet the welfare of our neighbour, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of his fame and honour, are one of the especiall matters, of which we shall render an exact account vnto God, of which those men are not much carefull, which greatly account of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers things, which in the truth of the matter are much lesse.</p>
                           <p>There is not any body that can denie, but that these &amp; such like things, doe daily raigne among Clergie &amp; Laiety, among all sorts of people. Therefore, seeing that thys euill is so vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, it were needfull that wee should deliuer men from so great errors, by propounding vnto them sound instructions, and by prescribing wholsome admonitions; especially seeing that they whose duty and function it is, doe it not. But that the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reader may hence suck greater commodity, and that he may not swallow poyson in stead of a medicine, it is needfull before all things, that he know the pulse and vaine of his owne disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inclination, that he know of what spirit he is, that hee may learne what his minde is most chiefely bent and inclined to. For there are certaine generall doctrines, which are profitable for all in generall, &amp; for euery one in particuler; as are the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Charity, Humility, Patience, and such like. There are others more speciall, which doe so profit some, that they are not fit for all. For example: There is one very scrupulous, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is to be enlarged. On the otherside, there is another, whose conscience retcheth like Cheuerill, that hath a large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, his is to be restrayned and brideled: to those that are faynt-harted and doe despaire, the diuine mercy is to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: but to those, that be head-strong, stifenecked, secure &amp; presumptuous, the diuine iustice is to be denounced, and so we may say of the rest, according to the counsell of Ecclesiasticus, saying; <hi>With a man irreligious, talke of religion, with an vniust man of iustice:</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Ecclus, 37,</note> 
                              <hi>and with a woman of those shee is iealous of: with a fearefull man of warre, with an enuious man of thanks-giuing, with a wicked man of godlines, and with an vnhonest man of honesty, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="507" facs="tcp:9369:263"/>Seeing therfore that there are two kindes of men, certaine of which doe more apply themselues to inward vertues, neuer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the outward, nor much esteeming them: others so loue the outward, and are so studious of them, that they neglect the inward: therefore these are to be perswaded vnto them, and the other vnto others, that by this meanes their humors may be reduced to a due proportion. For which cause wee also haue so tempered our stile, that wee haue seated euery one in his due place: by extolling the greater without preiudice of the lesser, and by depressing the lesser, that they may not preiudice the greater: that by this meanes wee may be altogether secure and safe from those two most dangerous Rockes, being by great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry taught and warned, how we may eschew them: one of these is, so much to esteeme internall exercises, that we neglect externall: the other is, so to account of externall, that we omit the internall: especiall, the feare of the Lord, and hatred of sin. Therefore the summe of thys whole busines is, to haue deepe rooting in the feare of the Lord, so that we feare at the onely name of sinne. He that hath this firme and stedfast roote fixed in his soule, he may be called happy, and vpon this foundation he may builde what he will. But he that is easily induced to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For we must know, that seeing there are many vertues, which are required, that a man may liue christianly, some are giuen to this man, others to that, which direct a man to God, and bring him vnto him; the greater part of which pertaine to a contemplatiue life: by some a man is taught his duty to his neighbour, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:9369:264"/>
to an actiue life, and some there are, which respect a mans selfe,<note place="margin">Diuers meanes to obtaine grace.</note> which especially belong vnto a priuate life. Furthermore, seeing that all vertues are as certaine meanes, by which the grace of the holy Ghost is obtayned, some endeuour to obtayne it by this meanes, others by that. Some seeke for the dewe of grace, and a blessing to be poured vpon their soules by fasting, disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and austerenes of life; some by almes and the workes of mercy; others by prayers and continuall meditations: in which last meane there is as great variety, as there are prayers and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations. For this forme and manner of prayer and meditation liketh this man, and that another: and as there are many things to meditate on, so are there sundry kinds of meditations; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which that is the best, whatsoeuer it be, in which a man findeth greater deuotion, and more profit. But we must obserue here;<note place="margin">Euery one likes his owne way best.</note> that oftentimes it commeth to passe, that an errour mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with the louers of vertue; for there are some when they haue found some profit by this or that meane, and by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it haue somwhat profited in the way of the Lord, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they perswade themselues, that there is no other meanes to serue God, and please him, besides that, which they vse, and in which they are conuersant: they would haue all men to follow that, and they think that they that enter not into this way, and walke not in this path, shall not come vnto life.</p>
                        <p>They that deuote themselues wholy vnto Prayer think that prayer is the onely way to saluation: they that wholy apply themselues vnto fasting, thinke that all things besides fasting are in vaine: they that bestow themselues vpon the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue life, thinke that they that are not contemplatiue, are in very great danger: and they are so in loue with this their opinion, that they reiect the actiue life as altogether vnprofitable. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily they that giue themselues to an actiue life, because they neuer tried, what sweetnes passeth betweene God and the soule in holy contemplation &amp; meditation; and seeing the manifest and visible profit that redoundeth of an actiue life, they so exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the contemplatiue life, that scarce they allow of a pure contemplatiue, vnlesse it haue some of the actiue ioyned and mingled with it; but they so iudge of it, as if it were in euery ones power to be right excellent in that kind. In like manner they
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:9369:264"/>
that haue wholy deuoted &amp; consecrated themselues vnto pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they thinke that euery ones prayers besides theirs are vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and he that bestoweth his paynes vpon vocall &amp; lip pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, saith that it is more laborious then the other, and therefore of greater acceptance.</p>
                        <p>After this manner euery Merchant, as it is in the Prouerb, prayseth his owne wares: and so by a close and secret manner of pride, not knowing what he doth, prayseth himselfe: extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that, he himselfe doth, because in it he feeleth greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.

The Orator sayth that in the world there is not any thing more noble then eloquence. The Astrologer affirmeth, that Astrologie carieth the bell from all other Arts, because it is conuersant about the heauens and the starres. The same the Philosopher sayth of Philosophy. The Schoole Diuine not knowing to keepe a meane, condemneth all other sciences, and placeth his throne aboue them all. Neyther are likely reasons wanting to any of them, to proue their sciences and faculties to be better, more profitable, &amp; more necessary then other. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is openly and notoriously knowne in sciences, is found also in vertues; but somwhat more obscurely. For euery one that desireth vertue, in one respect coueteth to choose that which is the best, and in another respect which is more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his nature: and therfore he supposeth, that to be condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to all, which is conuenient for him; and that the shooes that fit his feete, are fit for all other.</p>
                        <p>Hence arise rash iudgements of other mens lifes; hence spring contentions, and spirituall schismes among brethren: for one embraceth what another condemneth, while all doe not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one way. In this errour liued the Corinthians, who when they had receaued of God many &amp; sundry gifts, euery one iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his owne more excellent then the rest: and therefore one would be preferred before another: for some said that the grace of tongues was nobler then the rest; others the gift of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; some s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="510" facs="tcp:9369:265"/>
of all other: others also defended the excellencie and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue of their owne gifts. Against this error and abuse, there is no remedy more profitable, or more effectuall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, which Saint Paule vseth, in his former Epistle sent vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: in which, first he reduceth all graces to their beginning, saying that all graces are riuers of one fountaine, that is, of the holy Ghost: and that therefore they all participate of one equality in theyr cause, although they be diuers and sundry among themselues. Euen as the members of one body of any King are all members of the King,<note place="margin">A simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</note> being deriued from one royall blood, although they be diuers among themselues: so sayth the Apostle; <hi>By one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we are baptized into one body:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1, Cor. 12.</note> 
                           <hi>that we may be members of one body.</hi> And therefore we all participate of one and the selfe same dignity and glory, seeing that we are all members of the same head. Wherefore the Apostleforth-with addeth; <hi>If the foote would say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of the body? And if the eare would say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?</hi> We all therfore are made equall, that among all there might be vnity and brother-hood, albeit there is some diuersity betweene vs. This ariseth partly of nature, &amp; partly of grace. We say partly of nature; for although grace is the beginning of all our spirituall Being;<note place="margin">A simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</note> yet grace, as water receaued into diuers vessels, doth put on diuers figures and shapes, according to the disposition and nature of euery one. For there are some men by nature mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, mild,<note place="margin">The vari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

Others are cholerick, and delighted in practise and action, and therfore more fit for an actiue life; others are strong and of a sound and healthfull constitution, who doe not much tender and affect themselues, and these are meete for greater austerity of life. In this the goodnes and mercy of God shineth after a singuler manner, who willing to deuide and communicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto all, he would not doe it onely after one manner, but after many and diuers, according to the variety of mans condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the man that is not fit for some one meane and gift, might be fit for another.</p>
                        <p>The other reason is, this diuersity is grace: for the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Authour of it, would that among his there should be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:9369:265"/>
to the greater perfection and beauty of the Church.<note place="margin">Variety by grace, and why God would haue variety of gifts in his Church.</note> For euen as diuers members &amp; diuers sences are required to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and beauty of the body: so also it is required for the perfection and beauty of the Church, that there should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers vertues and graces. For if all the faithfull were of one and the selfe same condition, how should they be called a body? <hi>If the whole body were an eye,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1, Corin, 12</note> sayth Paule, <hi>where were the hearing? if the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? But nowe hath God disposed the members, euery one of them in the body at his owne pleasure.</hi> But God would that there should be many members, and yet one body, that when there were a multitude conioyned in vnity, there might be a proportion and an harmonious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of many in one: and hence ariseth the perfection &amp; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church. Such a like thing we see in Musick, where it behoueth that there be diuersity and multitude of voces vvith vnity and agreeablenes of consent in tune:<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</note> so that there may be sweetnes and melody in it. If all the voyces were of one qualitie and stampe, they should all be either Baces or Meanes, which would make neither musicke nor harmony.</p>
                        <p>In naturall things also it is admirable to see so great diuersitie of things, as that high and almighty Work-maister hath made, who hath deuided and bestowed beauty and perfection vppon all creatures in that order, that although euery one of them haue somewhat in themselues in which they excell the rest, yet there is no enuy amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: because euery one of them hath some prerogatiue,<note place="margin">There is a certaine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie in y<hi rend="sup">c</hi> creatures.</note> which in others is not the same. The Peacocke is very beautifull to the sight, but maketh a ranke and an vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant noyse. The Nightingale singeth sweetly; but is not so faire to the sight. An Horse is good for the race, and profitable for warre; but not good for foode, or fit for the table. The Oxe is profitable for the table and the plough, but vnprofitable for other things. Fruitefull trees doe serue for the nourishment of men, but are vnfit for building: contrarily, wilde and barren trees are fit for building, but vnapt to serue for foode. Therfore amongst all things, there is both a certaine vnity and a diuision, neither in one thing are all things found, that by this meanes the variety and beauty of the Vniuerse, and the forme and shapes of things might be preserued; that one may loue and embrace

another, for that neede which one standeth of another.</p>
                        <p>The same beauty and order, which GOD hath ordained and appointed in the works of nature, he would that it should be also in the works of grace: and therefore hee hath disposed by his Spirit, that there should be a thousand kind of vertues &amp; graces in Church, that of all them there might arise one most sweet harmony, one perfect world, and one beautifull bodie, compounded of diuers and sundry members. Hence it is that in the Church some are giuen to a contemplatiue life, some to an actiue: one is famous and excellent in the works of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, another in prayer. Some in singing, others in studying do exercise theyr gifts, that they may help &amp; further others: some attend vpon the weake, &amp; receaue strangers, who deuide theyr goods to the poore, and many other such kinde of vertuous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises there be. Therefore there be many members in one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and many voyces in one musick, that by this meanes there may be comlines, consonancie, and proportion in the Church: and therefore in one Harpe there are many strings, and in one Organ many pipes: that by this meanes there may be a conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie and an harmony of many tunes. This is that garment which the Patriarke Iacob commaunded to be made for hys sonne Ioseph,<note place="margin">Gene, 37,</note> of diuers colours. These are those Curtaines, which by the commaundement of God were made for the vse of the Tabernacle of wonderfull varietie and beautie. That the same should be done, both the order and beauty of the Church required. Therefore why should one eate vp another? Why should one iudge and condemne another, saying: Why is it not lawfull for one to doe that another doth? I know not what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing this is, then to goe about to destroy the body of the Church, and to teare in peeces Iosephs beauteous garment, and to disturbe this heauenly musick and harmony: that is, to make all the members of the Church, feete, or hands, or eyes, &amp;c. which certainly were monstrous beyond measure.</p>

                           <note place="margin">It is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill thing to enuie our neighbour. A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> By this it manifestly appeareth, how great wickednes it is to speak ill of, or enuie our neighbor: because he hath, that I haue not, or because he is not apt for that function I am. Surely the body should be in ill case, if the eyes should contemne the feete because they see not: and the feete should murmure against the
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:9369:266"/>
eyes, because they walke not, and should oppose themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the whole body, because the burden of the body is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vpon them. It is altogether necessary, that the feete should be weary with going, but that the eyes should rest; that the feete should be polluted with durt and mire, but that the eyes should be kept cleane and pure from all dust and moates: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe the eyes lesse in being at rest, then the feete in walking: neither doth the Pilot lesse sitting, and holding the sterne in his hand,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> neither is lesse necessary for the shyppe, then all the other Marriners, which eyther climbe the mast, or hoyse vp the sailes, or labour at the pumpe: yea albeit hee seemeth to doe the least of all, yet he dooth the most of all; for the excellency of a thing is not to be esteemed by labours, but by the profit and necessity: vnlesse we will say that an husband-man, who diggeth and tyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the ground, is of better esteeme in a Common-wealth, then a vvise-man, that gouerneth the Common-wealth by his aduice and wisedome. He therfore that well considereth these things, will leaue his vocation and calling to euery man: that is, that a foote may continue a foote, and a hand a hand: neyther vvill the foote desire that all the members might be feete; neither the hand, that all should be hands. This is that, which in that most large disputation the Apostle would teach in the Epistle cited a little before; the same thing he also admonisheth whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saith; <hi>Let not him that eateth,</hi>

                           <hi>despise him that eateth not, and let not him that eateth not, iudge him that eateth.</hi> For he that eateth, perhaps hath neede to eate: yet he may be indued with more excellent vertues, then he that fasteth. For euen as in song, the notes in the space are are valuable,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</note> as those in the line: so in the harmony of the spirituall musick of the Church, he is no lesse valuable that eateth, then he that eateth not: and he that is at quiet and rest, no lesse acceptable then he that is occupied, or he that in his ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure laboureth to edifie his neighbour. The same thing vvith great vehemencie S. Bernard teacheth, commaunding that no man should curiously looke into or search their lifes, who are placed in offices to censure and try others, or doe execute func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Iudges and Rulers: neyther that any man should iudge of another mans life, or compare his life with anothers.</p>

Thys is a continuall care and a watch, and perpetuall examining of those things,<note place="margin">Continuall care, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</note> which are to be done or spoken, that all things may be directed by the guydance of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. That as an Embassadour being to speak in the assembly of an honourable Senate, at one and the selfe-same time standeth carefully thinking of the matters he is to speake of:<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> and of the words by which he is to vtter them; and of the order vvhich he is to obserue in speaking, and also of the gesture of his body, &amp; of other things necessary for this action: so the seruant of God, ought diligently, carefully, &amp; circumspectly to watch ouer him selfe, and ouer all his actions in speaking, in silence, in demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in aunswering, in trafficking, in sitting at table, in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, in the Church, in the house, and without the house, as hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a compasse in his hand, measuring and moderating all his actions, works and thoughts: that he may proceed in all things according to the prescript of the diuine law, according to the rule of reason, and the decencie of his person. For albeit there is very great difference betweene good and euill, yet God hath infused and imprinted a certaine light and knowledge of either in our soules: so that a man can scarcely be found, albeit hee be rude and simple, who if he diligently attend that he dooth, but he may vnderstand, what he ought to doe in euery thing. And this care and consideration is profitable to all the documents &amp; instructions of this rule, and of many other. This care is that, which is commended of the holy Ghost, when he saith; <hi>Keepe therefore your soules carefully and diligently.</hi> And this is that third
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:9369:267"/>
part of righteousnes and iustice,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note> which the Prophet Micheas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuateth, saying; <hi>Walke humbly, carefully, and circumspectly with thy God.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Mich. 6.</note> This is nothing else, then a perpetuall care and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall thought, that thou doe not any thing, which is contrary to the Diuine will. This is that, which that multitude of eyes in those misticall creatures of Ezechiell doe signifie, which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth vnto vs the greatnes of attention and circumspection, which a Christian Souldier ought to haue against so many and so terrible enemies, with which he is to fight. The same thing <hi>those threescore strong and valiant men of Israell</hi> doe signifie, <hi>who compasse the bed of Salomon,</hi>

                           <hi>who al handle the sword, and are expert in warre.</hi> For in this the same care and vigilancy is signified, in which an armed man ought to be, who is compassed &amp; cirkled about with the troups of so many enemies, &amp; endangered with hands of so great cruelty. The cause of this care, besides many other dangers, is the greatnes and waight of this busines, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall in them that aspire to the perfection of a spirituall life. For to liue and conuerse worthily with God, is to keepe himselfe cleane and pure from all the spots of this world; to liue in this flesh without any signe of carnall worke or affection; and to walke without offence vntill the day of the Lord, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sayth. These things are so hard and so supernaturall, that all things are required heere,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.</note> yea, God himselfe, with his grace and helpe. Behold the care and circumspection, which a man hath, when he doth any special peece of work: but much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the worke of saluation. Therefore what care is here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Consider with what great care a man beareth any vessell brim full of precious liquor or oyle,<note place="margin">A simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</note> least it should be spilld: Consider with what great care a man goeth ouer any narrow peece of timber, or some old and ruinous bridge, vnder which a very deepe and a swift riuer runneth, least he should fall into it, and be deuoured of the water: To be briefe, consider what great warines they vse that goe vpon ropes, least they declining to this hand or that fall downe.<note place="margin">In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we must walke wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly.</note> With the same care and wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thou oughtest to walke, especially in the beginning of thy conuersion, that a good habit may be formed and framed in thee, with a thought and an intent so exact, that thou speake not a word, nor thinke any thing, as much as is possible, which any
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:9369:268"/>
whit strayeth from the path of vertue.<note place="margin">Certaine counsailes. Seneca.</note> For this Seneca giueth vs excellent counsaile, and that which is familier, saying: let a man that is vertuous, or that would liue vprightly, imagine, that he doth alwayes stand and walke in the presence of some man of great authority and account: and who is worthy to be reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced of all men: this imagination being presupposed, let him speake and doe all things none otherwise, then he would doe and speake, if he stood in his presence. Besides this aduice, there is another, no lesse conuenient nor lesse profitable then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: let a man thinke that this is the last day of his life, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that all things are to be done, no otherwise, then if that day or that night following he were to stand before the Diuine tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall, to render an account of his life. There is yet another counsaile much more excellent: Alwayes so to be conuersant (as much as is possible) in the sight of the Lord, and to haue him before his eyes, as if he were present visibly and corporally, as in truth he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>uisibly present in all places: and therfore to doe all things no otherwise then he that hath God his witnes and his Iudge seeing all things: &amp; let him alwayes desire of God grace so to be conuersant, that he may not be vnworthy the sight and presence of so great a Maiesty. So that this care &amp; watch, which we now speake of hath two proposed scopes; one, to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God with our harts, to haue them lifted vp vnto him, that we may stand before him with great reuerence, by worshipping him, by praysing, by reuerencing, by louing him, by yeelding thanks vnto him, and without intermission by offering vnto him the sacrifices of deuotion, vpon the alters of our harts. The other scope is a diligent obseruation of all our actions; that we doe and speake all things with that warines, that we doe not stray in the least from the tract and path of vertue. So that with one eye we alwayes behold God, by requesting grace of him; and with the other looking to that, which is conducent for our life, that it may be well ordered: and after this manner we shall very well bestow that light, which God hath giuen vnto vs, as well in Diuine things, as in humane. Therefore we shall stand partly attending on God, and partly on that thing which we are to doe. The which thing although it cannot alwayes be done, yet let vs doe this, that at the least we may then proceede after
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:9369:268"/>
this manner, when our intent is not hindered by corporall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises, yea, our hart is free, and may steale somwhat from exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour businesses, and hide it selfe in the wounds of Christ. I thought it very conuenient to handle this instruction here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is very profitable.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE precedent admonition hath opened our eyes, that we are now able to see, what we are to doe: but this will reach vs an arme; that is, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and courage, that we may be strengthned and enabled to doe that, which the eyes behold. For seeing that in Vertue there be two difficulties;<note place="margin">Two diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in vertue.</note> one that we may well distinguish good from euill, and seperate this from that; the other that wee may conquer the one, and proceede in the other: in that we haue neede of wisedome and vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in this of fortitude and diligence: so that eyther of these fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the busines of Vertue remayneth vnperfect. For there will be blindnes, if vigilancy and fore-sight be wanting: and if fortitude and courage faile, man being lame and feeble shall not be able to worke. This fortitude which we here speake of, is not that, which as a meane tempereth and moderateth auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousnes and feare, (for that is one among the foure cardinall vertues) but it is a certaine generall force and power, profitable to ouercome all difficulties, which hinder the vse of Vertue: and therfore it alwayes walketh in the company and fellowship of the vertues, hauing as it were a sword in her hand, that she may open &amp; prepare the way for them, which way so euer they goe. For Vertue (as the Philosophers say) is a thing hard and difficult; and therfore it is needfull, that this fortitude alwayes march in the vauntgard of the vertues, that she may lay to her helping hand to ouercome and conquer this difficulty.<note place="margin">A simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude.</note> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a stone-cutter ought alwayes to haue his mallet in his hand, by reason of the hard matter which he laboureth in; so a spirituall man of necessity ought alwayes to haue in a readines
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:9369:269"/>
this fortitude, as a spirituall mallet, to tame and ouercome this difficulty, which meeteth with vs in the way of vertue. And as the stone-cutter shall doe nothing to any purpose, vnlesse he hath his mallet: so also the louer of Vertue without this forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude shall sweat in vaine.<note place="margin">Vertue is hard and difficult.</note> Tell me what instance of any vertue canst thou giue, which hath not some particuler difficulty ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto it? Consider of them seuerally, if it please thee. Looke into Prayer, fasting, obedience, temperance, poorenes of spirit, patience, chastity, and humility. These and all other are alwaies ioyned with some difficulty, which comes eyther through our owne selfe-loue, or the malice of the deuill, or the crosnes and repugnacy of the world. Wherfore if thou takest away this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, what can naked and vnarmed Vertue doe? and therfore all other vertues doe seeme as it were bound hand and foote, neyther can they performe any thing. Wherfore, my brother, if thou desirest to warre in the tents of Vertue, &amp; to bring forth fruite in them, imagine that the Captaine and Emperor of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue doth say vnto thee, as he sayd in times past vnto Moses, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in another sence: <hi>Take this rod in thine hand, where-with thou shalt doe miracles,</hi>

                           <hi>and bring my people out of Egipt.</hi> Trust, doubt not, as that rod was the worker of these miracles which effected so blessed and ioyfull a worke; so also it is the rod of fortitude, which will conquer &amp; ouercome all difficulties, which may be procured and obiected eyther of selfe-loue, or of any other enemies, and it will strengthen and enable thee to bring the wished victory from this warre. Therefore see that thou haue it alwayes in thine hand, for thou canst doe no admirable thing without it.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The errour of them which forth-with in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion doe seeke for peace.</note> In this place in my iudgement they, that are newly inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into Gods Church, are to be admonished of a notable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which oftentimes happen vnto them. Who perchaunce reading in some spirituall booke of the greatnes of the sweetnes and consolations of the holy Ghost, and how great the pleasant allurements and enticements of charity be, forth-with they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that this whole way is plaine, full of deliciousnes, and that no labour nor trouble is to be found in it: wherefore they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themselues to walk in this way, as to an easie and delectable matter, neyther doe they arme themselues as those, who goe to
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:9369:269"/>
warre, but they put on a soft and a delicate robe, as if they were to goe to a mariage or a banquet. They doe not consider, that although the loue of God is sweet and pleasant in it selfe and of it owne nature, yet that the way vnto it is straight and bitter. For it is needfull aboue all things to conquer and ouercome selfe-loue, and to striue alwayes against thy selfe: which fight is greater then any other. Both of them that Euangelicall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet insinuateth,<note place="margin">Esay, 58,</note> when he sayth; <hi>O Ierusalem shake off the dust, arise, and sit downe.</hi> It is certaine that in sitting there is neyther labour nor difficulty: but it is labour to shake off the dust of earthly and carnall affections, and to arise from the sinne, in which we sleepe: which is necessary to doe, before we come to that sitting and rest, It is true, that God bestoweth many and wonderfull comforts vpon them, that faithfully labour; and in like manner vpon them, who now desire to change the delights ofthe world for the pleasures of heauen: yet if this change be not made, and if a man will not leaue the pray he hath taken; beleeue me, this refreshing and comfort shall not be giuen him: as neither Manna was giuen to the children of Israell in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, before the dowe was spent, which they brought vvith them out of Egypt.</p>

                           <p>Consider,<note place="margin">The sundry &amp; manifold tryals and torments of Martyrs.</note> howe one of them was rosted; another had his skinne pulld ouer his eares, the third, drowned in the water, the fourth, cast head-long from a steepe Rocke: a fift layde on a peece of vvood with a sharpe ridge, his flesh being scraped and rent of with a ragged tormenting Curry-combe, and his bowels beeing slitte out, yeelded vp the ghost: a sixth hath so many Darts sticking in him, that he is liker an Hedg-hog then a man: the seauenth is fryed in a frying pan, or boyled in scalding lead: others tormented with other extreame tortures. Consider how many of them haue beene tormented, not with one kinde of punishment, but with all kinde of torments, which humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath beene capable of, and so haue passed to death. For some haue been taken from the filthines &amp; vncleannesse of the pryson to be whipped and scourged; from whipping &amp; scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to be singed with burning coales; from burning coales to the bastinado; from the bastinado to yron combes; then to the sworde, which alone had beene sufficient to take away the life of the Martyrs; but not to make them shipwracke theyr fayth or constancie.</p>
                           <p>But what shall I speake of the arts, and inuentions, vvhich that ingenious and witty cruelty (I say not of men but of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils) hath deuised, to ouer-throw and confound with corporall tortures, fayth, courage, &amp; fortitude? Some of them, after they were most cruelly martyred, and theyr flesh all to be-torne and rent, were cast vpon a floare all sette with goades and prickes; that theyr bodies all at once might be goared and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> with a thousand woundes: and that they might feele a generall greefe throughout all theyr members, that theyr intollerable payne, might striue for victory with their faith.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="522" facs="tcp:9369:271"/>Others beeing condemned, were commaunded to walke vpon hote burning coales with their naked feete. Others bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tyed to the tayles of horses, were drawne ouer thornes and bryers, and rough places. Others were condemned to wheeles stucke all round about with sharpe kniues, that theyr bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put vppon them, whilst they turned about might be cutte small peeces. Others were stretched vpon Racks, and their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes beeing harrowed and furrowed from top to toe with yron crookes and peircers, did openly show their naked bowels, the flesh being puld of, and their ribs lying bare.</p>
                           <p>What shall I say more? seeing that the barbarous and more then beastly cruelty of Tyrants, not being contented with these torments,<note place="margin">By this kinde of death reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ended her lyfe.</note> hath found out a certaine new kind of cruelty. With certaine instruments they so brought together two high sturdie trees, that their tops touched one the other; to one of these tops they bound the right foote of the Martyr, to the other the left. Then losing the Trees to their old scope, they carried the body with them, and violently tare it in peeces, and each tree carryed with it his part into the ayre. In Nicomedia, among other innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Martyrs, one was beaten so long, till his white ribbs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared through his bloody wounds,<note place="margin">An horrible kind of mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/> tyrdome.</note> for the scourges and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings had peece-meale puld away the flesh; then they washed his whole body with most strong vinegar, &amp; after vinegar stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed all his wounds ful of salt. The Tyrants not yet satisfied with these dire discruciatements, and extreame tortures, when they saw that the Martyr yet breathed, they cast his halfe dead body vpon a gridyron, vnder which they made a fierce scorching fire, haling the gridyron this way and that with their yron hookes, vntil the body being fully rosted, the sanctified &amp; pure-purged soule, passed to the Lord. And thus those most barbarous &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane butcherly murtherers, inuented tortures more cruel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death, which notwithstanding was wont to be termed the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest of all dreadful things. For they sought not so much to kill, as to slay with vnheard of torments, without any deadly wound, by a lingering death, and with intollerable greatnesse of dolours and sorrowes.</p>
                           <p>Surely these Martyrs had not bodies vnlike to ours, or which were of another substance: their flesh was as our flesh; and
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:9369:271"/>
theyr complexion was the same with ours: neyther had they another God for theyr helper, besides our God: neyther did looke for another glory, then that wee looke for. Proceede therefore, if they haue obtayned eternall life by so violent death, why should we feare for the same cause at the least to mortifie the euill concupiscences of our flesh? If they died through hunger, wilt not thou fast one day? If they with their mangled bodies perseuered in prayer, why wilt not thou being sound and in health with bended knees continue a little in prayer? If they were so patient, that without resisting or contradiction they suffered their members to be maymed and detruncate, and theyr flesh to be torne in peeces, why wilt not thou abide that thine appetites and thine vnruly affections should be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised and mortified? If they many yeares and many moneths sat imprisoned in darke dungeons, why wilt not thou a little be contayned and shut vp in thy chamber? If they haue not refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to haue their shoulders furrowed and mangled with whips and scourges, why wilt not thou chastice thine?</p>
                           <p>If these examples doe not suffice thee, lift vp thine eyes to the Crosse of Christ, and behold who is he, that hanging vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it suffered so great and so cruell things for the loue of thee. The Apostle sayth: <hi>Consider him that endured such speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst of sinners,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> 
                              <hi>least yee should be wearied and faint in your minds.</hi> This is a fearefull and a dreadfull example, what way so euer thou shalt consider of it. For if thou lookest vppon the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there can be no greater. If thou respectest the person, who suffereth, a more excellent cannot be giuen. If thou exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minest the cause for which he suffereth, not for his owne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, for he is innocency it selfe; neyther suffereth he of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, for he is the Creatour and Lord of all creatures: but of his mere goodnes, and free loue. Yet for all this he suffered so great torments, not only in his body, but also in his soule, that the torments of all Martyrs, &amp; of all men that euer haue been in the world, are not to be compared with these. This was such a spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, that the heauens were astonished; the earth trembled, rocks claue in sunder, and all the insencible creatures felt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity of the thing. How therefore commeth it to passe, that man should be so insencible &amp; blockish, that he should not feele
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:9369:272"/>
that, which the brute elements haue felt? with what face can he be so ingratefull, that he should not study somewhat to imitate him, who hath done and suffered so great things, that he might leaue vs an example?<note place="margin">Luke. 24.</note> 
                              <hi>For euen so,</hi> as the Lord himselfe affirmeth, <hi>Christ ought to haue suffered, and so to enter into his glory.</hi> For seeing that he came into the world, that he might teach that heauen is not to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passed by any other way then by the Crosse, it was necessary that the Lord himselfe should first be crucified, that a courage might be put into his Souldiers, seeing their Captaine to be so cruelly and inhumanely handled and intreated. Who then will be so ingratefull, wicked, proud, and impudent, who seeing the Lord of Maiesty, with all his friends and chosen ones to walke such difficult wayes, and yet he himselfe will be caried in an Horse-litter, and on a bed of Downe, &amp; led his life in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciousnes? King Dauid commaunded Vrias, whom he had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from warre, to goe into his owne house, to sup &amp; sleepe with his wife:<note place="margin">2, Kings. 11.</note> but the good seruant answered; <hi>The Arke, and Israell and Iuda dwell in tents: and my Lord Ioab and the seruants of my Lord abide in the open fields: shall I then goe into mine house to eate and drink, and lye with my wife? by thy life, &amp; by the life of thy soule, I will not doe this thing.</hi> O good and faithfull seruant; who by so much is worthier of prayse, by how much he is vnworthier of death. And thou ô Christian, seeing thy Lord lying vpon an hard Crosse, hast thou no respect of him, neyther doost thou yeeld honour, &amp; reuerence vnto him? The Arke of God made of incorruptible Ceder wood suffereth griefes and dolours, and vndergoeth most bitter death, and doost thou seeke for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and delicacies? The Arke in which Manna was put (that is the foode of Angels) for the loue of thee tasted gall and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and doost thou long and hunt after sweet and delicious meates? The Arke in which the two tables of the law were (that is all the treasures of the wisedome and knowledge of God) is mocked, and derided as foolish, and wilt thou be smoothed and praysed, and doost thou gape after honors &amp; preferments?</p>
                           <p>But if the example of this misticall Arke be not sufficient to confound thee, let the afflictions of the seruants of God, which abide &amp; remaine vpon the face of the earth be ioyned vnto it: that is, the examples, &amp; passions of all the Saints, Prophets, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:9369:272"/>
Confessors, &amp; Virgins, who with so many and so great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations haue sayled ouer the huge and turbulent Sea of this world.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> Wherupon one of them saith; <hi>The Saints haue been tried by mockings &amp; scurgings, yea, moreouer by bonds &amp; prisoment. They were stoned, they were hewen asunder, they were tempted, they were slaine with the sword, they wandered vp and down in sheeps skins, and in goates skins being destitute, afflicted, and tormented: who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world was not worthy of: they wandered in wildernesses, &amp; mountaines, and dens, and caues of the earth. And these all through faith obtained good report:</hi> And among so many tribulations were found faithfull vnto God.</p>
                           <p>If therfore the life of the Saints was such yea, if the life of the Holy of Holies was such, surely I know not by what title, priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or immunity some doe think, to enter by the pleasures &amp; delights of this world into that place, where these doe now ioy, and for euer shal reioyce. Wherfore, my brother, if thou desirest to raigne with them, learne to imitate them, learne to beare and suffer the troubles and discommodities of this life.</p>
                           <p>This exhortation wil be profitable vnto thee, to kindle &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame thee with the loue of this vertue &amp; fortitude, &amp; that thou seeke for it &amp; after it so long, vntill at the length thou commest to the perfection of that soule, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is read, that <hi>she girded her loines with strength,</hi>
