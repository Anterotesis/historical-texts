            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough divers of the learned have declared the Baptiſme of Infants to be but a humane tradition; as <hi>P. B.</hi> confeſſeth in his Epiſtle, page <hi>3.</hi> yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, there be many that have, and doe take upon them, to countenance the ſame by the Word of God, wherein they commit a double offence; one in ſeducing the people, and leading them to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience againſt Chriſt, <hi>Mat. 28.19. Mar 16.15, 16.</hi> whom they are to heare in all things, <hi>Acts 3.</hi> The other in taking the Word of Chriſt, and putting it as a ſword into the hands of men to defend and maintaine themſelves in ſuch their diſobedience againſt him; amongst whom, one <hi>P. B.</hi> hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken part in publiſhing a booke to proove the Baptiſme of Infants to be agreeable to the word of God, but (as many times it falleth out when
<pb facs="tcp:48218:3"/>
men undertake to defend an evill cauſe) he hath ſo bewrayed the error of that doctrine, that in the judgement of any, who are but indifferently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Scriptures, there needs no more be ſaid to diſcover the falſity thereof, and ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his owne practice in the ſame things wherein unadviſedly hee accuſeth others.

But <hi>pag. 2.3.</hi> he confeſſeth that he knoweth not where any ſuch Church hath continued, nor doth hee believe that any can be found that can make ſuch a continuance of the Church to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare: therefore hee received not his Baptiſme
<pb facs="tcp:48218:3"/>
from any ſuch Church, nor is it then by his owne argument, the baptiſme of Chriſt, but a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, or Idoll come out of the bottomeleſſe pit, as hee himſelfe ſpeaketh, <hi>page 6.</hi> Having thus deſtroyed his foundation, and impeached his owne baptiſme, and the baptiſme of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> derived from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> a falſe ſtate the mother of fornications, &amp;c. as he affirmeth in the <hi>3. page</hi> of his Epiſtle to the Reader, his whole building muſt needs fall to the ground, which thing being conſidered, I know it may be thought, that an Anſwer to ſuch a Diſcourſe ſhould be altogether unneceſſary; for hee that impeacheth himſelfe, needs no other to accuſe him; yet nevertheleſſe, hearing that ſome not well acquainted with the ſtate of this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie have by his miſ-applying the Scriptures in the handling of the ſame, been prejudiced againſt the truth, by him evill ſpoken of; for their ſakes therefore is this briefe Anſwer made, wherein not regarding to follow him to and fro, in all his vaine wandering and tautologies (wherewith his booke is ſtored) I have reduced his whole Diſcourſe into ſuch particular heads, as doe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concern the perpetuity of the viſible <hi>Church,</hi> the baptiſme of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme

of Infants, &amp;c. which hee undertaketh to prove; for Anſwer, I have made uſe of little, ſave onely what I have found in his owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, wherein indeed, is ſufficient to diſcover the vanity of his opinion in theſe particulars, and to ſatisfie any that thereby have taken offence againg the truth; but all that is ſaid, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to thee (courteous <hi>Reader)</hi> in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Anſwer, and therefore I ſhall referre thee thereunto, and alſo unto the grace and guidance of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Redeemer, in whoſe ſervice I am alwayes thine,</p>

            <head>A BREIFE ANSVVER To a <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> lately written by one <hi>P. B.</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt, he ſaith, that the viſible Church of Chriſt hath had a perpetuall continuance in the world from the firſt plantation thereof by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and ſhall ſo continue unto the end of the world; this he ſaith was propheſied, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 9.7.59.21. witneſſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.33. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.29. and confirmed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18.28.20. and theſe Scriptures are ſtable and true, and ſo to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by all the Saints, <hi>page</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That theſe Scriptures, and all other, being delivered by the ſpirit of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. are ſtable and true, and ſo to be accounted of all the world, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22.23. and yet are not therefore the ſeverall gloſſes and underſtandings of men given upon theſe or other Scriptures alwayes ſtable and true, nor ſo to be accounted of any man. Before wee give credit therefore to his conſtruction of theſe Scriptures; wee will a little examine how he makes the truth thereof to appeare: he ſaith, that the perpetuity of the viſible Church was propheſied, <hi>Eſay</hi> 9.7.59.21. <hi>And the Word is yea and Amen, &amp;c.</hi> whereupon then it muſt needs follow, that if the viſible Church of Chriſt hath not had a perpetuall uninterrupted ſucceſſion in the world ever ſince the firſt plantation thereof, untill theſe dayes, though this propheſie in it ſelfe be true, yet his underſtanding and interpretation thereof muſt needs be falſe. This rule the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath given us, thereby to diſtinguiſh the true Prophet from the falſe, <hi>Deutron.</hi> 18.22. hee ſaith, when a Prophet ſpeaketh in the name of the Lord, and if the thing follow not, nor come to paſſe, that is, not the thing which the Lord hath ſpoken, but the Prophet hath ſpoken it preſumptuouſly. Now, as hereby wee are taught to diſtinguiſh the true Prophets from the falſe, ſo likewiſe are wee by the ſame rule taught, to know the true interpretation of every
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48218:5"/>
propheſie from the falſe, and therefore when any interpretation of any propheſie is given, and accordingly the thing follow not nor come to paſſe that is, not the thing which the Lord hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in that propheſie, but it's a falſe interpretation, and he is a falſe Prophet that hath given the ſame, of whom wee are taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.15. from which imputation, we ſhall now ſee how well he acquitteth himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he telleth us, that the defection and falling away under <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> was very generall and marvellous univerſall; and this he proveth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8, 16. (to which alſo he might have added the 3.4. and 7. verſes) and unleſſe the defection under <hi>Antichriſt</hi> had beene thus univerſall, he ſaith the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who appeared in the dawne of the day, could not truly have beene called the firſt fruits unto God, as he conceiveth they were, <hi>pag.</hi> 2. We ſay ſo too, and alſo firme that the viſible Church could not continue under that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, becauſe it's ſaid, it was given to him to make warre with the Saints, and to overcome them, and if to overcome them, they could not continue, for if they had not continued, then he did not overcome them and kill them with the ſword, as it is ſaid hee did, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.7.10. compared with <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.21.25. Moreover, it is ſaid, that thoſe which worſhipped the Beaſt, were ſuch, whoſe names were not written in the Lambs booke of life; therefore the viſible Church could not continue under that defection. But if it did not there continue, yet haply it might continue under the <hi>Greekes?</hi> To this he anſwereth, that indeed the <hi>Greekes</hi> did not alwayes ſubject themſelves to the <hi>Romane</hi> power, yet were they very little ſhort in defection, in ſo much, that according to the meaſure whereby the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are meaſured, they will ſtand and fall together; well but I demand (although the Church did not continue under the defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> nor yet under the <hi>Greekes</hi>) whether he doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that ſome man may be found able (though hee cannot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) to make it appeare that the the viſible <hi>Church</hi> hath continued elſewhere in the world? Vnto this he anſwereth, that he believeth none can be found able to make any ſuch continuance of the <hi>Church</hi> to appeare, <hi>page</hi> 3. if any could, he would thanke God for ſuch a diſcovery. And who then can believe his expoſition of <hi>Eſay</hi> 9.7.59.21. &amp;c. ſeeing that his owne mouth teſtifieth that no man can be found able to make the truth thereof to appeare; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs follow, that he hath given a falſe interpretation of the Scriptures by him alledged to prove the perpetuity of the viſible <hi>Church</hi>; neither will he himſelfe, nor any other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be able to cleare him from the imputation of a falſe Prophet, and one that hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48218:5"/>
preſumptuouſly in the name of the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.22. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having thus confuted himſelfe in this point, I thinke it a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thing for mee to ſpend any more time in the confutation of it. But ſeeing hee confeſſeth that none can be found able to make any ſuch continuance of a viſible <hi>Church</hi> (as he ſpeaketh of) to appeare, why are we by him blamed for not believing ſuch a continuance, <hi>page</hi> 4. and why are we ſo often charged for not believing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance thereof under the defection of <hi>Antichriſt, pag.</hi> 3.4.5. and 9. And why alſo are we accuſed for making Chriſt a widower, in not believing a perpetuall ſucceſſion of the viſible <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he himſelfe believeth no man can prove the perpetuall ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof? What, would he have us believe that which he cannot believe himſelfe? Herein hee is much more uncharitable then the <hi>Pope</hi>; who requireth none to believe what hee and his <hi>Church</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be a widower, except he hath alwayes a viſible Church in the world, then there is no ſalvation out of the viſible <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe none can be ſaved which are not firſt united to, and made one with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (and then what ſhall become of thoſe believers which in all ages have appeared, ſuch as <hi>Ierome</hi> of <hi>Prague, Iohn Hus, &amp;c.</hi> who loſt their lives for the teſtimonie of Jeſus, and were never members of any true viſible <hi>Church</hi>: I hope <hi>P. B.</hi> will not ſay that they periſhed in their ſins) and if they were ſaved, then were they eſpouſed unto and united to <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and if ſo, then <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath, and ſo may have a Spouſe, although no viſible <hi>Church,</hi> but <hi>P.B.</hi> I conceive, was ſo ſtudious when he wrote his booke, to bring ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities upon us, that he altogether forgot himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, ſeeing hee cannot believe that any can be found able to make the continuance of the viſible <hi>Church</hi> to appeare, and that as hee ſaith, The adminiſtration of Baptiſme doth ſo depend thereupon, that by no meanes poſſible it can be had elſewhere, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſpeciall commiſſion given from heaven for that purpoſe, ſuch as <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt had, <hi>page</hi> 4. &amp; 6. I demand where, or of whom <hi>P. B.</hi> received his Baptiſme: from the viſible <hi>Church</hi> he received it not, for he knoweth not where any ſuch <hi>Church</hi> is, neither doth hee believe that any man can make any ſuch <hi>Church</hi> to appeare to have continued in the world, if any could, he would bleſſe God for ſuch a diſcovery, <hi>page</hi> 3. &amp; 4. Belike then hee received it from one that had a ſpeciall commiſſion like to that of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſts, at leaſt by his diſcourſe he would have us to thinke ſo, but I know it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that it was but a Bull.</p>
            <p>But being unwilling to receive this confutation from himſelfe, or having begun a Diſcourſe, ſo quickly to finiſh it, hee proceeds, and tells us, that ſeeing he believes that none can make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48218:6"/>
that the viſible Church hath continued from under the defection of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> then it is more then probable, that it hath continued under that defection, <hi>page</hi> 3. But I demand how that can be probable, ſeeing that but a little before he told us, and alſo proved, that the defection and falling away under <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> was very great, and marvellous univerſall, and therefore were the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes,</hi> who appeared in the dawning of the day, not unfitly called the firſt fruits unto God; for they could not be the firſt, if there had beene a continuance, <hi>page</hi> 2. but he ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. it is ſaid, <hi>That the Sonne of perdition who exalteth himſelfe above all that is called God; or that is worſhipped, ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelfe that he is God,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Church</hi> hath continued under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> What is this, but <hi>I Sir, no Sir.</hi> But I anſwer, That the <hi>Temple</hi> here ſpoken of, wherein the <hi>Man of Sinne</hi> ſitteth, and is worſhipped, cannot be taken to be the <hi>Church</hi> of God, or that <hi>Temple</hi> of the living God. <hi>whereof Ieſus Chriſt is the Head,</hi> Epheſ. 1.22 <hi>and wherein God himſelfe dwelleth and walketh,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16.17. The reaſon is, becauſe that in 3. verſe of this Chapter it is ſaid, <hi>That the Man of Sinne is not revealed untill firſt there be a falling away,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his comming is ſaid, <hi>verſes</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. <hi>to be withall deceivableneſſe</hi>; in whom? (not in the Church, but <hi>in them that periſh,</hi> who, <hi>becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved, therefore God ſent them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe lies, that all they might periſh, who received not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> verſe 9.10.11.12. Whereupon it muſt needs follow, that that Temple or Societie wherein <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſitteth and is worſhipped; conſiſteth of perſons departed from the faith, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. who are by God juſtly for that cauſe given up to believe lies, that ſo they may periſh and be damned; and therefore not in any wiſe to be eſteemed the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Temple of the living God.</hi> And this muſt needs be ſo from his owne ground, ſeeing that by <hi>Antichriſt</hi> here ſpoken of, he underſtandeth the <hi>Beaſt</hi> mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. as apeareth by his applying this Scripture againſt <hi>Antichriſt, pag.</hi> 2. Now, for as much as thoſe that wonder after the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and worſhip him, are ſaid to be ſuch, whoſe names are not written in the Lambs Book of Life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8 he cannot therfore underſtand the ſame to be the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> where <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſitteth and is worſhipped (unleſſe he conceive that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> conſiſteth of ſuch perſons, whoſe names are not written in the Booke of Life, which I ſuppoſe hee doth not) and therefore I conclude from his own grounds, that the <hi>Temple</hi> ſpoken of in the 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. is no more the <hi>Temple</hi> of God, then <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who ſitteth therein, and is worſhipped, is God himſelfe, nor is otherwiſe to be eſteemed, nor hath hee any reaſon more to affirme
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48218:6"/>
the one, then he hath to affirme the other; from hence therefore it cannot be made to appeare probable that the viſible <hi>Church</hi> hath continued under the defection of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> but it muſt ſtand as <hi>P. B.</hi> at firſt affirmed, <hi>page</hi> 2. that under the defection of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> it could not continue.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe it were probable, that the Church had continued under that defection, then he ſaith <hi>pag.</hi> 3. that Baptiſme by which the matter of the <hi>Church</hi> is differenced, hath there likewiſe continued, and there alſo it will be probable, that his Baptiſme derived from thence is the Baptiſme of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> (Here we may take notice by way) that the beſt ground he hath for his faith in this particular, is but a probability: well, but ſeeing that he holdeth that baptiſme dependeth upon the true <hi>Church,</hi> then where no true <hi>Church</hi> is there can be no true Baptiſme. Now, I need not here demand whether conceives the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a true <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Reader, page</hi> 5. he deſireth that none ſhould thinke ſo of him, for there he ſaith, that he holds that ſtate to be the mother of Fornications, the great whore, <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Egypt, &amp;c.</hi> therfore it muſt needs hence follow, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not <hi>Chriſts</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; for thus he reaſoneth, if the <hi>Church</hi> hath continued, then Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme by which the matter of the Church is differenced hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, <hi>page</hi> 3. But the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not continued the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but is become the mother of fornications <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> as he faith in his Epiſtle, <hi>page</hi> 5. therefore the Baptiſme of <hi>Chriſt</hi> by which the matter of the <hi>Church</hi> is differenced, hath not continued in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; whereas therefore, <hi>page</hi> 5. hee deſireth thoſe which hold that the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Baptiſme</hi> hath not continued under the defection of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> would ſhew him the error and abſurdity of ſuch an opinion; he may eaſily diſcover the error and abſurdity hereof himſelfe, if he will but take notice of what hee hath herein written, <hi>viz.</hi> That Baptiſme differenceth the true matter of the <hi>Church</hi> from the falſe, <hi>pag.</hi> 3.4. whence it will neceſſarily follow, that if the baptiſme of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> be the Baptiſme of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which differenceth the true matter of the <hi>Church</hi> from the falſe, then <hi>Rome</hi> the falſe matter muſt thereby be differenced from it ſelfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a true <hi>Church</hi>; as when at firſt ſhee received <hi>Chriſts</hi> Baptiſme, and then ſhall <hi>Rome</hi> be no longer <hi>Rome,</hi> but a true <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> differenced from a falſe by her baptiſme which differenceth the true matter from the falſe; and therefore for any to hold the <hi>church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be a falſe <hi>church,</hi> as <hi>P. B.</hi> doth, and withall to maintaine that ſhe retaineth the Baptiſme of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereby the true matter of the <hi>Church</hi> is differenced from the falſe, is as much as if a man
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48218:7"/>
ſhould affirme even as he doth, that <hi>Rome</hi> is the mother of fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and alſo that <hi>Rome</hi> is the true Spouſe of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> which is both abſurd and contradictory.</p>
            <p>I will therefore conclude this point thus, Seeing that true Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme differenceth the true matter of the <hi>Church</hi> from the falſe, as <hi>P.B.</hi> ſaith, and yet the baptiſme of the <hi>church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not difference her from the falſe matter, as he alſo affirmeth in his Epiſtle, <hi>page</hi> 5. therefore the baptiſme of the <hi>church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is not that Baptiſme of Chriſt, which differenceth the true matter from the falſe, <hi>page</hi> 3.4. Secondly, That <hi>Church</hi> which hath no other baptiſme then the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of <hi>Rome,</hi> which differenceth not the true matter from the falſe, cannot thereby be differenced from the falſe <hi>church</hi>; but <hi>P.B.</hi> and his <hi>church</hi> have no other baptiſme then the baptiſme of the <hi>church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> which differenceth not the true matter from the falſe, therfore, <hi>P. B.</hi> and his <hi>church,</hi> are not yet differenced from the falſe Church. Whether therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> will owne the ſame for his Spouſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject her as a Harlot ſprung from the mother of Fornications and Harlos, may very well be a queſtion without <hi>Queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he ſaith, <hi>page</hi> 6. If the viſible <hi>Church</hi> hath not continued, then Baptiſme is ceaſed, and being ceaſed without a ſpeciall commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch as <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt had at firſt to baptize, it can never be againe obtained.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That although Baptiſme were ceaſed, as hee intends it, <hi>viz.</hi> That there were no baptized perſons in the world to be found, yet ſo long as Baptiſme the Ordinance of God is found in the word, with a Commiſſion ſerving to the end of the world for Believers or Diſciples to make and baptiſe Diſciples, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19.20. Baptiſme may be againe obtained without any ſuch ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Commiſſion as that which at firſt was given to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt; for it will not follow, that becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt might not baptiſe before baptiſme was inſtituted &amp; he commanded to baptiſe, that therefore Believers after baptiſme is inſtituted and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make and baptiſe Diſciples may not lawfully baptiſe ſuch as are made Diſciples, no more then it will follow, that becauſe <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> might not circumciſe himſelfe and his Males, before circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was inſtituted, and he commanded ſo to doe; that therefore the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> after circumciſion was inſtituted, and they comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to obſerve the ſame, might not, without a ſpeciall Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> had, lawfully circumciſe their Males. It was neceſſary indeed, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt ſhould have a ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to baptiſe, Baptiſme being not before inſtituted nor yet he, nor any other perſon required to baptiſe; as it was neceſſary to the firſt building of the Temple, that a patterne ſhould be given,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48218:7"/>
               <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.11.12. but as then another patterne was not expected as neceſſary for the rebuilding therof at the peoples returne out of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, who performed all things according to the firſt appointment and ordination, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. ſo neither is it requiſite, now baptiſme being ceaſed, that a new Commiſſion ſhould be obtained for the raiſing of it up againe. But that according to their example in the former inſtance all be done according to the firſt inſtitution and ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. If it be objected as in <hi>page</hi> 8. that the commiſſion was given to baptiſed perſons, ſuch as had received their baptiſme from <hi>Iohn,</hi> and therefore it intendeth none that are unbaptiſed; I anſwer, that this commiſſion requireth all ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who by the preaching of the Goſpell, either are or ſhall be made Diſciples unto the end of the world to be baptiſed, and <hi>Chriſts</hi> voyce muſt be obeyed in all things whatſoever he ſaith, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.22. and that without delay, as <hi>Acts.</hi> 22.16. therefore there lies a neceſſity upon all believers to be baptiſed. What is now to be done in this caſe? Baptiſed perſons from whom they may receive the ſame as in a right line, <hi>P. B.</hi> believeth none can be found, <hi>pag.</hi> 2.3. for if none can make it appeare that the viſible Church hath continued, as he believeth none can, then can none make it appear that there are any baptiſed perſons to be found in the world, and therfore ought cannot be had from any ſuch, how then? why in the 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. the Apoſtle telleth us; <hi>that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is profitable, and ſerveth for inſtruction in all righteouſneſſe, that the man of God may be perfect and throughly furniſhed unto all good workes,</hi> and if unto all, then unto this of Baptiſme; whereupon therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently affirme, that as at firſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, at the command of God baptiſed others, though he himſelfe was unbaptiſed: even ſo now (according to his example (which amongſt other things was written for our learning, that we thereby might be taught what to doe in the like caſe of neceſſity) <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. May a Diſciple at the command of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>having made Diſciples by the preaching of the Goſpel baptiſe them for the remiſsion of their ſins.</hi> Act. 2.38.</p>
            <p>If it further be objected, that this example is extraordinary, and therefore not exemplary; I anſwer, that every approved example, though extraordinary, ſerveth for our inſtruction and direction in the like extraordinary caſe; and this is warranted by Chriſts owne teſtimony, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.3.4. where he declareth, that although in ordinary caſes it was unlawfull for any to eate the <hi>Shew bread,</hi> ſave onely the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> yet in caſe of neceſſity it was lawfull and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, both for <hi>David,</hi> and alſo for ſouldiers to eate thereof, whereby he juſtifieth his Diſciples, who in the like caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48218:8"/>
were enforced to doe that which otherwiſe was not lawfull to be done on the Sabbath day. This is our caſe, and hereby wee ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie our practice in the point in hand, and by all which it doth appeare, that although baptiſme were ceaſed in that ſenſe wherein he ſpeaketh, yet ſeeing that that there is a commiſſion already given for baptiſme, which by Chriſt himſelfe is extended to the end of the world, there is no need of a new commiſsion for the raiſing of it up againe; and therefore, from that which <hi>P. B.</hi> ſpeaketh concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> their offering of ſtrange fire, which the Lord commanded not <hi>Lev.</hi> 10. hee might more fitly have applyed againſt his ſtrange baptiſme, <hi>viz.</hi> the baptiſme of Infants, of which the Lord hath never ſpoken, then againſt the baptiſing of believers at his command, and according to his owne inſtitution, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. but for want of better matter to fill up his booke, he was, it ſeemes, inforced to make uſe of vaine words.</p>
            <p>But this is not all for although it be proved that there is commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and authority for Diſciples to baptiſe, though they themſelves be unbaptiſed in the caſe before declared; yet there is another thing whereat <hi>P. B.</hi> is greatly offended, and that is the manner in which this new baptiſme (as he calleth it) is adminiſtred (which according to the inſtitution) is by dipping the whole man in water or burying the whole man under the water, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. This although the Lord command the ſame, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. and examples both of Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch, Act.</hi> 8.38.39. all of them giving witneſſe therunto, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe it to be ſo neceſſary, as that a perſon who is onely ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled with water, ſhould be eſteemed unbaptiſed, <hi>p.</hi> 12. But what are his Reaſons that perſwade him thus to judge? he ſaith, at the moſt, ſprinkling can be but a defect in the quantity of the element, and it's wonderfull that a <hi>Nullity</hi> ſhould follow thereupon. I anſwer, that it's wonderfull that any ſhould eſteeme that to be an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt, which Chriſt hath never ordained; but Chriſt never ordained ſprinkling for his baptiſing but dipping <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. therefore ſprinkling is none of Chriſts ordinance and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence muſt needs be a <hi>nullity</hi>; but he ſaith, by thus urging the Text, we place the ſubſtance of an ordinance in the critickneſſe of a word, <hi>page</hi> 13. I anſwer, that we doe place the ſubſtance of every ordinance in it's conformity to the Word of God, which alone giveth being thereunto, and for any to doe otherwiſe, it is very ſtrange: but belike, he that by the word baptiſe will not underſtand to ſprinkle, and accept the ſame for Chriſts ordinance in baptiſme, which is as much as if by the word (<hi>circumciſe</hi>) the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48218:8"/>
have underſtood to prick the finger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; ſhould ſo have practiſed and owned the ſame for the ordinance of <hi>circumciſion</hi> in the judgement of <hi>P.B.</hi> he is a meere Criticke, and placeth the ſubſtance of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a high nature in the critickneſſe of a word, as he ſpeaketh.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is ſaid that baptiſme reſembleth our buriall and reſurrection with Chriſt, which ſprinkling cannot import, <hi>Rom</hi> 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12 He anſwereth, that ſprinkling or powring water on the face doth hold forth both buriall and reſurrection, <hi>page</hi> 14. for thoſe (he ſaith) that are ſprinkled are under the water and buried, if not ſo, then he demandeth how they were baptiſed unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the cloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the ſea, when not ſo much as a hayre of their head was wet. I anſwer, that by this reaſon as they ſhould not be dipped in baptiſme, ſo neither ſhould they be ſprinkled, and yet ſhall they be under the water, and buried nevertheleſſe; This ſure is one of the myſteries which hee ſpeaketh of, that cannot eaſily be perceived, <hi>page</hi> 10. but ſeeing he thus urgeth the baptiſme of the cloud and of the ſea in this and divers other places deſiring that it may be well minded, as <hi>page</hi> 14.29.30. I deſire to know, whether thereby he underſtandeth the baptiſme inſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.9. if he doe not, then I demand, why he ſo often urgeth the ſame for an example in this point? if he doe, then further demand why con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto in baptiſing his Infants (as hee would have it eſteemed) he ſprinkleth water in their faces? this practice of his to ſprinkle water in the face, if perſons may be baptiſed without water, muſt needs be a point of voluntary religion, as he ſpeaketh of the Surpliſe, and baptiſed garments, <hi>page</hi> 15. and hereby any may ſee how pertinently he allegeth the Scripture. But he ſaith, that whileſt we thus urge baptiſme to hold forth buriall and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we loſe that which it holdeth forth equally therewith (namely) the ſprinkling of the conſcience in the blood of Chriſt. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 52.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24. and the laver of regeneration and our waſhing in the blood of Chriſt, that bleſſed Fountaine, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. To which I anſwer, and deny that ſprinkling in the blood of Chriſt is required to be holden forth in baptiſme, or that any of the Scriptures by him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, doe prove any ſuch thing, or make any mention at all of baptiſme, and therefore are not to be applied thereunto being onely metaphors borrowed from thoſe ſprinklings uſed under the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19.20.21, 22. which, although the matter thereof might or did ſet forth the blood of Chriſt, and the nature of it, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by faith, as 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. yet did not the ſame at all ſet forth the manner of baptiſme, which onely is to be found in the inſtitution,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48218:9"/>
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. and thoſe examples which the Scripture affordeth us thereof, <hi>Marke</hi> 1.9. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.38.39. together with that conformity and agreement with it, hath with death, buriall and reſurrection whereunto the Lord is pleaſed to reſemble and compare the ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. And hee that ſhall affirme that that act of ſprinkling, uſed under the Law, is to be obſerved in baptiſme, becauſe the matter thereof did ſet forth the blood of Chriſt, the matter of our cleanſing may by as good reaſon maintaine that all thoſe particular actions required to be uſed under the Law for the cleanſing of the Leaper (namely) the applying of the blood of his ſacrifice to the thumbe of his right hand, to the tip of his right care, and to the great toe of his right foot, ought alſo to be obſerved in baptiſme, ſeeing, that the matter thereof pointed out the blood of Chriſt as well as that did, which was uſed in ſprinkling then which nothing more abſurd can be imagined. As concerning our waſhing in the blood of Chriſt, that bleſſed foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the other particular in which he inſtanceth, and ſaith, that we loſe by urging baptiſme, to hold forth buriall and reſurrection. I anſwer, that he is much miſtaken therein; for as dipping in the judgement of the ſpirit of God is waſhing, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.14. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with 10. ſo likewiſe unto waſhing by dipping is neceſſarily required much water, as is ſeene, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.23. whereupon it doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that like as dipping of the whole man in water, and his riſing againe forth of the ſame, doth lively hold forth and repreſent his death, buriall and reſurrection with Chriſt, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3.4.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. ſo likewiſe his dipping or waſhing in much water, muſt needes be a full reſemblance of his waſhing in that bleſſed fountaine, the blood of Chriſt, ſet open to waſh in for ſinne and for uncleanneſſe, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1. We therefore by urging bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme to hold forth buriall and reſurrection, loſe not that which ought equally to be holden forth therewith (namely) our waſhing in the blood of Chriſt, &amp;c. But <hi>P. B.</hi> himſelfe, who for baptiſme uſeth ſprinkling, loſeth both buriall and reſurrection, and that which ought equally to be holden forth with them both alſo, to wit, our waſhing in the fountaine of the blood of Chriſt, for that ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hath neither ſimilitude, nor any proportion with any of them.</p>
            <p>But he ſaith that a thing that is dipped in water, is not therefore waſhed and made cleane; to which I anſwer, that then much leſſe is that which is onely ſprinkled with water therefore waſhed and made cleane, but I have proved before that dipping is waſhing, and therefore he that is dipped, is waſhed, and conſequently made cleane ſo farre forth as the ordinance of baptiſme doth require, that alone
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48218:9"/>
ſerving fully to demonſtrate our death, buriall, reſurrection with Chriſt, and the waſhing away and cleanſing us from all filthineſſe in the fountaine of his blood <hi>Zach.</hi> 13 1.</p>
            <p>Yet this will not ſuffice, therefore he further urgeth, that in thoſe Countries where baptiſme firſt begun, they dipped often, and alſo rubbed thereby to cleanſe <hi>pag.</hi> 14. I anſwer that they dipped in thoſe countries, where baptiſme firſt began, is moſt certaine, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly do we practiſe; and when <hi>P. B.</hi> can prove that they dipped often, &amp;c. and alſo juſtifie their practice by the Word of God, wee ſhall therein alſo follow their example. But ſeeing that he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth they dipped, and not onely ſo but alſo dipped often, &amp;c. Why then doth he accuſe us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who dip but once, as though that were too often? and moreover if they uſed to dip where baptiſme firſt began, then is dipping the old, and ſo conſequently the good way, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.16. and why then doth he reproach the ſame as a new way, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. and doth not rather, as he would teach his reader in the frontice-piece of his booke, walke in the old and good way, that he may finde reſt? <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.16. but it appeares that he loves to wrangle, and therefore, now contrary to dipping often, and rubbing to cleanſe, he ſaith, that a little water ſerveth to ſet forth our waſhing in the blood of Chriſt intended in baptiſme as well as a great deale, and the waſhing of a part, as the face, according to the preſent cuſtome as well as waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole man as appeareth by Chriſts waſhing of <hi>Peters</hi> feet, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.10. I anſwer, that a little water ſerveth not ſo fully to ſet out our waſhing in the blood of Chriſt as a great deale doth, and therefore, when the Lord himſelfe would ſet forth this thing unto us, he doth it not under the reſemblance of a little water, but of a fountaine of water, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1. And hence it was, that his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger baptiſed in much water, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.23. Neither doth the waſhing of a part ſet forth the cleanſing of us from all filthineſſe. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Like as the waſhing of the whole man doth, and therefore, that we might draw neere in full aſſurance it's required (not our faces or feet) but that our bodies ſhould be waſhed in pure waters, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. Chriſts waſhing of <hi>Peters</hi> feet he applyeth that as well as he doth the baptiſme of the cloud and of the Sea, and therefore, as I anſwered him in that, ſo I ſhall alſo in this; if hee conceive that Chriſt by waſhing of <hi>Peters</hi> feet would ſet forth unto us the manner of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. I demand then, why contrary thereunto, he uſeth to ſprinkle his infants faces, when he chriſteneth them? And why he doth not rather in a baſon of water waſh their feet? I ſuppoſe therefore, that he knoweth well enough, that Chriſt by waſhing of <hi>Peters</hi> feet, would teach all his Diſciples humility, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.15. and not to waſh
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48218:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a part in baptiſme contrary to his owne inſtitution, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. and example <hi>Marke</hi> 1.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16. But his great objection againſt the dipping of the whole man, is this (he ſaith) That it's hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine how it can ſtand with modeſty and ſhamefaſtneſſe, and yet in the countries where baptiſme firſt began, hee urgeth againſt us, that they dipped often, and alſo rubbed, thereby to cleanſe, <hi>page</hi> 14. Now, if he cannot determine how dipping once may be performed with modeſty, &amp;c. how will he determine how dipping often, and rubbing to cleanſe (as he inſtanceth) could be performed with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and ſhamefaſtneſſe? Surely he will conclude that they put on a linnen garment. But there it will follow, that they baptiſe the garments, &amp;c. Haply he will ſay not the garments but the perſons in the garment, becauſe that when he ſprinkleth his infants he doth not ſtrip them naked out of their clothes; neither yet will he ſay, that therefore he baptiſeth their garments into the death and reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but the infant that are therein. But if it muſt needs follow that they baptiſe the garments, &amp;c. (in their behalfe, I know though not in ours) he will determine, that it was but an error in reſpect of the ſubject, like to the baptiſme of an infant in the ſtead of a believer (as he pleadeth, <hi>page</hi> 12.) and therefore not worthy to be blamed or taken notice of.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſpoken his minde againſt the ordinance of Chriſt (to wit) the baptiſing or dipping of believers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which in deriſion he calleth the new baptiſme, <hi>page</hi> 3. hee returnes againe to the former argument the baptiſme of Infants, <hi>page</hi> 10. which, hee ſaith began many yeeres before Chriſt died, or at leaſt, before the Apoſtles left the world, which indeed, muſt needs be true, if it be the baptiſme which was inſtituted by Ieſus Chriſt, as hee pretends to prove by theſe reaſons that follow.</p>
            <p>His firſt ground is from the Covenant of God made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 17. which covenant, he ſaith was neither part of the new, nor yet of the old, <hi>chap.</hi> 17.18. becauſe it was neither confirmed with the blood of Bulls, nor with the blood of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which thing he ſaith, may ſeeme new, but yet he deſires to ſee the error that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends its. I anſwer, marvelling that he ſhould urge Infants, being in a covenant not confirmed with the blood of Chriſt, to prove their intereſt in baptiſme, and ſo by conſequent in the blood of Chriſt; <hi>the blood of Chriſt is the blood of the new Teſtament, Mat.</hi> 26.28. Now, if that infants be not in this covenant confirmed with the blood of Chriſt, then can they have no intereſt in baptiſme which ſerveth (as he ſaith <hi>page</hi> 14.) to ſet forth our waſhing and ſprinkling with the blood of Chriſt; there needs not therefore any more words

be uſed to ſhew the errour that attends this new conceit urged to prove Infants right to baptiſme, when it not onely excludes them from baptiſme, but alſo from ſalvation by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But Infants being a part of the Church and members thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, what doth let them from being ſo ſtill? ſeeing (as hee ſaith) the Lord hath never ſpoken one word thereof, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. I anſwer, that although Infants were of the Church before Chriſt yet the Lord hath manifeſtly declared, that they ſhould not be ſo now, Chriſt the true promiſed ſeed being once come, as is ſeene, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22. &amp;c. where the Apoſtle thus ſpeaketh. <hi>It is written</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that</hi> Abraham <hi>had two ſonnes, the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free woman,</hi> 23. <hi>but he that was borne of the bond-woman was borne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>fter the fleſh, but hee of the free woman was borne by promiſe,</hi> 24. which things he ſaith, was an allegorie, <hi>verſe</hi> 25.26. the bond maid <hi>Hagar</hi> ſhadowing out the old covenant or teſtament and her ſonne <hi>Iſhmael</hi> which ſhe bore to <hi>Abraham</hi> after the fleſh, or by carnall ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, ſhadowing out all the fleſhly and carnall <hi>Iſraelites</hi> which ſhould proceed from <hi>Abraham</hi> in after generations. The free wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Sara,</hi> pointing out the new covenant or <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which is from above and teaches her ſon appointing out <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the promiſed ſeed as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. and believers borne from above<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or by promiſe, as <hi>Iſack</hi> was the ſpirituall ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith <hi>verſe</hi> 28. We brethren, as <hi>Iſacke</hi> was, are the children of promiſe; after this, to cloſe up the full intent of the ſpirit of God in this thing, in the 29. &amp; 30. <hi>verſes,</hi> he ſheweth that by the carnall and fleſhly ſeed <hi>Iſhmael</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his perſecuting of him which was borne by the promiſe (to wit <hi>Iſaack</hi>) whereupon hee and his mother, was by the command of God, both of them together, caſt out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, the <hi>Church, Gen.</hi> 21.10. thereby was foreſhowne, that when <hi>Chriſt</hi> the true <hi>Iſaack</hi> ſhould be borne, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. and the barren wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the new <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Goſpell,</hi> ſhould bring forth and beare ſons unto God (as <hi>verſe</hi> 27.) then ſhould the bond woman, the old and carnall covenant, with all the carnall ordinances thereof. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. together all her ſonnes, the carnall and the fleſhly ſeed be caſt out of the houſe (ſo ſaith the Text, <hi>verſe</hi> 30.) <hi>Caſt out the bond woman and her ſonne; for the ſonne of the bond woman ſhall not be heire with the ſonne of the free woman, Ioh.</hi> 7.35.26. and therefore, although children carnally begotten were admitted members of the <hi>Church</hi> before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet are they not ſo now, but are with their mother the old and carnall covenant, with all the appurtenances thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are to be rejected (as was ſaid before) and ſo alſo is <hi>P. B.</hi> his expoſition of this Script<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>page</hi> 22. which by the ſonnes of the bond woman onely
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48218:11"/>
noteth ſuch who have actually refuſed and rejected grace, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.35.36. and thereby became bound (as though by nature, before they had rejected grace, they had been free) which is a manifeſt contradiction to the Apoſtle, who by the children of the bond wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man underſtandeth all that are borne, as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was by fleſhly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or all thoſe who are not as <hi>Iſaake,</hi> who was by promiſe (as before) <hi>Col.</hi> 4.27.28. with 3 29.</p>
            <p>His next ground to prove the baptiſme of Infants is this, becauſe the Apoſtle exhorteth parents to bring up their children in admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Lord, therefore they were of the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſo by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent were baptiſed; but how doth hee prove that they were of the <hi>Church?</hi> thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the Apoſtle, who had nothing to doe with thoſe who are without, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. exhorts their parents to bring them up in the admonition of the Lord. To this I anſwer, that the Apoſtle did not write this exhortation to the children who were without, but to their parents who were within; beſides where the Apoſtle ſaith, that hee hath nothing to doe with thoſe that are without, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. it's manifeſt, that hee doth not meane that he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to doe to exhort thoſe that are without, to know and feare the Lord; for hee was ſent to preach the Goſpell to thoſe that were without, that thereby they might be brought within, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.17.18. and hee acknowledgeth himſelfe a debtor to all men to the unwiſe as well as to the wiſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.14, when he ſaith, therefore that hee hath nothing to doe with thoſe that are without, his meaning is, that he hath nothing to doe to cenſure and deale with them that are without, for their evills of inceſt, whoredomes, thefts, &amp;c. he was not by <hi>Chriſt</hi> made a Judge over men in thoſe matters, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12.13. no more then <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe was, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.14. From this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his to prove Infants to be of the <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>(viz.)</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle exhorts their parents to bring them up in the nurture of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. It will follow, that becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts believing wives to be in ſubjection to their husbands, that ſo (although by the word they could not, yet) by their good converſation they might be won<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1.2. that therefore their unbelieving husbands were of the <hi>Church,</hi> and baptiſed, or elſe the Apoſtle medled with thoſe with whom he had nothing to doe.</p>
            <p>But he ſaith, it's an uncomfortable doctrine to hold that children are not of the <hi>Church</hi>; for if they are not borne members of the <hi>Church,</hi> then they are brought forth children to the divell, <hi>pag.</hi> 25. I anſwer, that by nature we are all alike the children of wrath, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. our being of the <hi>Church</hi> depending upon our new birth and generation, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3. and if all that were not borne members of the <hi>Church</hi> ſhall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48218:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be damned, then by <hi>P. B.</hi> his judgement, ſeeing hee cannot prove any true viſible church to be in the world, <hi>page</hi> 3. (and therefore no children to be borne in church) there ſhall none at all be ſaved. Is not this doctrine of his a very comfortable doctrine, for elſe what end doth he conceive was the preaching of the Goſpell ordained? <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18.</p>
            <p>He hath yet another argument which muſt needs be anſwered, for in it there is great confidence placed, and it's this, the children of believers are holy and therefore may be baptiſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. To which I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Apoſtle doth not ſay, that the children of believers are holy, but he ſaith, <hi>That the unbelieving wife is ſanctified to the believing huſband,</hi> (that is) lawfull for his uſe ſo that he may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abide with her, and needs not for her unbeliefe ſake put her away, (as was ſcrupled, <hi>verſe</hi> 10.11, 12.) or elſe, if that ſhee were not, then the children which he ſhould beget of her were uncleane or unholy, whereas being ſanctified, or lawfull to his uſe, they are cleane, or holy (that is, <hi>legitimate</hi>) for the holineſſe of the children here ſpoken of, is not concluded from the faith of parent, but from the lawfull uſe which the believing husband hath of his unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wife; for ſo are the words, <hi>The unbelieving huſband is ſanctified by, or to the believing wife, and the unbelieving wife is ſanctified by, or to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving huſband, or elſe were your children uncleane, but now are they holy.</hi> This Scripture therfore proves no more holineſſe in the children of believers then in the children lawfully he gotten in the honourable eſtate of marriage by unbelievers, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.4. and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence yeeldeth no better warrant for the baptiſing of the one, then it doth for the baptiſing of the other; but I intend brevity, and therefore for further anſwer in this point, I referre him to <hi>A. R.</hi> his booke lately printed, wherein the ſame is handled at large.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the beſt reaſons that <hi>P. B.</hi> can ſhew to prove the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Infants to be according to the word of God, which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they cannot give ſatisfaction to ſome, but they ſtill notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doe ſticke at the mater, (as they well may) and deſire a precept, or an example to warrant the ſame, and therefore he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to ſhew both, <hi>page</hi> 29. but firſt hee deſireth that wee would give him an example of an unbaptiſed perſons his baptiſing of others, and of the refuſing of Infants from being of the Church both which being before ſufficiently declared, we will now take notice how he performeth his promiſe: Firſt he ſaith, There are examples of baptiſing of houſholds, as the <hi>Iaylers</hi> and <hi>Lydias, Acts</hi> 16. and the houſe of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> and queſtionleſſe divers others, <hi>pag.</hi> 29. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an example for the baptiſing of Infants, and not of baptiſing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48218:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
houſholds of believers, ſuch as the <hi>Iaylors, Act.</hi> 16.34. and <hi>Stephanus.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.16. and <hi>Criſpus, Acts</hi> 18.8. and queſtionleſſe divers others. This is a bad example, (for an example he will have it called though it be none at all) to prove that the baptiſme of Infants which muſt be thus declared: houſholds were baptiſed, but in ſome houſholds there are Infants, therefore Infan<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s have been baptiſed. This is as plaine an example to prove the baptiſme of Infants, as this that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth is to prove the baptiſing of notorious drunkards ſwearers, thieves, murtherers, &amp;c. whole houſholds have beene baptiſed, but in ſome houſes there are notorious drunkards, ſwearers, thieves, murtherers, &amp;c. therfore the Apoſtles baptiſed ſuch, and ſuch may be baptiſed. <hi>Who ſeeth not your folly?</hi> Another example as plaine as this followeth, <hi>The whole Church of</hi> Coloſſe <hi>were buried with Chriſt in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> but children were a part of the <hi>Church,</hi> therefore Infants were baptiſed, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.20.21. I anſwer, that the whole Church of <hi>Coloſſe</hi> were buried with Chriſt in baptiſme, and that there were children in that Church to whom the Apoſtle wrote and exhorted to obey their parents in all things, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.20. But our queſtion is about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and not children in generall, ſome wherof are grown to yeers of underſtanding, as theſe were to whom the Apoſtle wrote: for ſure <hi>P. B.</hi> will not ſay he wrote to Infants, which could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what he ſaith. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.14. when <hi>Iacob</hi> ſent his ſonne <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamine</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he uſeth theſe words concerning him and <hi>Ioſeph: If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.</hi> Now, by his reaſon, <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamine,</hi> who was about ſeventeene yeeres old, and <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> who was about thirty yeeres of age, ſhould both of them be Infants becauſe their father called them children; Theſe examples will yeeld as little ſatisfaction to any that queſtion the baptiſing of Infants, as his Reaſons before anſwered.</p>
            <p>But although theſe examples faile, yet <hi>page</hi> 31. he ſaith, there is a plaine command of Ieſus Chriſt for the baptiſing of Infants; and it appeareth thus, <hi>Many nations appeare to be</hi> Abrahams, <hi>and to have him for their father</hi>; now, all theſe nations in which there muſt needs be ſome children, by the expreſſe command of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. are to be baptiſed. I anſwer, <hi>Abraham</hi> was to be a father of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nations, ſome whereof were his naturall and carnall ſeed, borne after the fleſh, as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who for unbeliefe, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and caſt off, with the old and carnall Covenant or Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as was ſhewed before; Others were ſo to be reputed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their faith, and walking in his ſteps, as it is written, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.12. where it is ſaid, <hi>That he received the ſigne of circumciſion, the ſeale of righteouſneſſe of faith, which he had before he was circumciſed, that hee
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48218:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might be the father,</hi> marke of whom (viz,) <hi>of all them that believe and walke in the ſteps of that faith, which he had before he was circumciſed,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. <hi>If yee be Chriſts, then are yee</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed and heires, according to promiſe.</hi> Theſe later, his ſpirituall ſeed by the expreſſe command of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. are to be baptiſed, <hi>Goe yee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and make Diſciples, or believers all Nations, and baptiſe them, and he that believeth</hi> (as <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of all that believe did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. <hi>and is baptiſed, ſhall be ſaved Marke</hi> 16.15. But what is all this to prove the baptiſme of Infants which believe not, and therefore are none of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, who onely are to be baptiſed? no more then that which followeth which is nothing at all; being the ſame in effect with this. The <hi>Nations</hi> that are made <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, the <hi>nations</hi> that are ſaved, the kingdomes which ſhall become the kingdomes of our Lord muſt needs receive Chriſts badge. This is granted, but proveth nothing leſſe then the baptiſing of Infants, ſeeing none are made <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed but thoſe which are firſt made Chriſts, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. that wake in his ſteps, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.12. and doe his workes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.36. Neither doe any kingdomes become the Kingdomes of the Lord, but thoſe that feare and ſerve him, that kiſſe the ſonne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.10.11.12. heare his voyce, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22.23. and have him to raigne over him, <hi>Luke</hi> 19 27. Nor doth the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſalvation of any more then thoſe onely which believe, he that believeth on the ſonne, hath everlaſting life, but hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.36. therefore in refuſing to baptiſe Infants who believe not, we curtaile not the nation that are made <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, &amp;c. I ſhould have thought (but that he denyeth a nationall Church, <hi>page</hi> 39.) that he would have all nations of people to be baptiſed, but ſeeing hee denyeth the former, I cannot charge him with the later but by this that is ſaid, it appeareth how hee hath proved the baptiſme of Infants from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. and other his inſtances then which nothing could poſſibly be alledged more oppoſite thereunto, but herein hee doth not ſeeme ſtrange to mee, finding his whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe not onely (weake, emptie and impertinent) but ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant and contradictions to it ſelfe; ſo that a man in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may very well judge, that he wrote the ſame inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to deſert and render the cauſe evil and naught which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to maintaine, or elſe deſiring to obtaine to himſelfe a name amongſt thoſe vaine janglers, mentioned 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6 who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be teachers, when they neither know what they ſay, nor whereof they affirme, <hi>verſe</hi> 7.
