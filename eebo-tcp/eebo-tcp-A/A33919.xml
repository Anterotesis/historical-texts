            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>BEing convinc'd that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing has gone farther in Debauching the Age than the <hi>Stage Poets,</hi> and <hi>Play-House,</hi> I thought I could not employ my time better than in writing against them. These Men sure, <hi>take Vertue and Regularity,</hi> for <hi>Great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> why else is their <hi>Disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> so very <hi>Remarkable?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:56421:2"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:56421:3"/>
               <hi>It must be said, They have made their</hi> Attack <hi>with great</hi> Courage, <hi>and</hi> gain'd <hi>no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable</hi> Advantage. <hi>But it seems</hi> Lewdness without A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism, <hi>is but</hi> half their Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Conscience <hi>might pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly recover, and</hi> Revenge <hi>be thought on; and therefore like</hi> Foot-Pads, <hi>they must not only</hi> Rob, <hi>but</hi> Murther. <hi>To do them right</hi> their Measures <hi>are</hi> Politickly taken: <hi>To make sure work on't, there's nothing like</hi> Destroying <hi>of</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; Practise <hi>must</hi> follow <hi>of</hi> Course. <hi>For to have</hi> no good Principles, <hi>is to have</hi> no
<pb facs="tcp:56421:3"/>
Reason to be Good. <hi>Now 'tis not to be expected that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should</hi> check <hi>their</hi> Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, <hi>and</hi> balk <hi>their</hi> Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>they don't know why. If</hi> Virtue <hi>has no</hi> Prospect, <hi>'tis not worth the owning. Who would be</hi> troubled <hi>with</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science <hi>if'tis only a</hi> Bugbear, <hi>and has nothing</hi> in't <hi>but</hi> Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>and the</hi> Spleen?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My</hi> Collection <hi>from the</hi> English Stage, <hi>is much short of what</hi> They <hi>are able to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish. An</hi> Inventory <hi>of their</hi> Ware-House <hi>would have been a large</hi> Work: <hi>But being</hi>

               <hi>afraid of over charging the</hi> Reader, <hi>I thought a</hi> Pattern <hi>might do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In</hi> Translating <hi>the</hi> Fathers, <hi>I have endeavour'd to keep</hi> close <hi>to their</hi> Meaning: <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in</hi> some few places, <hi>I have taken the</hi> Liberty of throwing in a Word or two; <hi>To</hi> clear <hi>the</hi> Sensé, <hi>to</hi> preserve <hi>the</hi> Spirit <hi>of the</hi> Original, <hi>and keep the</hi> English <hi>upon its Legs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There's one thing more to acquaint the</hi> Reader <hi>with; 'Tis that I have Ventured to</hi>

This Design has been oddly pursued by the English <hi>Stage.</hi> Our <hi>Poets</hi> write with a different View, and are gone into an other Interest. 'Tis true, were their Intentions fair, they might be <hi>Serviceable</hi> to this <hi>Purpose.</hi> They have in a great measure the Springs of Thought and Inclination in their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. <hi>Show, Musick, Action,</hi> and <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,</hi> are moving Entertainments; and rightly employ'd would be very signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.

These Advantages are now, in the Enemies Hand, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a very dangerous Management. Like Cannon seized they are point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wrong way, and by the Strength of the Defence the Mischief is made the greater.

               <hi>CHAP. 1.</hi> The Immodesty of the <hi>Stage.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN treating this Head, I hope the Reader does not expect that I should set down Chapter and Page, and give him the Citations at Length. To do this would be a very unacceptable and Foreign Employment. Indeed the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, many of them, are in no Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be handled: He that is desirous to see these Flowers let him do it in their own Soil: 'Tis my business rather to kill the <hi>Root</hi> than <hi>Transplant</hi> it. But that the Poets may not complain of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice; I shall point to the Infection at a Distance, and refer in General to <hi>Play</hi> and <hi>Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now among the Curiosities of this kind we may reckon Mrs. <hi>Pinchwife, Horner,</hi> and Lady <hi>Fidget</hi> in the <hi>Country Wife;</hi> Widdow <hi>Blackacre</hi> and <hi>Olivia</hi> in the <hi>Plain Dealer.</hi> These, tho' not all the exceptionable <hi>Characters,</hi> are the most remarkable. I'm sorry the Author should stoop his Wit thus Low, and use his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding so unkindly. Some People
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56421:11"/>
appear Coarse, and Slovenly out of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: They can't well go to the Charge of Sense. They are Offensive like Beggars for want of Necessaries. But this is none of the <hi>Plain Dealer</hi>'s case; He can afford his Muse a better Dress when he pleases. But then the Rule is; where the Motive is the less, the Fault is the greater. To proceed. <hi>Jacinta, Elvira, Dalinda,</hi> and <hi>Lady Plyant,</hi> in the <hi>Mock Astrologer, Spanish Friar, Love Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi> and <hi>Double Dealer,</hi> forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves extreamly: And almost all the <hi>Characters</hi> in the <hi>Old Batchelour,</hi> are foul and nauseous. <hi>Love</hi> for <hi>Love,</hi> and the <hi>Relapse,</hi> strike sometimes upon this <hi>Sand,</hi> and so likewise does <hi>Don Sebastian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I don't pretend to have read the <hi>Stage</hi> Through, neither am I Particular to my Utmost. Here is quoting enough unless 'twere better: Besides, I may have occasion to mention somewhat of this kind afterwards. But from what has been hinted already, the Reader may be over furnish'd. Here is a large Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Debauchery; such <hi>Pieces</hi> are rarely to be met with: 'Tis Sometimes pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Length too, and appears in great Variety of Progress and Practise. It wears almost all sorts of Dresses to engage the Fancy, and fasten upon the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56421:11"/>
Memory, and keep up the Charm from Languishing. Sometimes you have it in Image and Description; sometimes by way of Allusion; sometimes in Disguise; and sometimes without it. And what can be the Meaning of such a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, unless it be to Tincture the Audience, to extinguish Shame, and make Lewdness a Diversion? This is the natural Consequence, and therefore one would think 'twas the Intention too. Such Licentious Discourse tends to no point but to stain the Imagination, to awaken Folly, and to weaken the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of Virtue: It was upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of these Disorders that <hi>Plato</hi> ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd Poets his <hi>Common Wealth:</hi> And one of the <hi>Fathers</hi> calls <hi>Poetry, Vinum Daemonum</hi> an intoxicating <hi>Draught,</hi> made up by the Devils <hi>Dispensatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I grant the Abuse of a Thing is no Argument against the use of it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Young people particularly, should not entertain themselves with a Lewd Picture; especially when 'tis drawn by a Masterly Hand. For such a Liberty may probably raise those Passions which can neither be discharged without Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor satisfyed without a Crime: 'Tis not safe for a Man to trust his Virtue too far, for fear it should give
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56421:12"/>
him the slip! But the danger of such an Entertainment is but part of the Objection: 'Tis all Scandal and meanness into the bargain: it does in effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade Human Nature, sinks Reason into Appetite, and breaks down the Distinctions between Man and Beast. Goats and Monkeys if they could speak, would express their Brutality in such Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as This.</p>
            <p>To argue the Matter more at large.</p>
            <p>Smuttiness is a Fault in Behaviour as well as in Religion. 'Tis a very Coarse Diversion, the Entertainment of those who are generally least both in Sense, and Station. The looser part of the <hi>Mob,</hi> have no true relish of Decency and Honour, and want Education, and Thought, to furnish out a gentile Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. Barrenness of Fancy makes them often take up with those Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Liberties. A Vitious Imagination may blot a great deal of Paper at this rate with ease enough: And 'tis possible Convenience may sometimes invite to the Expedient. The Modern Poets seem to use <hi>Smut</hi> as the Old Ones did <hi>Machines,</hi> to relieve a fainting Invention. When <hi>Pegasus</hi> is jaded, and would stand still, he is apt like other <hi>Tits,</hi> to run into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Puddle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56421:12"/>
Obscenity in any Company is a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick uncreditable Talent; but among Women 'tis particularly rude. Such Talk would be very affrontive in Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not endur'd by any Lady of Reputation. Whence then comes it to Pass that those Liberties which disoblige so much in Conversation, should enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon the <hi>Stage.</hi> Do the Women leave all the regards to Decency and Conscience behind them when they come to the <hi>Play-House?</hi> Or does the Place transform their Inclinations, and turn their former Aversions into Pleasure? Or were Their pretences to Sobriety elsewhere nothing but Hypocrisy and Grimace? Such Suppositions as these are all Satyr and Invective: They are rude Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the whole Sex. To treat the Ladys with such stuff is no better than taking their Money to abuse them. It supposes their Imagination vitious, and their Memories ill furnish'd: That they are practised in the Language of the Stews, and pleas'd with the Scenes of Brutish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. When at the same time the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of Education, and the Laws of Decency, are so very cautious, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in regard to Women: I say so very reserv'd, that 'tis almost a Fault for them to Understand they are ill Used.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56421:13"/>
They can't discover their Disgust without disadvantage, nor Blush without disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to their Modesty. To appear with any skill in such Cant, looks as if they had fallen upon ill Conversation; or Managed their Curiosity amiss. In a word, He that treats the Ladys with such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, must conclude either that they like it, or they do not. To suppose the first, is a gross Reflection upon their Virtue. And as for the latter case, it entertains them with their own Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; which is ill Nature, and ill Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners enough in all Conscience. And in this Particular, Custom and Conscience, the Forms of Breeding, and the Maxims of Religion are on the same side. In other Instances Vice is often too fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable; But here a Man can't be a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, without being a Clown.</p>
            <p>In this respect the <hi>Stage</hi> is faulty to a Scandalous degree of Nauseousness and Aggravation. For</p>
            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> The <hi>Poets</hi> make <hi>Women</hi> speak Smuttily. Of This the Places before mention'd are sufficient Evidence: And if there was occasion they might be Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed to a much greater Number: Indeed the <hi>Comedies</hi> are seldom clear of these Blemishes: And sometimes you have them in <hi>Tragedy.</hi> For Instance.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56421:13"/>
The <hi>Orphans Monimia</hi> makes a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper Description; And the Royal <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onora</hi> in the <hi>Spanish Friar,</hi> runs a strange Length in the History of Love <hi>p.</hi> 50. And do Princesses use to make their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports with such fulsom Freedoms? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this <hi>Leonora</hi> was the first Queen of her Family. Such raptures are too Lascivious for <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Naples.</hi> Are these the <hi>Tender Things</hi> Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> says the Ladys call on him for? I suppose he means the <hi>Ladys</hi> that are too Modest to show their Faces in the <hi>Pit.</hi> This Entertainment can be fairly design'd for none but such. Indeed it hits their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late exactly. It regales their Lewdness, graces their Character, and keeps up their Spirits for their Vocation: Now to bring Women under such Misbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is Violence to their Native Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, and a Mispresentation of their Sex. For Modesty as Mr. <hi>Rapin</hi> observes, is <note place="margin">Reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Aristot. &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Character</hi> of Women. To repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent them without this Quality, is to make Monsters of them, and throw them out of their Kind. <hi>Euripides,</hi> who was no negligent Observer of Humane Nature, is always careful of this Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. <note place="margin">Eurip. Hippolit.</note> Thus <hi>Phaedra</hi> when possess'd with an infamous Passion, takes all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pains to conceal it. She is as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56421:14"/>
and reserv'd in her Language as the most virtuous Matron. 'Tis true, the force of Shame and Desire; The Scandal of Satisfying, and the difficulty of parting with her Inclinations, disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her to Distraction. However, her Frensy is not Lewd; She keeps her Modesty even after She has lost her Wits. Had <hi>Shakespear</hi> secur'd this point for his young Virgin <hi>Ophelia,</hi> the <note place="margin">Hamlet.</note> 
               <hi>Play</hi> had been better contriv'd. Since he was resolv'd to drown the Lady like a Kitten, he should have set her a swimming a little sooner. To keep her alive only to sully her Reputation, and discover the Rankness of her Breath, was very Cruel. But it may be said the Freedoms of Distraction go for nothing, a Feavour has no Faults, and a Man <hi>non Compos,</hi> may kill without Murther. It may be so: But then such People ought to be kept in dark Rooms and without Company. To shew them, or let them loose, is somewhat unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But after all, the Modern <hi>Stage</hi> seems to depend upon this Expedient. Women are sometimes represented <hi>Silly,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Mad,</hi> to enlarge their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and screen their Impudence from Censure: This Tolitick Contrivance we <note place="margin">Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot. Relapse Love for Love.</note> have in <hi>Marcella, Hoyden,</hi> and Miss <hi>Prue.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56421:14"/>
However it amounts to this Confession; that Women when they have their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings about them ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse otherwise. In fine; Modesty is the distinguishing Vertue of that Sex, and serves both for Ornament and Defence: Modesty was design'd by Providence as a Guard to Virtue; And that it might be always at Hand, 'tis wrought into the Mechanism of the Body. 'Tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise proportion'd to the occasions of Life, and strongest in Youth when Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is so too. 'Tis a Quality as true to Innocence, as the Sences are to Health; whatever is ungrateful to the first, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the latter. The Enemy no sooner approaches, but the Blood rises in Opposition, and looks Defyance to an Indecency. It supplys the room of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, and Collection: Intuitive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge can scarcely make a quicker Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; And what then can be a surer Guide to the Unexperienced? It teaches by suddain Instinct and Aversion; This is both a ready and a powerful Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Instruction. The Tumult of the Blood and Spirits, and the Uneasiness of the Sensation, are of singular Use. They serve to awaken Reason, and prevent surprize. Thus the Distinctions of Good and Evil are refresh'd, and the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation kept at proper Distance.</p>

2<hi>ly.</hi> They Represent their single La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys, and Persons of Condition, under these Disorders of Liberty, This makes the Irregularity still more Monstrous and a greater Contradiction to Nature, and Probability: But rather than not be Vitious, they will venture to spoil a Character. This mismanagement we have partly seen already. <hi>Jacinta,</hi> and <hi>Belinda</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mock Astrologer. Old Batch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elour.</note> are farther proof. And the <hi>Double Dealer</hi> is particularly remarkable. There are but <hi>Four</hi> Ladys in this <hi>Play,</hi> and <hi>Three</hi> of the biggest of them are Whores. A Great Compliment to Quality to tell them there is not above a quarter of them Honest! This was not the Roman Breeding, <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> and <hi>Plautus</hi> his Strumpets were Little people; but of this more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> They have oftentimes not so much as the poor refuge of a Double Meaning to fly to. So that you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a necessity either of taking Ribal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry or Nonsence. And when the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence has two Handles, the worst is generally turn'd to the Audience. The Matter is so Contrived that the Smut and Scum of the Thought rises uppermost; And like a Picture drawn to <hi>Sight,</hi> looks always upon the Company.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56421:15"/>
4<hi>ly.</hi> And which is still more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary: the <hi>Prologues,</hi> and <hi>Epilogues</hi> are <note place="margin">Mock Astrologer. Country Wife. Cleomenes. Old Batch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elour.</note> sometimes Scandalous to the last degree. I shall discover them for once, and let them stand like Rocks in the Margin. Now here properly speaking the <hi>Actors</hi> quit the <hi>Stage,</hi> and remove from Fiction into Life. Here they converse with the <hi>Boxes,</hi> and <hi>Pit,</hi> and address direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Audience. These Preliminaries and concluding Parts, are design'd to justify the Conduct of the <hi>Play,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak the Favour of the Company. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such Occasions one would imagine if ever, the Ladys should be used with Respect, and the Measures of Decency observ'd, But here we have Lewdness without Shame or Example: Here the <hi>Poet</hi> exceeds himself. Here are such Strains as would turn the Stomach of an ordinary Debauchee, and be almost nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seous in the <hi>Stews.</hi> And to make it the more agreeable, Women are Commonly pick'd out for this Service. Thus the <hi>Poet</hi> Courts the good opinion of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. This is the Desert he regales the Ladys with at the Close of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment: It seems He thinks They have admirable Palats! Nothing can be a greater Breach of Manners then such Liberties as these. If a Man would stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56421:16"/>
to outrage <hi>Quality</hi> and, Vertue, he could not do it more Effectually. But</p>
            <p>5<hi>thly.</hi> Smut is still more insufferable with respect to Religion. The Heathen Religion was in a great Measure a <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery</hi> of <hi>Iniquity.</hi> Lewdness was Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated in the Temples, as well as practis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Stews.</hi> Their Deitys were great Examples of Vice, and worship'd with their own Inclination. 'Tis no wonder therefore their Poetry should be tinctured with their Belief, and that the <hi>Stage</hi> should borrow some of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Theology. This made <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curys</hi> Procuring, and <hi>Jupiters</hi> Adultery the more passable in <hi>Amphitrion:</hi> Upon <note place="margin">Plant.</note> this Score <hi>Gymnasium</hi> is less Monstrous in Praying the Gods to send her store of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants. And thus <hi>Chaeraea</hi> defends his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture <note place="margin">Cistellar.</note> by the Precedent of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <note place="margin">Terent. Eunuch.</note> 
               <hi>Danae.</hi> But the Christian Religion is quite of an other Complexion. Both its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and Authorities, are the highest discouragement to Licentiousness. It for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the remotest Tendencies to Evil, Banishes the Follies of Conversation, and Obliges up to Sobriety of Thought. That which might pass for Raillery, and Entertainment in Heathenism, is detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Christianity. The Restraint of the Precept, and the Quality of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56421:16"/>
Deity, and the Expectations of Futurity quite alter the Case.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding the Latitudes of Paganism, the Roman and Greek <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atres</hi> were much more inoffensive than ours. To begin with <hi>Plautus.</hi> This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median, tho' the most exceptionable, is modest upon the Comparison. For</p>
            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> He rarely gives any of the above mention'd Liberties to Women; And when these are any Instances of the contrary, 'tis only in prostituted and Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar People; And even these, don't comè up to the Grossness of the <hi>Modern Stage:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Asinar.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For the Purpose. <hi>Cleaereta</hi> the Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris borders a little upon Rudeness: <hi>Lena</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cistellar.</note> and <hi>Bacchis</hi> the Strumpet are Airy <note place="margin">Bacchid.</note> and somewhat over-merry, but not <hi>A l'Anglois</hi> obscene. <hi>Chalinus</hi> in Womans <note place="margin">Casin.</note> Cloaths is the most remarkable. <hi>Pasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compa</hi>

               <hi>Phronesiam</hi> a Woman of the <hi>Town</hi> uses a <note place="margin">Trucul.</note> double entendre to <hi>Stratophanes.</hi> These are the most censurable Passages, and I think all of them with relation to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; which considering how the World goes is very moderate. Several of <hi>our</hi> Single <hi>Plays</hi> shall far out-do all This put together. And yet <hi>Plautus</hi> has upon the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56421:17"/>
matter left us 20 entire <hi>Comedies.</hi> So that in short, these Roman Lasses are meer <hi>Vestal Virgins,</hi> comparatively speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

He disputes very handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by himself against irregular Love; The Discourse between him and <hi>Philto</hi> is instructive and well managed. And afterwards he gives <hi>Lesbonicus</hi> a great <note place="margin">Act. 2. 1.</note> deal of sober advice, and declaims hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Act. 2. 2.</note> against Luxury and Lewdness! Now by confining his Rudeness to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle People, the Fault is much extenuated. For First, the representation is more Naturally this way; And which is still better, 'tis not so likely to pass into Imitation: Slaves and Clowns are not big enough to spread Infection; and set up an ill Fashion. 'Tis possible the <hi>Poet</hi> might contrive these <hi>Pesants Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive</hi> to discountenance the Practise. Thus the <hi>Heilots</hi> in <hi>Sparta</hi> were made drunk to keep Intemperance out of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56421:17"/>
Credit. I don't mention this as if I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd the Expedient, but only to show it a circumstance of Mitigation and Excuse.</p>
            <p>Farther, These <hi>Slaves</hi> and Pandars, Seldom run over, and play their Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols before Women. There are but Four Instances of this Kind as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Olympio, Palaestrio, Dordalus,</hi> and <note place="margin">Casin Mil. Glor. Pers. Trucul.</note> 
               <hi>Stratilax</hi> are the Persons. And the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men they discourse with, are two of them Slaves, and the third a Wench. But with our <hi>Dramatists,</hi> the case is otherwise. With us <hi>Smuttiness</hi> is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and unconfin'd. 'Tis under no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, of Company, nor has any regard to Quality or Sex. Gentlemen talk it to Ladies, and Ladies to Gentlemen with all the Freedom, and Frequency imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. This is in earnest to be very hearty in the cause! To give Title and Figure to Ill Manners is the utmost that can be done. If Lewdness will not thrive under such encouragement it must e'en Miscarry!</p>
            <p>4<hi>ly. Plautus</hi> his <hi>Prologues</hi> and <hi>Epilogues</hi> are inoffensive. 'Tis true, <hi>Lambinus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to fetch a double <hi>entendre</hi> out of that to <hi>Poenulus,</hi> but I think there is a Strain in the Construction. His <hi>Prologue</hi> to the <hi>Captivi</hi> is worth the observing.</p>

            <p>We see here the Poet confesses Smut a scandalous Entertainment. That such Liberties ought to fall under Neglect, to lie unmention'd, and be blotted out of Memory.</p>
            <p>And that this was not a Copy of his Countenance we may learn from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions. His best <hi>Plays</hi> are almost alwaies Modest and clean Complexion'd.

His <hi>Epidicus</hi> the Master-Piece of his whole Collection is inoffensive Throughout: And so are his <hi>Menechmi, Rudens,</hi> and <hi>Trinummus,</hi> which may be reckon'd amongst some of his next Best. His <hi>Truculentus</hi> another fine <hi>Play</hi> (tho' not entire) with a Heathen Allowance, is pretty Passable. To be short: Where he is most a Poet, he is generally least a Buffoon. And where the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment is Smut, there is rarely any other Dish well dress'd: The Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56421:18"/>
is commonly wretched, the Sence lean and full of Quibbles. So that his Understanding seems to have left him when he began to abuse it.</p>
            <p>To conclude, <hi>Plautus</hi> does not dilate upon the Progress, Successes, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments of <hi>Love,</hi> in the <hi>Modern</hi> way. This is nice Ground, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He either stands off, or walks grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over it, He has some regard to the Retirements of Modesty, and the Dignity of Humane Nature, and does not seem to make Lewdness his Business. To give an Instance. <hi>Silenium</hi> is much gone in Love, but Modest withall, tho' former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Cistellar. A. 1.</note> debauch'd.</p>
            <p>She is sorry her Spark was forced from her, and in Danger of being lost. But then she keeps within compass and never flies out into Indecency. <hi>Alcesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marchus</hi> is strangely smitten with this <hi>Silenium,</hi> and almost distracted to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her. He is uneasy and blusters, and <note place="margin">Ibid. A. 2.</note> threatens, but his Passion goes off in Generals. He Paints no Images of his Extravagance, nor descends to any nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous particulars.</p>
            <p>And yet after all, <hi>Plautus</hi> wrote in an Age not perfectly refin'd, and often seems to design his <hi>Plays</hi> for a Vulgar Capacity. 'Twas upon this view I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56421:19"/>
his <hi>Characters</hi> exceed Nature, and his ill Features are drawn too large: His old Men over credulous, his Misers Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and his Coxcombs improbably singular. And 'tis likely for this reason his <hi>Slaves</hi> might have too much Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Terence</hi> appear'd when Breeding was more exact, and the <hi>Town</hi> better polish'd; And he manages accordingly: He has <note place="margin">Heauton</note> but one faulty bordering Expression, which is that of <hi>Chremes</hi> to <hi>Cliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho.</hi> This single Sentence apart, the rest of his Book is (I think) unsullied and fit for the nicest Conversation. I mean only in referrence to the Argument in Hand, for there are things in Him, which I have no intention to warrant. He is Extreamly careful in the Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of his Women. Neither <hi>Glycerium</hi> in <hi>Andria, Pamphila</hi> in <hi>Eunuchus,</hi> or <hi>Pamphila</hi> in <hi>Adelphi, Phanium</hi> in <hi>Phor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio,</hi> or <hi>Philumena</hi> in <hi>Hecyra,</hi> have any share of Conversation upon the <hi>Stage.</hi> such Freedom was then thought too much for the Reservedness of a Maiden-Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. 'Tis true in <hi>Heautontimoroumenos</hi> the <hi>Poets</hi> Plot obliged <hi>Antiphila</hi> to go under the Disguise of <hi>Bacchis</hi> her Maid. Upon this Occasion they hold a little Discourse together. But then <hi>Bacchis</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56421:19"/>
tho' she was a Woman of the <hi>Town,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves her self with all the Decency ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. She does not talk in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of her Profession. But commends <hi>Antiphila</hi> for her Virtue: <hi>Antiphila</hi> only says how constant she has been to <hi>Chinia,</hi> seems surprised at his Arrival, and salutes him civilly upon't, and we hear no more from her. Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> seems to refer to this Conduct in his Dramatick <hi>Poesie.</hi> He censures the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> for making <hi>Mutes</hi> of their single Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. This He calls the <hi>Breeding of the Old</hi> Elizabeth <hi>way, which was for Maids to be seen and not to be heard.</hi> Under Favour the old Discipline would be very serviceable upon the <hi>Stage.</hi> As matters go, the <hi>Mutes</hi> are much to few. For certainly 'tis better to say nothing, than talk out of Character, and to ill purpose.</p>
            <p>To return. The Virgin injured by <hi>Chaerea</hi> does nothing but weep, and won't so much as speak her misfortune to the <note place="margin">Eunuch.</note> Women. But Comedy is strangly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved since that time; For <hi>Dalinda</hi> has a great deal more Courage, tho' the loss of her Virtue was her own <note place="margin">Love Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ump.</note> Fault.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Terence</hi> has that regard for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that he won't so much as touch upon an ill Subject before them. Thus
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56421:20"/>
               <hi>Chremes</hi> was ashamed to mention any thing about his Sons Lewdness when his Wife was present.</p>

            <p>The Slaves in this Comedian are kept in order and civilly bred. They Guard and Fence when occasion requires, and step handsomly over a dirty place. The <note place="margin">Eunuch A. 5. 4. 5. Adelph. A. 2. 3.</note> Poet did not think Littleness and low Education a good Excuse for Ribaldry. He knew Infection at the weakest, might seize on some Constitutions: Besides, the Audience was a Superior Presence, and ought to be considered. For how Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent soever People may'be at Home, yet when they come before their Betters 'tis Manners to look wholsom.</p>
            <p>Now tho' <hi>Plautus</hi> might have the richer Invention; <hi>Terence</hi> was always thought the more judicious Comedian. His Raillery is not only finer, and his stile better polish'd; but his <hi>Characters</hi> are more just, and he seems to have reach'd farther into Life than the other. To take Leave of this Author, even his Serumpets are better behaved than our honest Women, than our Women of Quality of the English <hi>Stage. Bacchis</hi> in <hi>Heautontimoroumenos,</hi> and <hi>Bacchis</hi> in

               <hi>Hocyra,</hi> may serve for example. They are both modest, and converse not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming their Sex. <hi>Thais</hi> the most accomplish'd in her way, has a great deal of Spirit and wheadling in her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, <note place="margin">Eunuch.</note> but talks no Smut.</p>
            <p>Thus we see with what Caution and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety of Language <hi>Terence</hi> manages. 'Tis possible this Conduct might be his own Modesty, and result from Judgment and Inclination. But however his Fancy stood, he was sensible the Coarse way would not do. The <hi>Stage</hi> was then under Discipline, the publick <hi>Censors</hi> formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and the Office of the <hi>Choragus</hi> was originally to prevent the Excesses of Liberty.</p>
            <p>To this we may add that <hi>Nobless</hi> had <note place="margin">Casaub. Annot, in Curcul Plauti.</note> no Relish for Obscenity; 'twas the ready way to Disoblige them. And therefore 'tis <hi>Horaces</hi> Rule.</p>

            <p>The Old <hi>Romans</hi> were particularly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full their Women might not be affronted in Conversation: For this reason the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married kept off from Entertainments for <note place="margin">Var. apud.

               <hi>Greece</hi> no Woman above the degree of a <hi>Slave,</hi> was treated abroad by any but <note place="margin">Corn. Nep.</note> Relations. 'Tis probable the old Comedy was silenced at <hi>Athens</hi> upon this Score, as well as for Defamation. For as <hi>Aristotle</hi> observes the new Set of Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians <note place="margin">Arist. Lib. 4. de Mor. cap. 14.</note> were much more modest than the former. In this celebrated Republick, if the <hi>Poets</hi> wrote any thing against Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or Good Manners, They were <note place="margin">Vit. Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rip. ed Cantab. 1694.</note> tryed for their Misbehaviour, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the highest Forfeitures.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiss to observe that there are no Instances of debauching Married Women, in <hi>Plautus,</hi> nor <hi>Terence,</hi> no nor yet in <hi>Aristophanes.</hi> But on our <hi>Stage</hi> how common is it to make a Lord, a Knight, or an Alderman a Cuckold? The Schemes of Success are beaten out with great Variety, and almost drawn up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Science. How many Snares are laid for the undermining of Virtue, and with what Triumph is the Victory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd? The Finess of the <hi>Plot,</hi> and the Life of the Entertainment often lies in these Contrivances. But the <hi>Romans</hi> had a different sence of these Matters, and saw thro' the consequences of them. The Government was awake upon the Theatre, and would not suffer the Abuses of Honour, and Family, to pass into
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56421:21"/>
Diversion. And before we part with these <hi>Comedians</hi> we may take notice that there are no Smutty Songs in their <hi>Plays;</hi> in which the <hi>English</hi> are extreamly Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous. <note place="margin">Love for Love.

In his <hi>Thebais, Oedipus</hi>'s Incest is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at large, but without any choaking Description. 'Tis granted <hi>Phaedra</hi> speaks her Passion plainly out, and owns the strength of the Impression, and is far less prudent than in <hi>Euripides.</hi> But tho' her <note place="margin">Hippol.</note> Thoughts appear too freely, her Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is under Discipline.</p>
            <p>Let us now Travel from <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> and take a view of the Theatre at <hi>Athens.</hi> In this City the <hi>Stage</hi> had both its beginning and highest Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Aeschylus</hi> was the first who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd with any Reputation. His Genius
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56421:22"/>
seems noble, and his Mind generous, willing to transfuse it self into the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and inspire them with a Spirit of Bravery. To this purpose his Stile is Pompous, Martial, and Enterprizing. There is Drum and Trumpet in his Verse. 'Tis apt to excite an Heroick Ardour, to awaken, warm, and push forward to Action. But his Mettal is not always under Management. His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination for the <hi>Sublime;</hi> carrys him too far: He is sometimes Embarrass'd with <hi>Epithites.</hi> His Metaphors are too stiff, and far fetch'd; and he rises rather in Sound, than in Sence. However generally speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Materials are both shining and solid, and his Thoughts lofty, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common. This Tragedian had always a nice regard to Good Manners. He knew corrupting the People was the greatest disservice to the Commonwealth; And that Publick Ruine was the effect of general Debauchery. For this reason he declines the Business of Amours, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares expresly against it.

            <p>To proceed. <hi>Sophocles</hi> appear'd next upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> and was in earnest an Extraordinary Person.

This Tragedian like <hi>Aeschylus</hi> does not often concern himself with <hi>Amours,</hi> and when he does, nothing can be more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and decent. For example where the Incest of <hi>Oedipus</hi> is described, the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiveness of the Idea is screen'd off and broken by Metaphorical and distant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions. <note place="margin">Oedip.

Had They been with us, they had met with kinder treatment. They might have had Interviews and Time and Freedom enough. Enough to mud their Fancy, to tarnish their Quality, and make their Passion Scandalous. In the Relation of <hi>Haemons</hi> Death, his Love is related too, and that with all the Life and <hi>Pathos</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginable.

            <p>
               <hi>Sophocles</hi> will afford us no more, let us therefore take a view of <hi>Euripides.</hi> 'Tis the Method of this Author to decline the Singularities of the <hi>Stage,</hi> and to appear with an Air of Conversation.

            <p>The <hi>Play-house</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> has been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto in Order, but are there no Instances to the contrary? Do's not <hi>Aristophanes</hi> take great Liberties and make Women speak extraordinary Sentences? He do's so. But his Precedent fignifies nothing in the case. For</p>
            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> We have both the Reason of the Thing, and all the Advantage of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity on the other side. We have the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise and Opinion of Men of much greater Sence, and Learning then Himself. The best Philosophers and Poets, Criticks and Orators, both Greek and Latin, both An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and Modern, give the Cause against him. But <hi>Aristophanes</hi> his own <hi>Plays</hi> are sufficient to ruin his Authority. For</p>
            <p>1<hi>st,</hi> He discovers himself a downright Atheist. This Charge will be easily Made
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56421:27"/>
good against him by his Comparing his <hi>Nubes</hi> with other <hi>Plays.</hi> The Design of his <hi>Nubes</hi> was to expose <hi>Socrates,</hi> and make a Town jest of him. Now this Philosopher was not only a Person of great Sence and Probity, but was likewise suppos'd to refine upon the Heathen Theology, to throw off the Fabulous part of it, and to endeavour to bring it back to the Standard of Natural Religion. And therefore <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> and some others of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> look'd on him as a Person of no Pagan Belief, and thought he suffer'd for the Unity of the God-Head. This Man <hi>Aristophanes</hi> makes fine sport with as he fancies: He puts him in a Fools Coat, and then points at him. He makes <hi>Socrates</hi> instruct his Disciple <hi>Strepsiades</hi> in a new Religion, and tell him that <hi>he did not own the Gods in the vulgar Notion.</hi> He brings him in elswhere affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Nub. Act. 1. Sc. 3. p. 104. Ed.

            <p>
               <hi>Socrates</hi> goes on with his Lecture of Divinity and declares very roundly that there is no such thing as <hi>Jupiter.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">p. 106.</note> he advances farther, and endeavours
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56421:28"/>
to get <hi>Strepsiades</hi> under Articles to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no other Gods, but <hi>Chaos,</hi> the <hi>Clouds,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Nub. p. 110.</note> and the <hi>Tongue.</hi> At last the <hi>Poet</hi> brings the Philosopher to publick Pennance for his Singularities. He sets fire to his <hi>School</hi> for teaching Young People (as he pretends) to dispute against Law and Justice; for advancing Atheistick Notions, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesquing the Religion of the Country. <note place="margin">Act. 5. p. 176.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Socrates</hi> was no Atheist is clear from Instances enough. To mention but one.

                  </gap>.</note> 'tis plain <hi>Aristophanes</hi> was not of his Religion. The <hi>Comedian</hi> was by no means for correcting the Common Perswasion. So that he must either be an Orthodox Heathen or nothing at all. Let us see then with what Respect he treats the Receiv'd <hi>Divinities.</hi> This <hi>Play,</hi> where one would not expect it, discovers somewhat of his Devotion. In the beginning of it <hi>Phidip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides,</hi> who was a sort of <hi>New-Market</hi> Spark, swears by <hi>Jocky Neptune,</hi> that he had a <note place="margin">Nub. p. 86</note> strange Kindness for his Father <hi>Strepsiades.</hi> upon this the old Man replies; <hi>No Jocky, if you love me; that Deity has almost undone me.</hi> This was making somewhat bold with <hi>Neptune</hi> who was <hi>Jupiters</hi> Brother, <hi>Soveraign</hi> of a whole <hi>Element,</hi> and had no
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56421:28"/>
less than the Third Share of the Universe! Certainly <hi>Aristophanes</hi> had no Venture at Sea, or else must think the <hi>Trident</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied but very little. But this is meer Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony to what follows. In his first <hi>Play Plutus</hi> pretends he had a mind to oblige only Men of Probity, but <hi>Jupiter</hi> had made him blind on purpose that he might not distinguish Honest men from Knaves: For to be plain <hi>Jupiter</hi> had a Pique against Good people. Towards the end of this <hi>Comedy Mercury</hi> is abused by <hi>Cario,</hi> and <note place="margin">Plut. A. 1. Sc. 2.</note> acts a ridiculous, and lessening part him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Afterwards he complains heavily that since <hi>Plutus</hi> was cured of his Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the business of Sacrifing fell off, and the Gods were ready to starve. This <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> has the same ill Usage with the <hi>Poets,</hi> Knaves, Informers, and Lewd Women; From all this stuff put together, his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is pretty plain, <hi>viz.</hi> That Religion was no better than an Imposture suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Art, and Ignorance: And that when Men's Understandings were awake, and their Eyes a little open, they would have more discretion than to be at any expence about the Gods.</p>
            <p>This I take to be part of the Moral of his Fable. If we look farther into him we shall see more of his Mind. His <hi>Ranae</hi> makes Merry with theHeathen Scheme of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56421:29"/>
Heaven and Hell. Here <hi>Charon</hi> and the <hi>Stygian Frogs</hi> are brought in Comically enough. And that you may understand his opinion more perfectly we are told, that He that Bilks his <hi>Catamite</hi> after a <hi>Sodomitical</hi> Abuse, is thrown into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon shore of <hi>Hades.</hi> And what Company do you think he is lodg'd with? Why with those who Perjure themselves, with those who Kick their Fathers and Mothers? It seems in the <hi>Poets</hi> Justice a Man <note place="margin">Ram. p. 188.</note> might as good be false to his Oath, as to his Lewdness. To disappoint the <hi>Stews,</hi> is every jot as great a Crime; as to fly in the Face of Nature, and outrage our Parents. His Quartering his Malefactors thus critically, was without question on purpose to Banter the perswasion of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Punishment. In the same <hi>Play Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> bids <hi>Aeacus</hi> answer him by <hi>Jove,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. This little Scoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drel of a Slave has the Manners to make <hi>Jupiters</hi> Quality no better than his own. To go on with him: In his <hi>Aves</hi> he speaks out to purpose. Here <hi>Pisthetaerus</hi> tells <hi>Epops</hi> that if the <hi>Birds</hi> would build a Castle in the Air, they might intercept the Fumes of the Sacrifices, and starve the Gods unless they would come too, and be Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary. It seems the <hi>Birds</hi> had very good Pretences to execute this project; for they
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56421:29"/>
were ancienter than <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> and Govern'd before the Gods. And to speak truth were more capable of the Function. Their Adviser goes on to inform <note place="margin">536. 538. 546.</note> them, that after they had built their pensile City, and fortifyed the Air, their next business was to demand their ancient Soveragnity: If <hi>Jupiter</hi> refused to quit, they were to declare a Holy War against Him, and the rest of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Gods, and to cut off the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication between Heaven and Earth. <hi>Pisthaeterus</hi> grows very warm in his <note place="margin">542.</note> new Interest, and swears by <hi>Jove</hi> that Men ought to Sacrifice to the <hi>Birds,</hi> and not to <hi>Jupiter.</hi> And if things came to a Rupture, and <hi>Jupiter</hi> grew Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, <note place="margin">582.</note> he undertakes to send a Detache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Eagles against Him; with Orders to storm his Palace with Flambeaux, and fire it about his Ears. At last to prevent the Calamities of a War, <hi>Hercules</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> proposes an Accomodation, and is willing <hi>Jupiter</hi> should Resign. <hi>Neptune</hi> calls him a Block-head for his pains, because he was Heir at <hi>Law,</hi> and after <hi>Jupiters</hi> Decease was of Course to succeed in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Once more, and I have done: In <hi>Eirene, Trygaeus</hi> speaks in a menacing <note place="margin">602.</note> way. That unless <hi>Jupiter</hi> gave him Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in his business, he would inform
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56421:30"/>
against Him as a disaffected Person, and a betrayer of the Liberties of <hi>Greece.</hi> I <note place="margin">Eiren. 616.</note> might add many other Instances, and some more Scandalous than any I have mentioned; But these are sufficient to shew the Authors Sentiment: And is it any wonder an Atheist should misbehave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in point of Modesty? What can we expect less from those who laugh at the Being of a God, at the Doctrines of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the Distinctions of Good and Evil? A <hi>Sceptick</hi> has no notion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; no Relish for Virtue, nor is under any Moral restraints from Hope or Fear. Such a one has nothing to do but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult his Ease, and gratifie his Vanity, and fill his Pocket. But how these Ends are compassed, he has no squeamishness, or Scruples about it. 'Tis true when the Methods of Lewdness will Take, they are generally most agreeable. This way suits their Talent, and screens their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, and obliges their Malice. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is a greater Eye-sore to these Men, then Virtue and Regularity. What a pleasure is it then to be admired for Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif, to be reveng'd on Religion, and to see Vice prosper and improve under our Hands! To return: Beside <hi>Aristophanes;</hi> Atheisme, I have a Second objection to his Authority, and that is want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56421:30"/>
If we examine his <hi>Plays</hi> we shall find his Characters improper, or ununi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; either wrong at first, or unsteady in the Right. For the purpose. In his <hi>Nubes.

He puts dirty expressions in the Mouth of his Man of Probity, makes him declaim vitiously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Vice, and Corrects scurrility with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence; Now what can be more idle and senceless, than such Conduct as this? Epecially when this <hi>Justus</hi> as he calls him had told them in the beginning of his speech, that People used to be well slash'd for such Fooling, when Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Discipline were in their due Force. The <hi>Chorus</hi> of his <hi>Ranae</hi> slides <note place="margin">p. 142. p. 200.</note> into the same Inconsistency of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and Practise.

This <hi>Tragedian</hi> after he had play'd <note place="margin">242.</note> a little with the Story of <hi>Bellerophon,</hi> goes on in the same strain; And charges <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides</hi> that he had furnish'd all sorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with Saweiness and Prattle.

               <hi>Signior</hi> at a publick Audience! This with a short Sentence or two of Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is the hardest of <hi>Hercules</hi> his Usage: And 'tis well he escaped so; for <hi>Bacchus</hi> is treated much worse.

Now do's this paultry Behaviour agree with the Heathen Theology, with the Common Opinion concerning <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Hercules?</hi> Do's a <hi>Blew-Cap</hi> and a <hi>Ladle,</hi> become the Sons of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Religious Worship? Those who at the lowest, were counted the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the World, and more than Men both by Birth and Enterprizes? <hi>Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> and <hi>Euripides</hi> make these two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons manage at a quite different rate of Decency. 'Tis no defence to say <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> wrot Comedy, and so was obliged to make his Scenes more diverting. This excuse I say is defective; for a Comedian ought to imitate Life and Probability, no less than a Tragedian. To Metomorphose <hi>Characters,</hi> and present Contradictions to Common Belief, is to write, <hi>Farce</hi> instead of <hi>Plays.</hi> Such Comedians like <hi>Thespis</hi> ought to have a travelling <hi>Stage,</hi> and take the Air with <hi>Porcupines</hi> and <hi>Dromedaryes.</hi> If 'tis said that Gravity and greatness do's not suit the Complection and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of Comedy. To this I answer, that therefore the <hi>Persons</hi> should be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen accordingly. They should have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their known Humour, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition too Noble, and solemn for Trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. 'Tis <hi>Horaces</hi> advice.</p>

            <p>Let us remember that Operations always resemble the Nature from whence they flow. Great Persons should therefore have a correspondent Behaviour assign'd them. To make <hi>Beings</hi> much Superior to the Biggest of Mankind, talk below the Least, is absurd and ridicules. This <hi>Aristophanes</hi> seems sensible of in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Aeschylus.</hi> Here <hi>Euripides</hi> objects <note place="margin">Ranae p. 242.</note> to <hi>Aeschylus,</hi> that he was too rumbling, noisy, and bombastick, over affecting that which <hi>Horace</hi> calls</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ampullas, &amp; sesquipedalia Verba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this <hi>Aeschylus</hi> Answers, that the Thoughts, and Designs of <hi>Heroes</hi> must be deliver'd in Expressions proportioned to their Greatness. It being likely that the Demi-Gods spoke up to their Dignity and Stature: And as they were distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd by the richness of their Habit, so they had a more Magnificent Language than other Mortals. To this <hi>Euripides</hi> replys nothing; from whence you may conclude the <hi>Poet</hi> thought the Apology not unreasonable. In short <hi>Aristophanes</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:56421:33"/>
had Sense but he does not always use it. He is not equal, and uniforme. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times you have him flat and foolish a good while together. And where he has Spirit, 'tis oftentimes lavished away to little purpose. <note place="margin">Ranae A 1. Sc. 1. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionat.</note> His Buffoonery is commonly too strong for his Judgment. This makes him let sly his jests without regard to Person or occasion: And thus by Springing the <hi>Game</hi> too soon, the Diversion is lost. I could make several other Material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections against the Conduct of his <hi>Plays;</hi> But this being not necessary I shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in the</p>
            <p>3<hi>d.</hi> Place. That notwithstanding the scandalous Liberty for which <hi>Aristophanes</hi> is so remarkable; yet in his Lucid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervalls, when Sence and Sobriety return upon him, he pronounces against his own Practise. In the contest between <hi>Aeschylus</hi> and <hi>Euripides, Bacchus</hi> is made the Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the Controversie. <hi>Aeschylus</hi> begins <note place="margin">Ranae p. 238.</note> with a Question, and asks <hi>Euripides</hi> what 'tis which makes a <hi>Poet</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired? He answers. 'Tis for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress of his Conduct, and the handsome Turns of Morality in his Poems. 'Tis because his performance has a tendency to form the Audience to Virtue, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. <hi>Aeschylus</hi> demands of him
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56421:33"/>
farther; But suppose you debauched the Age, and made an Honest and a brave Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Lewd, and good for nothing, what do you deserve then? Here <hi>Bacchus</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and crys out, what does he deserve? A Halter! pray don't ask so plain a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And afterwards we are told, that <hi>Poets</hi> are valuable only for describing Things useful, in Life and Religion, for polishing Inventions, and setting off great Examples with Lustre, and Advantage. In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress <note place="margin">p. 240.</note> of the Dispute, <hi>Aeschylus</hi> taxes <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides</hi> with being too uncautious in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations; And tells him that Poets ought to conceal that which is vicious in Story; And entertain with nothing but Virtue, and Sobriety: He goes on repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>Euripides</hi> for his Dramatick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cests, Strumpets, and Amours: And as for himself, to his best remembrance, He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver brought any Love-Intrigues upon the <note place="margin">p. 242. 244.</note> Stage.</p>
            <p>This is very significant expostulation: and contains very good Rules for the Trial of the <hi>Muses:</hi> But if the English <hi>Stage,</hi> should be obliged to this Test; <hi>Aristophanes</hi> must set fire to it, and that with much more reason than to <hi>Socrates</hi> his <hi>School.</hi> Now that <hi>Aeschylus</hi> spoke <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi>'s Sense is pretty plain: For first; As to the Business of Love, <hi>Aristophanes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56421:34"/>
declines it; He never patches up a <hi>Play</hi> with <hi>Courtship,</hi> and <hi>Whining,</hi> tho' he wrote nothing but <hi>Comedy.</hi> In the next place the <hi>Chorus</hi> which is usually the <hi>Poets</hi> Interpreter, speaks honourably of <hi>Aes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chylus</hi> even to a Preference; And at last <note place="margin">255. 267.</note> Judge <hi>Bacchus</hi> gives Sentence for him.</p>
            <p>Thus we see <hi>Aristophanes</hi> Confutes his own Lewdness, and comes in Evidence against himself. This with the other two Exceptions I have made good against him, are sufficient to take off the Force of the <hi>Precedent,</hi> and make him an insignificant Authority.</p>
            <p>To what I have observ'd from the <hi>Stage</hi> of the Antients, I could add the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and <hi>Quintilian,</hi> both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Persons, but I shall reserve their Testimony till Afterwards.</p>
            <p>To come Home, and near our own Times: The English Theatre from Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us something not inconsiderable to our purpose.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Shakespear,</hi> he is too guilty to make an Evidence: But I think he gains not much by his Misbehaviour; He has commonly <hi>Plautus</hi>'s <hi>Fate,</hi> where there is most Smut, there is least Sense.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ben. Johnson</hi> is much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in his <hi>Plays,</hi> and declares plainly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56421:34"/>
for Modesty in his <hi>Discoveries,</hi> some of his Words are these.</p>
            <p>A just Writer whom he calls a <hi>True Artificer,</hi> will avoid <hi>Obscene</hi> and <hi>Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Phrase. Where Manners and Fashions</hi>

               <note place="margin">p. 701.</note> 
               <hi>of a sick Mind.</hi> A little after he returns to the Argument, and applies his Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more particularly to the Stage. <hi>Poetry,</hi> (says he) <hi>and Picture, both behold Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and profit, as their common Object, but should abstain from all base Pleasures, least they should wholly Err from their End; And while they seek to better Men's Minds, Destroy their Manners, Insolent and obscene Speeches, and Jests upon the best Men, are most likely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Laughter. But this is truly leaping from the Stage to the Tumbrill again, reducing all Wit to the Original Dung-Cart.</hi> More might <note place="margin">p. 706. 717.</note> be cited to this purpose, but that may serve for an other Occasion: In the mean time I shall go on to <hi>Beaumont</hi> and <hi>Fletch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fletchers Faithfull Shepheardess</hi> is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably Moral, and a sort of Exhortation to Chastity. This <hi>Play</hi> met with ill Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, 'twas Hiss'd before half <hi>Acted,</hi> and seems to have suffer'd on the account of its Innocence. Soon after <hi>Ben. Johnson</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Beauments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Works.</note>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:56421:35"/>
and <hi>Beaumont</hi> appear justifying the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in a Copy of Verses. And as <hi>Beaumont</hi> commends Modesty in <hi>Fletcher,</hi> so he is commended himself by Mr. <hi>Earl</hi> for the <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> same Quality.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Such Passions, Such Expressions meet my Eye,</l>
               <l>Such Wit untainted with Obscenity.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And as I remember <hi>Jasper Main</hi> has some stroaks to the same purpose. <hi>Fletcher</hi> is <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> still more full for the Cause. Indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more express. He delivers himself by way of <hi>Prologue;</hi> where the <hi>Poet</hi> speaks in his own Person. The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> to the <hi>Woman-Hater,</hi> very frankly lets the Audience know what they are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. <hi>If there be any amongst you, (says he) that come to hear Lascivious Scenes, let them depart; For I do pronounce this, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter discomfort of all two-penny Gallery Men, you shall no Bawdry in it.</hi> We find in those days Smut was the expectation of a Coarse Palate, and relish'd by none but two-penny Customers. In the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Burning Pestle,</hi> part of the <hi>Prologue</hi> runs thus. <hi>They were banish'd the Theatre at</hi> Athens, <hi>and from</hi> Rome <hi>hiss'd, that brought Parasites on the Stage with Apish Actions, or Fools with uncivil Habits, or Courtezans with immodest words.</hi> Afterwards <hi>Prologue,</hi> who represents a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, gives us more to the same purpose.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:56421:35"/>
——Fly far from hence</l>
               <l>All private taxes, immodest phrases,</l>
               <l>Whatever may but look like Vitious.</l>
               <l>For wicked mirth, never true Pleasure brings;</l>
               <l>For honest Minds, are pleas'd with honest things.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I have quoted nothing but Comedy in this Author. The <hi>Coronation</hi> is another. And the <hi>Prologue</hi> tells you there is</p>
            <lg>
               <l>No Undermirth such as does lard the Scene,</l>
               <l>For Coarse Delight, the Language here is clean,</l>
               <l>And confident our Poet bad me say,</l>
               <l>He'll bate you but the Folly of a Play.</l>
               <l>For which altho' dull Souls his Pen despise;</l>
               <l>Who think it yet too early to be wise.</l>
               <l>The Nobles yet will thank his Muse, at least</l>
               <l>Excuse him, cause his Thought aim'd at the Best.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Thus these <hi>Poets</hi> are in their Judgments clearly ours. 'Tis true their Hand was not always steady. But thus much may be aver'd, that <hi>Fletcher's</hi> later <hi>Plays</hi> are the most inoffensive. This is either a sign of the <hi>Poets</hi> Reformation; or that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable Passages belong'd to <hi>Beaumont,</hi> who dyed first.</p>
            <p>To these Authorities of our own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I shall add a considerable Testimony out of Mr. <hi>Corneille.</hi> This Author was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56421:36"/>
sensible that tho' the Expression of his <note place="margin">Theodore. Ed. Roven. Ep. Ded.</note> 
               <hi>Theodore</hi> was altogether unsmutty, <q>Yet the bare Idea of Prostitution uneffected, shock'd the Audience, and made the Play miscarry. The <hi>Poet</hi> protests he took great care to alter the natural Complexion of the Image, and to convey it decently to the Fancy; and deliver'd only some part of the History as inoffensively as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. And after all his Screening and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, the Modesty of the Audience would not endure that little, the Subject forced him upon. He is positive 'the Comedies St. <hi>Augustine</hi> declaim'd against, were not such as the <hi>French.</hi> For theirs are not spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles of Turpitude, as that Father justly calls those of his Time. The <hi>French</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally speaking, containing nothing but examples of Innocence, Piety and Vertue.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this Citation we have the Opinion of the <hi>Poet,</hi> the Practise of the <hi>French</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, and the Sense of that <hi>Nation,</hi> and all very full to our purpose.</p>
            <p>To conclude this <hi>Chapter.</hi> By what has been offer'd, it appears that the <hi>Present English Stage</hi> is superlatively Scandalous. It exceeds the Liberties of all Times and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: It has not so much as the poor plea of a <hi>Precedent,</hi> to which most other ill Things may claim a pretence. 'Tis most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meer Discovery and Invention: A new
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56421:36"/>
World of Vice found out, and planted with all the Industry imaginable. <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> himself, how bad soever in other respects, does not amplyfie, and flourish, and run through all the Topicks of Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness like these Men. The <hi>Miscellany Poems</hi> are likewise horribly Licentious. They are sometimes Collections from Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and osten, the worst parts of the worst <hi>Poets.</hi> And to mend the Matter, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Translation,</hi> is more nauseous than the <hi>Pagan</hi> Original. Such stuff I believe was never seen, and suffer'd before. In a word, If Poverty and Diseases, the Dishonour of Families, and the Debauching of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, are such valuable Advantages, then I confess these Books deserve encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But if the Case is otherwise, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive the Proceeding should be so too.</p>

            <p>What is more frequent then their wishes of Hell, and Confusion, Devils and Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, all the Plagues of this World, and the next, to each other? And as for Swearing; 'tis used by all Persons, and upon all Occasions: By Heroes, and Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troons; by Gentlemen, and Clowns: Love, and Quarrels, Success, and Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Temper, and Passion, must be var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, and set off with <hi>Oaths.</hi> At some times, and with some <hi>Poets</hi> Swearing is no ordinary Relief. It stands up in the room of Sense, gives Spirit to a flat Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, and makes a Period Musical and Round. In short, 'tis almost all the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56421:37"/>
and Reason some People are Masters of: The manner of performance is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Some times they mince the matter; change the Letter, and keep the Sense, as if they had a mind to steal <note place="margin">Gad for God.</note> a Swearing, and break the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without Sin. At another time the Oaths are clipt, but not so much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Ring, but that the <hi>Image and Superscription</hi> are visible. These expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, I conceive are more for variety, then Conscience: For when the fit comes on them, they make no difficulty of Swearing at Length. Instances of all these kinds may be met with in the <hi>Old Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Double Dealer,</hi> and <hi>Love for Love.</hi> And to mention no more, <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> the <hi>Provok'd Wife,</hi> and the <hi>Relapse,</hi> are particularly rampant and scandalous. The <hi>English Stage</hi> exceed their predecessors in this, as well as other Branches of immorality. <hi>Shakespear</hi> is comparatively sober, <hi>Ben Jonson</hi> is still more regular; And as for <hi>Beaument</hi> and <hi>Fletcher,</hi> In their <hi>Plays</hi> they are commonly Profligate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that Swear, and even those are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd for't. Besides, the Oaths are not so full of Hell and Defiance, as in the Moderns.</p>
            <p>So much for matter of Fact: And as for point of Law, I hope there needs not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56421:38"/>
many words to prove Swearing a Sin: For what is more provoking than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and what Sin more contemptuous than common Swearing? what can be more Insolent and Irreligious, than to bring in God to attest our Trifles, to give Security for our Follies, and to make part of our Diversion? To Play with Majesty and Omnipotence in this manner, is to render it cheap and despicable. How can such Customes as these consist with the belief of Providence or Revelation? The <hi>Poets</hi> are of all People most to blame. They want even the Plea of <hi>Bullies</hi> and <hi>Shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</hi> There's no Rencounters, no starts of Passion, no suddain Accidents to discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them. They swear in Solitude and cool Blood, under Thought and Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for Business, and for Exercise: This is a terrible Circumstance; It makes all <hi>Malice Prepence,</hi> and enflames the Guilt, and the Reckoning.</p>
            <p>And if Religion signifies nothing, (as I am afraid it does with some People) there is Law, as well as Gospel against <hi>Swearing.</hi> 3<hi>d, Jac.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 21. is expresly against the <hi>Playhouse.</hi> It runs thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FOR the preventing and avoiding of the great abuse of the holy Name of God, in Stage Plays, Enterludes</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Be it enacted by out vereign Lord</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That if at any time, or times,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:56421:38"/>
               <hi>after the End of this present Session of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament; any Person or Persons do, or shall, in any Stage Play, Enterlude, Shew</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ieastingly or Profanly, speak or use the Holy Name of God, or of Christ</hi> Jesus, <hi>or of the Holy Ghost, or of the Trinity, which are not to be spoken, but with Fear and Reverence; shall forfeit for every such offence, by him or them committed, ten pounds: The one Mosty thereof to the King's Majesty, his heirs; and Successors, the other Mosty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to him, or them, that will sue for the same in any Court of Record at Westminster, wherein no essoin, protection, or wager of Law shall be allow'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this <hi>Act</hi> not only direct Swearing, but all vain Invocation of the Name of God is forbidden. This <hi>Statute</hi> well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted would mend the <hi>Poets,</hi> or sweep the <hi>Box:</hi> And the <hi>Stage</hi> must either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, or not thrive upon Profaness.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly</hi> Swearing in the <hi>Playhouse</hi> is an ungentlemanly, as well as an unchristian Practice. The <hi>Ladies</hi> make a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of the <hi>Audience.</hi> Now Swearing before Women is reckon'd a Breach of good Behaviour, and therefore a civil Atheist will forbear it. The custom seems to go upon this Presumption; that the Impressions of Religion are strongest in Women, and more generally spread. And that it must be very disagreeable to them, to hear the Majesty of God treated with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56421:39"/>
so little respect. Besides: Oaths are a boistrous and tempestiuous sort of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; Generally the effects of Passion, and spoken with Noise, and Heat. Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looks like the beginning of a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, to which Women have an aversion: As being neither armed by Nature, nor disciplin'd by Custome for such rough Disputes.

But to some Peoplean Atheistical Rant is as good as a Flourish of Trumpets. To proceed. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio</hi> tho' a profess'd Christian, mends the matter very little.

            <p>Very Solemnly and Religiously express'd! <hi>Lucian</hi> and <hi>Celsus</hi> could not have ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Resurrection better! Certainly the Poet never expects to be there. Such a light Turn would have agreed much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a Man who was in the Dark, and was feeling for his Stockings. But let those who talk of <hi>Fumbling</hi> for their Limbs, take care they don't find them too fast. In the Fourth <hi>Act Mustapha</hi> dates his <hi>Exaltation to Tumult, from the second Night of the Month</hi> Abib. Thus you have <note place="margin">Id. p. 83. Exod, 12, 13.</note> the Holy Text abused by Captain <hi>Tom;</hi> And the Bible torn by the Rabble! The Design of this Liberty I can't understand, unless it be to make <hi>Mustapha</hi> as consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as <hi>Moses;</hi> and the prevalence of a Tumult, as much a Miracle as the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> We have heard this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hitherto in his <hi>Characters,</hi> let us hear him now in his own Person. In his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> of <hi>Aurenge Zebe</hi> he is so hardy as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56421:42"/>
to affirm that <hi>he who is too lightly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled after high Provocation, may Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himself to the World for a Christian, but I should hardly trust him for a Friend.</hi> And why is a Christian not fit to make a Friend of? Are the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity defective, and the Laws of it Ill contriv'd? Are the Interests and Capacities of Mankind overlook'd? Did our Great Master bind us to Disadvantage, and make our Duty our Misfortune? And did he grudge us all the Pleasures and Securities of Friendship? Are not all these horrid Suppositions? Are they not a flat Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the <hi>Bible,</hi> and a Satyr on the Attributes of the Deity? Our Saviour tells us we must <hi>forgive until Seventy times Seven;</hi> That is, we must never be tired out of Clemency and Good Nature. He has taught us to pray for the Forgiveness of our own Sins, only upon the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of forgiving others. Here is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception upon the Repetition of the Fault, or the Quality of the Provocation. Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> to do him right, do's not dispute the Precept. He confesses this is the way to be a Christian: But for all that he <hi>should hardly trust him for a Friend.</hi> And why so? Because the Italian Proverb says, <hi>He</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>that forgives the second time is a Fool.</hi> This Lewd Proverb comes in for Authority,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56421:43"/>
and is a piece of very pertinent Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my! Thus in some Peoples <hi>Logick</hi> one proof from Atheisin, is worth Ten from the <hi>New Testament.</hi> But here the <hi>Poet</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues no better than he Believes. For most certainly, a Christian of all others is best qualifyed for Friendship. For He that loves his Neighbour as himself, and carries Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence and Good Nature beyond the Heights of Philosophy: He that is not govern'd by Vanity, or Design; He that prefers his Conscience to his Life, and has Courage to Maintain his Reason; He that is thus qualified must be a good Friend; And he that falls short, is no good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. And since the <hi>Poet</hi> is pleas'd to find fault with Christianity, let us examine his own Scheme. <hi>Our Minds (says he) are perpetually wrought on by the Temperament of our Bodies, which makes me suspect they are nearer Allyed than either our Philosophers, or School Divines will allow them to be.</hi> The <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> meaning is, he suspects our Souls are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Organiz'd Matter. Or in plain English, our <hi>Souls</hi> are nothing but our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And then when the Body dies you may guess what becomes of them! Thus the Authorities of Religion are weaken'd, and the prospect of the other World almost shut up. And is this a likely Supposition for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and good Nature? Do's Honour
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56421:43"/>
use to rise upon the Ruines of Conscience? And are People the best Friends where they have the least Reason to be so? But not only the Inclinations to Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship must Languish upon this Scheme, but the very Powers of it are as it were destroy'd. By this Systeme no Man can say his Soul is his own. He can't be assured the same Colours of Reason and Desire will last. Any little Accident from <hi>without</hi> may metamorphose his Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and push him upon a new set of Thoughts. <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion</hi> are the most Humorsom Capricious Things in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and withall, the most Arbitrary and uncontroll'd. And can Constancy proceed from Chance, Choice from Fate, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from Necessity? In short a Man at this rate must be a Friend or an Enemy in spite of his Teeth, and just as long as the <hi>Atoms</hi> please and no longer. Every Change in <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Impulse,</hi> must alter the Idea, and wear off the former Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. So that by these Principles, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship will depend on the <hi>Seasons,</hi> and we must look in the <hi>Weather Glass</hi> for our Inclinations. But this 'tis to Refine upon Revelation, and grow wiser than Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! The same Author in his Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Juvenal</hi> and <hi>Persius,</hi> has these words: <hi>My Lord, I am come to the last Petition of</hi>

'Tis in effect to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute the Holy Rhetorick, and send the <hi>Bible</hi> to the <hi>Brothell!</hi> I can hardly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin why these Tombs of Antiquity were raked in, and disturb'd?

Indeed <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal</hi> has a very untoward way with him in some of his Satyrs. His Pen has such a Libertine stroak that 'tis a Question whether the Practise, or the Reproof, the Age, or the Author, were the more Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. He teaches those Vices he would
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56421:44"/>
correct, and writes more like a Pimp, than a <hi>Poet.</hi> And truly I think there is but little of Lewdness lost in the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation.</hi> The Sixth and Eleventh <hi>Satyrs</hi> are Particularly remarkable. Such nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seous stuff is almost enough to debauch the <hi>Alphabet,</hi> and make the Language scandalous. One would almost be sorry for the privilege of <hi>Speech,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of <hi>Letters,</hi> to see them thus wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedly abused. And since the Business must be undertaken, why was not the Thought Blanched, the Expression made remote, and the ill Features cast into shadows? I'm mistaken if we have not Lewdness enough of our own Growth, without Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting from our Neighbours. No. This can't be. An Author must have Right done him and be shown in his own shape, and Complexion. Yes by all means! Vice must be disrobed, and People poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd, and all for the sake of Justice! To do Right to such an Author is to burn him. I hope Modesty is much better than Resemblance. The Imitation of an ill Thing is the worse for being exact: And sometimes to report a Fault is to repeat it.</p>

This Officer we must understand was left upon a Solitary Island, ill used by his Friends, and harrass'd with Poverty and Ulcers, for Ten years together.

            <p>Upon the whole; The <hi>Plays</hi> of <hi>Aeschy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and <hi>Sophocles</hi> are formed upon Models of Virtue: They joyn Innocence with

            <p>In <hi>Euripides</hi>'s <hi>Bacchae, Pentheus</hi> is pull'd in pieces for using <hi>Bacchus</hi> with Disrespect.

Torture, and hard Usage. But the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Stage</hi> are unprovok'd in their Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Blaspheme for their Pleasure. But supposing the <hi>Theatres</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> as bad as possible, what Defence is all This? Can we argue from <hi>Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism</hi> to <hi>Christianity?</hi> How can the <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise</hi> be the same, where the <hi>Rule</hi> is so very different? Have we not a clearer Light to direct us, and greater Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make us afraid. Is there no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between Truth and Fiction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Majesty and a Pageant? Must God be treated like an Idol, and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> banter'd like <hi>Homers Elysium,</hi> and <hi>Hesiods Theogonia?</hi> Are these the Returns we make Him for his Supernatural Assistance? For the more perfect Discovery of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, the stooping of his Greatness, and the Wonders of his Love. Can't we refuse the Happiness without affronting the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer? Must we add Contempt to Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Out-rage to Ingratitude? Is there no Diversion without Insulting the God that made us, the Goodness that would save us, and the Power that can damn us? Let us not flatter our selves, <hi>Words</hi> won't go for Nothing. Profaness is a most Provoking Contempt, and a Crime of the deepest dye. To break through the Laws of a Kingdom is bad
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56421:57"/>
enough; But to make <hi>Ballads</hi> upon the <hi>Statute-Book,</hi> and a Jest of Authority, is much worse. Atheists may fancy what they please, but God will <hi>Arise and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his own Cause,</hi> and Vindicate his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in due time.</p>
            <p>To conclude. Profaness tho' never so well corrected is not to be endured. It ought to be Banish'd without <hi>Proviso,</hi> or Limitation. No pretence of <hi>Character</hi> or Punishment, can excuse it; or any <hi>Stage-Discipline</hi> make it tolerable. 'Tis grating to <hi>Christian</hi> Ears, dishonourable to the Majesty of God, and dangerous in the Example. And in a Word, It tends to no point, unless it be to wear off the horrour of the Practise, to weaken the force of Conscience, and teach the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Damn'd.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The Clergy abused by the <hi>Stage.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Satyr of the <hi>Stage</hi> upon the <hi>Clergy</hi> is extreamly Particular. In other cases, They level at a single Mark, and confine themselves to Persons. But here their Buffoonry takes an unusual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass; They shoot Chain'd-shot, and strike at Universals. They play upon the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi> and endeavour to expose not only the Men, but the Business. 'Tis true, the Clergy are no small Rub in the <hi>Poets</hi> way. 'Tis by their Ministrations that Religion is perpetuated, the other World Refresh'd, and the Interest of Virtue kept up. Vice will never have an unlimited Range, nor Conscience be totally subdued, as long as People are so easy as to be Priest-ridden! As long as these Men are look'd on as the Messengers of Heaven, and the Supports of Government, and enjoy their old Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in Credit and Authority; as long as this Grievance continues, the <hi>Stage</hi> must decline of Course, and Atheism give Ground, and Lewdness lie under Censure,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56421:58"/>
and Discouragment. Therefore that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty may not be embarrass'd, nor Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples make Head against Pleasure, the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> must be attack'd, and rendred Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
            <p>To represent a Person fairly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out disservice to his Reputation, two Things are to be observ'd. First He must not be ill used by others: Nor Secondly be made to Play the Fool Himself. This latter way of Abuse is rather the worst, because here a Man is a sort of <hi>Felo de se;</hi> and appears Ridiculous by his own fault. The Contradiction of both these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods is practised by the <hi>Stage.</hi> To make sure work on't, they leave no stone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, The whole <hi>Common place</hi> of Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is run through. They strain their Invention and their Malice: And over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look nothing in ill Nature, or ill Manners, to gain their point.</p>
            <p>To give some Instances of their Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! In the <hi>Spanish Fryer, Dominick</hi> is made a Pimp for <hi>Lorenzo;</hi> He is call'd <hi>a parcel of Holy Guts and Garbage,</hi> and said <hi>to</hi>

               <hi>Dominick</hi> has a great many of these Compliments bestow'd upon him. And to make the Railing more effectual, you have a general stroke or two upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. Would you know what are the

He Preaches against Sin, why? Because he gets by't: He holds his Tongue; why? because so much more is bidden for his Silence. 'Tis but giving a Man his Price, and Principles of <hi>Church</hi> are bought off as easily as they are in <hi>State:</hi> No man will be a Rogue for nothing; but Compensation must be made, so much Gold for so much Honesty; and then a Church-man will break the Rules of Chess.

            </p>
            <p>At last <hi>Dominick</hi> is discover'd to the Company, makes a dishonourable <hi>Exit,</hi> and is push'd off the <hi>Stage</hi> by the Rabble. This is great Justice!

            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Aegeon</hi> brought the News of King <hi>Polybus</hi>'s Death, <hi>Oedipus</hi> was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully surpriz'd at the Relation.</p>
            <l>O all ye Powers is't possible? what, Dead! <note place="margin">p. 48.</note>
            </l>
            <p>And why not? was the Man invulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable or immortal? Nothing of that: He was only Fourscore and Ten years old, that was his main security. And if you will believe the Poet he</p>
            <l>Fell like Autumn Fruit that mellow'd long,</l>
            <l>Ev'n wondred at because he dropt no sooner. <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
            </l>
            <p>And which is more, <hi>Oedipus</hi> must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Age, having spent the greatest part of his time with him at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> So that in short, the pith of the Story lies in this Circumstance. A Prince of Ninety years was dead, and one who was wondred at for dying no sooner. And now why so much Exclamation upon this occasion? Why must all the <hi>Powers</hi> in Being be Summon'd in to make the News
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56421:62"/>
Credible? This <hi>Posse</hi> of <hi>Interjections</hi> would have been more seasonably raised if the Man had been alive; for that by the Poets Confession had been much the stranger Thing. However <hi>Oedipus</hi> is almost out of his Wits about the Matter, and is Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent for an account of Particulars.</p>
            <l>That so the Tempest of my joys may rise</l>
            <l>By just degrees, and hit at last the Stars. <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
            </l>
            <p>This is an empty ill proportion'd Rant, and without warrant in Nature or Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. <hi>Sophocles</hi> does not represent <hi>Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> in such Raptures of Extravagant sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.

            </p>
            <p>These <hi>Poets</hi> I observe when They grow lazy, and are inclined to Nonsence, they commonly get a Clergy-man to speak it.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56421:64"/>
Thus they pass their own Dulness for Humour, and gratifie their Ease, and their Malice at once. <hi>Coupler</hi> instructs <hi>Young Fashion</hi> which way <hi>Bull</hi> was to be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

            </p>
            <p>A few Lines forward, the Rudeness is still more gross, and dash'd with Smut, the common <hi>Play-house</hi> Ingredient. 'Tis not long before <hi>Coupler</hi> falls into his old Civilities. He tells <hi>Young Fashion, Last Night the Devil run away with the Parson of</hi> Fatgoose <hi>Living.</hi> Afterwards <hi>Bull</hi> is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully <note place="margin">p. 94.</note> rail'd on in down right <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings-gate:</hi> made to appear Silly, Servile, and Profane; and treated both in Posture and Language, with the utmost Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. <note place="margin">p. 95, 97. 105.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I could cite more <hi>Plays</hi> to this purpose; But these are sufficient to show the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>Stage,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see how hearty these People are in their Ill Will! How they attack Religion under every Form, and pursue the Priesthood through all the Subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Opinion. Neither <hi>Jews</hi> nor <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Turks</hi> nor <hi>Christians, Rome</hi> nor <hi>Geneva, Church</hi> nor <hi>Conventicle,</hi> can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56421:64"/>
them. They are afraid least Virtue should have any Quarters undisturbed, Conscience any Corner to retire to, or God be Worship'd in any Place. 'Tis true their Force seldom carries up to their Malice: They are too eager in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat to be happy in the Execution. The Abuse is often both gross and clumsey, and the Wit as wretched as the Manners. Nay Talking won't always satisfy them. They must ridicule the <hi>Habit</hi> as well as the Function, of the Clergy. 'Tis not enough for them to play the Fool unless they do it in <hi>Pontificalibus.</hi> The Farce must be play'd in a Religious Figure, and under the Distinctions of their Office! Thus the Abuse strikes stronger upon the sense; The contempt is better spread, and the little <hi>Idea</hi> is apt to return upon the same Appearance.</p>
            <p>And now does this Rudeness go upon any Authorities? Was the Priesthood alwaies thought thus insignificant, and do the Antient Poets palt it in this Manner? This Point shall be tried, I shall run through the most considerable Authors that the Reader may see how they treat the Argument. <hi>Homer</hi> stands highest upon the Roll, and is the first Poet both in Time, and Quality; I shall therefore begin with him. Tis true he wrote no

            <p>These are all the <hi>Priests</hi> I find Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>Homer;</hi> And we see how fairly the Poet treats them, and what sort of Figure they made in the World.</p>
            <p>To the Testimony of <hi>Homer,</hi> I shall joyn that of <hi>Virgil,</hi> who tho' He follows at a great distance of Time, was an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the first Rank, and wrote the same kind of Poetry with the other. Now <hi>Virgil</hi> tho' he is very extraordinary in his Genius, in the Compass of his Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in the Musick and Majesty of his Stile; yet the exactness of his Judgment seems to be his peculiar, and most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing Talent. He had the truest
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56421:66"/>
Relish imaginable, and always described Things according to <hi>Nature, Custom,</hi> and <hi>Decency.</hi> He wrote with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Command of <hi>Temper,</hi> and <hi>Superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of good <hi>Sense.</hi> He is never lost in smoak and Rapture, nor overborn with Poetick Fury; but keeps his Fancy warm and his Reason Cool at the same time. Now this great Master of Propriety never Mentions any <hi>Priests</hi> without some <hi>Marks</hi> of <hi>Advantage.</hi> To give some Instances as they lie in Order.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Trojans</hi> were consulting what was to be done with the <hi>Wooden-Horse,</hi> and some were for lodging it within the Walls; <hi>Laocoon</hi> appears against this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion at the Head of a numerous Party, harangues with a great deal of Sense, and Resolution, and examines the <hi>Machine</hi> with his Lance.

In short; He is all Gold, Purple, Scarlet, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydery; and as rich as Nature, Art, and <note place="margin">Aeneid. 11.</note> Rhetorick can make him.

            <p>Thus we see the admired <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> always treat the <hi>Priests</hi> fairly, and describe them in Circumstances of Credit: If 'tis said that the Instances I have given are mostly in Names of <hi>Fiction,</hi> and in Persons who had no Being, unless in the Poets fancy. I answer, I am not concern'd in the History of the Relation. Whether the Muster is true or false, 'tis all one to my purpose. This is certain, had the <hi>Priests</hi> been People of such slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Consideration as our <hi>Stage Poets</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make them; they must have
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56421:68"/>
appear'd in a different Figure; or rather have been left out as too little for that sort of <hi>Poem.</hi> But <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> had other Sentiments of Matters: They were govern'd by the Reason of Things, and the common usage of the World. They knew the <hi>Priesthood</hi> a very reputable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and always esteem'd as such. To have used the <hi>Priests</hi> ill, They must have call'd their own Discretion in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: They must have run into impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and fallen soul upon Custom, Manners, and Religion. Now 'twas not their way to play the Knave and the Fool together: They had more Sense than to do a silly Thing, only for the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of doing an ill one.</p>
            <p>I shall now go on to enquire what the Greek <hi>Tragedians</hi> will afford us upon the present Subject. There are but two <hi>Plays</hi> in <hi>Aeschylus</hi> where the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gods are represented. The one is in his <hi>Eumenides,</hi> and here <hi>Apollo</hi>'s <hi>Priestess</hi> only opens the <hi>Play,</hi> and appears no more. The other is in his <hi>Seige</hi> of <hi>Thebes.</hi> In this Tragedy the <hi>Prophet Amphiaraus</hi> is one of the Seven Commanders against the <hi>Town.</hi> He has the Character of a Modest, Brave Officer, and of one who rather affected to be great in Action, than Noise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:56421:69"/>
In <hi>Sophocle</hi>'s <hi>Oedipus Tyrannus. Jupiter</hi>'s <hi>Priest</hi> has a short part. He appears at the Head of an <hi>Address,</hi> and delivers the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue by the King's Order. <hi>Oedipus</hi> in his Passion treats <hi>Tiresias</hi> ruggedly; <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resias</hi>

            <p>To go on to <hi>Euripides,</hi> for <hi>Sophocles</hi> has nothing more.

And now a word or two of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The famous <hi>Corneille</hi> and <hi>Moliere,</hi> bring no <hi>Priests</hi> of any kind upon the <hi>Stage.</hi> The former leaves out <hi>Tiresias</hi> in his <hi>Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus:</hi> Tho' this Omission balks his Thought, and maims the <hi>Fable.</hi> What therefore but the regard to Religion could keep him from the use of this Liberty? As I am inform'd the same Reservedness is practis'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy:</hi> And that there is no Theatre in <hi>Europe</hi> excepting the <hi>English,</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains the <hi>Audience</hi> with <hi>Priests.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is certainly the right method, and best secures the Outworks of Piety. The Holy Function is much too Solemn to be play'd with. Christianity is for no Fooling, neither the <hi>Place,</hi> the <hi>Occasion</hi> nor the <hi>Actors</hi> are fit for such a Representation. To bring the <hi>Church</hi> into the <hi>Playhouse,</hi> is the way to bring the <hi>Playhouse</hi> into the <hi>Church.</hi> 'Tis apt to turn Religion into <hi>Romance;</hi> and make unthinking People conclude that all Serious Matters are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Farce, Fiction,</hi> and <hi>Design.</hi> 'Tis true the <hi>Tragedies</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> were a sort of <hi>Homilies,</hi> and design'd for the Instruction of the People.

case standing thus 'tis less suprizing to find the <hi>Priests</hi> sometimes Appear. The Play had grave Argument, and Pagan In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, to plead in its behalf. But our <hi>Poets</hi> steer by an other <hi>Compass.</hi> Their Aim is to <hi>destroy</hi> Religion, their <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is against <hi>Sermons;</hi> and their Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but Diversion at the best. In short, Let the Character be never so well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged no Christian <hi>Priest</hi> (especially,) ought to come upon the <hi>Stage.</hi> For where the Business is an Abuse, and the place a Profanation; the demureness of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is but a poor excuse. Monsieur <hi>Racine</hi> is an Exception to what I have observ'd in <hi>France.</hi> In his <hi>Athalia, Joida</hi> the <hi>High-Priest</hi> has a large part. But then the Poet does him Justice in his Station; he makes him Honest and Brave, and gives him a shining Character throughout. <hi>Mathan</hi> is another <hi>Priest</hi> in the same Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy. He turns Renegado, and revolts from God to <hi>Baal.</hi> He is a very ill Man but makes a considerable Appearance, and is one of the Top of <hi>Athaliahs</hi> Faction. And as for the <hi>Blemishes</hi> of his Life, they all stick upon his own Honour, and reach no farther than his Person: In fine the <hi>Play</hi> is a very Religious Poem; 'Tis upon the Matter all <hi>Sermon</hi> and <hi>Anthem.</hi> And if it were not designed for the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre,</hi> I have nothing to object.</p>

Let us now just look over our own Country-men till King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second. <hi>Shakespear</hi> takes the Freedom to represent the <hi>Clergy</hi> in several of his <hi>Plays:</hi> But for the most part he holds up the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and makes them neither Act, nor Suffer any thing unhandsom.

I grant in <hi>Loves Labour lost</hi> the <hi>Curate</hi> plays the Fool egregiously; And so does the <hi>Poet</hi> too, for the whole <hi>Play</hi> is a very silly one. In the History of Sr. <hi>John Old-Castle,</hi> Sr. <hi>John, Parson</hi> of <hi>Wrotham</hi> Swears, Games, Wenches, Pads, Tilts, and Drinks: This is extreamly bad, and like the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Relapse</hi> &amp;c. Only with this difference; <hi>Shakespears</hi> Sr. <hi>John</hi> has some Advantage in his Character. He appears Loyal, and Stout; He brings in Sr. <hi>John Acton,</hi> and other Rebels Prisoners. He is rewarded by the King, and the Judge uses him Civilly and with Respect. In short He is represented Lewd, but not Little; And the Disgrace falls rather on the Person, then the Office.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56421:72"/>
despicable: So that upon the whole, <hi>Shakespear</hi> is by much the gentiler E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
            <p>Towards the End of the <hi>Silent Woman, Ben Johnson</hi> brings in a <hi>Clergy-man,</hi> and a <hi>Civilian</hi> in their <hi>Habits.</hi> But then he premises a handsom Excuse, acquaints the <hi>Audience,</hi> that the <hi>Persons</hi> are but borrow'd, and throws in a <hi>Salvo</hi> for the Honour of either profession.

            </p>
            <p>Thus we see the English <hi>Stage</hi> has always been out of Order, but never to the Degree 'tis at present.</p>
            <p>I shall now take Leave of the <hi>Poets,</hi> and touch a little upon History and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And here I shall briefly shew the Right the <hi>Clergy</hi> have to Regard, and fair Usage, upon these Three following Accounts.
<list>
                  <item>I. Because of their Relation to the Deity.</item>
                  <item>II. Because of the Importance of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</item>
                  <item>III. They have prescription for their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege. Their Function has been in Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Esteem in all Ages, and Countries.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Vpon the account of their Relation to the Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Holy <hi>Order</hi> is appropriated to the Divine Worship: And a <hi>Priest</hi> has the peculiar Honour to <hi>Belong</hi> to nothing less then God Almighty. Now the Credit of the <hi>Service</hi> always rises in proportion to the Quality and Greatness of the Master. And for this Reason 'tis more Honourable to serve a Prince, than a private Person. To apply this. Christian <hi>Priests</hi> are the Principal Ministers of Gods Kingdom.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56421:73"/>
They Represent his Person, Publish his Laws, Pass his Pardons, and Preside in his Worship. To expose a <hi>Priest</hi> much more to burlesque his Function, is an Affront to the Diety. All indignities done to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, are interpreted upon their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and reveng'd as such. To outrage the <hi>Ministers</hi> of Religion, is in effect to deny the Being, or Providence of God; And to treat the <hi>Bible</hi> like a <hi>Romance.</hi> As much as to say the Stories of an other World are nothing but a little <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,</hi> and therefore I am resolv'd to Lash the Profession. But to droll upon the Institutions of God; To make his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters cheap, and his Authority contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; To do this is little less than open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyance. Tis a sort of Challenge to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Vengeance, to exert his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence; and do Right to his Honour. If the Profession of a Courtier was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fashionable, a Princes Commission thought a Scandal, and the <hi>Magistracy</hi> laught at for their Business; the Monarch had need look to himself in time; He may conclude his Person is despis'd, his Authority but a Jest, and the People ready either to change their Master, or set up for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Government and Religion, no less than <hi>Trade</hi> Subsist upon Reputation. 'Tis true God can't be Deposed, neither does
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56421:73"/>
his Happiness depend upon Homage. But since he does not Govern by Omnipotence, since he leaves Men to their Liberty, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment must sink, and Obedience decline, in proportion to the Lessenings of Authority. How provoking an Indignity of this kind must be, is easy to imagine.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Functions and Authorities of Religion have a great Influence on <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</hi> The Interest of this Life lies very much in the Belief of another. So that if our Hopes were bounded with <hi>Sight,</hi> and <hi>Sense,</hi> if <hi>Eternity</hi> was out of the Case, General Advantage, and Publick Reason, and Secular Policy, would oblige us to be just to the <hi>Priesthood.</hi> For <hi>Priests,</hi> and Religion always stand and fall together; Now Religion is the Basis of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Man is a wretched Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without it. When Conscience takes its Leave, Good Faith, and Good Nature goes with it. <hi>Atheism</hi> is all Self, Mean and Mercenary. The <hi>Atheist</hi> has no <hi>Hereafter,</hi> and therefore will be sure to make the most of this World. Interest, and Pleasure, are the Gods he Worships, and to these he'll Sacrifice every Thing else.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Priest-hood</hi> ought to be fairly treated, because it has prescription for this Privilege. This is so evident a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56421:74"/>
Truth, that there is hardly any Age or Country, but affords sufficient Proof. A just Discourse upon this Subject would be a large Book, but I shall just skim it over and pass on. and</p>
            <p>I<hi>st.</hi> For the Jews. <hi>Josephus</hi> tells us the Line of <hi>Aaron</hi> made some of the best Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digrees, <note place="margin">De Bell. Judaic.</note> and that the <hi>Priests</hi> were reckon'd among the Principal Nobility.</p>
            <p>By the Old <hi>Testament</hi> we are inform'd that the <hi>High-Priest</hi> was the Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">Deut 17. 9. 10. 2 Chron. 19. 8.</note> in the Kingdom. The Body of that <hi>Order</hi> had Civil Jurisdiction. And the <hi>Priests</hi> continued Part of the Magistracy in the time of our Saviour. <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the <note place="margin">Math. 27. Act. 4. Vid seldon de Synedr.</note> 
               <hi>High-Priest</hi> was thought an Alliance big enough for the Royal Family. He Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Kings Daughter; His Interest and Authority was so great that he broke the Usurpation under <hi>Athalia;</hi> and was at the Head of the Restauration. And lastly the <note place="margin">2. Cbron. 22. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Assamonean</hi> Race were both Kings and Priests. <note place="margin">Joseph.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To Proceed. The <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Monarchy was one of the most antient and best po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd upon Record. Here Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the Improvment of Reason, and the Splendor of Life had its first Rise. Hither 'twas that <hi>Plato</hi> and most of the Celebrated Philosophers travel'd for their Learning. Now in this Kingdom the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56421:74"/>
               <hi>Priests</hi> made no vulgar Figure. These with the Military Men were the Body of the Nobility, and Gentry. Besides the Business of Religion, the <hi>Priests</hi> were the Publick <hi>Annalists</hi> and kept the Records of <hi>History,</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi> They were many of them bred in Courts, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Education of their Princes, and assisted at their Councils. When <hi>Joseph</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Diod. Sici</note> was Viceroy of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in all the height of his Pomp, and Power, the King Married him to the Daughter of <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherah Priest</hi> of <hi>On.</hi> The Text says <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 41.</note> 
               <hi>gave him her to Wife.</hi> This shows the Match was deliberate Choice, and Royal Favour, no stooping of Quality, or Condescensions of Love, on <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Side.</p>
            <p>To pass on. The <hi>Persian Magi,</hi> and the <hi>Druids,</hi> of <hi>Gaul</hi> were of a Religious Profession, and consign'd to the Service of the Gods. Now all these were at the upper End of the Government, and had a great share of Regard and Authority. <note place="margin">Porph. de Abstin. Lib. 4. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar de Bell. Gall. Lib. 6</note> The Body of the <hi>Indians</hi> as <hi>Diodorus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi> reports is divided into Seven parts. The first is the <hi>Clan</hi> of the <hi>Bramines,</hi> the <hi>Priests,</hi> and Philosophers of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. <q>This Division is the least in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but the first in Degree. Their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges are extraordinary. They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56421:75"/>
from Taxes, and Live Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Authority. They are called to the Sacrifices, and take care of Funerals; They are look'd on as the Favourites of the Gods, and thought skillful in the Doctrins of an other Life: And upon these accounts are largely consider'd in Presents, and Acknowledgment.</q> The <hi>Priestesses</hi> of <hi>Argos</hi> were so Considerable, that <hi>Time</hi> is dated from them, and they stand for a Reign in <hi>Chronology.</hi> The Brave <hi>Romans</hi> are commended by <hi>Polybius</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lib. 6.</note> for their Devotion to the Gods; Indeed they gave great Proof of their being in earnest; For when their Cheif Magistrates, their Consuls themselves, met any of the <hi>Vestals,</hi> they held down their <hi>Fasces,</hi> and stoop'd their <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Mace</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <note place="margin">Sen, in Controv.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Priest-hood</hi> was for sometime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to the <hi>Patrician</hi> Order, that is to the Upper Nobility. And afterwards the <hi>Emperours</hi> were generally <hi>High-Priests</hi> themselves. The Romans in distress en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to make Friends with <hi>Coriolanus</hi> whom they had banish'd before. To this purpose they furnish'd out several <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi> Embasayes. Now the Regulation of the Ceremony, and the Remarks of the Historian; plainly discover that the <hi>Body</hi>

to any other. One Testimony from <hi>Tully</hi> and I have done. 'Tis in his Harangue to the College of the <hi>Priests. Cum multa divinitus, Pontifices, a majoribus nostris in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venta atque instituta sunt; tum nihil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarius</hi>

Amongst the many laudable Instances of our Ancestors Prudence, and Capacity, I know nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contrived then their placing your Order at the Helm, and setting the same Persons at the Head both of Religion, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Thus we see what <hi>Rank</hi> the <hi>Priest-hood</hi> held among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and how Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taught the <hi>Heathen</hi> to regard it. And is it not now possess'd of as fair pretences as formerly? Is Christianity any disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Holy Office. And does the Dignity of a Religion lessen the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Administrations in't? The <hi>Priests of the most High God</hi> and of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> can't be compared without Injury. To argue for the Preference is a Reflection upon the <hi>Creed.</hi> 'Tis true the <hi>Jewish Priest-hood</hi> was instituted by God: But every Thing Divine is not of Equal Consideration. <hi>Realities</hi> are more valuable than <hi>Types;</hi> And as the Apostle argues, the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> is greater than that of <hi>Aaron.</hi> The Author, (I mean the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <note place="margin">Hebr. 7.</note>

one,) the Authorities, the Business, and the End, of the <hi>Christian Priest-hood,</hi> are more Noble than those of the <hi>Jewish.</hi> For is not <hi>Christ</hi> greater than <hi>Moses, Heaven</hi> better than the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the <hi>Eucharist</hi> to be prefer'd to all the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>Expiations</hi> of the <hi>Law?</hi> Thus the Right, and the Reason of Things stands. And as for <hi>Fact,</hi> the Christian World have not been backward in their Acknowledgments. Ever since the first Conversion of Princes, the <hi>Priest-hood</hi> has had no small share of Temporal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The <hi>Codes, Novels,</hi> and <hi>Church History,</hi> are Sufficient Evidence what Sense <hi>Constantine</hi> and his Successors had of these Matters.

To mention nothing more, their <hi>Heraldry</hi> is regulated by <hi>Garter,</hi> and <hi>Blazon'd</hi> by <hi>Stones,</hi> which none under the <hi>Nobility</hi> can pretend to. In this Country of ours, Persons of the First Quality have been in <hi>Orders:</hi> To give an Instance of some few. <hi>Odo</hi> Brother to <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> was <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Baieux,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Kent.</hi> King <hi>Stephens</hi> Brother was <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of <hi>Winchester. Nevill Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>York</hi> was Brother to the Great Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and <hi>Cardinal Pool</hi> was of the Royal Family. To come a little lower, and to our own Times. And here we may reckon not a few Persons of Noble Descent in Holy <hi>Orders.</hi> Witness the <hi>Berklyes, Comptons, Montagues, Crews,</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:56421:77"/>
and <hi>Norths;</hi> The <hi>Annesleys, Finches, Grayhams</hi> &amp;c. And as for the Gentry, there are not many good Familes in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but either have, or have had a <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man</hi> in them,</p>
            <p>In short; The <hi>Priest-hood</hi> is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of a Gentleman. A <hi>Parson</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the ignorant Pride of some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is a Name of Credit, and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, both in Religion, and <hi>Law.</hi> The <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of <hi>Clerk</hi> is at least equal to that of Gentleman. Were it otherwise the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> would in many cases be a kind of Punishment. But the <hi>Law</hi> is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so singular as to make <hi>Orders</hi> a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to <hi>Degree.</hi> No, The Honour of the Family continues, and the <hi>Her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry</hi> is every jot as safe in the <hi>Church,</hi> as 'twas in the <hi>State.</hi> And yet when the <hi>Laity</hi> are taken leave of, not <hi>Gentleman</hi> but <hi>Clerk</hi> is usually written. This Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom is an argument the Change is not made for the worse, that the Spiritual Distinction is as valuable as the other; And to speak Modestly, that the first <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> is not lost, but Cover'd. Did the Subject require it, this Point might be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made good. For the stile of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Secular Honour is continued as well with <hi>Priest-hood</hi> as without it. A Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who is either <hi>Baronet, or Baron,</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:56421:77"/>
writes himself so, notwithstanding His <hi>Clerkship.</hi> Indeed we can't well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Clergy degraded from Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Honour without a strange Reflection on the Country; without supposing <hi>Julian</hi> at the Helm, the <hi>Laws</hi> Antichristian, and <hi>Infidelity</hi> in the very <hi>Constitution.</hi> To make the Ministers of Religion less upon the score of their Function, would be a Penalty on the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and a contempt of the God of Christianity. 'Tis our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours reasoning; <hi>He that despises you, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spises</hi>

            <p>I hope what I have offer'd on this Subject will not be misunderstood. There is no Vanity in necessary Defence. To wipe off Aspersions, and rescue Things from Mistake, is but bare Justice: Besides, where the Honour of God, and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Interest are concern'd, a Man is bound to speak. To argue from a resembling Instance. He that has the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission ought to Maintain it. To let it suffer under Rudeness is to betray it. To be tame and silent in such cases, is not Modesty but Meanness, Humility obliges no Man to desert his Trust; To throw up his Privilege, and prove false to his Character. And is our Saviours Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity inferiour to that of Princes? Are the Kingdoms of this World more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56421:78"/>
than that of the next? And can the Concerns of Time be greater than those of Eternity? If not, the reasoning above mention'd must hold in the Application.</p>
            <p>And now by this time I conceive the ill Manners of the <hi>Stage</hi> may be in some measure apparent; And that the <hi>Clergy</hi> deserve none of that Coarse Usage which it puts upon them. I confess I know no <hi>Profession</hi> that has made a more credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Figure, that has better Customs for their Privileges, and better Reasons to maintain them. And here setting aside the point of Conscience, where lies the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of falling foul upon this <hi>Order?</hi> What Propriety is there in Misrepresenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? In confounding Respects, disguising Features, and painting Things out of all Colour and Complexion? This crossing upon Nature and Reason, is great Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and out of Rule. And now what Pleasure is there in Misbehaviour and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse? Is it such an Entertainment to see Religion worryed by Atheism, and Things the most Solemn and Significant tumbled and tost by Buffoons? A Man may laugh at a Puppy's tearing a Wardrobe, but I think 'twere altogether as discrect to beat him off. Well! but the <hi>Clergy</hi> mismanage sometimes, and they must be told of their Faults. What then? Are the <hi>Poets</hi> their <hi>Ordinaries?</hi> Is the <hi>Pulpit</hi> under the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56421:78"/>
of the <hi>Stage?</hi> And are those fit to correct the Church, that are not fit to come into it? Besides, What makes them fly out upon the <hi>Function;</hi> and rail by wholesale? Is the <hi>Priesthood</hi> a crime, and the service of God a Disadvantage? I grant Persons and Things are not always suited. A good <hi>Post</hi> may be ill kept, but then the Censure should keep close to the Fault, and the Office not suffer for the Manager. The <hi>Clergy</hi> may have their Failings some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like others, but what then? The <hi>Character</hi> is still untarnish'd. The <hi>Men</hi> may be Little, but the <hi>Priests</hi> are not so. And therefore like other People, they ought to be treated by their best Distinction.</p>
            <p>If 'tis Objected that the <hi>Clergy</hi> in <hi>Plays</hi> are commonly <hi>Chaplains,</hi> And that these <hi>Belonging</hi> to Persons of Quality they were obliged to represent them servile and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive. To this I Answer</p>
            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> In my former remark, that the <hi>Stage</hi> often outrages the whole <hi>Order,</hi> without regard to any particular Office. But were it not so in the</p>
            <p>2<hi>d.</hi> Place, They quite overlook the Character, and mistake the Business of <hi>Chaplains.</hi> They are no <hi>Servants,</hi> neither <note place="margin">Moral Essays.</note> do they <hi>Belong</hi> to any <hi>Body,</hi> but God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. This Point I have fully proved in another, <hi>Treatise,</hi> and thither. I refer the <hi>Reader</hi>

            <p>THE Lines of Virtue and Vice are Struck out by Nature in very Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Distinctions; They tend to a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Point, and in the greater Instances the Space between them is easily perceiv'd. Nothing can be more unlike than the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Forms of these Qualities: The First has all the sweetness, Charms, and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces imaginable; The other has the Air of a <hi>Post</hi> ill Carved into a <hi>Monster,</hi> and looks both foolish and Frightful together. These are the Native Appearances of good and Evil: And they that endeavour to blot the Distinctions, to rub out the Colours, or change the Marks, are extreamly to blame. 'Tis confessed as long as the Mind is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, and Conscience goes true, there's no fear of being imposed on. But when Vice is varnish'd over with Pleasure, and comes in the Shape of Convenience, the case grows somewhat dangerous; for then
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56421:79"/>
the Fancy may be gain'd, and the Guards corrupted, and Reason suborn'd against it self. And thus a <hi>Disguise</hi> often passes when the Person would otherwise be stopt. To put <hi>Lewdness</hi> into a Thriving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to give it an Equipage of Quality, and to treat it with Ceremony and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, is the way to confound the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, to fortifie the Charm, and to make the Mischief invincible. Innocence is often owing to Fear, and Appetite is kept under by Shame; But when these Restraints are once taken off, when Profit and Liberty lie on the same side, and a Man can Debauch himself into Credit, what can be expected in such a case, but that Pleasure should grow Absolute, and Madness carry all before it? The <hi>Stage</hi> seem eager to bring Matters to this Issue; They have made a considerable progress, and are still pushing their Point with all the Vigour imaginable. If this be not their Aim why is <hi>Lewdness</hi> so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd in Character and Success? Why are their Favourites Atheistical, and their fine Gentleman debauched? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is <hi>Vice</hi> thus prefer'd, thus ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and caress'd, unless for Imitation? That matter of Fact stands thus, I shall make good by several Instances: To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin then with their Men of Breeding and

But then abating this single Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, <hi>Valentine</hi> is altogether com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Vice. He is a prodigal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchee, <note place="margin">Love for Love. p. 6, 7. 25. 61. 89. 91.</note> unnatural, and Profane, Obscene, Sawcy, and undutiful, And yet this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56421:80"/>
is crown'd for the Man of Merit, has his Wishes thrown into his Lap, and makes the Happy <hi>Exit.</hi> I perceive we should have a rare set of <hi>Virtues</hi> if these <hi>Poets</hi> had the making of them! How they hug a Vitious Character, and how profuse are they in their Liberalities to Lewdness? In the <hi>Provok'd Wife, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Swears at Length, solicits Lady <hi>Brute,</hi> Confesses himself Lewd, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Debauchery to Marriage. He handles the last Sybject very notably and worth the Hearing. <hi>There is</hi> (says he) <hi>a poor sordid Slavery in Marriage, that turns the flowing Tide of Honour, and sinks it to the lowest ebb of Infamy. 'Tis a Corrupted Soil, Ill Nature, Avarice, Sloth, Cowardize, and Dirt, are all its Product.</hi>—But then <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy (alias Whoring) is a Brave, Free, Haughty, Generous, Agent.</hi> This is admirable stuff both for the Rhetorick and the Reason! The <note place="margin">p. 35.</note> Character of <hi>Young Fashion</hi> in the <hi>Relapse</hi> is of the same Staunchness, but this the <hi>Reader</hi> may have in another Place.</p>
            <p>To sum up the Evidence. A fine Gentleman, is a fine Whoring, Swearing, Smutty, Atheistical Man. These Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications it seems compleat the <hi>Idea</hi> of Honour. They are the Top-Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Fortune, and the distinguishing Glories of Birth and Breeding! This is
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56421:81"/>
the <hi>Stage-Test</hi> for <hi>Quality,</hi> and those that can't stand it, ought to be <hi>Disclaim'd.</hi> The Restraints of Conscience and the Pedantry of Virtue, are unbecoming a Cavalier: Future Securities, and Reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond Life, are vulgar Provisions: If he falls a Thinking at this rate, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits his Honour; For his Head was only made to run against a Post! Here you have a Man of Breeding and Figure that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesques the <hi>Bible,</hi> Swears, and talks Smut to Ladies, speaks ill of his Friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his Back, and betraies his Interest. A fine Gentleman that has neither Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, nor Honour, Conscience, nor Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Good Nature, nor civil Hypocricy. Fine, only in the Insignificancy of Life, the Abuse of Religion and the Scandals of Conversation. These Worshipful Things are the <hi>Poets</hi> Favourites: They appear at the Head of the <hi>Fashion;</hi> and shine in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and Equipage. If there is any Sense stirring, They must have it, tho' the rest of the <hi>Stage</hi> suffer never so much by the Partiality. And what can be the Meaning of this wretched Distribution of Honour? Is it not to give Credit and Countenance to Vice, and to shame young People out of all pretences to Conscience, and Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity? They seem forc'd to turn Lewd in their own Defence: They can't other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56421:81"/>
justifie themselves to the Fashion, nor keep up the Character of Gentlemen: Thus People not well furnish'd with Thought, and Experience, are debauch'd both in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise and Principle. And thus Religion grows uncreditable, and passes for ill Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The <hi>Stage</hi> seldom gives Quarter to any Thing that's serviceable or Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, but persecutes Worth, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness under every Appearance. He that would be safe from their Satir must take care to disguise himself in Vice, and hang out the <hi>Colours</hi> of Debauchery. How often is Learning, Industry, and Fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ridiculed in Comedy? The rich Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens are often Misers, and Cuckolds, and the <hi>Universities,</hi> Schools of Pedantry upon this score. In short; Libertinism and Profaness, Dressing, Idleness, and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, are the only valuable Qualities. As if People were not apt enough of themselves to be Lazy, Lewd, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, unless they were prick'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and provok'd by Glory, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. Thus the Marks of Honour, and Infamy are misapplyed, and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's of Virtue and Vice confounded. Thus Monstrousness goes for Proportion, and the Blemishes of Human Nature, make up the Beauties of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:56421:82"/>
The fine Ladies are of the same Cut with the Gentlemen; <hi>Moraima</hi> is scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously rude to her Father, helps him to a beating, and runs away with <hi>Antonio. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica</hi> talks sawcily to her Uncle, and <hi>Belin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Don Sebist. Love for Love. p. 20 Provok'd Wife. p. 64. Chap. 1. &amp; 2.</note> confesses her Inclination for a Gallant. And as I have observ'd already, the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ladies in the <hi>Mock Astrologer, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Fryar, Country Wife, Old Batchelour, Orphan, Double Dealer,</hi> and <hi>Love Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi> are smutty, and sometimes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane.</p>
            <p>And was Licentiousness and irreligion, alwaies a mark of Honour? No; I don't perceive but that the old <hi>Poets</hi> had an other Notion of Accomplishment, and bred their people of Condition a different way. <hi>Philolaches</hi> in <hi>Plautus</hi> laments his being debauch'd; and dilates upon the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Virtue, and Regularity. <hi>Lusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teles</hi> another Young Gentleman disputes <note place="margin">Mostel.

And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he lashes Luxury and Debauching <note place="margin">A. 2. 2.</note> with a great deal of Warmth, and Satir. <hi>Chremes</hi> in <hi>Terence</hi> is a modest young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, he is afraid of being surpriz'd by <note place="margin">

               <hi>Jacinta</hi> as I remember does not treat her Father at this rate of Decency. Let us hear a little of her Behaviour. The <hi>Mock Astrologer</hi> makes the Men draw, and frights the Ladys with the Apprehension of a Quarrel. Upon this; <hi>Theodosia</hi> crys <hi>what will become of us! Jacinta</hi> answers, <hi>we'll die for Company: nothing vexes me but that I am not a Man, to have one thrust at that malicious old Father of mine, before I go.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p. 60.</note> Afterwards the old Gentleman <hi>Alonzo</hi> threatens his Daughters with a Nunnery. <hi>Jacinta</hi> spars again and says, <hi>I would have thee to know thou graceless old Man, that I defy a Nunnery: name a Nunnery once more and I disown thee for my Father.</hi> I could carry on the Comparison between the old <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:56421:83"/>
and Modern Poets somewhat farther. But this may suffice.</p>
            <p>Thus we see what a fine time Lewd People have on the <hi>English Stage.</hi> No Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, no mark of Insamy, no Mortification must touch them. They keep their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour untarnish'd, and carry off the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their Character. They are set up for the Standard of Behaviour, and the Masters of Ceremony and Sense. And at last that the Example may work the better, they generally make them rich, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and reward them with their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> in the <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>Mock-Astrologer,</hi> confesses himself blamed for this Practise. <hi>For making debauch'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons his</hi> Protagonists, <hi>or chief Persons of the Drama; And for making them happy in the Conclusion of the Play, against the Law of Comedy, which is to reward Virtue, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Vice.</hi> To this Objection He makes a lame Defence. And answers</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st. That he knows no such Law constantly observ'd in Comedy by the Antient or Modern Poets.</hi> What then? <hi>Poets</hi> are not always exactly in Rule. It may be a good Law tho' 'tis not constantly observ'd, some Laws are constantly broken, and yet ne're the worse for all that. He goes on, and pleads the Authorities of <hi>Plautus,</hi> and <hi>Terence.</hi> I grant there are Instances of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56421:83"/>
Favour to vitious young People in those Authors, but to this I reply</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> That those <hi>Poets</hi> had a greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of Liberty in their Religion. Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery did not lie under those Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Scandal, and penalty, with them as it does with us. Unless therefore He can prove <hi>Heathenism,</hi> and <hi>Christianity</hi> the same, his <hi>precedents</hi> will do him little service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly. Horace</hi> who was as good a judge of the <hi>Stage,</hi> as either of those <hi>Comedians,</hi> seems to be of another Opinion. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the obscenities of <hi>Plautus,</hi> and tells you Men of Fortune and Quality in his time; would not endure immodest Satir. <note place="margin">De Art. Poet.</note> He continues, that Poets were formerly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired for the great services they did. For teaching Matters relating to Religion, and Government; For refining the Manners, tempering the Passions, and improving the Understandings of Mankind: For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them more useful in Domestick Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the publick Capacities of Life. This is a demonstration that Vice was not <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the Inclination of the Muses in those days; and that <hi>Horace</hi> beleiv'd the chief business of a <hi>Poem</hi> was, to Instruct the Audience. He adds farther that the <hi>Chorus</hi> ought to turn upon the Argument of the <hi>Drama,</hi> and support the Design of the <hi>Acts.</hi> That
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56421:84"/>
They ought to speak in Defence of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and Frugality, and show a Regard to Religion. Now from the Rule of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> we may conclude his Judgment for the <hi>Play.</hi> For as he observes, there must be a Uniformity between the <hi>Chorus</hi> and the <hi>Acts:</hi> They must have the same View, and be all of a Piece. From hence 'tis plain that <hi>Horace</hi> would have no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral <hi>Character</hi> have either Countenance or good Fortune, upon the <hi>Stage.</hi> If 'tis said the very mention of the <hi>Chorus</hi> shews the Directions were intended for <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> To this</p>
            <p>I answer, that the Consequence is not good. For the use of a <hi>Chorus</hi> is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with <hi>Comedy.</hi> The antient <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> had it. <hi>Aristophanes</hi> is an Instance. I know 'tis said the <hi>Chorus</hi> was left out in that they call the <hi>New Comedy.</hi> But I can't see the conclusiveness of this Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For <hi>Aristophanes</hi> his <hi>Plutus</hi> is <hi>New Comedy</hi> with a <hi>Chorus</hi> in't. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

                  </gap>. Schol.</note> who lived after this Revolution of the <hi>Stage,</hi> mentions nothing of the Omission of the <hi>Chorus.</hi> He rather supposes its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance by saying the <hi>Chorus was added by the Government long after the Invention of Comedy.</hi> 'Tis true <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Libr. de Poet. cap. 5.</note> have none, but those before them proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly might. <hi>Moliere</hi> has now reviv'd them; <note place="margin">

               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:56421:84"/>
And <hi>Horace</hi> might be of his Opinion, for ought wee know to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly. Horace</hi> having expresly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the beginning and progress of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,</hi> discovers himself more fully: He advises a <hi>Poet</hi> to form his Work upon the Precepts of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and the Models of Moral Philosophy. This was the way to preserve Decency, and to assign a proper Fate and Behaviour to every <hi>Character.</hi> Now if <hi>Horace</hi> would have his <hi>Poet</hi> govern'd by the Maxims of <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Morality, he must oblige him to Sobriety of Conduct, and a just distribution of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and Punishments.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> makes Homewards, and endeavours to fortifie himself in Modern Authority. He lets us know that <hi>Ben Johnson after whom he may be proud to Err, gives him more than one example of this Conduct; That in the</hi> Alchemist <hi>is notorius,</hi> where neither <hi>Face</hi> nor his <hi>Master</hi> are <note place="margin">Fref Mock-Astrol.</note> corrected according to their Demerits. But how Proud soever Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> may be of an Errour, he has not so much of <hi>Ben Jonson's</hi> company as he pretends. His Instance of <hi>Face &amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Alchemist</hi> is rather <hi>notorious</hi> against his Purpose then for it.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Face</hi> did not Council his Master <hi>Lovewit</hi> to debauch the Widdow; neither
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56421:85"/>
is it clear that the Matter went thus far. He might gain her consent upon Terms of Honour for ought appears to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. 'Tis true <hi>Face</hi> who was one of the Principal Cheats is Pardon'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd. But then his Master confesses himself kind to a fault. He owns this Indulgence was a Breach of Justice, and unbecoming the Gravity of an old Man. And then desires the Audience to excuse him upon the Score of the Temptation. But <hi>Face continued in the Cousenage till the last without Repentance.</hi> Under favour I <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> conceive this is a Mistake. For does not <hi>Face</hi> make an Apology before he leaves the <hi>Stage?</hi> Does he not set himself at the <hi>Bar,</hi> arraign his own Practise, and cast the Cause upon the Clemency of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? And are not all these Signs of the Dislike of what he had done? Thus care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful the <hi>Poet</hi> is to prevent the Ill Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of his <hi>Play!</hi> He brings both Man and Master to Confession. He dismisses them like Malefactours; And moves for their Pardon before he gives them their Discharge. But the <hi>Mock-Astrologer</hi> has a gentler Hand: <hi>Wild-Blood</hi> and <hi>Jacinta</hi> are more generously used: There is no Acknowledgment exacted; no Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship put upon them: They are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to talk on in their Libertine way to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56421:85"/>
the Last: And take Leave without the least Appearance of Reformation. The <hi>Mock-Astrologer</hi> urges <hi>Ben Johnson's Silent Woman</hi> as an other <hi>Precedent</hi> to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. For <hi>there</hi> Dauphine <hi>confesses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in Love with all the Collegiate Lady's. And yet this naughty</hi> Dauphine <hi>is Crowned in the end with the Possession of his Uncles Estate, and with the hopes of all his Mistresses.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> This Charge, as I take it, is somewhat too severe. I grant <hi>Dauphine</hi> Professes himself in Love with the Collegiate Ladies at first. But when they invited him to a private Visit, he makes them no Promise; but rather appears tired, and willing to disengage. <hi>Dauphine</hi> therefore is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together so naughty as this Author repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ben Johnson's Fox</hi> is clearly against Mr. <hi>Dryden.</hi> And here I have his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession for proof. He declares the <hi>Poets</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Essay of Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry.</note> 
               <hi>end in this Play was the Punishment of Vice, and the Reward of Virtue. Ben</hi> was forced to strain for this piece of Justice, and <note place="margin">p. 28.</note> break through the <hi>Unity of Design.</hi> This Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> remarks upon him: How ever he is pleased to commend the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and calls it an excellent <hi>Fifth Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ben Johnson</hi> shall speak for himself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the Character of a Critick;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:56421:86"/>
In the mean time I shall take a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or two from <hi>Shakespear.</hi> And here we may observe the admir'd <hi>Falstaffe</hi> goes off in Disappointment. He is thrown out of Favour as being a <hi>Rake,</hi> and dies like a Rat behind the Hangings. The Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure he had given, would not excuse him. The <hi>Poet</hi> was not so partial, as to let his Humour compound for his Lewdness. If 'tis objected that this remark is wide of the Point, because <hi>Falstaffe</hi> is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in Tragedy, where the Laws of Justice are more strickly observ'd To this I answer, that you may call <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth and Fifth, Tragedies if you please. But for all that, <hi>Falstaffe</hi> wears no <hi>Buskins,</hi> his Character is perfectly Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical from end to end.</p>
            <p>The next Instance shall be in <hi>Flowerdale</hi> the <hi>Prodigal.</hi> This Spark notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Extravagance, makes a lucky Hand on't at last, and marries up a rich <note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> Lady. But then the Poet qualifies him for his good Fortune, and mends his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with his Circumstances. He makes him repent, and leave off his Intemperance, Swearing <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when his Father warn'd him against a Relapse, He answers very soberly,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heaven helping me I'le hate the Course of Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:56421:86"/>
I could give some instances of this kind out of <hi>Beaumount</hi> and <hi>Fletcher,</hi> But there's no need of any farther Quotation; For Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> is not satisfied with his Apology from Authority: He does as good as own that this may be construed no better than defending one ill practise by another. To prevent this very reasonable objection he endeavours to vindicate his <hi>Precedents</hi> from the Reason of the Thing. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he <hi>makes a wide difference between the Rules of Tragedy and Comedy. That Vice must be impartially prosecuted in the first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Persons are Great &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seems then <hi>Executions</hi> are only for <hi>Greatness,</hi> and <hi>Quality. Justice</hi> is not to strike much <hi>lower</hi> than a <hi>Prince. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate People</hi> may do what they <hi>please.</hi> They are too <hi>few</hi> for <hi>Mischief,</hi> and too <hi>Little</hi> for <hi>Punishment!</hi> This would be admirable Doctrine for <hi>Newgate,</hi> and give us a general <hi>Goal-Delivery</hi> without more ado. But in <hi>Tragedy</hi> (says the <hi>Mock Astrologer.) the Crimes are likewise Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid,</hi> so that there is a necessity for Severity and Example. And how stands the matter in <hi>Comedy?</hi> Quite otherwise. There the <hi>Faults are but the sallies of Youth, and the Frailties of Human Nature.</hi> For <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Instance. There is nothing but a little Whoring, Pimping. Gaming, Profaness <hi>&amp;c,</hi> And who could be so hard hearted
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:56421:87"/>
to give a Man any Trouble for This? Such Rigours would be strangely Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane! A <hi>Poet</hi> is a better natur'd Thing I can assure you. These little Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages <hi>move Pity and Commiseration, and are not such as must of necessity be Punish'd.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> This is comfortable Casuistry! But to be Serious. Is Dissolution of Manners such a Peccadillo? Does a Profligate Conscience deserve nothing but Commiseration? And are People damn'd only for <hi>Humane Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</hi> I perceive the Laws of Religion and those of the <hi>Stage</hi> differ extreamly! The strength of his Defence lies in this choice Maxim, that the <hi>Cheif End of Comedy is Delight.</hi> He questions <hi>whether Instruction has any thing to do in Comedy;</hi> If it has, he is sure <hi>'tis no more then its secondary end: For the business of the Poet is to make you laugh.</hi> Granting the Truth of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> I somewhat question the servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of it. For is there no Diversion to be had unless Vice appears prosperous, and rides at the Head of Success. One would think such a preposterous, distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Rewards, should rather shock the Reason, and raise the Indignation of the <hi>Audience.</hi> To laugh without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is the Pleasure of Fools, and against it, of something worse. The exposing of Knavery, and making <hi>Lewdness</hi> ridiculous, is a much better occasion for Laughter.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:56421:87"/>
And this with submission I take to be the End of <hi>Comedy.</hi> And therefore it does not differ from <hi>Tragedy</hi> in the End, but in the <hi>Means.</hi> Instruction is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Design of both. The one works by Terror, the other by Insamy. 'Tis true, they don't move in the same Line, but they meet in the same point at last. For this Opinion I have good Authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what has been cited already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> Monsieur <hi>Rapin</hi> affirms <q>That De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is the End that Poetry aims at, but not the Principal one. For Poetry being an Art, ought to be profitable by the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it's own nature, and by the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Subordination that all Arts should have to Polity, whose End in General is <note place="margin">Rapin Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect. &amp;c. p. 10.</note> the publick Good. This is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and of <hi>Horace</hi> his chief Interpreter.</q> 
               <hi>Ben Johnson</hi> in his Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Epistle of his <hi>Fox</hi> has somewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable upon this Argument; And de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims with a great deal of zeal, spirit, and good Sense, against the Licentiousness of the <hi>Stage.</hi> He lays it down for a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <q>That 'tis impossible to be a good <hi>Poet</hi> without being a good <hi>Man.</hi> That he (a good Poet) is said to be able to inform Young Men to all good Discipline, and enflame grown Men to all great Virtues &amp;c.—That the general complaint was that the <hi>Writers</hi> of those days had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:56421:88"/>
remaining in them of the Dignity of a <hi>Poet,</hi> but the abused Name. That now, especially in Stage Poetry, nothing but Ribaldry, Profanation, <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> all Licence of Offence to God and Man, is practised. He confesses a great part of this Charge is over-true, and is sorry he dares not deny it. But then he hopes all are not embark'd in this bold Adventure for Hell. For my part (says he) I can, and from a most clear Conscience affirm; That I have ever trembled to think to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the least Profaness, and loath'd the Use of such foul, and unwash'd Bawdry, as is now made the Food of the <hi>Scene.</hi>—<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>The encrease of which Lust in Liberty, what Learned or Liberal Soul does not abhor? In whole <hi>Enterludes</hi> nothing but the Filth of the Time is utter'd—with Brothelry able to violate the Ear of a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> and Blasphemy, to turn the Blood of a Christian to Water. He continues, that the Insolence of these Men had brought the <hi>Muses</hi> into Disgrace, and made <hi>Poetry</hi> the lowest scorn of the Age. He appeals to his Patrons the <hi>Universities,</hi> that his Labour has been heretofore, and mostly in this his latest Work, to reduce not only the antient Forms, but Manners of the <hi>Scene,</hi> the innocence and the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which is the <hi>Principal End</hi> of Poesy,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:56421:88"/>
to inform Men in the best Reason of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Lastly he adds, that 'he has imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the Conduct of the Antients in this <hi>Play,</hi> The goings out (or Conclusions) of whose <hi>Comedies,</hi> were not always joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful but oft-times the Bawds, the Slaves, the Rivals, ye and the Masters are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and fitly, it being the Office of a <hi>Comick Poet</hi> (mark that!) to imitate Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and Instruct to Life <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Say you so! Why then if <hi>Ben Johnson</hi> knew any thing of the Matter, Divertisment and Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not as Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> affirms, the <hi>Chief End of Comedy.</hi> This Testimony is so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry full and clear, that it needs no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, nor any enforcement from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, and Consequence:</p>
            <p>And because Laughing and Pleasure has such an unlimited Prerogative upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> I shall add a Citation or two from <hi>Aristotle</hi> concerning this Matter. Now this great Man <q>calls those Buffoons, and Impertinents, who rally without any regard to Persons or Things, to Decency, or good Manners. That there is a great difference between Ribaldry, and handsom Rallying. He that would perform ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, must keep within the Character of Virtue, and Breeding. He goes on, and tells us that the old Comedians enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Audience with Smut, but the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:56421:89"/>
Modern ones avoided that Liberty, and grew more reserv'd. This latter way he says was much more proper and Gentile then the other. That in his Opinion Rallying, no less than Railing, ought to be under the Discipline of Law; That he who is ridden by his <hi>Jests,</hi> and minds nothing but the business of <hi>Laughing,</hi> is himself Ridiculous. And that a Man of Education and Sense, is so far from going <note place="margin">Libr. 4. de. Morib. cap. 14.</note> these Lengths that he wont so much as endure the hearing some sort of Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foonry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the point of Delight in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the same Author affirms, <q>that scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Satisfactions are not properly Pleasures. 'Tis only Distemper, and false Appetite which makes them palatable. And a Man that is sick, seldom has his Tast true. Besides, supposing we throw Capacity out of the Question, and make Experiment and Sensation the Judge; Granting this, we ought not to chop at every Bait, nor Fly out at every Thing that strikes the Fancy. The meer Agreableness must not overbear us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distinguishing upon the Quality, and the Means. Pleasure how charming so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, must not be fetched out of Vice. An Estate is a pretty thing, but if we purchase by Falshood, and Knavery,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:56421:89"/>
Knavery, we pay too much for't. Some Pleasures, are Childish and others abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable; And upon the whole, Pleasure, absolutely speaking, is no good Thing.</q> 
               <note place="margin">De Mor. Lib. 10. cap. 2.</note> And so much for the Philosopher. And because <hi>Ribaldry</hi> is used for Sport, a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage or two from <hi>Quintilian,</hi> may not be unseasonable. This Orator does not only Condemn the grosser Instances, but cuts off all the <hi>Double-Entendre's</hi> at a Blow. He comes up to the Regularity of Thought, and tells us <q>that the Meaning, as well as the Words of Discourse must be unsullied.</q> 
               <note place="margin">Institut; Lib. 6. c. 3.</note> And in the same <hi>Chapter</hi> he adds that <q>A Man of Probity has always a Reserve in his Freedoms, and Converses within the Rules of Modesty, and Character.And that Mirth at the expence of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is an Over-purchase, <hi>Nimium enim risus pretium est si probitatis impendio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stat.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see how these great <hi>Masters</hi> qualify Diversion, and tie it up to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visoes,</hi> and Conditions. Indeed to make <hi>Delight</hi> the main business of <hi>Comedy</hi> is an unreasonable and dangerous Principle. It opens the way to all Licentiousness, and Confounds the distinction between Mirth, and Madness. For if Diversion is the <hi>Chief End,</hi> it must be had at any Price, No serviceable Expedient must be refused,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56421:90"/>
tho' never so scandalous. And thus the worst Things are said, and the best abus'd; Religion is insulted, and the most serious Matters turn'd into Ridicule! As if the Blindside of an Audience ought to be caress'd, and their Folly and Atheism en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd in the first Place. Yes, if the Palate is pleas'd, no matter tho' the Body is Poyson'd! For can one die of an easier Disease than Diversion? But Raillery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, certainly Mirth and Laughing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect to the Cause, are not such supreme Satisfactions! A man has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Pleasure in losing his Wits. Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, and <hi>Possession,</hi> will shake the Lungs, and brighten the Face; and yet I suppose they are not much to be coveted. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, now we know the Reason of the Profaness, and Obscenity of the <hi>Stage,</hi> of their Hellish Cursing, and Swearing, and in short of their great Industry to make God, and Goodness Contemptible: 'Tis all to Satisfie the Company, and make People Laugh! A most admirable justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation! What can be more engaging to an <hi>Audience,</hi> then to see a <hi>Poet</hi> thus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistically brave? To see him charge up to the Canons Mouth, and defy the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of Heaven to serve them? Besides, there may be somewhat of Convenience in the Case. To fetch Diversion out of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:56421:90"/>
Innocence is no such easy matter. There's no succeeding it may be in this method, without Sweat, and Drudging. Clean Wit, inoffensive Humour, and handsom Contrivance, require Time, and Thought. And who would be at this Expence, when the Purchase is so cheap another way? 'Tis possible a <hi>Poet</hi> may not alwaies have Sense enough by him for such an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And since we are upon supposals, it may be the <hi>Audience</hi> is not to be gain'd without straining a Point, and giving a Loose to Conscience: And when People are sick, are they not to be Humour'd? In fine, We must make them Laugh, right or wrong, for <hi>Delight</hi> is the <hi>Cheif End of Comedy. Delight!</hi> He should have said <hi>Debauchery:</hi> That's the English of the Word, and the Consequence of the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise. But the Original Design of <hi>Comedy</hi> was otherwise: And granting 'twas not so, what then? If the <hi>Ends</hi> of Things are naught, they must be mended. Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is the Chief end of Malice, would it be then a Blemish in Ill Nature to change Temper, and relent into Goodness? The Chief <hi>End</hi> of a Madman it may be is to Fire a House, must we not then bind him in his Bed? To conclude. If <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> without Restraint, or Distinction, without Conscience or Shame, is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:56421:91"/>
Law of <hi>Comedy,</hi> 'twere well if we had less on't. Arbitrary Pleasure, is more dangerous than Arbitrary Power. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more Brutal than to be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd to Appetite; And nothing more wretched than to serve in such a Design. The <hi>Mock-Astrologer</hi> to clear himself of this Imputation, is glad to give up his Principle at Last. <hi>Least any Man should think</hi> (says He) <hi>that I write this to make Libertinism amiable, or that I cared not to debase the end, and Institution of</hi> Comedy. (It seems then <hi>Delight</hi> is not the Chief end.) <hi>I must farther declare that we make not Vitious Persons Happy, but only as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven makes Sinners so.</hi> &amp;c. If this will hold, all's well. But <hi>Heaven</hi> does not forgive without Repentance. Let us see then what Satisfaction he requires from his <hi>Wild-Blood,</hi> and what Discipline he puts him under. Why, He helps him to his Mistress, he Marries him to a Lady of Birth and Fortune. And now do you think He has not made him an Example, and punish'd him to some Purpose! These are frightful Severities! Who would be vitious when such Terrors hang over his Head? And does <hi>Heaven make Sinners happy</hi> upon these Conditions? Sure some People have a good Opinion of Vice, or a very ill one of Marriage, otherwise they
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:56421:91"/>
would have Charged the Penance a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more. But I have nothing farther with the <hi>Mock-Astrologer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now for the Conclusion of a <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> I shall give some Instances of the <hi>Manners</hi> of the <hi>Stage,</hi> and that with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to Poetry, and Ceremony. <hi>Manners</hi> in the Language of Poetry, is a Propriety of Actions, and Persons. To succeed in this business, there must always be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had to Age, Sex, and Condition: And nothing put into the Mouths of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which disagrees with any of these Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. 'Tis not enough to say a witty Thing, unless it be spoken by a likely Person, and upon a Proper occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But my Design will lead me to this Subject afterwards, and therefore I shall say no more of it at present, but proceed to apply the Remark.</p>
            <p>One Instance of Impropriety in <hi>Manners</hi> both Poetical and Moral, is their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Women, and Women of Quality talk Smuttily. This I have proved upon them already, and could cite many more places to the same Purpose were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</p>
            <p>But I shall go on, and give the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> some other examples of Decency, Judgment, and Probability. <hi>Don-Sebas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> will help us in some measure. Here
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56421:92"/>
the <hi>Mufti</hi> makes a foolish Speech to the Rabble, and jests upon his own Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He tells them, <hi>tho' your Tyrant is a Lawful Emperour, yet your Lawful Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is but a Tyrant,—That your Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is a Tyrant is most Manifest, for you were born to be Turks, out he has play'd the Turk with you.</hi> And now is not this Man <note place="margin">p. 85</note> sit to Manage the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and to be set up for on Oracle of State? <hi>Captain Tom</hi> should have had this Speech by right: But the <hi>Poet</hi> had a farther Design, and any thing is good enough for a <hi>Mufti.</hi>

               <hi>Sebastian</hi> after all the violence of his Repentance, his grasping at self Murther, and Resolutions for the <hi>Cell,</hi> is strangely pleased with the Remembrance of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest,</hi> and wishes the Repetition of it: And <hi>Almeida</hi> out of her Princely Modesty, and singular Compunction, is of the same mind.

at the thoughts on't, At the thoughts on't, tho' 'twas comitted under all the Circumstances of excuse. Now when Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and meer Mistake are so very disquieting, 'tis very strange if a Man should plague his Mind with the Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Knowledge; To carry Aversion, and Desire, in their full strength upon the same Object; To fly and pursue with so <note place="margin">p. 32.</note> much eagerness, is somewhat Unusual.</p>

            <p>These are strange Compliments! <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismond</hi> calls his Queen Rebel to her head, when he was both her General and her Lover. This is powerful Rhetorick to Court a Queen with! Enough one would think to have made the Affair desperate. But he has a Remedy at hand. The <hi>Poets Nostrum</hi> of Profaness cures all. He does as good as tell Her, she may Sin as much as she has a mind to. Her Face is a Protection to her Conscience. For
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56421:93"/>
Heaven is under a necessity to forgive a Handsom Woman. To say all this ought to be pass'd over in <hi>Torrismond</hi> on the score of his Passion, is to make the Excuse more scandalous than the Fault, if possible. Such Raptures are fit only for <hi>Bedlam,</hi> or a place which I shan't name. <hi>Love Triumphant</hi> will furnish another Rant not altogether inconsiderable. Here <hi>Celadea</hi> a Maiden Lady when she was afraid her Spark would be married to another, calls out presently for a <hi>Chaos.</hi> She is for pulling the World about her ears, tumbling all the Elements together, and expostulates with Heaven for making Humane Nature otherwise than it should have been.</p>

            <p>Now to my fancy, if she had call'd for a <hi>Chair</hi> instead of a <hi>Chaos,</hi> trip'd off, and kept her folly to her self, the Woman had been much wiser.

a Gingle upon the double meaning of a word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I think,</hi> says <hi>Dominick</hi> the Fryar, <hi>it was my good Angel that sent me hither so opportunely. Gomez</hi> suspects him brib'd for no credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table business and answers.</p>

            <p>These <hi>Spaniards</hi> will entertain us with more of this fine Raillery. Colonel <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> in <hi>Love Triumphant</hi> has a great stroak at it. He says his Bride <hi>Dalinda</hi> is no more <hi>Dalinda,</hi> but <hi>Dalilah</hi> the <hi>Philistine.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">p 70.</note> This Colonel as great a Soldier as he is, is quite puzzled at a <hi>Herald.</hi> He <hi>thinks they call him</hi> Herod, <hi>or some such Jewish Name.</hi> Here you have a good Officer <note place="margin">p 61.</note> spoil'd for a miserable jest. And yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, this <hi>Sancho</hi> tho' he can't pronounce <hi>Herald,</hi> knows what 'tis to be <hi>Laconick,</hi> which is somewhat more out of his way. <hi>Thraso</hi> in <hi>Terence</hi> was a man of the same <note place="margin">Enuch.</note> size in Sense, but for all that he does not quibble. <hi>Albanact</hi> Captain of the Guards, <note place="margin">King Arth. p. 2.</note> is much about as witty as <hi>Sancho.</hi> It seems <hi>Emmeline</hi> Heiress to the Duke of <hi>Cornwal</hi> was Blind. <hi>Albanact</hi> takes the rise of his Thought from hence; And observes <hi>that as Blind as she is, Coswald would have no blind Bargain of her.

            <p>
               <hi>Sancho</hi> replies, <hi>Indeed I have her License for it. Carlos</hi> is somewhat angry at this Gingle, and cries, <hi>what quibling too in your Prosperity?</hi> Adversity it seems is the only time for <hi>punning.</hi> Truly I think so too. For 'tis a sign a Man is much Distress'd when he flies to such an Expedient. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Carlos</hi> needed not to have been so touchy: For He can stoop as low him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon occasion. We must know then that <hi>Sancho</hi> had made Himself a Hunch'd Back, to counterfeit the <hi>Conde Alonzo.</hi> The two Colonels being in the same Disguise, were just upon the edg of a Quarrel. After some Preliminaries in Railing, <hi>Sancho</hi> cries, <hi>Don't provoke me; I am mischeivously bent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Carlos replies, <hi>Nay, you are Bent enough in Conscience, but I have a Bent</hi> Fist <hi>for Boxing.</hi> Here you have a brace of Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles started in a Line and a half. And which is worst of all, they come from <hi>Carlos,</hi> from a <hi>Character</hi> of Sense; And therefore the Poet, not the <hi>Soldier,</hi> must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for them.</p>
            <p>I shall now give the <hi>Reader</hi> a few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Gourtship of the <hi>Stage,</hi> and how decently they treat the Women, and <hi>Quality</hi> of both <hi>Sexes.</hi> The <hi>Women</hi> who
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:56421:94"/>
are secured from Affronts by Custom, and have a Privilege for Respect, are sometimes but roughly saluted by these Men of Address. And to bar the Defence, this Coarseness does not alwaies come from Clowns, and Women-haters; but from <hi>Persons</hi> of Figure, neither singular, nor ill Bred. And which is still worse, The Satir falls on blindly without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, and strikes at the whole <hi>Sex.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To begin with <hi>Amphytrion.</hi> In this <hi>Play</hi> Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> represents <hi>Jupiter</hi> with the Attributes of the supream Being: He furnishes him with Omnipotence, makes him the Creator of Nature, and the Arbiter <note place="margin">Amphit. p. 1, 2, 3, 8, 9.</note> of Fate, puts all the Functions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in his Hand, and describes him with the Majesty of the true God. And when he has put Him in this glorious
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:56421:98"/>
Equipage, he brings him out for Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He makes him express himself in the most intemperate Raptures: He is <note place="margin">p. 8. 17.</note> willing to <hi>Renounce</hi> his <hi>Heaven</hi> for his Brutality, and employ a whole <hi>Eternity</hi> in Lewdness. He draws his Debauch at its full Length, with all the Art, and Height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Foulness of Idea immaginable. This <hi>Jupiter</hi> is not contented with his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess against <hi>Amphitrion,</hi> unless he brings <hi>Alcmena</hi> into the Confederacy, and makes her a Party <hi>ex post Facto.</hi> He would not have her think of her <hi>Husband,</hi> but her <hi>Lover,</hi> that is, her <hi>Whoremaster.</hi> 'Tis not the success, but the manner of gaining it which is all in all. 'Tis the Vice which is the charming Circumstance. Innocence and Regularity, are dangerous Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; They spoil Satisfaction, and make every Thing insipid! Unless People take care to discharge their Virtue, and clear off their Conscience, their Senses will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish immediately! For <hi>Jupiter,</hi> says he, would <hi>owe nothing to a Name so dull as</hi>

               <p>I would give the <hi>Reader</hi> some more of these fine Sentences, but that they are
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56421:98"/>
too much out of Order to appear. The truth is, Our <hi>Stage-Poets</hi> seem to fence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Censure by the excess of Lewdness; And to make the overgrown size of a Crime, a Ground for Impunity. As if a Malefactor should project his Escape by appearing too scandalous for Publick Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. However, This is their Armour of Proof, this is the Strength they retreat to. They are fortified in Smut, and almost impregnable in Stench, so that where they deserve most, there's no coming at them. To proceed. I desire to know what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has for this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Representation? His Original <hi>Plautus,</hi> is no President. Indeed <hi>Plautus</hi> is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bold Heathen that ever made <hi>Jupiter</hi> tread the <hi>Stage.</hi> But then he stops far short of the Liberties of the <hi>English Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitrion. Jupiter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> have the same unaccountable Design; but the Methods of pursuit are very different. The First, does not solicit in scandalous Language, nor flourish upon his Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nor endeavours to set it up for the Fashion. <hi>Plautus</hi> had some regard to the Height of the Character, and the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Country, and the Restraints of Modesty. The Sallies of <hi>Aristophanes</hi> do not come up to the case; And if they did, I have cut off the Succours from that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:56421:99"/>
Quarter already. <hi>Terence's Chaerea</hi> is the <note place="margin">Eunuch.</note> next bold Man: However, here the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Danae</hi> are just glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at, and the Expression is clean; and He that tells the Story, a Young Libertine. These are all circumstances of extenuation, and give quite another Complexion to the Thing. As for the <hi>Greek Tragedians</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> there's no Prescription can be drawn from them. They mention <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in Terms of Magnificence and Respect, and make his Actions, and his Nature of a piece. But it may be the Celebrated <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> may give Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> some Countenance. Not at all. <hi>Virgil's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> is alwaies great, and solemn, and keeps up the port of a Deity. 'Tis true, <hi>Homer</hi> does not guard the Idea with that exactness, but then He never sinks the Character into Obscenity. The most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable passage is that where <hi>Jupiter</hi> relates his Love Adventures to <hi>Juno.</hi> Here this pretended Deity is charm'd with <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s Girdle, is in the height of his Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and under the Ascendant of his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This 'tis confess'd was a slippery Place, and yet the Poet makes a shift to keep his Feet. His <hi>Jupiter</hi> is Little, but not nauseous; The Story, tho' improper, will bear the telling, and look Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Face. However; These Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:56421:99"/>
of <hi>Homer</hi> were counted intolerable: I shall not insist on the Censures of <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> or <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus:</hi> Even the Heathen could not endure them. The Poets are lashed by <hi>Plato</hi> upon this Score; For planting Vice in Heaven, and making their Gods infectious; If Mr. <note place="margin">Euseb. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varg.</note> 
                  <hi>Dryden</hi> answers that <hi>Jupiter</hi> can do us no Harm. He is known to be an Idol of Lewd Memory, and therefore his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample can have no Force: Under Favour this is a mistake: For won't Pitch daub when a dirty Hand throws it; or can't a Toad spit Poyson because she's ugly? Ribaldry is dangerous under any Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of Representation. And as <hi>Menander</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> express it, <hi>Evil Communications corrupt good Manners.</hi> I mention them both, because if the <hi>Apostle</hi> should be dislik'd, the <hi>Comedian</hi> may pass. But after all, Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> has not so much as a Heathen President for his Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. What then made him fall into them? Was it the Decency of the Thing, and the Propriety of <hi>Character,</hi> and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour? By no means. For as I have observ'd before, Nature and Operations, ought to be proportion'd, and Behaviour suited to the Dignity of Being. To draw a Monkey in Royal Robes, and a Prince in <hi>Antick,</hi> would be Farce upon

Colours, entertain like a Monster, and please only upon the score of Deformity. Why then does Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> cross upon Nature and Authority, and go off as he Confesses, from the Plan of <hi>Plautus,</hi> and <hi>Moliere?</hi> Tho' by the way, the English <hi>Amphitryon</hi> has borrow'd most of the Libertine Thoughts of <hi>Moliere,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd them. But to the former question. Why must the beaten Road be left? He tells us, <hi>That the difference of our</hi> Stage <hi>from the Roman and the French did so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</hi> That is, our <hi>Stage</hi> must be much <note place="margin">Ep. Ded</note> more Licentious. For you are to observe that Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> and his Fraternity, have help'd to debauch the <hi>Town,</hi> and Poyson their Pleasures to an unusal Degree: And therefore the Diet must be dress'd to the Palate of the <hi>Company.</hi> And since they are made <hi>Scepticks,</hi> they must be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd as such. That the English <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryon</hi> was contriv'd with this View is too plain to be better interpreted. To what purpose else does <hi>Jupiter</hi> appear in the shape of <hi>Jehovah?</hi> Why are the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable <hi>Attributes</hi> burlesqu'd, and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence applyed to Acts of Infamy? To what end can such Horrible stuff as this serve, unless to expose the Notion, and extinguish the Belief of a Deity? The Perfections of God, are Himself. To
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:56421:100"/>
ridicule his Attributes and his Being, are but two words for the same Thing. These Attributes are bestow'd on <hi>Jupiter</hi> with great Prodigality, and afterwards execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly outrag'd. The Case being thus, the Cover of an Idol, is to thin a pretence to Screen the Blasphemy. Nothing but Mr. <hi>Dryden's Absolom</hi> and <hi>Achitophel</hi> can out-do This. Here I confess the Motion of his Pen is bolder, and the Strokes more Black'd. Here we have Blasphemy on the top of the Letter, without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Inference, or Construction. This Poem runs all upon Scripture Names, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Suppositions of the true Religion, and the right Object of Worship. Here Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faness is shut out from Defence, and lies open without Colour or Evasion. Here are no Pagan Divinities in the Scheme, so that all the Atheistick Raillery must point upon the true God. In the beginning we are told that <hi>Absalom</hi> was <hi>David's</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Son: So then there's a blot in his <hi>Scutchcon,</hi> and a Blemish upon his Birth. The <hi>Poet</hi> will make admirable use of this remark presently! This <hi>Absalom</hi> it seems was very extraordinary in his Person and Performances. Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> does not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know how this came about, and therefore enquires of himself in the first place,</p>
               <lg>

               <p>This is down right Defiance of the Living God! Here you have the very Essence and Spirit of Blasphemy, and the Holy Ghost brought in upon the most hideous Occasion. I question whether the Torments and Despair of the Damn'd, dare venture at such Flights as these. They are beyond Description, I Pray God they may not be beyond Pardon too. I can't forbear saying, that the next bad Thing to the writing these Impieties, is to Suffer them. To return to <hi>Amphitryon. Phaebus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> have <hi>Manners</hi> assign'd very disagreeable to their Condition. The later abating Propriety of Language, talks more like a <hi>Water-man</hi> than a Deity. They rail against the Gods, and call <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Vulcan</hi> the <hi>two Fools of Heaven. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> is pert upon his Father <hi>Jupiter,</hi> makes jests upon his Pleasures, and his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and is horribly smutty and profane. And all this Misbehaviour comes from <note place="margin">p. 3. 16. &amp;c.</note> him in his own shape, and in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of his Character. Had He run Riot in the Disguise of <hi>Sosia,</hi> the Discourse and the Person had been better adjusted, and the Extravagance more Pardonable.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:56421:101"/>
But here the Decorum is quite lost. To see the <hi>Immortals</hi> play such Gambols, and the biggest Beings do the least Actions, is strangely unnatural. An Emperour in the Grimaces of an Ape, or the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of a Kitten, would not be half so ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous. Now as Monsieur <hi>Rapin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, without Decorum there can be no <hi>probability,</hi> nor without Probability any true Beauty. Nature must be minded, otherwise Things will look forced, taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, and chimerical. Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses very handsomly on this occasion in his <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Albion</hi> and <hi>Albanius.</hi> He <note place="margin">p. 1.</note> informs us, <hi>That Wit has been truly defin'd a propriety of Words and Thoughts.—That Propriety of Thought is that Fancy which arises naturally from the Subject.</hi> Why then without doubt, the Quality, of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters should be taken care of, and great Persons appear like themselves. Yes, yes, all this is granted by implication, and Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> comes still nearer to the present case. He tells us, that <hi>Propriety is to be observed, even in Machines; And that the Gods are all to manage their Peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</hi> He instances in some of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Employments; but I don't find that any of them were to talk Lewdly. No. He plainly supposes the contrary. For as he goes on, <hi>If they were to speak upon</hi>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:56421:102"/>
                  <hi>the Stage it would follow of necessity, that the Expressions should be Lofty, Figurative, and Majestical.</hi> It seems then their Behaviour should be agreeable to their Greatness. Why then are not these Rules observ'd, in the <hi>Machines</hi> of <hi>Amphitrion?</hi> And as I take it, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scenity has not the Air of Majesty, nor any Alliance with the <hi>Sublime.</hi> And as for the <hi>Figurative</hi> Part, 'tis generally of the same Cut with the <hi>Lofty:</hi> The Smut shines clear, and strong, through the Metaphor, and is no better screen'd than the Sun by a Glass Window. To use <hi>Mercury</hi> thus ill, and make the God of Eloquence speak so unlike himself, is somewhat strange! But tho' the <hi>Antients</hi> knew nothing of it, there are Considerations above those of <hi>Decency.</hi> And when this happens, <hi>A Rule must rather be trespass'd on, than a Beauty left out.</hi> 'Tis Mr. <hi>Dryden's</hi> opinion in his <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> where he breaks the <hi>Unity of Time,</hi> to describe the <hi>Beauty</hi> of a Famine. <note place="margin">Pref.</note> Now Beauty is an arbitrary Advantage, and depends upon Custom and Fancy. With some People the Blackest Complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions are the handsomest. 'Tis to these <hi>African</hi> Criticks that Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> seems to make his Appeal. And without doubt he bespeaks their Favour, and strikes their Imagination luckily enough. For to lodge Divinity and Scandal together; To make
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56421:102"/>
the Gods throw <hi>Stars,</hi> like <hi>Snow-balls</hi> at one another, but especially to Court in Smut, and rally in Blasphemy, is most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably entertaining! This is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than all the Niceties of <hi>Decorum.</hi> 'Tis handsomly contriv'd to slur the Notion of a Superiour Nature, to disarm the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Religion, and make the Court A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove as Romantick as that of the <hi>Fairies.</hi> A Libertine when his Conscience is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, and Atheism sits easie upon his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, can't help being grateful upon the Occasion. Meer Interest will oblige him to cry up the Performance, and solicit for the <hi>Poets</hi> Reputation! Before I take leave of these <hi>Machines,</hi> it may not be amiss to enquire why the Gods are brought into the <hi>Spiritual Court.</hi> Now I suppose the <note place="margin">p. 1.</note> Creditableness of the Business, and the <hi>Poets</hi> Kindness to those <hi>Places,</hi> are the principal Reasons of their coming. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, He might have a farther Design in his Head, and that is, to bring <hi>Thebes</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> and to show the Antiquity of <hi>Doctors Commons.</hi> For if you will believe <hi>Mercury,</hi> this Conference between him and <hi>Phaebus</hi> was held three thousand years <note place="margin">19. Troil. and Cressid.</note> ago. Thus <hi>Shakespear</hi> makes <hi>Hector</hi> talk about <hi>Aristotles</hi> Philosophy, and calls Sr. <hi>John Old Castle, Protestant.</hi> I had not <note place="margin">The Hist. of Sr. John Old Castle.</note> mention'd this Discovery in Chronology,

but that Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> falls upon <hi>Ben John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> for making <hi>Cataline give Fire at the Face of a Cloud,</hi> before Guns were inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>By the Pattern of these pretended <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> we may guess what sort of <hi>Mortals</hi> we are likely to meet with. Neither are we mistaken. For <hi>Phaedra</hi> is bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in all Conscience, but <hi>Bromia</hi> is a meer Original. Indeed when Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> makes <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> makes the Women, little less can be expected. So much for <hi>Amphitrion.</hi>

               <p>I shall pass on to <hi>King Arthur</hi> for a <note place="margin">King Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur.</note> word or two. Now here is a strange jumble and Hotch potch of Matters, if you mind it. Here we have <hi>Genii,</hi> and <hi>Angels, Cupids, Syrens,</hi> and <hi>Devils; Venus</hi> and St. <hi>George, Pan</hi> and the <hi>Parson,</hi> the Hell of Heathenism, and the Hell of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;</hi> A fit of Smut, and then a Jest about Original Sin. And why are Truth and Fiction, Heathenism and Christianity, the most Serious and the most Trifling Things blended together, and thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Form of Diversion? Why is all this done unless it be to ridicule the whole, and make one as incredible as the other? His <hi>Airy</hi> and <hi>Earthy Spirits</hi> discourse of the first state of Devils, of their <hi>Chief</hi> of their Revolt, their Punishment, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postures.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:56421:103"/>
This Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> very Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously calls a <hi>Fairy way of Writing, which depends only on the Force of Imagination.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ep. Ded.</note> What then is the Fall of the Angels a Romance? Has it no basis of Truth, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to support it, but strength of Fancy, and Poetick Invention? After He had mention'd Hell, Devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and given us a sort of <hi>Bible</hi> description of these formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Things; I say after he had formed his Poem in this manner, I am surprized to hear him call it a <hi>Fairy kind of Writing.</hi> Is the History of <hi>Tophet</hi> no better prov'd than that of <hi>Styx?</hi> Is the Lake of <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi> and that of <hi>Phlegeton</hi> alike dreadful? And have we as much Reason to believe the Torments of <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Prometheus,</hi> as those of the Devils and Damn'd? These are lamentable Consequences! And yet I can't well see how the <hi>Poet</hi> can avoid them. But setting aside this miserable Gloss in the <hi>Dedication,</hi> the Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it self is scandalously irreligious. To droll upon the Vengeance of Heaven, and the Miseries of the Damn'd, is a sad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Christianity! Those that bring Devils upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> can hardly believe them any where else. Besides, the Effects of such an Entertainment must needs be admirable! To see Hell thus play'd with is a mighty Refreshment to a lewd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:56421:104"/>
and a byass'd Understanding. It' heartens the Young Libertine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the well-wishers to Atheism, and makes Vice bold, and enterprizing. Such Diversions serve to dispel the Gloom, and guild the Horrors of the <hi>Shades below,</hi> and are a sort of Ensurance against Damnation. One would think these <hi>Poets</hi> went upon absolute Certainty, and could demonstrate a Scheme of Infidelity. If they could, They had much better keep the Secret. The divulging it tends only to debauch Mankind, and shake the Securities of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Life. However, if they have been in the other World and find it empty, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabited, and are acquainted with all the Powers, and Places, in Being; If they can show the Impostures of Religion, and the Contradictions of Common Belief, they have something to say for themselves. Have they then infallible Proof and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematick Evidence for these Discoveries? No Man had ever the Confidence to say This: And if He should, he would be but laughed at for his Folly. No Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can exceed the Evidence of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; you may as well build a Castle in the Air, as raise a Demonstration upon a Bottom of Uncertainty. And is any Man so vain as to pretend to know the Extent of Nature, and the Stretch of Possibility,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:56421:104"/>
and the Force of the Powers Invisible? So that notwithstanding the Boldness of this <hi>Opera,</hi> there may be such a Place as Hell; And if so, a Discourse about Devils, will be no <hi>Fairy way of Writing.</hi> For a <hi>Fairy way of Writing,</hi> is nothing but a <hi>History of Fiction;</hi> A subject of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Beings; such as never had any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence in Time, or Nature. And if as Monsieur <hi>Rapin</hi> observes, <hi>Poetry</hi> requires a mixture of Truth and <hi>Fable;</hi> Mr. <hi>Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> may make his advantage, for his <hi>Play</hi> is much better founded on Reality than He was aware of.</p>
               <p>It may not be improper to consider in a word or two, what a frightfull Idea the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> give us of Hell. 'Tis describ'd by all the Circumstance of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, by every Thing dreadful to Sense, and amazing to Thought. The Place, the Company, the Duration, are all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations of Astonishment. And why has God given us this solemn warning? Is it not to awaken our Fears, and guard our Happiness; To restrain the Disorders of Appetite, and to keep us within Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and Duty? And as for the <hi>Apostate Angels,</hi> the <hi>Scriptures</hi> inform us of their lost Condition, of their Malice and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, of their active Industry and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; and all these Qualities Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:56421:105"/>
to the Bulk of their Nature, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of their Being, and the Misery of their State. In short, They are pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in all the formidable Appearances ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, to alarm our Caution, and put us upon the utmost Defence.</p>
               <p>Let us see now how Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents these unhappy Spirits, and their Place of Abode. Why very entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly! Those that have a true Tast for Atheism were never better regaled. One would think by this <hi>Play</hi> the Devils were meer Mormo's and Bugbears, fit only to fright Children and Fools. They rally upon Hell and Damnation, with a great deal of Air and Pleasantry; and appear like <hi>Robin Good-fellow,</hi> only to make the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany laugh. <hi>Philidel:</hi> Is call'd a <hi>Puling Sprite.</hi> And why so? For this pious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>He trembles at the yawning Gulph of Hell,</l>
                  <l>Nor dares approach the Flames least he should Singe</l>
                  <l>His gaudy silken Wings. <note place="margin">p. 6.</note>

                  <l>He sighs when he should plunge a Soul in Sulphur,</l>
                  <l>As with Compassion touch'd of Foolish Man.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>The answer is, <hi>What a half Devil's he.</hi>

You see how admirably it runs all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Christian Scheme! Sometimes they are <hi>Half-Devils,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Hopeful-Devils,</hi> and what you please to make sport with. <hi>Grimbald</hi> is afraid of being <hi>whooped through Hell at his return,</hi> for miscarrying in his Business. It seems there is great Leisure for Diversion! There's <hi>Whooping</hi> in Hell, instead of <hi>Weeping</hi> and <hi>Wailing!</hi> One would fancy Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> had Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Company, when these Lines were written. I know his Courage is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; But sure such Thoughts could never bear up against Solitude and a Candle!</p>
               <p>And now since he has diverted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the <hi>Terrors</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> I dont wonder he should treat those that Preach them with so much Civility! en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Poet</hi> in the Habit of a <hi>Peasant.</hi>

               <p>These are fine comprehensive stroaks! Here you have the <hi>Iliads</hi> in a Nutshell! Two or three courtly words take in the whole Clergy: And what is wanting in

Wit, is made up in Abuse, and that's as well. This is an admirable <hi>Harvest Catch,</hi> and the poor Tith-stealers stand highly indebted. They might have been tired with Cheating in <hi>Prose,</hi> had not they not been thus seasonably releiv'd in Doggrell! But now there is Musick in playing the Knave. A Countryman now may fill his Barn, and humour his ill Manners, and sing his Conscience asleep, and all under one. I dont question but these <hi>four Lines</hi> steal many a Pound in the year.

'Tis a fine portable Infection, and costs no more Carriage than the Plague.</p>
               <p>Well! the Clergy must be contented: It might possibly have been worse for them if they had been in his favour: For he has sometimes a very unlucky way of showing his Kindness. He commends the <hi>Earl of Leicester for considering the Friend,</hi>

'Tis Presum'd these Noble Persons are unconcern'd in this Character.

               <p>And now He has serv'd his Friends, he comes in the last place like a modest Man, to commend Himself.

               <p>Here the <hi>Poet</hi> tells you Providence makes Mankind by halves, huddles up the Soul, and takes the least care of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Moyety.

               <p>In this and the following page, the <hi>Redemption</hi> of the World is treated with the same respect with the <hi>Creation.</hi> The word <hi>Redeemer,</hi> which among Christians is appropriated to our Blessed Saviour, and like the Jewish Tetragrammaton peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reserv'd to the Deity; This adorable Name <hi>(Redeemer and Dear Redeemer,)</hi> is applyed to the ridiculous Don <hi>Quixote.</hi> These Insolencies are too big for the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of a Pen, and therefore I shall leave them. After this horrible abuse of the Works, and Attributes of God, he goes on to make sport with his Vengeance. He makes the Torments of Hell a very Comical Entertainment: As if they were only Flames in Painting, and Terrors in <hi>Romance.</hi> The <hi>Stygian Frogs</hi> in <hi>Aristophanes</hi> are not represented with more Levity, and Drolling.

               <p>I shall omit the mention of several outrages of this Kind, besides his deep mouth'd swearing, which is frequent, and pass on to the Second Head, which is His Abuse of the Clergy. And since Reveal'd Religion has been thus horribly treated,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:56421:109"/>
'tis no Wonder if the <hi>Ministers</hi> of it have the same Usage.</p>
               <p>And here we are likely to meet with some passages extraordinary enough. For to give Mr. <hi>Durfey</hi> his due, when he med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles with Church men he lays about him like a Knight Errant: Here his Wit and his Malice, are generally in extreams, tho' not of the same Kind. To begin. He makes the Curate <hi>Perez</hi> assist at the <note place="margin">Part. 1. p. 13.</note> ridiculous Ceremony of <hi>Don Quixots</hi> Knighting. Afterwards Squire <hi>Sancho</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing his mistake to <hi>Quixote,</hi> tells him, <hi>Ah consider dear Sir no man is born wise.</hi> And what if he was born wise? He may be <hi>Bred</hi> a Fool, if he has not a care. But how does he prove this Memorable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? Because a <hi>Bishop is no more than another man without Grace und Good Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi> I must needs say if the <hi>Poet</hi> had any share of either of these Qualities, he would be less bold with his Superiors; and not give his Clowns the Liberty to droll thus heavily upon a solemn <hi>Character.</hi> This <hi>Sancho</hi> Mr. <hi>Durfey</hi> takes care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us is <hi>a dry shrewd Country Fellow,</hi> The reason of this Character is for the strength of it somewhat surprising. 'Tis because <hi>he blunders out Proverbs upon all</hi>

To proceed. <hi>Sancho</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of his being married, because it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him from better offers. <hi>Perez</hi> the Curate is sorry for this Misfortune. <hi>For as I remember</hi> says he <hi>'twas my luck to give</hi> Teresa <hi>and you the Blessing.</hi> To this <hi>Sancho</hi> replies. <hi>A Plague on your Blessing!

                  <hi>of Fornication, good Conjunction Copulative.</hi> For this irreverence and Profaness <hi>Perez</hi> threatens him with Excommunication. <hi>Sancho</hi> tells him, <hi>I care not, I shall lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by it but a nap in the Afternoon.</hi> In his Second Part, <hi>Jodolet</hi> a Priest is call'd a <hi>Holy Cormorant,</hi> and made to dispatch <hi>half a Turkey, and a Bottle of Malaga for his Breakfast.</hi> Here one Country Girl <note place="margin">p. 3.</note> chides another for her sawcyness. <hi>D'ee</hi> (says she) <hi>make a Pimp of a Priest? San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> interposes with his usual shrewdness: <hi>A Pimp of a Priest, why is that such a Miracle?</hi> In the Second <hi>Scene</hi> the Poet Provides himself another Priest to abuse. <note place="margin">p. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Mannel</hi> the Steward calls <hi>Bernardo</hi> the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain Mr. <hi>Cuff-Cushion,</hi> and tells him a <hi>Whore is a Pulpit he loves.</hi>—In settling the <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters Mannel</hi> is given out for <hi>a witty pleasant Fellow.</hi> And now you see he comes up to Expectation.

Before they rise from Table, the <hi>Poet</hi> contrives a Quarrel between <hi>Don Quixot</hi> and <hi>Bernardo.</hi> The Priest railes on the Knight, and calls him <hi>Don Cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb</hi> &amp;c. By this time you may imagine the Knight heartily Provok'd, ready to buckle on his <hi>Bason,</hi> and draw out for the Combat, Let us hear his Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Don Quix.<hi>Oh thou old black Fox with a Fire brand in thy Tail, thou very Priest: Thou Kindler of all Mischeifs in all Nations. De'e hear Homily: Did not the Reverence I bear these Nobles—I would so thrum your Cassock you Church Vermin.</hi>

However Mr. <hi>Durfey</hi> is not so Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious as to submit: He is resolved to keep the Field against the Ladies; And endeavours to defend himself by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I know no other way in Nature to do the Characters right, but to make a Romp, speak like a Romp, and a clownish Boor blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>

               <p>By his favour, all Imitations tho' never so well Counterfeited are not proper for the <hi>Stage.</hi> To present Nature under every Appearance would be an odd under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. A Midnight <hi>Cart,</hi> or a <hi>Dunghil</hi> would be no Ornamental <hi>Scene.</hi> Nasty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and dirty Conversation are of the same kind. For <hi>Words</hi> are a Picture to the Ear, as Colours and <hi>Surface</hi> are to the Eye. Such Discourses are like dilating upon Ulcers, and Leprosies: The more
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:56421:112"/>
                  <hi>Natural,</hi> the worse; for the Disgust al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways rises with the Life of the Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Offensive Language like offensive Smells, does but make a Man's Senses a burthen, and affords him nothing but Loathing and Aversion. Beastliness in Behaviour, gives a disparaging Idea of Humane Nature, and almost makes us sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we are of the same Kind. For these reasons 'tis a Maxime in Good Breeding never to shock the Senses, or Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This Rule holds strongest before <hi>Women,</hi> and especially when they come to be entertain'd. The Diversion ought to be suited to the Audience; For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pleases which is disproportion'd to Capacity, and Gust. The Rudenesses and broad Jests of Beggars, are just as accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Ladies as their Rags, and Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. To treat Persons of Condition like the <hi>Mob,</hi> is to degrade their Birth, and affront their Breeding. It levells them with the lowest Education. For the size of a Man's Sense, and Improvement, is discovered by his Pleasures, as much as by any thing else.</p>
               <p>But to remove from <hi>Scenes</hi> of <hi>Decency,</hi> to <hi>Scenes</hi> of Wit.

               <p>The Third <hi>Part</hi> presents a set of <hi>Poppets,</hi> which is a Thought good enough; for this Play is only fit to move upon <hi>Wires.</hi> 'Tis pity these little <hi>Machines</hi> appear'd no sooner, for then the Sense, and the <hi>Actors</hi> had been well adjusted. In explaining the <hi>Persons,</hi> He acquaints us that <hi>Carasco is a Witty Man.</hi> I can't tell what the Gentleman might be in other Places, but I'm Satisfied he is a Fool in his <hi>Play.</hi> But some <hi>Poets</hi> are as great Judges of Wit, as they are an instance; And have the Theory and the Practise just alike.</p>

to be happy in his Interpretation. But to be serious. Were I the Author, I would discharge my Muse unless she prov'd kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

                  <hi>SECT. III.</hi> Remarks upon the <hi>Relapse.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Relapse</hi> shall follow <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> upon the account of some Alliance between them. And because this <hi>Author</hi> swaggers so much in his <hi>Preface,</hi> and seems to look big upon his Performance, I shall spend a few more thoughts than ordinary upon his <hi>Play,</hi> and examine it briefly in the <hi>Fable,</hi> the <hi>Moral,</hi> the <hi>Characters, &amp;c.</hi> The Fable I take to be as follows.</p>
               <p>Fashion <hi>a Lewd, Prodigal, younger Brother, is reduced to extremity: Upon his arrival from his Travels, he meets with</hi> Coupler, <hi>an old sharping Match-maker; This Man puts him upon a project of cheating his Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lord</hi> Foplington, <hi>of a rich Fortune. Young</hi> Fashion <hi>being refused a Summ of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by his Brother, goes into</hi> Couplers <hi>Plot, bubbles Sir</hi> Tunbelly <hi>of his Daughter, and makes himself Master of a fair Estate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the Form and Constitution of the <hi>Fable,</hi> I observe</p>
               <p>1<hi>st.</hi> That there is a <hi>Misnommer</hi> in the Title. The <hi>Play</hi> should not have been call'd the <hi>Relapse, or Virtue in Danger:</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:56421:115"/>
                  <hi>Lovelace,</hi> and <hi>Amanda,</hi> from whose <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi> these Names are drawn, are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Inferiour Consideration. <hi>Lovelace</hi> sinks in the middle of the <hi>Fourth</hi> Act, and we hear no more of him till towards the End of the <hi>Fifth,</hi> where he enters once more, but then 'tis as <hi>Cato</hi> did the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate house, only to go out again. And as for <hi>Amanda</hi> she has nothing to do but to stand a shock of Courtship, and carry off her Virtue. This I confess is a great task in the <hi>Play-house,</hi> but no main matter in the <hi>Play.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Intrigue,</hi> and the <hi>Discovery,</hi> the great Revolution and success, turns upon <hi>Young Fashion.</hi> He without Competition, is the Principal Person in the <hi>Comedy.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Younger Brother,</hi> or the <hi>Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Cheat,</hi> had been much a more proper Name. Now when a <hi>Poet</hi> can't rig out a <hi>Title Page,</hi> 'tis but a bad sign of his hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to the <hi>Epilogue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2<hi>ly.</hi> I observe the <hi>Moral</hi> is vitious: It points the wrong way, and puts the <hi>Prize</hi> into the wrong Hand. It seems to make <hi>Lewdness</hi> the reason of <hi>Desert,</hi> and gives <hi>Young Fashion</hi> a second Fortune, only for Debauching away his First. A short view of his <hi>Character,</hi> will make good this Reflection. To begin with him: He confesses himself a <hi>Rake,</hi> swears, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:56421:115"/>
Blasphemes, Curses, and Challenges his Elder Brother, cheats him of his Mistress, and gets him laid by the Heels in a Dog-Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel. And what was the ground of all this unnatural quarrelling and outrage? Why the main of it was only because Lord <hi>Foplington</hi> refused to supply his Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, and make good his Extravagance. This <hi>Young Fashion</hi> after all, is the <hi>Poets</hi> Man of Merit. He provides, a <hi>Plot</hi> and a Fortune, on purpose for him. To speak freely, A Lewd Character seldom wants good Luck in <hi>Comedy.</hi> So that when ever you see a thorough Libertine, you may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most swear he is in a rising way, and that the <hi>Poet</hi> intends to make him a great Man. In short; This <hi>Play</hi> perverts the End of <hi>Comedy:</hi> Which as Monsieur <hi>Rapin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves ought to regard Reformation, and publick Improvement. But the <hi>Relapser</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reflect, &amp;c. p. 131.</note> had a more fashionable Fancy in his Head. His <hi>Moral</hi> holds forth this notable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>1<hi>st.</hi> That all <hi>Younger Brothers</hi> should be careful to run out their Circumstances as Fast, and as Ill as they can. And when they have put their Affairs in this posture of Advantage, they may conclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the high Road to Wealth, and Success. For as <hi>Fashion</hi> Blasphemously applies it, <hi>Providence takes care of Men of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Relapse. p. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Merit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:56421:116"/>
2<hi>ly.</hi> That when a Man is press'd, his business is not to be govern'd by Scruples, or formalize upon Conscience and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty. The quickest Expedients are the best; For in such cases the Occasion ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies the Means, and a Knight of the <hi>Post,</hi> is as good as one of the <hi>Garter.</hi> In the</p>
               <p>3<hi>d.</hi> Place it may not be improper to look a little into the <hi>Plot.</hi> Here the <hi>Poet</hi> ought to play the Politician if ever. This part should have some stroaks, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and strains of Invention more then ordinary. There should be something that is admirable, and unexpected to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the Audience. And all this Finess must work by gentle degrees, by a due preparation of <hi>Incidents,</hi> and by Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">Reflect. p. 133.</note> which are probable. 'Tis Mr. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins</hi> remark, that without probability <hi>every Thing is lame and Faulty.</hi> Where there is no pretence to <hi>Miracle</hi> and <hi>Machine,</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters must not exceed the force of Beleif. To produce effects without proportion; and likelyhood in the Cause, is Farce, and Magick, and looks more like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring than Conduct. Let us examine the <hi>Relapser</hi> by these Rules. To discover his <hi>Plot,</hi> we must lay open somewhat more of the <hi>Fable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Lord <hi>Foplington</hi> a Town Beau, had agreed to Marry the Daughter of Sir.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:56421:116"/>
                     <hi>Tun-belly Clumsey</hi> a Country Gentleman, who lived Fifty miles from <hi>London.</hi> Notwithstanding this small distance, the Lord had never seen his Mistress, nor the Knight his Son in Law. Both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties out of their great Wisdom, leave the treating the Match to <hi>Coupler.</hi> When all the preliminaries of Settlement were adjusted, and Lord <hi>Foplington</hi> expected by Sir <hi>Tun-belly</hi> in a few days, <hi>Coupler</hi> betrays his Trust to <hi>Young Fashion.</hi> He advises him to go down before his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: To Counterfeit his Person, and pretend that the strength of his Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions brought him thither before his time, and without his Retinue. And to make him pass upon Sir <hi>Tun-belly, Coupler</hi> gives him his <hi>Letter,</hi> which was to be Lord <hi>Foplingtons</hi> Credential. <hi>Young Fashion</hi> thus provided, posts down to Sir <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belly,</hi> is received for Lord <hi>Foplington,</hi> and by the help of a little Folly and Knavery in the Family, Marries the young Lady without her Fathers Knowledge, and a week before the Appointment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Main of the Contrivance. The Counterturn in Lord <hi>Foplingtons</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing afterwards, and the Support of the main <hi>Plot,</hi> by <hi>Bulls,</hi> and <hi>Nurses</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing the Marriage, contain's little of Moment. And here we may observe that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:56421:117"/>
Lord <hi>Foplington</hi> has an unlucky Disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in his <hi>Character;</hi> This Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune sits hard upon the credibility of the Design. 'Tis true he was Formal and Fantastick, Smitten with Dress, and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, and it may be vapour'd by his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes; But his Behaviour is far from that of an Ideot. This being granted, 'tis very <note place="margin">p. 27.</note> unlikely this Lord with his five Thousand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> should leave the choise of his Mistress to <hi>Coupler,</hi> and take her Person and Fortune upon <hi>Content.</hi> To court thus blindfold, and by <hi>Proxy,</hi> does not agree with the Method of an Estate, nor the Niceness of a <hi>Beau.</hi> However the <hi>Poet</hi> makes him engage Hand over Head, without so much as the sight of her Picture. His going down to Sir <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 79.</note> was as extraordinary as his Courtship. He had never seen this Gentleman. He must know him to be beyond Measure suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and that there was no Admittance without <hi>Couplers</hi> Letter. This <hi>Letter</hi> which was, the Key to the Castle, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to take with him, and tells you <hi>'twas stolen by his Brother Tam.</hi> And for his part he neither had the Discretion to get ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor yet to produce that written by him to Sir <hi>Tun-belly.</hi> Had common Sense been consulted upon this Occasion, the <hi>Plot</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> had been at an End, and the <hi>Play</hi> had sunk
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:56421:117"/>
in the Fourth <hi>Act.</hi> The Remainder sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists purely upon the strength of Folly, and of Folly altogether improbable, and out of <hi>Character.</hi> The <hi>Salvo</hi> of Sir <hi>John Friendly's</hi> appearing at last, and vouching for Lord <hi>Foplington,</hi> won't mend the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For as the <hi>Story</hi> informs us, Lord <hi>Foplington</hi> never depended on this Reserve: <note place="margin">p. 81.</note> He knew nothing of this Gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Country, nor where he Lived. The truth is, Sir <hi>John</hi> was left in <hi>Town,</hi> and the Lord had neither concerted his journey with him, nor engaged his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. <note place="margin">p. 83.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now see how Sir. <hi>Tun-belly</hi> hangs together. This Gentleman the <hi>Poet</hi> makes a <hi>Justice</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and a <hi>Deputy Lieutenant,</hi> and seats him fifty Miles from <hi>London:</hi> But by his Character you would take him for one of <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Monsters, or some Gyant in <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Warwick.</hi> His Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is altogether <hi>Romance,</hi> and has nothing agreeable to Time, or Country. When <hi>Fashion,</hi> and <hi>Lory,</hi> went down, they find the Bridge drawn up, the Gates barr'd, and the Blunderbuss cock'd at the first civil Question. And when Sir <hi>Tun-belly</hi> had notice of this formidable Appearance, he Sallies out with the <hi>Posse</hi> of the Family, and marches against a Couple of Strangers with a <hi>Life Gaurd</hi> of Halberds, Sythes,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:56421:118"/>
and Pitchforks. And to make sure work, Young <hi>Hoyden</hi> is lock'd up at the first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Enemy. Here you have prudence and wariness to the excess of Fable, and Frensy. And yet this mighty man of suspition, trusts <hi>Coupler</hi> with the Disposal of his only Daughter, and his Estate into the Bargain. And what was this <hi>Coupler?</hi> Why, a sharper by <hi>Character,</hi> and little better by Profession. Farther. Lord <hi>Foplington</hi> and the Knight, are but a days Journey asunder, and yet by their treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Proxy, and Commission, one would Fancy a dozen Degrees of <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> betwixt them. And as for Young <hi>Fashion,</hi> excepting <hi>Couplers</hi> Letter, he has all imaginable Marks of Imposture upon him. He comes before his Time, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Retinue expected, and has nothing of the Air of Lord <hi>Foplington's</hi> Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. When Sir <hi>Tun-belly</hi> ask'd him, <hi>pray where are your Coaches and Servants my Lord?</hi> He makes a trifling excuse. <hi>Sir, that I might give you and your Fair Daughter a proof how impatient I am to be nearer akin to you, I left my Equipage to follow me, and came away Post, with only one Servant.</hi> To be in such a Hurry of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination <note place="margin">p. 59.</note> for a Person he never saw, is somewhat strange! Besides, 'tis very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely Lord <hi>Foplington</hi> should hazard his
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:56421:118"/>
Complexion on Horseback, out ride his Figure, and appear a Bridegroom in <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habille.</hi> You may as soon perswade a Peacock out of his Train, as a <hi>Beau</hi> out of his Equipage; especially upon such an Occasion. Lord <hi>Foplington</hi> would scarse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speak to his Brother just come a <hi>Shore,</hi> till the Grand Committee of <hi>Taylors, Seam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was dispatch'd. Pomp, and Curiosity were this Lords Inclination; why then should he mortifie without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, make his first Approaches thus out of Form, and present himself to his Mistress at such Disadvantage? And as this is the Character of Lord <hi>Foplington,</hi> so 'tis reasonable to suppose Sir <hi>Tunbelly</hi> acquainted with it. An enquiry into the Humour and management of a Son in Law, is very natural and Customary. So that we can't without Violence to Sense, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Sir <hi>Tunbelly</hi> a Stranger to Lord <hi>Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi>'s Singularities. These Reasons were enough in all Conscience to make Sir <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belly</hi> suspect a Juggle, and that <hi>Fashion</hi> was no better then a Counterfeit. Why then was the <hi>Credential</hi> swallow'd without chewing, why was not <hi>Hoyden</hi> lock'd up, and a pause made for farther Enquiry? Did this <hi>Justice</hi> never hear of such a Thing as Knavery, or had he ever greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to guard against it? More wary steps
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:56421:119"/>
might well have been expected from Sir <hi>Tunbelly.</hi> To run from one extream of Caution, to another of Credulity, is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable. In short, either Lord <hi>Foplington</hi> and Sir <hi>Tunbelly</hi> are Fools, or they are not. If they are, where lies the Cunning in over-reaching them? What Conquest can there be without Opposition? If they are not Fools, why does the <hi>Poet</hi> make them so? Why is their Conduct so gross, so particolour'd, and inconsistent? Take them either way, and the <hi>Plot</hi> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carries. The first supposition makes it dull, and the later, incredible. So much for the <hi>Plot.</hi> I shall now in the</p>
               <p>4<hi>th.</hi> Place touch briefly upon the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Manners</hi> in the Language of the <hi>Stage</hi> have a signification somewhat par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Rapin</hi> call them the Causes and Principles of Action. They are formed upon the Diversities of Age, and Sex, of Fortune, Capacity, and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The propriety of <hi>Manners</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in a Conformity of Practise, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; of Nature, and Behaviour. For the purpose. An old Man must not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with the Profuseness and Levity of Youth; A Gentleman must not talk like a Clown, nor a Country Girl like a Town Jilt. And when the <hi>Characters</hi> are feign'd
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:56421:119"/>
'tis <hi>Horace</hi>'s Rule to keep them Uniform, and consistent, and agreeable to their first setting out. The <hi>Poet</hi> must be careful to hold his <hi>Persons</hi> tight to their <hi>Calling</hi> and pretentions. He must not shift, and shuffle their Understandings; Let them skip from Wits to Blockheads, nor from Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to Pedants. On the other hand. If their business is playing the Fool, keep them strictly to their Duty, and never indulge them in fine Sentences. To ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage otherwise, is to desert <hi>Nature,</hi> and makes the <hi>Play</hi> appear monstrous, and Chimerical. So that instead of an <hi>Image of Life,</hi> 'tis rather an Image of Impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. To apply some of these remarks to the <hi>Relapser.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fine <hi>Berinthia,</hi> one of the Top-Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, is impudent and Profane. <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> would engage her Secrecy, and bids her Swear. She answers <hi>I do.</hi>

                  <hi>Berinthia</hi> is carried off into a Closet, and <note place="margin">p. 74.</note> Lodged in a <hi>Scene</hi> of Debauch. Here is Decency, and Reservedness, to a great exactness! Monsieur <hi>Rapin</hi> blames <hi>Ariosto,</hi> and <hi>Tasso,</hi> for representing two of their Women over free, and airy. These <hi>Poets</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reflect. p. 40.</note> says he, <hi>rob Women of their Character, which is Modesty.</hi> Mr. <hi>Rymer</hi> is of the same Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: His words are these. <hi>Nature knows no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Manners which so properly, and particularly distinguish a Woman, as her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tragedies of the last Age consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 113, 114.</note>—<hi>An impudent Woman is fit only to be kicked, and expos'd in Comedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Berinthia</hi> appears in <hi>Comedy</hi> 'tis true; but neither to be <hi>kick'd,</hi> nor <hi>expos'd.</hi> She makes a Considerable Figure, has good Usage, keeps the best Company, and goes off without Censure, or Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Let us now take a Turn or two with Sir <hi>Tun-belly's</hi> Heiress of 1500 pounds a year. This Young Lady swears, talks smut, and is upon the matter just as rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manner'd as <hi>Mary the Buxsome.</hi> 'Tis plain the <hi>Relapser</hi> copyed Mr. <hi>Durfey's</hi> Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which is a sign he was somewhat Pinch'd. Now this <hi>Character</hi> was no great Beauty in <hi>Buxsome;</hi> But it becomes the Knights Daughter much worse. <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi> was a poor Pesant, which made her Rudeness more natural, and expected. But <hi>Deputy Lieutenants</hi> Children don't
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56421:120"/>
use to appear with the Behaviour of Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars. To breed all People alike, and make no distinction between a <hi>Seat,</hi> and a <hi>Cottage,</hi> is not over artful, nor very cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious to the Country Gentlemen. The <hi>Relapser</hi> gives <hi>Miss</hi> a pretty Soliloquy, I'll transcribe it for the <hi>Reader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She swears by her Maker, <hi>'tis well I have a Husband a coming, or I'de Marry</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 59.</note> 
                  <hi>the Baker I would so. No body can knock at the Gate, but presently I must be lock'd up, and here's the Young Gray-hound—can run loose about the Hoase all day long, she can, 'tis very well!</hi> Afterwards her Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is too Lewd to be quoted. Here is a Compound of Ill Manners, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction! Is this a good Resemblance of Quality, a Description of a great Heiress, and the effect of a Cautious Education? By her Coarsness you would think her Bred upon a Common, and by her Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in the Nursery of the <hi>Play-house.</hi> I suppose the <hi>Relapser</hi> Fancies the calling her <hi>Miss Hoyden</hi> is enough to justifie her Ill Manners. By his favour, this is a Mistake. To represent her thus unhewn, he should have suited her Condition to her Name, a little better. For there is no Charm in <hi>Words</hi> as to matters of Breeding, An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fashionable Name won't make a Man a Clown. Education is not form'd upon
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56421:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sounds, and Syllables, but upon Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and Quality. So that if he was resolv'd to have shown her thus unpolish'd, he should have made her keep <hi>Sheep,</hi> or brought her up at the <hi>Wash-Boul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Tun-belly</hi> accosts Young <hi>Fashion</hi> much <note place="margin">p. 61.</note> at the same rate of Accomplishment. My Lord,—<hi>I humbly crave leave to bid you Welcome in Cup of Sack-wine.</hi> One would imagine the <hi>Poet</hi> was overdozed before he gave the <hi>Justice</hi> a Glass. For <hi>Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine</hi> is too low for a <hi>Petty Constable.</hi> This peasantly expression agrees neither with the Gentlemans Figure, nor with the rest of his Behaviour. I find we should have a Creditable <hi>Magistracy,</hi> if the <hi>Relapser</hi> had the Making them. Here the <hi>Characters</hi> are pinch'd in Sense, and stinted to short Allowance. At an other time they are over-indulged, and treated above Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.</p>
               <p>For the purpose. Vanity and Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing is Lord <hi>Foplingtons</hi> part. To let him speak without Aukwardness, and Affectation, is to put him out of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There must be Gumm and stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fening in his Discourse to make it natural. However, the <hi>Relapser</hi> has taken a fancy to his Person, and given him some of the most Gentile raillery in the whole <hi>Play.</hi> To give an Instance or two. This Lord
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:56421:121"/>
in Discourse with <hi>Fashion</hi> forgets his Name, flies out into Sense, and smooth expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, out talks his Brother, and abating the starch'd Similitude of a <hi>Watch,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers nothing of Affectation, for almost <note place="margin">p. 42.</note> a <hi>Page</hi> together. He relapses into the same Intemperance of good Sense, in an other Dialogue between him and his Brother. I shall cite a little of it.</p>
               <p>Y. <hi>Fash.</hi>Unless you are so kind to assist me in redeeming my Annuity, I know no Remedy, but to go take a Purse.</p>
               <p>L. <hi>Fopl.</hi>Why Faith <hi>Tam</hi>—to give <note place="margin">p. 43.</note> you my Sense of the Thing, I do think taking a Purse the best Remedy in the World, for if you succeed, you are releiv'd that way, if you are taken—you are reliev'd to'ther.</p>
               <p>Fashion <hi>being disappointed of a supply quarrels his Elder Brother, and calls him</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 44.</note> the Prince of Coxcombs.</p>
               <p>L. <hi>Fopl.</hi>Sir I am proud of being at the Head of so prevailing a party.</p>
               <p>Y. <hi>Fash.</hi>Will nothing then provoke thee? draw Coward.</p>
               <p>L. <hi>Fopl.</hi>Look you <hi>Tam,</hi> your poverty makes your Life so burdensome to you, you would provoke me to a Quarrel, in hopes either to slip through my Lungs into my Estate, or else to get your self run through the Guts, to put an end to your Pain. But I shall disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point you in both. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

This Drolling has too much Spirit, the Air of it is too free, and too hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly turn'd for Lord <hi>Foplingtons</hi> Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. I' grant the <hi>Relapser</hi> could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to lose these Sentences. The Scene would have suffer'd by the Omission. But then he should have contriv'd the matter so, as that they might, have been spoken by Young <hi>Fashion</hi> in <hi>Asides,</hi> or by some other more proper Person. To go on. Miss <hi>Hoyden</hi> sparkles too much in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. The <hi>Poet</hi> must needs give her a <note place="margin">p. 64. At top.</note> shining Line or two, which serves only to make the rest of her dullness the more remarkable. Sir. <hi>Tun-belly</hi> falls into the same Misfortune of a Wit, and rallies above the force of his Capacity. But the place having a mixture of Profaness, I <note place="margin">p. 85.</note> shall forbear to cite it. Now to what purpose should a Fools Coat be embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd? Finery in the wrong place is but expensive Ridiculousness. Besides, I don't perceive the <hi>Relapser</hi> was in any Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be thus liberal. And when a <hi>Poet</hi> is not overstock'd, to squander away his Wit among his <hi>Block-heads,</hi> is meer Distraction. His men of Sense will smart for this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality. <hi>Lovelace</hi> in his discourse of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> shall be the first Instance. <hi>Friendship</hi> (says he) <hi>is said to be a plant of tedious growth, its Root composed of tender</hi> Fibers,

nice in their Tast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By this Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Palate of a <hi>Fiber,</hi> should be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more <hi>nice</hi> and distinguishing, then the <hi>Poets</hi> Judgment. Let us examin some more of his Witty People. Young <hi>Fashion</hi> fancies by <hi>Misses</hi> forward Behaviour, she would have a whole <hi>Kennel</hi> of <hi>Beaux</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her at <hi>London.</hi> And then <hi>Hey to the Park, and the Play, and the Church, and the</hi>

                  <hi>Devil.</hi> Here I conceive the ranging of the Period is amiss. For if he had put the <hi>Play,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> together, the Order of Nature, and the Air of Probability had been much better observ'd.</p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>Coupler</hi> being out of Breath in coming up stairs to <hi>Fashion,</hi> asks him <hi>why the—canst thou not lodge upon the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Y. <hi>Fash.</hi>Because I love to lye as near Heaven as I can. <hi>One would think a Spark just come off his Travels, and had made the</hi> Tour <hi>of</hi> Italy <hi>and</hi> France, <hi>might have rallied with a better Grace! However if he lodg'd in a</hi> Garret, <hi>'tis a good</hi> Local <hi>jest. I had almost forgot one pretty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Sentence of</hi> Fashion <hi>to</hi> Lory. I <note place="margin">p. 15.</note> shall shew thee <hi>(says he)</hi> the excess of my Passion by being very calm. <hi>Now since this</hi> Gentleman <hi>was in a vein of talking Philosophy to his Man, I'm sorry he broke of so quickly. Had he gone on and shown</hi>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:56421:123"/>
him the <hi>Excess</hi> of a Storm and no Wind stirring, the Topick had been spent, and the Thought improv'd to the utmost.</p>
               <p>Let us now pass on to <hi>Worthy,</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsers</hi> fine Gentleman. This Spark sets up for Sense, and Address, and is to have nothing of Affectation or Conscience to spoil his Character. However to say no more of him, he grows Foppish in the last <hi>Scene,</hi> and courts <hi>Amanda</hi> in Fustian, and Pedantry. First, He gives his Periods a turn of Versification, and talks <hi>Prose</hi> to her in <hi>Meeter.</hi> Now this is just as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as it would be to <hi>Ride</hi> with one Leg, and <hi>Walk</hi> with the other. But let him speak for himself. His first business is to bring <hi>Amanda</hi> to an Aversion for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; And therefore he perswades her to <hi>Rouse up that Spirit Women ought to bear;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">p. 99.</note> 
                  <hi>and slight your God if he neglects his Angel.</hi> He goes on with his Orisons. <hi>With Arms of Ice receive his Cold Embraces and keep your Fire for those that come in Flames.</hi> Fire and Flames, is Mettal upon Mettal; 'Tis false Heraldry. <hi>Extend the Arms of Mercy to his Aid. His zeal may give him Title to your Pity, altho' his Merit can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not claim your Love.</hi> Here you have <hi>Arms</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> brought in again by Head and shoulders. I suppose the design was to keep up the Situation of the <hi>Allegory.</hi> But the latter
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:56421:123"/>
part of the Speech is very Pithy. He would have her resign her Vertue out of Civility, and abuse her Husband on Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of good Nature. <hi>Worthy</hi> pursues his point, and Rises in his Address. He falls into a Fit of Dissection, and hopes to gain his Mistress by Cutting his Throat. He is for <hi>Ripping up his Faithful Breast,</hi> to prove the Reality of his Passion. Now when a Man Courts with his Heart in his Hand, it must be great Cruelty to refuse him! No Butcher could have Thought of a more moving Expedient! However, <hi>Amanda</hi> continues obstinate, and is not in the usual Humour of the <hi>Stage.</hi> Upon this, like a well bred Lover he seizes her by Force, and threatens to Kill her. <hi>Nay struggle not for all's in vain, or Death, or Victory, I am determin'd.</hi> In this rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">p. 100.</note> the Lady proves too nimble, and slips through his Fingers. Upon this disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, he cries, <hi>there's Divinity about her, and she has dispenc'd some Portion on't to me.</hi> His Passion is Metamorphos'd in the Turn of a band: He is refin'd into a <hi>Platonick</hi> Admirer, and goes off as like a <hi>Town Spark</hi> as you would wish. And so much for the <hi>Poets</hi> fine Gentleman.</p>
               <p>I should now examine the <hi>Relapser's Thoughts and Expressions,</hi> which are two other Things of Consideration in a <hi>Play</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:56421:124"/>
The <hi>Thoughts</hi> or <hi>Sentiments are the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rapin Reflect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>of the Manners, as Words are of the Thoughts.</hi> But the view of the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi> has in some measure prevented this Enquiry. Leaving this Argument there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I shall consider his <hi>Play</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Three Unities</hi> of Time, Place, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And here the <hi>Reader</hi> may please to take notice, that the Design of these Rules, is to conceal the Fiction of the <hi>Stage,</hi> to make the <hi>Play</hi> appear Natural, and to give it an Air of Reality, and <hi>Conversation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The largest compass for the first <hi>Unity</hi> is Twenty Four Hours: But a lesser pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is more regular. To be exact, the Time of the History, or <hi>Fable,</hi> should not exceed that of the <hi>Representation:</hi> Or in other words, the whole Business of the <hi>Play,</hi> should not be much longer than the Time it takes up in <hi>Playing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second <hi>Unity</hi> is that of <hi>Place.</hi> To observe it, the <hi>Scene</hi> must not wander from one Town, or Country to another. It must continue in the same House, Street, or at farthest in the same City, where it was first laid. The Reason of this Rule depends upon the <hi>First.</hi> Now the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of <hi>Time</hi> being strait, that of <hi>Space</hi> must bear a Correspondent Proportion.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:56421:124"/>
Long journeys in <hi>Plays</hi> are impracticable. The Distances of <hi>Place</hi> must be suited to Leisure, and Possibility, otherwise the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position will appear unnatural and absurd. The</p>
               <p>Third <hi>Unity</hi> is that of <hi>Action;</hi> It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in contriving the chief Business of the <hi>Play</hi> single, and making the concerns of one Person distinguishably great above the rest. All the Forces of the <hi>Stage</hi> must as it were serve Under one <hi>General:</hi> And the lesser Intrigues or Underplots, have some Relation to the Main. The very Oppositions must be useful, and appear on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be Conquer'd, and Countermin'd. To represent Two considerable Actions independent of each other, Destroys the beauty of Subordination, weakens the Contrivance, and dilutes the pleasure. It splits the <hi>Play,</hi> and makes the <hi>Poem</hi> double. He that would see more upon this subject <note place="margin">Discourse des Trois Unitez. pt. 3d.</note> may consult <hi>Corneille.</hi> To bring these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks to the Case in hand. And here we may observe how the <hi>Relapser</hi> fails in all the <hi>Rules</hi> above mention'd.</p>
               <p>1<hi>st.</hi> His <hi>Play</hi> by modest Computation takes up a weeks Work, but five days you must allow it at the lowest. One day must be spent in the First, Second, and part of the Third <hi>Act,</hi> before Lord <hi>Foplington</hi> sets forward to Sir <hi>Tun-belly.</hi> Now the Length
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:56421:125"/>
of the Distance, the Pomp of the Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and the Niceness of the Person being consider'd; the journey down, and up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, cannot be laid under four days. To put this out of doubt, Lord, <hi>Foplington</hi> is <note place="margin">p. 88.</note> particularly careful to tell <hi>Coupler,</hi> how concern'd he was not to overdrive, <hi>for fear of disordering his Coach-Horses.</hi> The Laws of <hi>Place,</hi> are no better observ'd than those of <hi>Time.</hi> In the Third <hi>Act</hi> the <hi>Play</hi> is in <hi>Town,</hi> in the Fourth <hi>Act</hi> 'tis stroll'd Fifty Miles off, and in the Fifth <hi>Act</hi> in <hi>London</hi> again. Here <hi>Pegasus</hi> stretches it to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose! This <hi>Poet</hi> is fit to ride a Match with Witches. <hi>Juliana Cox</hi> never Switched a Broom stock with more Expedition! This is exactly</p>
               <p>Titus <hi>at</hi> Walton Town, <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>at</hi> Isling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>
               <p>One would think by the probability of matters, the <hi>Plot</hi> had been stolen from Dr. <hi>O—s.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Poet's</hi> Success in the last <hi>Vnity</hi> of <hi>Action</hi> is much the same with the former. <hi>Lovelace, Amanda,</hi> and <hi>Berinthia,</hi> have no share in the main Business. These Second rate <hi>Characters</hi> are a detatched Body: Their Interest is perfectly Foreign, and they are neither Friends, nor Enemies to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:56421:125"/>
the <hi>Plot. Young Fashion</hi> does not so much as see them till the Close of the Fifth <hi>Act,</hi> and then they meet only to fill the <hi>Stage:</hi> And yet these <hi>Persons</hi> are in the <hi>Poets</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count very considerable; Insomuch that he has misnamed his <hi>Play</hi> from the Figure of two of them. This strangness of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> distinct Company, and inconnexion of Affairs, destroys the Unity of the <hi>Poem.</hi> The contrivance is just as wise as it would be to cut a Diamond in two. There is a loss of Lustre in the Division. Increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Number, abates the Value, and by making it more, you make it less.</p>
               <p>Thus far I have examin'd the <hi>Dramatick</hi> Merits of the <hi>Play.</hi> And upon enquiry, it appears a Heap of Irregularities. There is neither Propriety in the <hi>Name,</hi> nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance in the <hi>Plot,</hi> nor Decorum in the <hi>Characters.</hi> 'Tis a thorough Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Nature, and impossible in <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Place.</hi> Its <hi>Shining Graces</hi> as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <note place="margin">Pref.</note> calls them, are <hi>Blasphemy</hi> and <hi>Baudy,</hi> together with a mixture of <hi>Oaths,</hi> and <hi>Cursing.</hi> Upon the whole; The <hi>Relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser's</hi> Judgment, and his Morals, are pretty well adjusted. The <hi>Poet,</hi> is not much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than 'the <hi>Man.</hi> As for the <hi>Profane</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">see Chap. 2d.</note> part, 'tis hideous and superlative. But this I have consider'd elsewhere. All that I shall observe here is, that the Author was
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:56421:126"/>
sensible of this Objection. His Defence in his <hi>Preface</hi> is most wretched: He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to know nothing of the Matter, and that <hi>'tis all Printed;</hi> Which only proves his Confidence equal to the rest of his Virtues. To out-face Evidence in this manner, is next to the affirming there's no such Sin as <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> which is the greatest Blasphemy of all. His Apology consists in railing at the <hi>Clergy;</hi> a certain sign of ill Principles, and ill Manners. This He does at an unusual rate of Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Spite. He calls them the Saints with Screw'd <hi>Faces, and wry Mouths.</hi> And after a great deal of scurrilous Abuse too gross to be mention'd, he adds; <hi>If any Man happens to be offended at a story of a Cock and a Bull, and a Priest and a Bull-dog, I</hi>

And that the <hi>Massilienses</hi> did well <note place="margin">cap. 6.</note> in clearing the Country of them. <hi>Seneca</hi> complains heartily of the Extravagance and Debauchery of the Age: And how forward People were to improve in that which was naught. That scarce any Body would apply themselves to the Study of Nature and Morality, unless when the <hi>Play-House</hi> was shut, or the Weather foul. That there was no body to teach <hi>Philosophy,</hi> because there was no body to Learn it: But that the <hi>Stage</hi> had <hi>Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,</hi> and Company enough. This Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application of time and Fancy, made Knowledge in so ill a Condition. This was the Cause the Hints of Antiquity were no better pursued; that some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions were sunk, and that Humane Reason grew Downwards rather than <note place="margin">Natural Quest.

               <hi>Plutark</hi> are dangerous to corrupt Young People; And therefore <hi>Stage</hi> Poetry when it grows too hardy, and Licentious, ought to be checkt. This was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of these Celebrated <hi>Authors</hi> with respect to <hi>Theatres:</hi> They Charge them with the Corruption of Principles, and Manners, and lay in all imaginable Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against them. And yet these Men had seldom any thing but this World in their Scheme; and form'd their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only upon Natural Light, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Experience. We see then to what sort of Conduct we are oblig'd.

            <p>To these Testimonies I shall add a Couple of <hi>Poets,</hi> who both seem good Judges of the Affair in Hand.</p>

            <p>About the Year 1580, there was a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition made to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of <hi>Play-Houses.</hi> 'Tis somewhat remarkable, and therefore I shall tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe some part of the Relation.</p>

Il faut ignorer sa Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion pour ne pas connoître l'horreur qu'elle a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quée dans tous les temps des Spectacles, &amp; de la Comedie en particulier. Les saints Peres la con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damnent dans leurs écrits; Ils la regardent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me un reste du paganisme, &amp; Comme une école d' impureté. L' Eglise l' a toûjours regardée avec abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, &amp; si elle n'a pas absolument rejetté de son sein ceux qui exercent ce mêtier infame &amp; seandaleux, elle les prive publiquement des Sacre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, &amp; n' oublie rien pour marquer en toutes ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countres son aversion pour cet ètat &amp; pour l' inspirer a ses Enfans. Des Rituels de Dioceses tres reglés les mettent au nombre des personnes que les Curés sont obligés de traiter comme excommunies; Celui de Paris les joint aux Sorciers, &amp; aux Magiciens, &amp; les regarde comme manifestement infames; Le Eveques les plus saints leur font refuser publiquement, les Sacremens; Nous avons veu un des premiers Eveques de France ne vouloir pas par cette raison re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cevoir au mariage un homme de cet état; un autre ne vouloir pas leur accorder la terre Sainte; Et dans</hi>

               <hi>Il est donc impossible de justifyer la Comedie sans vouloir condamner l' Eglise, les saints peres, les plus saint Prelats, mais il ne l' est pas moins de justifiër ceux qui par leur assistance a ces spectacles non seule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prennent part au mal qui s'y fait, mais contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buent en même temps á retenir ces malheureux mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres de Satan dans une profession, qui les separant des Sâcremens de l' Eglise les met dans un état per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuel de peché &amp; hors de salut s'ils ne l' abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</hi>—</p>

The Holy <hi>Fathers</hi> condemn them in their writings; They look upon them as reliques of Heathenism, and Schools of Debauchery. They have been always abominated by the Church; And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding those who are concern'd in this Scandalous Profession; are not absolutely expell'd by a Formal Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, yet She publickly refuses them the Sacraments, and omits nothing upon all occasions, to show her aversion for this Employment, and to transfuse
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:56421:134"/>
the same sentiments into her Children. The <hi>Rituals</hi> of the best govern'd Dioceses, have ranged the <hi>Players</hi> among those whom the Parish Priests are oblig'd to treat as Excommunicated Persons. The <hi>Ritual</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> joyns them with Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and Magicians, and looks upon them as notoriously infamous; The most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Bishops for Piety, have publickly denied them the Sacraments: For this reason, we our selves have known one of the most considerable Bishops in <hi>France;</hi> turn back a <hi>Player</hi> that came to be Married; And an other of the same order, refused to bury them in Consecrated Ground: And by the <hi>Orders</hi> of a Bishop, who is much more illustrious for his worth, for his Piety, and the Strictness of his Life, than for the <hi>Purple</hi> in his Habit; They are thrown amongst For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators, Usurers, Blasphemers, Lewd Women, and declar'd Excommunicates, amongst the Infamous, and Simoniacal, and other Scandalous Persons who are in the List of those who ought publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be barr'd Communion.</p>
               <p>Unless therfore we have a mind to condemn the Church, the Holy Fathers, and the most holy Bishops, 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to justifie <hi>Plays;</hi> neither is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of those less impracticable, who
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:56421:134"/>
by their Countenance of these Diversions, not only have their share of the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief there done, but contribute at the same time to fix these unhappy Ministers of Satan in a Profession, which by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving them of the Sacraments of the Church, leaves them under a constant necessity of Sinning, and out of all hopes of being saved, unless they give it over.—</p>
            </q>
            <p>From the general Unlawfulness of <hi>Plays,</hi> the Bishop proceeds to argue more strongly against seeing them at times which are more particularly devoted to Piety, and Humiliation: And therefore he strickly forbids his Diocess the <hi>Play-House</hi> in <hi>Advent, Lent,</hi> or under any publick <hi>Calamity.</hi> And at last concludes in this Manner.</p>
            <p>
               <q>As for the Case of <hi>Players</hi> both Men, and Women, we expresly forbid all our Rectors, Pastors, and Confessours, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to the Sacraments, unless they shall repent them of their Crime, make proof of their Reformation, renounce their <hi>Business,</hi> and retrieve the Scandal they have given, by such publick Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as we shall think proper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn them. Made and Decreed at <hi>Arras</hi> the fourth day of <hi>December</hi> 1695.</q>

I shall now in the Third</p>
            <p>Place, give a short account of the sense of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church concerning the <hi>Stage:</hi> And first I shall instance in her <hi>Councils.</hi>

            <p>The Council of <hi>Illiberis,</hi> or <hi>Collioure</hi> in <note place="margin">Ann. 305. Can. 67.</note> 
               <hi>Spain,</hi> decrees,</p>
            <p>
               <q>That it shall not be lawful for any Woman who is either in full Communion or a probationer for Baptism, to Marry, or Entertain any <hi>Comedians</hi> or <hi>Actors;</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever takes this Liberty shall be Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</q>

            <p>The First Council of <hi>Arles,</hi> runs thus, <note place="margin">Ann. 314. Can. 5.</note> 
               <q>Concerning <hi>Players,</hi> we have thought fit to Excommunicate them as long as they continue to <hi>Act.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Second Council of <hi>Arles</hi> made their <note place="margin">Ann. 452.</note> 20<hi>th</hi> Canon to the same purpose, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in the same words.</p>
            <p>The Third Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> of which <note place="margin">Ann. 397. Can. 11.</note> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> was a Member, ordains,</p>
            <p>
               <q>That the Sons of Bishops, or other Clergy-men should not be permitted to furnish out Publick <hi>Shews,</hi> or <hi>Plays</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Secula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula, which manifestly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the Stage.</note> or be prelent at them: Such sort of Pagan <hi>Entertainments</hi> being forbidden all the <hi>Laity.</hi> It being always unlawful for all Christians to come amongst <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:56421:135"/>
This last branch shews the <hi>Canon</hi> was Principally levell'd against the <hi>Play-House:</hi> And the reason of the Prohibition, holds every jot as strong against the <hi>English,</hi> as against the <hi>Roman Stage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the 35th <hi>Canon</hi> of this <hi>Council</hi> 'tis decreed,</p>
            <p>
               <q>That <hi>Actors</hi> or others belonging to the <hi>Stage,</hi> who are either <hi>Converts,</hi> or <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> upon a Relapse, shall not be denied Admission into the Church.</q> This is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof, that <hi>Players</hi> as long as they kept to their Employment were bar'd <hi>Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another <hi>African Council</hi> declares,</p>
            <p>
               <q>That the Testimony of People of ill <note place="margin">Ann. 424. Can. 96.</note> Reputation, of <hi>Players,</hi> and others of such scandalous Employments, shall not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against any Person.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Second <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chaalon</hi> sets <note place="margin">Concil. Cabilon. Ann. 813. Can. 9.</note> forth,</p>
            <p>
               <q>That Clergy men ought to abstain from all over-engaging Entertainments in Musick or <hi>Show. (oculorum auriumque illecebris.)</hi> And as for the smutty, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Insolence of <hi>Players,</hi> and Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foons, let them not only decline the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it themselves, but likewise conclude the <hi>Laity</hi> oblig'd to the same Conduct.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I could cite many more Authorities of this Kind, but being conscious of the Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56421:136"/>
of the <hi>Age,</hi> I shall forbear, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Testimony of the <hi>Fathers.</hi>

            <p>
               <q>Tis not lawful (says he) for us to be <note place="margin">Libr. 3. ad Autol.</note> present at the <hi>Prizes</hi> of your <hi>Gladiators</hi> least by this means we should be <hi>Accessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> to the Murthers there committed.

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula.</note> least our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses should be tinctur'd, and disoblig'd, with Indecency, and Profaness. The Tragical Distractions of <hi>Tereus</hi> and <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estes,</hi> are Nonsense to us. We are for seeing no Representations of Lewdness. The Stage-Adulteries of the <hi>Gods,</hi> and <hi>Hero's,</hi> are unwarrantable Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And so much the worse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Mercenary <hi>Players</hi> set them off with all the Charms and Advantages of Speaking. God forbid that <hi>Christians</hi> who are remarkable for Modesty, and Reserv'dness; who are obliged to Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and train'd up in Virtue, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid I say, that we should dishonour our Thoughts, much less our Practise, with such Wickedness as This!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> who liv'd at the latter end of this Century is copious upon this subject; I shall translate but some Part of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:56421:136"/>
it. In his Apologetick. He thus addresses <note place="margin">Chap. 38.</note> the Heathens.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We keep off from your publick <hi>Shews,</hi> because we can't understand the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their Original. There's Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and Idolatry in the Case: And we dislike the Entertainment because we dislike the reason of its Institution. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, We have nothing to do with the Frensies of the <hi>Race-Ground,</hi> the Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Play-House,</hi> or the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Bear-Garden.</hi> The <hi>Epicureans</hi> had the Liberty to state the Notion, and determine the Object of Pleasure. Why can't we have the same Privilege? What Offence is it then if we differ from you in the Idea of Satisfaction? If we won't understand to brighten our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and live pleasantly, where's the harm? If any body has the worst on't, 'tis only our selves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His Book <hi>de Spectaculis</hi> was wrote on purpose to diswade the Christians, from the publick Diversions of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> of which the <hi>Play-House</hi> was one. In his first Chapter He gives them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, <q>That the Tenour of their Faith, the Reason of Principle, and the Order of Discipline, had bar'd them the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of the <hi>Town.</hi> And therefore He exhorts them to refresh their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:56421:137"/>
to run up to their Baptism, and recollect their first Engagements. For without care, Pleasure is a strange bewitching Thing. When it gets the Ascendant, 'twill keep on Ignorance for an Excuse of Liberty, make a man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science wink, and suborn his Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himself.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>But as he goes on, some peoples Faith <note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> is either too full of Scruples, or too bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of Sense. Nothing will serve to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them but a plain Text of <hi>Scripture,</hi> They hover in uncertainty because 'tis not said as expresly thou shalt not go to the <hi>Play-House,</hi> as 'tis thou shalt not Kill. But this looks more like Fencing than Argument. For we have the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the prohibition tho' not the sound, in the first <hi>Psalm. Blessed is the Man that walks not in the Council of the Ungodly, nor stands in the way of Sinners, nor sits in the Seat of the Scornful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Censors</hi> whose business 'twas to <note place="margin">Ibid. Cap. 10.</note> take care of Regularity and Manners, look'd on these <hi>Play-Houses</hi> as no other than <hi>Batteries</hi> upon Virtue and Sobriety, and for this reason often pull'd them down before they were well built so that here we can argue from the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents</hi> of meer <hi>Nature,</hi> and plead the <hi>Heathens</hi> against themselves. Upon this
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:56421:137"/>
view <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, when he built his <hi>Dramatick</hi> Bawdy-House, clapp'd a <hi>Chappel</hi> a Top on't. He would not let it go under the Name of a Play-House, but conven'd the people to a Solemn Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and called it <hi>Venus's</hi> Temple; Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to understand at the same time that there were <hi>Benches</hi> under it for Diversion. He was afraid if he had not gone this way to work, The <hi>Censors</hi> might afterwards have razed the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and branded his Memory. Thus a Scandalous pile of Building was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected: The Temple, cover'd the <hi>Play-House,</hi> and Discipline was baffled by <hi>Superstition.</hi> But the Design is notably suited to the Patronage of <hi>Bacchus</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The Play-houses were dedicated to Baccbus.</note> and <hi>Venus.</hi> These two Confederate Devils of Lust and Intemperance, do well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The very Functions of the <hi>Players</hi> resemble their <hi>Protectors,</hi> and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Service and Acknowledgment. Their Motion is effeminate, and their Gestures vitious and Significant: And thus they worship the Luxury of one <hi>Idoll,</hi> and the Lewdness of the other.</p>
               <p>And granting the Regards of Quality, <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 15.</note> the Advantages of Age, or Temper, may fortifie some People; granting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty secur'd, and the Diversion as it were refin'd by this Means: Yet a Man
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:56421:138"/>
must not expect to stand by perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and impregnable. No body can be pleas'd without Sensible Impressions. Nor can such Perceptions be received without a Train of Passions attending them. These Consequences will be sure to work back upon their Causes, solicite the Fancy, and heighten the Original Pleasure. But if a Man pretends to be a <hi>Stoick</hi> at <hi>Plays,</hi> he falls under another Imputation. For where there is no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, there can be no Pleasure: And then the <hi>Spectator</hi> is very much Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, in going where he gets no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his Pains. And if this were all; I suppose Christians have something else to do than to ramble about to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 22.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Even those very Magistrates who abet the <hi>Stage,</hi> discountenance the <hi>Players.</hi> They stigmatize their <hi>Character,</hi> and cramp their Freedoms. The whole Tribe of them is thrown out of all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Privilege. They are neither suffer'd to be Lords, nor Gentlemen: To come within the <hi>Senate,</hi> or harangue the People, or so much as to be Members of a <hi>Common-Council.</hi> Now what Caprice and Inconsistency is this! To love what we punish, and lessen those whom we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire! To cry up the Mystery, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:56421:138"/>
the practise; For a Man to be as it were eclips'd upon the score of Merit is certainly an odd sort of Justice! True. But the Inference lies stronger another way. What a Confession then is this of an Ill Business; when the very Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it is not without Infamy?</p>
               <p>Since therefore Humane Prudence has thought fit to degrade the <hi>Stage,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Divertingness of it. Since Pleasure can't make them an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Here, nor shelter them from Censure. <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 23.</note> How will They be able to stand the shock of Divine Justice, and what <hi>Reckoning</hi> have they <hi>Reason</hi> to expect Hereafter?</p>
               <p>All things consider'd 'tis no wonder such People should fall under <hi>Possession.</hi> God knows we have had a sad Example of this already. A certain Woman went <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 26.</note> to the <hi>Play-House,</hi> and brought the Devil Home with Her. And when the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Spirit was press'd in the <hi>Exorcism</hi> and ask'd how he durst attack a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. I have done nothing (says he) but what I can justify. For I seiz'd her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my own Ground. Indeed, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Instances have we of others who have apostatiz'd from God, by Correspondence with the Devil? What <hi>Communion has Light with Darkness? No Man can serve</hi>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:56421:139"/>
                  <hi>two Masters,</hi> nor have Life and Death in him at the same time.</p>
               <p>Will you not then avoid this Seat of <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 27.</note> Infection? The very Air suffers by their Impurities; And they almost Pronounce the Plague. What tho' the performance may be in some measure pretty and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining? What tho' Innocence, yes and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue too, shines through some part of it? 'Tis not the custom to prepare Poyson unpalatable, nor make up Ratzbane with Rhubarb and Sena. No. To have the Mischief speed, they must oblige the Sense, and make the Dose pleasant. Thus the Devil throws in a Cordial Drop to make the Draught go down; And steals some few Ingredients from the <hi>Dispensatory</hi> of Heaven. In short, look upon all the engaging Sentences of the Stage; Their flights of Fortitude, and Philosophy, the Loftiness of their Stile, the Musick of the Cadence, and the Finess of the Conduct; Look upon it only I say as Honey dropping from the Bowels of a Toad, or the Bag of a Spider: Let your Health over-rule your Pleasure, and don't die of a little <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorishness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In earnest Christian, our time for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment is not yet: you are two cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 28.</note> and ill managed if you are so violent
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:56421:139"/>
for Delight. And let me tell you, no wiser than you should be, if you count such Things Satisfaction. Some Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers placed their Happiness in bare Tranquillity. Easiness of Thought, and Absence of Pain, was all they aim'd at. But this it seems won't Satisfie Thee. Thou liest sighing and hankering after the <hi>Play-house.</hi> Prethee recollect thy self: Thou knowest Death ought to be our Pleasure, And therefore I hope Life may be a little without it. Are not our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires the same with the Apostles, <hi>To be Dissolv'd and to be with Christ.</hi> Let us act up to our pretentions, and let Pleasure be true to Inclination.</p>
               <p>But if you can't wait for Delight; if <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 29.</note> you must be put into present Possession, wee'l cast the Cause upon that Issue. Now were you not unreasonable, you would perceive the Liberalities of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and find your self almost in the midst of Satisfaction. For what can be more transporting than the Friendship of Heaven, and the Discovery of Truth, than the Sense of our Mistakes, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our Sins? What greater Pleasure can there be, than to scorn being <hi>Pleas'd?</hi> To contemn the World? And to be a Slave to Nothing? 'Tis a mighty satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction I take it, to have a clear Conscience;
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:56421:140"/>
To make Life no Burthen, nor Death any Terror! To trample upon the <hi>Pagan</hi> Deities; To batter <hi>Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> and force the Devils to Resign! <note n="*" place="margin">By Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms</note> These are the Delights, these are the noble Entertainments of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: And besides the advantage of the Quality, they are always at hand, and cost us nothing.</p>

                  <hi>Circus</hi> and <hi>Theatre</hi> may not improperly be call'd the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>Pestilence.</hi>—<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Away then with these Lewd, Ungodly Diversions, and which are but Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence at the Best. What part of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence either in words or practise, is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Stage? Don't the Buffoons take almost all manner of Liberties, and plunge through Thick and Thin, to make a jest? Now those who are affected with a vitious satisfaction, will be haunted with the Idea, and spread the Infection. But if a man is not entertain'd to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose should he go Thither? Why should he be fond where he finds nothing, and court that which sleeps upon the Sense? If 'tis said these Diversions are taken on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to unbend the Mind, and refresh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a little. To this I answer. That the spaces between Business should not
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:56421:140"/>
be fill'd up with such Rubbish. A wise man has a Guard upon his Recreations, and always prefers, the Profitable to the Pleasant.</q>

Diversion, because 'twas not Condemn'd by express <hi>Scripture.</hi> 
               <q>Let meer Modesty (says he) supply the <hi>Holy Text:</hi> And let <hi>Nature</hi> govern where <hi>Revelation</hi> does not reach. Some Things are too black to lie upon <hi>Paper,</hi> and are more strongly forbidden, because unmention'd. The Divine Wisdom must have had a low Opinion of <hi>Christians,</hi> had it descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to particulars in this Case. Silence is sometimes the best Method for Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. To Forbid often puts People in mind of what they should not do; And thus the force of the Precept is lost by naming the Crime. Besides, what need we any farther Instruction? Discipline and general Restraint makes up the Meaning of the Law; and common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son will tell you what the Scripture has left unsaid. I would have every one examine his own Thoughts, and inquire at Home into the Duties of his Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. This is a good way to secure him from Indecency. For those Rules which a Man has work'd out for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he commonly makes most use of.—</q>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>And after having describ'd the infamous Diversions of the <hi>Play-house;</hi> He expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in this Manner.</p>
            <q>
               <p>What business has a Christian at such Places as these? A Christian who has not
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:56421:141"/>
the Liberty so much as to think of an ill Thing. Why does he entertain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with Lewd Representations? Has he a mind to discharge his Modesty, and be flesh'd for the <hi>Practise?</hi> Yes. this is the Consequence. By using to see these Things, hee'l learn to do them.—<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>What need I mention the Levities, and Impertinence in <hi>Comedies,</hi> or the ranting Distractions of <hi>Tragedy?</hi> Were these Things unconcern'd with Idolatry, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians ought not to be at them. For were they not highly Criminal, the Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of them is egregious, and unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gravity of <hi>Beleivers.</hi>—</p>
               <p>As I have often said these Foppish, these pernicious Diversions, must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. We must set a Guard upon our Senses, and keep the Sentinal always upon Duty. To make Vice familiar to the ear, is the way to recommend it. And since the mind of Man has a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bent to Extravagance; how is it likely to hold out under Example, and Invitation? If you push that which tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters already, whether will it tumble? In earnest, we must draw off our Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations from these Vanities. A Christian has much better <hi>Sights</hi> than these to look at. He has solid Satisfactions in his
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:56421:142"/>
Power, which will please, and improve him at the same time.</p>
               <p>Would a Christian be agreeably Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh'd? Let him read the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> Here the Entertainment will suit his Character, and be big enough for his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.—Beloved, how noble, how moving how profitable a pleasure is it to be thus employed? To have our Expectations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in prospect, and be intent on the Glories of Heaven?</p>
            </q>
            <p>He has a great deal more upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in his <hi>Epistles</hi> to <hi>Donatus</hi> and <hi>Eucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> which are undoubtedly genuine. The later being somewhat remarkable, I shall Translate part of it for the <hi>Reader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Dear Brother, your usual Kindness, together with your desire of releiving <note place="margin">Ad Euv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat.</note> your own Modesty and mine, has put you upon asking my Thoughts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a certain <hi>Player</hi> in your Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; whether such a Person ought to be allow'd the Privilege of <hi>Communion.</hi> This Man it seems continues in his Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Profession, and keeps a Nursery under him. He teaches that which 'twas a Crime in him to learn, sets up for a Master of Debauch, and Propagates the lewd Mystery. The case standing thus, 'tis my Opinion that the Admission of such a <hi>Member</hi> would be a Breach of the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:56421:142"/>
Discipline of the Gospel, and a Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Divine Majesty: Neither do I think it fit the Honour of the Church should suffer by so Infamous a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lactantius</hi>'s Testimony shall come next. This Author in his <hi>Divine Institutions,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 20.</note> which he Dedicates to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, cautions the Christians against the <hi>Play-House,</hi> from the Disorder, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of those places. For as he observes.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The debauching of Virgins, and the Amours of Strumpets, are the Subject of <hi>Comedy.</hi> And here the Rule is, the more Rhetorick the more Mischeif, and the best <hi>Poets</hi> are the worst Common-Wealths-men. For the Harmony and Ornament of the Composition serves only to recommend the Argument, to fortifie the Charm, and engage the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. At last he concludes with this advice.</p>
               <p>Let us avoid therefore these Diversions, least somewhat of the Malignity should seize us. Our Minds should be quiet and Compos'd, and not over-run with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musements. Besides a Habit of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is an ensnaring Circumstance. 'Tis <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 21.</note> apt to make us forget God, and grow cool in the Offices of Virtue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:56421:143"/>
Should a Man have a Stage at Home, would not his Reputation suffer extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and all people count him a notorious Libertine? most undoubtedly. Now the Place does not alter the Property. The Practise at the <hi>Play-House</hi> is the same thing, only there he has more Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to keep him in Countenance.</p>
               <p>A well work'd <hi>Poem</hi> is a powerful piece of Imposture: It masters the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and hurries it no Body knows whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—If therefore we would be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by Reason let us stand off from the Temptation, such Pleasures can have no good Meaning. Like delicious Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels they subdue the Palate, and flatter us only to cut our Throats. Let us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Reality to Appearance, Service, to <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. 22.</note> Show; and Eternity to Time.</p>
               <p>As God makes Virtue the Condition of Glory, and trains men up to Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness by Hardship and Industry. So the Devils road to Destruction lies through Sensuality and <hi>Epicurism.</hi> And as pretended Evils lead us on to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counterfeited Bliss; So Visionary Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions are the causes of Real Misery. In short, These Inviting Things are all stratagem. Let us, take care the soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Importunity of the Pleasure does not surprise us, nor the Bait bring
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:56421:143"/>
us within the snare. The Senses are more than <hi>Out-Works,</hi> and should be defended accordingly.</p>
            </q>
            <p>I shall pass over St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and go <note place="margin">In Psal. 119.</note> on to St. <hi>Chrisostome.</hi> This <hi>Father</hi> is copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous upon the Subject, I could translate some <hi>Sheets</hi> from him were it necessary. But length being not my Business, a few Lines may serve to discover his Opinion. His 15 <hi>Homily ad Populum Antiochenum,</hi> runs thus.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Most People fancy the Unlawfulness of going to <hi>Plays</hi> is not clear. But by their favour, a world of Disorders are the Consequences of such a Liberty. For frequenting the <hi>Play-House</hi> has brought Whoring and Ribaldry into Vogue, and finish'd all the parts of Debauchery.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards he seems to make the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position better than the <hi>Fact,</hi> and argues upon a feign'd Case.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Let us not only avoid downright Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but the Tendencies to it. Some Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Things are fatal in the Consequence, and strike us at the Rebound. Now who would chuse his standing within an Inch of a Fall; or swim upon the Verge of a Whirlpool? He that walks upon a Precipice, shakes tho'he does not tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And commonly his Concern brings him to the Bottom. The Case is much

the same in reference to Conscience, and Morality. He that won't keep his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Gulph, is oftentimes suck'd in by the Eddy; and the least oversight is enough to undo Him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In his 37 Homily upon the Eleventh Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> he declaims more at large against the Stage.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Smutty Songs (says he) are much more abominable than Stench and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. And which is most to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, you are not at all uneasy at such Licentiousness. You Laugh when you should Frown; and Commend what you ought to abhor.—Heark you, you can keep the Language of your own House in order: If your Servants or your Childrens Tongues run Riot, they presently smart for't. And yet at the <hi>Play-House</hi> you are quite another Thing. These little Buffoons have a strange As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant! A luscious Sentence is huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly welcome from their Mouth: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Censure, they have thanks and encouragement for their Pains. Now if a Man would be so just as to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at himself, here's Madness, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in Abundance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But I know you'l say what's this to me, I neither sing nor pronounce, any of this Lewd stuff? Granting your Plea,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:56421:145"/>
what do you get by't? If you don't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat these Scurrilities, you are very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear them. Now whether the Ear, or the Tongue is mismanaged, comes much to the same reckoning. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the <hi>Organ,</hi> does not alter the Action so mightily, as you may imagine. But pray how do you prove you don't repeat them? They may be your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, or the Entertainments of your Closet for ought we know to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. This is certain; you hear them with pleasure in your Face, and make it your business to run after them: And to my Mind, these are strong Arguments of your Approbation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I desire to ask you a Question. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you hear any wretches Blaspheme, are you in any Rapture about it? And do your Gestures appear airy, and obliged? Far from it. I doubt not but your blood grows chill, and your Ears are stopt at the Presumption. And what's the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this Aversion in your Behaviour? Why 'tis because you don't use to Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, your self. Pray clear your self the same way from the Charge of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scenity. Wee'l then believe you don't talk Smut, when we percieve you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to hear it. Lewd Sonnets, and Serenades are quite different from the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:56421:146"/>
Prescriptions of Virtue. This is strange Nourishment for a Christian to take in! I don't wonder you should lose your Health, when you feed thus Foul. It may be Chastity is no such easy Task! Innocence moves upon an Ascent, at least for sometime. Now those who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Laughing can never strain up Hill. If the best preparations of Care will just do, what must become of those that are dissolv'd in Pleasure, and lie under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of Debauchery?—Have you not heard how that St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us <hi>to rejoyce in the Lord?</hi> He said <hi>in the Lord;</hi> not in the Devil. But alas! what leisure have you to Mind St. <hi>Paul?</hi> How should you be sensible of your Faults, when your Head is always kept Hot, and as it were intoxicated with Buffooning?</q>—He goes on, and lashes the Impudence of the <hi>Stage</hi> with a great deal of Satir and Severity; and at last proposes this Objection.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You'l say, I can give you many Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where the <hi>Play-House</hi> has done no Harm. Don't mistake. Throwing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of Time and ill example, has a great deal of Harm in't; And thus far you are guilty at the best.</q> For granting your own Virtue impenetrable, and out of Reach, Granting the Protection of your Temper has brought you off unhurt,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:56421:146"/>
are all. People thus Fortified? <q>By no means. However, many a weak Brother has ventur'd after you, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried upon your <hi>Precedent.</hi> And since you make others thus <hi>Faulty,</hi> how can you be <hi>Innocent</hi> your self? All the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple undone There, will lay their Ruine at your Door. The Company are all Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the Mischeif of the Place. For were there no <hi>Audience,</hi> we should have no <hi>Acting.</hi> And therefore those who joyn in the Crime, will ne're be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Punishment. Granting your Modesty has secur'd you, which by the way I believe nothing of; yet since ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been debauch'd by the <hi>Play-House,</hi> you must expect a severe Reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for giving them Encouragement. Tho' after all, as Virtuous as you are, I doubt not, you wou'd have been much Better, had you kept away.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In fine, Let us not dispute to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; The practise won't bear a Defence! Where the Cause is naught 'tis in vain to rack our Reason, and strain for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. The best excuse for what is past, is to stand clear from the danger, and do so no more.</q>
            </p>
            <p>One citation more from St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and I take Leave. In the Preface of his Commentary upon St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gospel speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Plays</hi> and other Publick <hi>Shews,</hi> he has these words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:56421:147"/>
But what need I branch out the Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those <hi>Spectacles,</hi> and be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in Description? For what's there to be met with but Lewd Laughing, but Smut, Railing, and Buffoonry? In a word. 'Tis all Scandal and Confusion. Observe me, I speak to you all; Let none who partake of this <hi>Holy-Table,</hi> unqualifie himself with such Mortal Diversions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Hierom</hi> on the 1<hi>st.</hi> Verse 32 <hi>Psal.</hi> makes this Exposition upon the <hi>Text.</hi>

            <p>
               <q>Some are delighted with the Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this World, some with the <hi>Circus,</hi> and some with the <hi>Theatre:</hi> But the Psalmist commands every good Man <hi>to delight himself in the Lord.</hi>—For as <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaks, <hi>woe to them that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.</hi>
               </q> And in his <hi>Epistles</hi> he cautions the Ladies against <note place="margin">Ep. 9. 12. Advers. Jovinian.

            <p>In the 6<hi>th.</hi> Book of his Comentary on <hi>Ezechiel</hi> he lets us understand; <q>That <note place="margin">Chap. 20.</note> when we depart out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> we must refine our Inclinations, and change our Delights into Aversion. And after some other Instances, He tells us we must
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:56421:147"/>
decline the <hi>Theatres,</hi> and all other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Diversions, which stain the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of the Soul, and slip into the <hi>Will</hi> through the Senses.</q>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his 5<hi>th.</hi> Epistle to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus</hi> will afford us something upon the same Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The prosperity of Sinners is their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Unhappiness. If one may say so, They are most Punish'd when they are overlook'd. By this means their bad Temper is encourag'd, and they are more inclin'd to be false to themselves; And we know an Enemy <hi>within,</hi> is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than one <hi>without.</hi> But the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Reasonings of the Generality, make different Conclusions. They fancy the World goes wonderfully well when People make a Figure. When a Man is a Prince in his Fortune, but a Begger in his Vertue; Has a great many fine Things about him, but not so much as one good Quality to deserve them. When the <hi>Play-Houses</hi> go up, and Religion go's down. When Prodigality is admir'd, and Charity laugh'd at. When the <hi>Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> can revel with the Rich Man's purse, And the Poor have scarse enough to keep Life and Soul together.—When God suffers these Things to flourish, we may be fure he is most Angry. Present Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, is the deepest Revenge. But
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:56421:148"/>
when he cuts off the Supplies of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury, and disables the Powers of Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance, then as one may say, he is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully severe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In his 1<hi>st.</hi> Book <hi>de consensu Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listarum,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">cap. 33.</note> He answers an objection of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and comes up to the Case in Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Their Complaint as if the Times were less happy since the Appearance of Christianity is very unreasonable. Let them read their own Philosophers: There they'l find those very Things censured, which they now are so uneasy to part with; This Remark must shut up their Mouths, and convince them of the Excellency of our Religion. For pray what Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions have they lost? Nonethat I know of, excepting some Licentious ones, which they abused to the Dishonour of their Creatour. But it may be the Times are bad because the <hi>Theatres</hi> are Tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling almost every where. The <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> those <hi>Cages</hi> of <hi>Uncleaness,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Schools of Debauchery.—And what's the Reason of their running to Ruine? Why 'tis the Reformation of the Age: 'Tis because those Lewd Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises are out of Fashion, which first built and kept them in Countenance. Their own <hi>Tully</hi>'s Commendation of the <hi>Actor Roscius</hi> is remarkable. He was so much
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:56421:148"/>
a Master (says he) that none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was worthy to Tread the <hi>Stage.</hi> And on the other hand, so good a Man, that he was the most unfit Person of the Gang to come There. And is not this a plain Confession of the Lewdness of the <hi>Play-House;</hi> And that the better a Man was, the more he was obliged to forbear it?</q>
            </p>
            <p>I could go on, much farther with St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> but I love to be as brief as may be. I could likewise run through the succeeding <hi>Centuries,</hi> and collect Evidence all along. But I conceive the best Ages, and the biggest Authorities, may be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: And these the <hi>Reader</hi> has had already. However, one Instance more from the <hi>Moderns</hi> may not be amiss. <hi>Didacus de Tapia</hi> an eminent <hi>Spaniard,</hi> shall close the <hi>Evidence.</hi> This Author in debating the Question whether <hi>Players</hi> might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> amongst other things encounters an Objection. Some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it seems pretended there was some good to be learn'd at the <hi>Play-House.</hi> To these, he makes this reply.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Granting your Supposition, (says He) your Inference is naught. Do People use to send their Daughters to the <hi>Stews</hi> for Discipline? And yet it may be, they might meet some there lamenting their own Debauchery. No Man will breed his Son upon the <hi>High-way,</hi> to harden his
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:56421:149"/>
Courage; Neither will any one go on board a Leaky Vessel, to learn the Art of shifting in a Wreck the better. My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is, let no body go to the Infamous <hi>Play-House.</hi> A place of such staring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Strictness and Sobriety of Religion: A Place hated by God, and haunted by the Devil. Let no man I say learn to relish any thing that's said there; <note place="margin">Didac, &amp;c. in D. Thom. p. 546.</note> For 'tis all but Poyson handsomly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I have presented the <hi>Reader</hi> with a short View of the Sense of <hi>Christianity.</hi> This was the opinion of the <hi>Church</hi> for the first 500 Years. And thus she has Censured the <hi>Stage</hi> both in <hi>Councils,</hi> and Single <hi>Authorities.</hi> And since the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir of the <hi>Fathers</hi> comes full upon the <hi>Modern Poets,</hi> their Caution must be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable. The parity of the Case makes their Reasons take place, and their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity revive upon us. If we are <hi>Christians,</hi> the <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> and the Sense of the Primitive <hi>Church</hi> must have a weight. The very Time is a good argument of it self. Then the <hi>Apostolical Traditions</hi> were fresh, and undisputed; and the <hi>Church</hi> much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agreed than she has been since. Then, Discipline was in Force, and Virtue Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd, and People lived up to their <hi>Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> And as for the <hi>Persons,</hi> they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all exception. Their <hi>Station,</hi> their
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:56421:149"/>
Learning, and Sufficiency was very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable; Their Piety and Resolution, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. They acted generously, and wrote freely, and were always above the little Regards of Interest or Danger. To be short; They were, as we may say the <hi>Worthies</hi> of <hi>Christendom,</hi> the Flower of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and the Top of their <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> Nothing can be better establish'd than the Credit of these <hi>Fathers:</hi> Their Affirmation goes a great way in a proof; And we might argue upon the strength of their <hi>Character.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But supposing them contented to wave their Privilege, and dispute upon the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. Granting this, the <hi>Stage</hi> would be undone by them. The Force of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, and the bare <hi>Intrinsick</hi> of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, would be abundantly sufficient to carry the Cause.</p>
            <p>But it may be objected, is the Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance exact between Old <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> will the Paralel hold out, and has the <hi>English Stage</hi> any Thing so bad as the <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> of the <hi>Pantomimi?</hi> I don't say that: The <hi>Modern Gestures</hi> tho' bold, and Lewd too sometimes, are not altogether so scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous as the <hi>Roman.</hi> Here then we can make them some little Abatement.</p>
            <p>And to go as far in their <hi>Excuse</hi> as we can, 'tis probable their <hi>Musick</hi> may not be altogether so exceptionable as that of the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:56421:150"/>
               <hi>Antients.</hi> I don't say this part of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment is directly vitious, because I am not willing to Censure at Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Those who frequent the <hi>Play-House</hi> are the most competent Judges: But this I must say, the Performances of this kind are much too fine for the <hi>Place.</hi> 'Twere to be wish'd that either the <hi>Plays</hi> were better, or the <hi>Musick</hi> worse. I'm sorry to see <hi>Art</hi> so meanly Prostituted: Atheism ought to have nothing Charming in its <hi>Retinue.</hi> 'Tis great Pity <hi>Debauchery</hi> should have the Assistance of a fine Hand, to whet the Appetite, and play it down.</p>
            <p>Now granting the <hi>Play-House-Musick</hi> not vitious in the Composition, yet the design of it is to refresh the <hi>Idea</hi>'s of the <hi>Action,</hi> to keep <hi>Time</hi> with the <hi>Poem,</hi> and be true to the <hi>Subject.</hi> For this Reason among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the <hi>Tunes</hi> are generally Airy and Gail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siardizing: They are contriv'd on purpose to excite a sportive Humour, and spread a Gaity upon the Spirits. To banish all Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Scruple, and lay Thinking and Reflection a sleep. This sort of Musick warms the Passions, and unlocks the Fancy, and makes it open to Pleasure like a Flower to the Sun. It helps a Luscious Sentence to slide, drowns the Discords of <hi>Atheisni,</hi> and keeps off the Aversions of Conscience. It throws a Man off his Guard, makes way for an ill Impression, and is most Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:56421:150"/>
planted to do Mischief. A Lewd <hi>Play</hi> with good Musick is like a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone <hi>Arm'd,</hi> it draws much stronger than before.</p>
            <p>Now why should it be in the power of a few mercenary Hands to play People out of their Senses, to run away with their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, and wind their Passions about their Fingers as they list? Musick is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as dangerous as Gunpowder; And it may be requires looking after no less than the <hi>Press,</hi> or the <hi>Mint.</hi> 'Tis possible a Publick Regulation might not be amiss. No less a Philosopher than <hi>Plato</hi> seems to be of this Opinion. He is clearly for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the old grave, and solemn way of <hi>Playing.</hi> He lays a mighty stress upon this Observation: He does not stick to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that to extend the <hi>Science,</hi> and alter <note place="margin">De Repub. L. 4.</note> the <hi>Notes,</hi> is the way to have the <hi>Laws</hi> repeal'd and to unsettle the <hi>Constitution.</hi> I suppose He imagined that if the Power of <hi>Sounds,</hi> the Temper of Constitutions, and the Diversities of Age, were well stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died; If this were done, and some general Permissions formed upon the Enquiry, the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> might find their Account in't.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tully</hi> does not carry the Speculation thus <note place="margin">Cic. de Leg. L. 3.</note> high: However, he owns it has a weight in't, and should not be overlook'd. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies not but that when the Musick is soft,

            <p>Now were the <hi>Stage</hi> in a Condition to wipe off any of these Imputations, which <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:56421:151"/>
The first is their dilating so much upon the Argument of Love.</p>
            <p>This Subject is generally treated Home, and in the most tender and passionate manner imaginable. Tis often the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Concern: The Incidents make way, and the <hi>Plot</hi> turns upon't. As mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters go, the Company expect it: And it may be the <hi>Poets</hi> can neither Write, nor Live without it. This is a cunning way enough of stealing upon the Blind Side, and Practising upon the Weakness of humane Nature. People love to see their <hi>Passions</hi> painted no less than their <hi>Persons:</hi> And like <hi>Narcissus</hi> are apt to dote on their own Image. This Bent of self Admiration recommends the Business of <hi>Amours,</hi> and engages the Inclination. And which is more, these Love-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations oftentimes call up the Spirits, and set them on work. The <hi>Play</hi> is acted over again in the <hi>Scene</hi> of Fancy, and the first Imitation becomes a Model. <hi>Love</hi> has generally a <hi>Party Within;</hi> And when the Wax is prepared, the Impression is easily made. Thus the Disease of the <hi>Stage</hi> grows Catching: It throws its own <hi>Amours</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Company, and forms these Passions when it does not find them. And when they are born before, they thrive extreamly in this <hi>Nursery.</hi> Here they sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fail either of Grouth, or Complexion.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:56421:152"/>
They grow strong, and they grow Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming too. This is the best Place to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Languishing Amour, to rowse it from Sleep, and retrieve it from Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. And thus Desire becomes Absolute, and forces the Oppositions of Decency and Shame. And if the Misfortune does not go thus far, the consequences are none of the best. The Passions are up in Arms, and there's a mighty Contest between Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Inclination. The Mind is over-run with Amusements, and commonly good for nothing sometime after.</p>
            <p>I don't say the <hi>Stage</hi> Fells all before them, and disables the whole <hi>Audience:</hi> 'Tis a hard Battle where none escapes. However, Their <hi>Triumphs</hi> and their <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheys</hi> are unspeakable. Neither need we much wonder at the Matter. They are dangerously Prepar'd for Conquest, and Empire. There's Nature, and Passion, and Life, in all the Circumstances of their <hi>Action.</hi> Their Declamation, their <hi>Mein</hi> their Gestures, and their Equipage, are very moving and significant. Now when the Subject is agreeable, a lively Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and a Passionate way of Expression, make wild work, and have a strange Force upon the Blood, and Temper.</p>
            <p>And then as for the General Strains of Courtship, there can be nothing more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and extravagant. The Hero's Mistress
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:56421:152"/>
is no less than his Deity. She disposes of his Reason, prescribes his Motions, and Commands his Interest. What Soveraign Respect, what Religious Address, what Idolizing Raptures are we pester'd with? <hi>Shrines</hi> and <hi>Offerings,</hi> and Adorations, are nothing upon such solemn Occasions. Thus Love and Devotion, Ceremony and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship are Confounded; And God, and his Creatures treated both alike! These Shreds of Distraction are often brought from the <hi>Play-House</hi> into Conversation: And thus the <hi>Sparks</hi> are taught to Court their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, in the same Language they say their <hi>Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Second Thing which I have to object against the <hi>Stage</hi> is their encouraging Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. What is more Common than Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and Quarrelling in their <hi>Characters</hi> of Figure? Those Practises which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous in Reason, <hi>Capital</hi> in <hi>Law,</hi> and Damnable in Religion, are the Credit of the <hi>Stage.</hi> Thus Rage and Resentment, Blood and Barbarity, are almost Deified: Pride goes for Greatness, and <hi>Fiends</hi> and <hi>Hero's</hi> are made of the same Mettal. To give Instances were needless, nothing is more frequent. And in this respect the <hi>French Dramatists</hi> have been to blame no less than the <hi>English.</hi> And thus the Notion <note place="margin">Vid. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neille Cid. Cinna &amp; Pompee.</note> of Honour is mistated, the Maxims of Christianity despised, and the Peace of the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:56421:153"/>
World disturb'd. I grant this desperate Custom is no <hi>Original</hi> of the <hi>Stage.</hi> But then why was not the Growth of it check'd? I thought the <hi>Poets</hi> business had not been to back false Reasoning and ill Practise; and to fix us in Frensy and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake! Yes. They have done their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to cherish the Malignity, and keep the Disorder in Countenance. They have made it both the Mark, and the Merit of a Man of Honour; and set it off with <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and Commendation. But I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd <note place="margin">Moral Essays.</note> on this Subject elswhere, and therefore shall pursue it no farther.</p>
            <p>To draw towards an End. And here I must observe that these two later Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are but Petty Mismanagements with respect to the Former. And when the best are thus bad, what are the worst? What must we say of the more soul Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations, of all the Impudence in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Gesture? Can this Stuff be the Inclination of <hi>Ladies?</hi> Is a <hi>Reading</hi> upon Vice so Entertaining, and do they love to see the <hi>Stews Dissected</hi> before them? One would think the Dishonour of their own Sex, the Discovery of so much Lewdness, and the treating Human Nature so very Coarsly, could have little Satisfaction in't. Let us set Conscience aside, and throw the other World out of the Question: These In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests are far the greatest, but not all. The
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:56421:153"/>
               <hi>Ladies</hi> have other Motives to confine them. The Restraints of Decency, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations of Honour, are sufficient to keep them at Home. But hoping They will be just to themselves I shall wave this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable Argument. I shall only add, that a Surprize ought not to be Censured. Accidents are no Faults. The strictest Virtue may sometimes stumble upon an <hi>Ill Sight.</hi> But Choise, and Frequency, and ill Ground, conclude strongly for Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To be assured of the inoffensiveness of the <hi>Play</hi> is no more than a Necessary Precaution. Indeed the <hi>Players</hi> should be generally discouraged. They have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of Modesty, nor any scruples upon the Quality of the Treat. The grossest <hi>Dish</hi> when 'twill down is as ready as the Best. To say Money is their Business and they must <hi>Live,</hi> is the Plea of <hi>Pick pockets,</hi> and <hi>High way men.</hi> These later may as well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their <hi>Vocation</hi> for a Lewd practise as the other. But</p>
            <p>To give the Charge its due Compass: To comprehend the whole <hi>Audience,</hi> and take in the Motives of Religon.</p>
            <p>And here I can't imagine how we can reconcile such Liberties with our Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. These Entertainments are as it were Litterally renounc'd in <hi>Baptism.</hi> They are the <hi>Vanities of the wicked World, and the Works of the Devil,</hi> in the most open, and emphatical Signification. <hi>What Communion</hi>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:56421:154"/>
               <hi>has Light with Darkness, and what concord</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 14.</note> 
               <hi>has Christ with Belial.</hi> Call you this Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion? Can Profaness be such an irresistable Delight? Does the Crime of the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance make the Spirit of the Satisfaction, and is the Scorn of Christianity the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of Christians? Is it such a Pleasure to hear the <hi>Scriptures</hi> burlesqu'd? Is Ribaldry so very obliging, and <hi>Atheism</hi> so Charming a Quality? Are we indeed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to quit the Privilege of our Nature; to surrender our <hi>Charter</hi> of Immortality, and throw up the Pretences to another Life? It may be so! But then we should do well to remember that <hi>Nothing</hi> is not in our Power. Our Desires did not make us, neither can they unmake us. But I hope our wishes are not so mean, and that we have a better sense of the Dignity of our <hi>Being.</hi> And if so, how can we be pleas'd with those Things which would degrade us into Brutes, which ridicule our <hi>Creed,</hi> and turn all our Expectations into <hi>Romance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after all, the Jest on't is, these Men would make us believe their design is Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Reformation. In good time! They are likely to combat Vice with success, who destroy the Principles of Good and Evil! Take them at the best, and they do no more than expose a little Humour, and Formality. But then, as the Matter is manag'd, the Correction is much worse
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:56421:154"/>
than the Fault. They laugh at <hi>Pedantry,</hi> and teach <hi>Atheism,</hi> cure a Pimple, and give the Plague. I heartily wish they would have let us alone. To exchange Virtue for Behaviour is a hard Bargain. Is not plain Honesty much better than Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy well Dress'd? What's Sight good for without Substance? What is a well Bred Libertine but a well bred Knave? One that can't prefer Conscience to Pleasure, without calling himself Fool: And will sell his Friend, or his Father, if need be, for his Convenience.</p>
            <p>In short: Nothing can be more disser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to Probity and Religion, than the management of the <hi>Stage.</hi> It cherishes those Passions, and rewards those Vices, which 'tis the business of Reason to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance. It strikes at the Root of Principle, draws off the Inclinations from Virtue, and spoils good Education: 'Tis the most effectual means to baffle the Force of Discipline, to emasculate peoples Spirits, and Debauch their Manners. How <hi>many</hi> of the Unwary have these <hi>Syrens</hi> devour'd? And how often has the best Blood been tainted, with this Infection? What Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of Parents, what Confusion in Families, and What Beggery in Estates have been hence occasion'd? And which is still worse, the Mischief spreads dayly, and the Malignity grows more envenom'd.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:56421:155"/>
The Feavour works up towards Madness, and will scarcely endure to be touch'd. And what hope is there of Health when the <hi>Patient</hi> strikes in with the Disease, and flies in the Face of the <hi>Remedy?</hi> Can Religion retrive us? Yes, when we don't despise it. But while our <hi>Notions</hi> are naught, our <hi>Lives</hi> will hardly be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. What can the Assistance of the Church signify to those who are more ready to Rally the <hi>Preacher,</hi> than Practise the <hi>Sermon?</hi> To those who are overgrown with Pleasure, and hardned in Ill Custom? Who have neither Patience to hear, nor Conscience to take hold of? You may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as well feed a Man without a Mouth, as give Advice where there's no dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to receive it. 'Tis true; as long as there is Life there's Hope. Sometimes the Force of Argument, and the Grace of God, and the anguish of Affliction, may strike through the Prejudice, and make their way into the Soul. But these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances don't always meet, and then the Case is extreamly dangerous. For this miserable Temper, we may thank the <hi>Stage</hi> in a great Measure: And therefore, if I mistake not, They have the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to Favour, and the most need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, of all Men Living.</p>
