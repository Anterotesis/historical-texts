            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, to satisfie thy minde, and to stop the mouths of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who liste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry idle report, are easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to beleeue, whatsoeuer bee by vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne fame bruted abroad, I haue caused these seuerall Letters, with a true discourse therein contayned, of the beginning and proceedings in these late Popish actions, to be diuulged: and I haue the rather bene thereunto induced, because I know certayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that not a few, for their better satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are very desirous to vnderstand the truth thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20311:3"/>
Furthermore, in perusall hereof, the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar people, &amp; such as are wauering in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by reading his Maiesties protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the mayntenance of Religion, herein contayned, and publikely vttered in the Starre-chamber, by the mouth of the L. Chauncellor of England, vpon Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the xx. of Iune last past, shall hereby bee incouraged to go on in the Christian profession of the Gospel, so long time by Gods mercies, and the constancy of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princes mayntayned amongst vs, and not bee discouraged by any idle perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which seditious and trecherous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, who haue vowed themselues vnto the seruice of the Pope, shall closely and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myningly (thereby seeking to alienate the hearts of his faythfull subiects, from their dutifull allegeance)<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> buzze into their eares. So that if any Papist hereafter should seeke to perswade any of his Maiesties subiects, that the tymes are like to alter, and that a Toleration should bee graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (thereby wronging his Maiesty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, who is so fully settled in the
<pb facs="tcp:20311:3"/>
Trueth) they may answere them, <hi>Auoyd, false and lying Varlets, your words are vayne, and your hopes are more vayne; see here his Maiesties protestation to the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither can I here omit to giue notice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, of that excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t speach, which mine owne eares heard vttered vpon Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the fifth of August last past, at Paules Crosse, by the right Reuerend Father in God, the Lord Bishop of London, in his Sermon there; because it serueth for a strengthening and confirmation of that, which in the ensuing Letter you shall read. His words tended briefly to this effect:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That his Maiesty had made a protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God and his Angels, that he was so constant for the maintenance of the Religion publikely in England professed, as that hee would spend his owne dearest bloud in the defence therof, rather then the Truth should be ouerthrown: and that if he had ten times as many more kingdomes as he hath, he would dispend them all for the safety and protection thereof: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb facs="tcp:20311:4"/>
that if he had any childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> that should out-liue him, if they should maintayne or vp-hold any other Religion, he desired of God, that hee might see them brought to their graues before him, that their shame might be buried in his life time, neuer to be spoken of in future ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh worthy speeches, and worthy so noble and religious a King! Shall we therefore that are his subiects, be discouraged, hauing so couragious a King? No, God forbid.</p>
            <p>Thus wishing thee to iudge none other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise hereof, then as proceeding from one, that tendreth the good of his Prince and country, and is willing to satisfy all such, as desire to be informed in the truth hereof, I rest a wel-willer to all that meane well.</p>

            <head>A Letter from a Gentleman in London, to his friend in Hereford.</head>
            <head type="sub">
               <g ref="char:leaf">‚ùß</g> To his most affected and kinde friend, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. E. R. in Hereford.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">K</seg>Ind M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. E. R. the former proofes that I haue already had of your loue to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, causeth me agayne to presume vpon your further curtesies. The matter is thus: There hath bene lately noysed abroad very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in London, a strange report, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the proceedings of some Papists in your parts, and as fame goeth, not far from you: much haue I heard thereof, and that diuersly: whereupon being desirous to be
<pb facs="tcp:20311:5"/>
satisfied with a certayne truth of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (because my mind cannot rest conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an vncertayne Relation thereof) I repayred vpon Thursday last, being Starre-chamber day, vnto Westminster, there expecting to heare something con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those causes: neyther was I alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deceyued in my expectation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not fully satisfyed in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of this matter, how the maner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was: for being there, vpon the same day, after that the Lords were set, and that one or two matters, concerning some former misorders in those partes formerly committed, had bene heard, the right Honourable, the Lord high Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of England, as from his Maiesties owne mouth, beganne a most excellent speach, and deliuered the matter after such an vnexpressable maner, as it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to come neere vnto, eyther the words, or perfit substance thereof, it was so pithy, so excellent, and so admirably
<pb facs="tcp:20311:5"/>
couched together: and yet acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he himselfe was vnable to declare it vnto them in such maner, as his Maiesty had deliuered it vnto him.</p>
            <p>But I will onely heerein relate vnto you, as neere as I can remember, such things as were vttered by his Lordship, concerning these present matters: for his Lordship, after that he had spoken some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what largely, concerning some other poynts, sayd, That there had now happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a present occasion (meaning this late Commotion in your partes) which did administer much matter worthy of consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p>Then he began to shew how certainely his Maiesty was informed, <hi>That the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Papists in England was mightily increased, since his Maiesties comming, and that Popish Priests and Iesuites (factors for the Pope) lay lurking in many corners of this land, to seduce his Maiesties sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects from their due and lawfull allegeance
<pb facs="tcp:20311:6"/>
vnto their rightfull Prince, to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of a forrain power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, namely, the Pope of Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then also, that his Maiesty maruayled, how it happened, that Papists could so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease daily, or Priests and Iesuites be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned within his Kingdomes, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that his Lawes are in force against them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thereupon entring into a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the estate of this Land, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by all meanes possible to finde where the fault might be; after the examination of diuers supposed causes, he alleadged, that none was greater then this, <hi>viz. That Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices are too slacke and negligent in their places; it being a thing impossible, that Priests and Iesuites should swarme so thick as they doe in any partes of England, or VVales, vnlesse Iustices of Peace in those parts where they frequented, were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of their place and office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon also he said, that his Maiesty
<pb facs="tcp:20311:6"/>
was informed, <hi>That many, who were in place of Iustice, to punish others, either were themselues so affected, or atleast wise, for speciall respects, fauoured them that were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then spake he vnto the Iudges, and such as were to go their Circuits, remembring vnto them, how carefull his Maiesty had bene for the good and happy gouernment of these his Kingdomes; how studious for the mayntenance of the true Religion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and maintayned by the Church of England; how often his Maiesty had held consultation with his Councell and Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, for the sure establishment of matters in Religion; and how loth to alter, change, or disanull any of the Lawes of England: because hee found, that there was no more perfit forme of gouernment in the world, nor any Church that came so neere vnto the very substance of the trueth in euery poynt, as the Church of England doth: and because that Religion is the surest
<pb facs="tcp:20311:7"/>
bond to knit mens hearts in vnity, he reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted how great paynes, and what often cares his Maiesty had taken for a perfit vnity in Religion, and diuine worship, that not euery one should bee at liberty to serue God after his owne fashion, but all should ioyne in one true worship of God; which, if euer any Nation in the world had, we now haue.</p>
            <p>Further also, giuing vnto the Iudges a straight charge, that in their Circuits they should haue an especiall care to inquire for all such as were Priests, Iesuites, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants, and to take such order, that they might be punished; and more especially, for inquiry of all such Iustices of peace, as were either, themselues, their wiues, children, or seruants, Papists; or knowne themselues to be fauourers of Papists.</p>
            <p>Hereupon further alledging, that there were some Iustices, who although they themselues would not be seene to giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny entertaynement or countenance vnto
<pb facs="tcp:20311:7"/>
Priests, Iesuites, or Recusants, yet such should finde welcome at theyr Wyues hands.</p>
            <p>And therefore his Maiestyes pleasure was, That all such Iustices, as can bee knowne to be as aforesayd, should haue their names sent vp, that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued out of the Commission for the Peace, as being vnfit members to hold such places.</p>
            <p>And as this his Maiestyes charge ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended vnto the punishment of such, as were obstinate Papists: so, more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, for the punishment of such, as were become Papists since his Maiesties comming: and yet a more strict charge for those parts about you, because they were alwayes most infestious and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</p>
            <p>Then hee put the Iudges in minde, how long a time they now had for search into these matters, and what directions

they had receyued for their proceedings, assuring them, that as his Maiesty had sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified vnto them before their going, what course they should obserue: so at their returnes, hee would call them vnto an account, what they had performed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>And amongst many other matters of speciall moment, he entred into a deepe consideration of this Land, the estate ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of how blessed it was, how much boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnto GODS Almighty goodnesse, for that he hath sent vs so gracious a King: A King, that did so constantly professe CHRISTES true Religion establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the Church of England: a King, by whose happy commaund we were free from many cares, many dangers, many perills.</p>
            <p>Moreouer also, he shewed, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists in diuers places, (as his Maiesty was certaynely informed) did bragge in words, <hi>That they were in a good hope of

a Toleration:</hi> hereunto adding a speach of his Maiestyes, concerning the folly of Papists, how they were besotted, yea; and more then bewitched, to suppose any such matter, wondering, whereupon they should builde their false hopes; adding thereunto also, that his Maiesty was so surely perswaded of the truth of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, so firmely grounded vpon the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty thereof, and so constantly bent for the mayntenance thereof, as that he yowed vnto his Priuy Councell, that if he did know that any of his children after him (which I hope neuer will be) would goe backe from the Religion which hee now professed, and maintayne any other, that vpon that childe hee would lay his curse.</p>
            <p>These and many other matters (which not a little ioyed me to vnderstand, how constant his Maiesty is for the maynte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Gospell) I heard with mine owne eares, whereof I thought it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a little Uillage in Herefordshire, called by the name of</hi> Allens Moore, <hi>distant from the City of Hereford, two little myles. In this Parish (as also in many other thereabouts) the Priestes of Rome haue so bestirred themselues, that with their doctrine, they haue so poysoned and made many drunke, with the dregges of the fornication of the Whoore of Rome, as that they are become obstinate Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants, to repayre to the Church, and to participate of our Churches Sacraments, the true and vndoubted Pledges of our saluation.</hi>

               <hi>And amongst the rest, without any further digression (to come to our present purpose) one</hi> Alice Wellington, <hi>wife of</hi> Thomas Wellington, <hi>of</hi> Allens-Moore, <hi>in the aforesayd County, Peoman, being but a simple woman, and voyd of any true grounds of Learning or Diuinity; but onely being seduced by the witcheries of</hi> Baals <hi>Priests, continued so obstinate in her erronious peruersnesse, that she, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto his Maiesties Lawes, would by no meanes nor perswasions, bee indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to repayre vnto the Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Maiesties Lawes in that case prouided. Whereupon, by the censure of the Church, shee rested excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It pleased GOD, to visit this</hi> Alice Wellington <hi>with sicknesse, and to lay his hand so heauy vpon her, that she dyed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, not hauing submitted her selfe vnto our Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereupon, the Uicar of the Parish being asked whether he would bury her? Hee the sayd Uicar (knowing that the Law would not admit those to be buryed, according to the order of our Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, who liuing, refuse to submit
<pb facs="tcp:20311:12"/>
themselues thereunto) refused the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof, alleadging; that hee should incurre the penalty and daunger of the Lawe, if hee should yeelde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hereupon, many Papists being aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised of her death; and drawing themselues together, they so determined, that among themselues, come what come would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it should bee performed after their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereupon it was agreed, that vpon the Tuesday following, being Tuesday in Whitsun weeke in the morning, it should be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Understand by the way, that the Uicars house being close to the Church-yard, as hee lay in his bed, about sixe of the clocke in the morning, some houre and halfe after Sunne rising, he heard the sound of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bell; and being vnacquaynted with such a sound, and wondring what it might be, hee started vp, and looked out at the wyndow, from whence he espyed (as he gessed) some fourty or fifty persons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying a Coarse round about the Church, one of which company had a</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:20311:13"/>
Saints-bell, another bare a Crosse, faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (as it seemed vnto him) vpon the end of a staffe; before the coarse some carryed Tapers burning, and other such trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: The rest of them being weaponed, some with Billes, some Staues, some Swords, &amp; other weapons; some of which men the Uicar himselfe knew, and some he knew not.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, the Uicar (as soone as hee could) arrayed himselfe: but before hee was dressed and come vnto them, the body was layd into the ground, and their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies welneere ended. Whereupon, the Uicar drawing neere, spake vnto them, blaming them for their boldnesse. But they little regarding his words, gaue him many reuiling tearmes, and bade him get him gone, if he tendered his owne life, and not to disturbe them, nor approach neere them.</p>
            <p>The Uicar being but himselfe alone, and seeing so many weaponed in offensiue maner, thought it bootles to say any more, or to make resistance against so rude a company, and thereupon returned into his house.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20311:13"/>
After that the company was dissolued, the Uicar gaue the right Reuerend Father in God, the Lord Bishop of Hereford, then lying at the Palace in Hereford, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand thereof, both the maner how, the time when, and the names of some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whome he had seene and knowne in the said Action.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, his Lordship hauing an especiall care, for the suppressing of such tumults and disorders, and also knowing how much hurt the wincking thereat might easily procure; and withall, being zealously bent against their profane cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, directed a Warrant vnto the high Constable of that Hundred, <hi>George Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lond,</hi> for the speedy search for, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of such as were knowne to be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors therein.</p>
            <p>The high Constable hauing receyued the Warrant, with other petty Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, speedily repayred vnto the shoppe of one <hi>Iames Cowle,</hi> a Weauer of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerstone, neere thereunto adioyning, where the sayde <hi>Iames Cowle</hi> was, and also one <hi>Chadnor,</hi> a Weauer like wise,
<pb facs="tcp:20311:14"/>
who wrought in another roome adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, both of them being in the Warrant, the sayd high Constable, <hi>George Wenlond,</hi> caused them both to be apprehended, by vertue of the sayd Warrant.</p>
            <p>But they beganne to striue and strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and would not goe with them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the purport of the Warrant: In which contention, the sayd <hi>Chadnor</hi> esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, some pursued him, the rest remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with <hi>Iames Cowle:</hi> but <hi>Cowle,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Kings Peace, desperately strooke at a Gentleman, named Master <hi>William Gough,</hi> with a short knife, which Weauers commonly vse to cut off their threeds, and there with grieuously woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the sayd Master <hi>William Gough</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the chynne. At which time also, one <hi>William Rogers,</hi> one of the Constables, was hurt in seuerall places vpon the hand.</p>
            <p>It happened, that as they were thus contending, one <hi>Leonard Marsh,</hi> of <hi>Kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> who had likewise beene in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Action, and was also one of the men named in the Warrant, came into the sayd Shoppe, where the same <hi>Iames Cowle</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:20311:14"/>
was.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the sayd <hi>Leonard Marsh</hi> was likewise apprehended; and in their striuing, the Constable being hurt, and Master <hi>Gough</hi> likewise, the sayd <hi>Iames Cowle</hi> escaped also; in so much that none, saue onely the aforesayd <hi>Leonard Marsh,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in their power.</p>
            <p>The rest hauing escaped, and wilfully indangered themselues, by committing such vyle misdemeanors against his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties sworne Officers, the high Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tooke the sayd <hi>Leonard Marsh</hi> with him toward <hi>Hereford;</hi> and by the way as hee passed, he charged diuers such as he met with, in his Maiesties name, to bee assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant vnto him, in conducting the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner vnto <hi>Hereford:</hi> in so much, that hee had to his ayde some fifteene or sixteene men, euery one taking with him such wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons as they could come presently by, and as the haste required; whereby they were but very meanely and slenderly weapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>In this maner marching towards <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford</hi> City, suite was made vnto the high Constable, by a brother of the sayd
<pb facs="tcp:20311:15"/>
               <hi>Leonard Marsh,</hi> that he would stay his course with the Prisoner, vntill such time, as Master <hi>William Morgan</hi> of Treble Parke had spoken with him.</p>
            <p>But the high Constable following the wordes of his Warrant, aduisedly replyed, That hee might not stay his course; for his Warrant was to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, <hi>William Marsh,</hi> brother vnto the sayd <hi>Leonard Marsh,</hi> called vnto his brother, and bade him not to goe with them.</p>
            <p>Thereupon, the sayd <hi>Leonard</hi> began to draw backwards; but being himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he was by strength forced forward softly.</p>
            <p>Thus, hauing gone on softly some two miles, when as they came within a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a myle of <hi>Hereford</hi> City, suddenly they espyed themselues beset on euery side the way with men (in number as they gessed, some forty or fifty) weaponed, some hauing Bowes &amp; Arrowes, some Billes, some Long-staues and Pikes, some Swords; And so inclosing the high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, and his company, they demaunded,
<pb facs="tcp:20311:15"/>
whither he conuayed the Prisoner? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That his Warrant was to carry him to <hi>Hereford.</hi> The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> they demaunded, For what purpose? He answered, That when he came there, they should know. At which words, one of them set a Iauelin to his brest, and charged him, vnlesse he meant to see his owne guts, to let goe the Prisoner.</p>
            <p>The high Constable perceyning in what danger hee was; and also knowing how far too weake his company was to make resistance, being (as before is said) but some fifteene or sixteene persons, and those also, (as not mistrusting so bold a rescue) but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanely weaponed; yea, welneere as good as altogether without weapons, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had reasoned with those vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble persons, and shewed them the danger that they had thrust themselues into, by making so rebellious a rescue (seeing no meanes of resistance, let goe the Prisoner, who as soone as he was loose, had a Byll presently by some of the company deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him: and then in most bold and presumptuous maner beganne to threaten diuers of those, that were with the high Constable to ayde him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20311:16"/>
Presently, as soone as the sayd <hi>Leonard Marsh</hi> was rescued, came the aforesayd Master <hi>William Morgan</hi> of Treble Parke (who is now with some others sent vp to London) vnto the high Constable: vnto whome the high Constable spake some words, as blaming him for the rescue, and that hee should be the cause thereof, and that his comming in afterwards, was but only to colour the matter. All which, the sayd Master <hi>Morgan</hi> denyed, excusing himselfe, that hee came onely to speake a word or two with him, not knowing any thing at all of the rescue.</p>
            <p>The Prisoner being thus rescued, the high Constable gaue present notice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnto the Bishop of <hi>Hereford:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, the Priuy Councell was presently with all speed informed thereof: and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly were sent for vp to London, some such as were knowne, to be chiefe Actors therein.</p>
            <p>Upon which businesse, <hi>Sir Herbert Croft</hi> was dispatched into the countrey. And after inquiry made, certayne Gentlemen were sent vp to London, to answere the matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20311:16"/>
Upon which occasion, diuers Iustices in this County haue bene since that time put out of the Commission of the Peace, as knowne to bee too much leauing vnto the Popish faction.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I briefly related vnto you, the true maner of the Papists proceedings in these late Actions: if any other matter of moment ensue hereupon, I wil not faile (God willing) but certify you thereof by my Letters. <hi>Hereford, the nyne and twentieth of Iune.</hi> 1605.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL promises, that with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty may bee kept amongst men, ought to bee obserued, and especially amongst those that by loue and inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection are so neerely obliged each to other, as wee both are.</p>
            <p>I remember well, that by my last Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I bound my selfe vnto your seruice, if any materiall accident worthy the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, concerning the late broyles in our parts, should happen; and although
<pb facs="tcp:20311:18"/>
I must needs confesse, that my style in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, be very blunt and harsh, yet know I this also, that the matter and substance of my lynes are true. which may in some sort counteruaile the glosing eloquence of some Rhetoricians, who study more for sine and fyled phrases, then for the truth of matter: for vnlesse I be much deceyued, the thing that you most desired, was the truth, and that also was the end, whereunto my thoughts tended, and principally aymed at: and therefore, I hope, that you will rather accept of <hi>nudam veritatem,</hi> without eloquence, then of eloquence without the truth.</p>
            <p>Within fewe dayes after that I had written my last Letter (dated as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, the nyne and twentyeth day of Iune) vnto your worship, the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, the Earle of <hi>Worcester,</hi> came downe vnto his Place of Ragland in <hi>Munmouthshire,</hi> with full authority from his Maiesty, of present Iustice to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted vpon such as had beene Actors in these causes.</p>
            <p>Now, albeit that the matters were far gone, and diuers misorders committed,
<pb facs="tcp:20311:18"/>
yet seeing it booted not to withstand any further, hauing waded too farre already, most of the principall of them came in, and yeelded themselues vnto his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, such as his Lordship in his wisedome thought fit to be proceeded with somewhat sharpely, after examination, he caused to be committed to prison, vntill his Maiesties further pleasure be known, where diuers of them yet remayne: with others, who were lesse obstinate, and onely carryed away by false perswasions of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Factors, being of themselues inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to accord vnto the trueth, if their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences might be thereunto perswaded. His Lordship tooke a more milde course, seeking to wynne them vnto the trueth, by reasons grounded vpon Gods Worde, which is the onely Rocke, whereupon the conscience must build. And so effectually hath his Honour dealt in this case with many of them, as that from stiffe Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants, they are conuerted, and become new Scholers in Christes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>Schoole, and I trust will proceed rightly, and in a rightful course hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20311:19"/>
I could name diuers of good account, who haue reconciled themselues vnto our Church, by his Lordships honourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with them, and do now dutifully repaire vnto the Church.</p>
            <p>What will become of those that are yet Prisoners, I know not, as yet they onely remayne in durance, vntill his Maiestyes pleasure be knowne.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> Most merciful Lord God, and louing Father, wee thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and sheep of thy pasture, hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>bly prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our selues at the foote of thy diuine Maiesty, do here confesse, that we are not worthy of the least of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable benefits, which thou in mercy, for thy Sonne Christ Iesus sake hast besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpon vs; neyther are we worthy to be called thy children, but only in &amp; through
<pb facs="tcp:20311:20"/>
him, in whom thou art well pleased: for wee haue disobeyed thy will, broken thy Lawes, contemned thy Precepts, and cast thy Commaundements behind vs: if thou shouldest call vs to account for our liues misspent, for our deeds misdone, and for our maniford tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>sgressions which we haue commited, we are not able to answere thee one for a thousand, it is impossible that we should stand in thy sight: Nay, Lord, if thou shouldest but marke what is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, why then, who were able to abide it?</p>
            <p>We were not, and thou of thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse madest vs to be; and when we were, we fell away from thee, and forsooke thee: But thou (who before wee were, causedst our being) when we were, wouldest not<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> suffer vs to be lost for euer; but didest send thy Sonne Christ Iesus to redeeme our soules out of the hands of Sathan, who otherwise would haue seyzed vpon vs, and greedily haue deuoured vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20311:20"/>
Not long since, O Lord, we sate in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and in the shaddow of death; we slept in ignorance, not knowing the precious sweetnesse of thy holy Word; we liued in blindnesse, not knowing whither we went, but as we were led; and withall, our leaders were blind, in so much, that the blind lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the blind, (hadst not thou sent vs a guide to conduct vs) we had both fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ditch.</p>
            <p>Thy holy word, O Lord, is a Lanthorn vnto our feet, and a light vnto our pathes: thy holy Spirit is the guide to lead vs vnto the light; and the light, which is thy holy word, is that which leadeth vs vnto salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. O Lord, take not this light from vs, but let it euer shine as bright vnto vs, as the Sun at noone day. And for this cause, O Lord, we render vnto thee most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hearty thanks, for the long, happy, glorious, and prosperous raigne of our late dread Soueraigne, Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whose blessed and happy gouernment
<pb facs="tcp:20311:21"/>
so many yeeres together, we inioyed the light of thy holy word, and by whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy the truth thereof was euer since the beginning of her Raigne, mightily main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned. We thanke thee, O Lord, for all those blessings, that by and through her thou diddest conferre vpon vs thy vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy children: as namely, the practice and profession of thy holy word: The quiet possessing of that we had, (euery man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his owne Vyne, peaceably eating the labour of his owne hands:) The great number of many paynefull, learned, and faithfull Preachers, which vnder her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment thou diddest send into thy Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard: The graue, wise, and honourable Counsellours, that by thy gracious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, thou didst appoynt vnto her: Their true, faythfull, and dutifull seruice, that (guided by thy grace) they performed vnto her: The preuention of many euils &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (entended to haue bin wrought by the
<pb facs="tcp:20311:21"/>
hands of villaynes) which, had they taken effect, might haue bin the vtter ouerthrow and ruine of our whole Countrey: The quiet and peaceable end, that (protected with thy Shield, maugre the malice of all her enemies) after the common course of Nature, peaceably dying in her bed, she made, leauing (as in right they did belong) her imperiall Crownes vnto our now gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and renowmed Soueraigne Lord King IAMES, by thy grace, of great Brittayne, Fraunce and Ireland, King, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the same true, Catholike and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolike fayth, which she formerly did.</p>
            <p>Lord, we humbly againe, and againe, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our bended knees, from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of our hearts pray and beseech thee, that, as of thine especiall loue and fauour vnto vs, thou hast giuen vs so gracious and religious a King: so thou wilt of the same thy louing mercy, protect and defend him, in all dangers and perilles whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20311:22"/>
Guide, O Lord, his going fotth, and his comming in: blesse him in all the actions that he shall take in hand. Put (O Lord) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his heart good desires, strengthen him with thy continuall grace, and in the end, bring him to thy euerlasting kingdome.</p>
            <p>As he is; so, O Lord, continue him, a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full professor of thy Gospel; a zealous and religious confessor therof; a true and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty defender thereof; a barre and obstacle, to hinder all the courses and proceedings that either Papists (or other enemies of thy Gospell whatsoeuer) shall go about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent for the suppressing of the truth. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer them, O Lord, and let their deuices, if they perseuer in wickednes, redound vnto their owne shame and confusion. Protect and defend him, O Lord, in all his wayes; counsell him in all his consultations; let all his thoughts, wordes and workes, tend vnto the honour and glory of thy holy name, and his owne endlesse ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20311:22"/>
Continue him a true maintayner of the truth: Establish and confirme thy truth in his heart: Root out Antichrist, and pull downe his pride: Let Religion (as now it doeth) alwayes flourish in this kingdome: Suppresse the power and might of Sathan: Cause an vnity in the Church: Graffe vs all into one stocke, and let vs be all composed into one body, whereof thy Sonne Christ Iesus is the head.</p>
            <p>And because, O Lord God Almighty, that Kings and Princes, as they are here on earth, in highest Offices and authority vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee, so are they chiefe markes for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans Instruments to shoot at, wee meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray and beseech thee, that thou wilt blesse and defend his Royall Maiesty from all the desperate &amp; wicked attempts, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer Sathan, or wicked Traytors, his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, shall vndertake. O Lord, let them all (who wish him any harme) sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be consumed, perish, and come to a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full end. Blesse, O Lord, our gracious
<pb facs="tcp:20311:23"/>
Queene <hi>Anne,</hi> our noble Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> and all the rest of the King and Queenes royall Issue: Let their Posterity neuer fayle; but let them continue Kings and Queenes of this Land, to maintayne the Trueth vnto the worlds end.</p>
            <p>Disperse, O Lord, all the mists of error and superstition; Let those that are blinde, and fayne would see the Light participate with vs in the Truth: Settle all misorders whatsoeuer, that are any where in these his Maiesties kingdomes, either in Church or Common-wealth. Let peace dwell in our quarters, and let not the name of Warre be heard amongst vs. Conuert those vnto thy truth, that are yet vnconuerted; and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish those in the Truth, who are already conuerted.</p>
            <p>Finally, O good God, blesse and preserue all and euery particular member, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this thy Church of great Brittaine: make vs all ready to serue thee, and faithfull subiects vnto his Maiesty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20311:23"/>
These, and all other blessings, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer thou in thy wisdome shalt thinke ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for vs, wee begge at thy mercifull hands, for his sake, in and through whome thou first louedst vs, euen Christ Iesus our Lord and alone Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</p>
