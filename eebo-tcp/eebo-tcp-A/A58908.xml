            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Fortune aſſiſts the bold; this you need not travel ſo far as <hi>Florence</hi> to experiment, ſeeing our great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of Safety ſtagger at noiſe. Had your City Magiſtrates been confident of their own Authority and Strength, the Iron Gate had opened, and theſe Inohantments which affrighted them had vaniſht, Your City, as <hi>Monſieur de Rohan</hi> ſaid of <hi>England,</hi> is a Beaſt indomitable, when provoked; and cannot be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but by itſelf, having now Beſides the Magazine of Arms, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and Money, (<unclear>the</unclear> Sinews of War) that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which others want, with the Concurrence of all the Nation, except the common Enemy. All that can be required to a happy Iſſue, conſiſts under GOD in your Reſolution to Defend your ſelves, and truſt to your own Courage: all other Parties are onely Factions and you the Umpaire. It lies now in your own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage to break the Yoak, and by gaining your Liberty, to ſet us Free. If you joyn with any particular Intereſt, you yield the Cauſe, and ſuffer them to ride you for their own buſineſs, changing your Maſters not your Bondage. If you keep your Swords in your Hands, and your Money in your purſes, the very Tax, Excize, and Cuſtom which you may ſpare, will bear your change and tire your Oppoſers. Above all, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Cajoles; Treaties are yet new to you, and dagerous to the beſt experienced, having to doe with Men that hold no Faith: Oaths Promiſes in ſuch a Juncture ſerve onely to delude the Credulous, and gain eaſie ſecure Victories: He that truſts not cannot be deceived. The yielding any Point in Treaty makes way for new Demands, and doth encourage hope to overcome. You will finde it moſt ſafe and Honourable to inſiſt upon a Free Parliament, and take in the conſiderable Vote of the Nation, without relying yon Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Fortune, whoſe Trade is to perpetuate the War, and their Livelihood to eat up the induſtrious. I wiſh you the Honour to oblige that Thanks which the Peoples Deliverance may challenge. So reſts,</p>
