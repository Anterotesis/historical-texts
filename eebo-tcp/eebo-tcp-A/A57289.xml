            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>BEing about to publish the ensuing little Book, These are humbly to beg your Lordship's <hi>Patrociny,</hi> which I am emboldened to do on the following Reasons.</p>
            <p>First, Because it had its Birth under your Lordship's Roof, while I had the Honour to be one of your Lordship's Domesticks.</p>
            <p>And in the next place, because it is in it self improveable for promoting of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Business,</hi> in both which respects your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship hath rendred your self eminent amongst those of your Rank.</p>
            <p>By a long and undaunted owning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing of the former, both in publick and private Capacities, your Lordship is no less signalized than your renowned Ancestor was at the famous Battel of <hi>Solan Mosse,</hi> where
<pb facs="tcp:36695:3"/>
he purchased Victory for his Country, entailed Honour upon his Family, and enrolled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the Registers of Fame as a <hi>Hero</hi> of the first Magnitude, whose Atchievement oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions one of the noblest Passages that the History of the Kingdom affords.</p>
            <p>By your Lordship's Skill and Dexterity in managing the latter, you have aggrandized your Revenues, and made them more adaequate than formerly to the Splendor of your Family.</p>
            <p>These things being considered, it seems very natural for this <hi>Enchiridion</hi> to cast it self at your Lordship's feet and beg your Protection, which tho the subject matter thereof be but mean, and seemingly below your Lordship's Grandeur to Patronize, yet being the best way I can conceive my self able to express my Gratitude for Obligations I am under to your Lordship, I hope it will be taken in good part from him who shall always look upon it as his Honour to have been, and ambitious still to entitle himself,</p>

            <p>THE Usesulness of Short-hand is so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally known, and readily apprehended, that it is needless for me to say any thing in its Commendation, and therefore I shall here only give an Answer to an Objection some make against it, and an account of this present Essay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It teaches to spell false.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They will scarcely be capable to learn this Art, that are not before-hand able to read and write, and consequently so acquainted with the Rules of spelling true, that they will be in no hazard of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to spell false.</p>
            <p>I desire such also to consider that there is a great difference betwixt spelling <hi>false</hi> and <hi>short;</hi> for in this Art we acknowledg that the leaving out of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Letters is injoyn'd, but will not so readily grant that therefore we teach to spell false. Some able Criticks in our Language do wish that this Method were more in Practice; for as it is no Perfection in any Language to have more Letters in its Words than are sufficient to sound it, it can be no injury to it to have what is unnecessary expunged; and surely if this course were taken it would make our Language more easie to our own Youth to read, and to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners both to read and speak. These Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have prevail'd with the <hi>French</hi> of late to leave
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36695:4"/>
out a great many of such Letters as they do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce; and since we Apify them in many worse things, it will be no great Crime to do it a little in this.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I desire such Objectors to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that we do not teach them to write the same way in <hi>Long-hand</hi> that they do in <hi>Short,</hi> but make the difference between the two plainly appear, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently teach true spelling in <hi>their Sense</hi> over again, for the Examples are first given as they should be in Long-hand, and then as they should be in Short-hand.</p>
            <p>But some will still object and say, that by writing Short-hand they will get a habit of spelling false.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They may with as much Reason argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst learning Latin and French; because in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer they are accustomed to pronounce all the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and so because they read <hi>fine finé,</hi> in Latin they must needs read the English Word <hi>fine</hi> so too; or because they are accustomed to read <hi>nostre notre</hi> in French, they must needs read the English word <hi>Oister Oter</hi> too; or because in Arithmetick we express Numbers by Figures, we should in other cases get a habit of doing so too. But the contrary is so evident, that to make such Objections would be justly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ridiculous.</p>
            <p>I shall now give you an account of this present Essay, as followeth.</p>
            <p>Being very desirous to learn Short-hand, I perused all the Authors I could meet with for that end, but missing that Satisfaction I expected in them, I set about this Composure for my own use. In prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which I discovered several considerable things (not taken notice of by former Authors) that fall very naturally under Rules of Contraction, which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36695:4"/>
after several Years Practice and Experience of their Usefulness, I now publish for common Benefit in the ensuing Method.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here is an easie Alphabet, in composing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I took care to make the Characters distinct in their shapes, and easie to be joyned together, which several of our late Authors not observing, have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged their Learners on that account in the very Threshold.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here are all the double Consonants (except two) intirely framed of the Letters of the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, whereas others make such Marks as have no dependance upon the same, and is consequently a double charge to the Memory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You have here the places of the Vowels in better order than hitherto; others having assigned the place of <hi>a</hi> and <hi>e</hi> both at top, and <hi>o</hi> and <hi>u</hi> both at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, or <hi>a</hi> just above the Letter, and <hi>u</hi> just underneath it; the inconvenience of both which Methods you may see by these Examples, for according to the former, where <hi>e</hi> and <hi>u</hi> are only distinguished from <hi>a</hi> and <hi>o</hi> by their greater distance from the Letter before them, if one were writing in haste it will be difficult to keep due distance, and so the places being the same, there is hazard of confounding words of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Signification; or if, according to the latter, one were to write <hi>Baruch,</hi> it must be writ thus r / b, and then one is at a loss where to joyn <hi>ch;</hi> or <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi> it must be writ thus h / m, and then you are at a loss again where to dispose of your following Letters, and so of all words of these sorts: but both these Inconveniences are avoided here, as you may see by looking upon Figure 3 in the Copper Plate.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:36695:5"/>
            <p n="4">4. All others having enjoyned the proper Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Vowel to be writ when it begins a Word, instead thereof I have ordered a prick to be put in the Vowels place, which is sooner writ than any other Character, and will be also more beautiful.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whereas others have only given a general hint, and some few instances to leave out superfluous Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I have given a particular account of them all, with Directions to know when they are to be left out, which must needs be a considerable help to the Younger, who cannot discern them, and the Elder who have not leisure to consider which they are.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I have given you such Rules for <hi>exchanging</hi> Letters of like sound, by which one may often serve for two or three, and such a plain Table of Syllables for <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>ending</hi> of words as hath more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the Alphabet than any yet extant.</p>
            <p n="7">7. You have here Rules how to express the words <hi>of, to, with, from, by</hi> and <hi>for</hi> without writing any thing for them, and such a short way of expressing the small Particles <hi>a, the, this, that, these, those,</hi> and the Pronouns <hi>ours, yours, theirs,</hi> &amp;c. and the degrees of Comparison, or the words <hi>more, most, than of the, among them,</hi> &amp;c. as was never hitherto published by any.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Such Rules for shortning the <hi>Persons, Moods,</hi> and <hi>Tenses</hi> as will be of exceeding good use, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the words <hi>thou, he, we, ye, they, let, wish, may, can, might, ought, would, should, may,</hi> or <hi>can here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after</hi> are contracted, the words <hi>do, am, was, have, had, shall</hi> and <hi>will</hi> are left out.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Moods, Tenses and Persons, are improved in the same manner in Sentences <hi>Interrogatory</hi> and <hi>Negative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:36695:5"/>10. You have here Rules for contracting of short words when they come together, and for abrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of long words, expressing of Contrarieties, and Repetitions as short as any yet extant; which, being well adverted to, will sufficiently supply the want of, and be much more useful and practicable than such Tables (wherewith some Authors abound) which have neither sufficient dependance upon the Letters of the Alphabet, nor do naturally represent the thing signified; and consequently are difficult to learn, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome to the Memory, and hard to retain; as may appear by this instance: Some Authors prescribe <hi>ab</hi> to be writ for <hi>abominable,</hi> and such like, which with as much reason may signify <hi>absolute, abundance,</hi> and any other word that begins with <hi>ab,</hi> whereas by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an <hi>m</hi> in the place of <hi>o</hi> according to the Rules here given, the <hi>root</hi> of the word is fully expressed, and consequently no doubt what it is, neither doth it occasion any burden to the Memory, nor difficulty in reading, both which are necessary Consequents of the former Method.</p>
            <p n="11">11. You have here a Table of Analogical Marks, wherein the Characters for the most part represent naturally the thing signified, and will consequently make a quick Impression on, and be no burden to the Memory.</p>
            <p n="12">12. You have also a Specimen of other Tables, with Directions how to compose them if so be you approve of them.</p>
            <p>I desire the Ingenuous Reader before he gives his Censure of the Work, to consider well the constant use there will be of the above-mentioned Rules for shortning and leaving out of words which are so common in all Discourses, and in the next place to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36695:6"/>
consider the natural Method in which they are laid down, so as they may be quickly learned, and not burdensome to the Memory to retain; and I doubt not but he will easily be perswaded, that besides the removal of former Difficulties, there is a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Essay made here towards the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if not Perfection, of Short-hand.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude with some <hi>Directions</hi> for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter learning this Art.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You are desired either to unfold the engraven Sheet at <hi>Pag.</hi> in which the Examples are, and let it lie before you, turning from the Rule to the Example in the said Sheet to which the Number will direct you; or to cut it out, that you may have it ready on all occasions, and by laying the Book upon it, and moving it to the several Examples, they will be as readily seen against every Rule as if they were writ on the same Page.</p>
            <p>The Reason of my taking this Course was both to avoid the Expenses of engraving the whole Book, and because I judg it a readier way of teaching; for having once read over and understood the Rules, the unfolding of this Sheet, and looking upon the Examples, will instruct you sufficiently without turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Book; the Sheet is also more portable upon all occasions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Learn but a little at a time, lest you make it burdensome to your self; the best way is to write the Examples over and over, till you can do them readily. But be not discouraged tho you cannot read what you write at first, for that is common to all Beginners.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:36695:6"/>
            <p n="3">3. Observe there are several things peculiar to the Scotish Dialect which are marked <hi>S,</hi> so that the English Learner may omit them; and that there are several Anglicisms, or things peculiar to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Dialect, which are marked <hi>A,</hi> so that my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men may do therein as they judg best.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If there be any thing you do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, advise with those of riper Years and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Such as have learned other Short-hands, and desire a further improvement, are desired to peruse the whole Book, wherein they will find several things of good use, but more especially the Contraction of the Verbs, Moods, Times, and Persons. I hope you will excuse the length of this, seeing it serves both for Preface, Contents, and Directions.</p>

               <p>There are also two Characters for <hi>S,</hi> that the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may take which of them he shall find most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to joyn with other Letters. See the Alphabet.</p>
               <p>For the better understanding of the following Rules, the Learner is desired to observe that the Letters <hi>a, e, i, o, u,</hi> are called Vowels, and the rest of the Letters are called Consonants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:36695:7"/>It must be observed that the Letters J and V coming before themselves, or any other Vowel in the same Syllable, are Consonants, as in the words</p>

               </head>
               <p>When a word begins or ends with a Vowel, the said Vowel must not be expressed by its proper Character, but by a prick put in its place: which that you may the more easily remember and understand, observe that their places are according to their rank in the Alphabet, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>

                  <label>a</label>
                  <item>Being the first Vowel, hath the first place, <hi>viz.</hi> a little higher than the following Letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not just over it. See the Copper Plate at fig. 3.</item>
                  <label>e</label>
                  <item>Being the second Vowel, hath the second place, <hi>viz.</hi> just against the upper corner of the following Letter. See again at fig. 3.</item>
                  <label>i</label>
                  <item>Being the third Vowel, hath the third place, <hi>viz.</hi> just against the middle of the Letter. See fig. 3.</item>
                  <label>o</label>
                  <item>Being the fourth Vowel, hath the fourth place, just against the lower corner of the following Letter. See fig. 3.</item>
                  <label>u</label>
                  <item>Being the fifth Vowel, hath the fifth place a little lower than the following Letter, but not just under it. See again at fig. 3.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:36695:7"/>You must also take notice that the places of the Vowels are the same after a Consonant as before one, and that the Letter <hi>y</hi> when joined to a Consonant hath always the sound of the Vowel <hi>i,</hi> and therefore is expressed in the same manner. In the next place observe carefully the places of the Vowels about the Letters <hi>l</hi> and <hi>s,</hi> you will easily understand these things by viewing the Examples at fig. 3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When a Vowel comes between two Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, it is to be expressed by putting the latter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant in its place. See fig. 4.</p>
               <p>In this Art we do not regard true spelling, but for swiftness sake leave out all the Letters that are not pronounced in speaking; which that you may the better understand, I have given in the following Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a particular account of all such Letters, with Rules how to know them and when to leave them out; the Learner must write them in Short-hand Letters till he can do them well.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:36695:13"/>13. The words, <hi>I, thou, he, we, ye, they,</hi> do often come before Verbs, and are called Persons. See for their Characters, fig. 13.</p>
               <p>There are three times of doing or suffering, <hi>viz. the time past, the time present, the time to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We express the <hi>time past</hi> by the words <hi>have, have been, had, had been, did</hi> and <hi>was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We express the <hi>time present</hi> by the words <hi>do</hi> and <hi>am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We express <hi>the time to come</hi> by the words <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>will be, shall,</hi> and <hi>shall be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now according to the order of Nature, and not of Grammar, supposing that many may learn this Art, that never learned that, I have put the time past first, the present in the middle, and the time to come last.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Therefore when the word <hi>have</hi> comes either after any of the words <hi>I, thou, he, we ye, they,</hi> or any other word, it is not to be writ, but the word that comes after it is to have the first Letter of it writ higher than the corner of the word before it, which being the first place is the place of <hi>have,</hi> which is the sign of the first time. See fig. 14.</p>
               <p>Instead of the words <hi>have been,</hi> write after the same manner, but because that is a <hi>Passive Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it must be distinguished by putting a little stroke on the back of the first Letter of the word that <unclear>comes</unclear> after <hi>have been.</hi> See the Example, fig. 14.</p>
               <p>For <hi>had</hi> and <hi>had been,</hi> write in the same manner, only let the word which comes after <hi>had</hi> be writ at twice so much distance from the word that goes before it, as the word was that came after <hi>have,</hi> and let the word that comes after <hi>had been,</hi> have a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36695:13"/>
stroke put on its back according to the former Rule. See the next Example<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fig. 14.</p>
               <p>When the word <hi>did</hi> comes after any of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> or <hi>another word,</hi> it is not to be writ, but sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by its place also, which is just against, or even with the upper corner of the word that goes before it, and therefore the word that comes after it must be writ in that place at such distance as it may not be confounded with the word that goes before it.</p>
               <p>See the next Example, fig. 14.</p>
               <p>For the word <hi>was</hi> it must be expressed the same way, but with this difference, that being of a Passive or Suffering Signification, a little stroke must be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the back of the word that follows it, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. See further fig. 14.</p>
               <p>The <hi>time present</hi> being between that which is <hi>past,</hi> and that which is <hi>to come,</hi> you must put such word as comes after <hi>do</hi> or <hi>am</hi> just against the middle of such word as went before them, only putting a <hi>stroke</hi> upon the back of such word as comes after <hi>am,</hi> because it is <hi>Passive.</hi> See fig. 14.</p>
               <p>The <hi>time to come</hi> being the <hi>last,</hi> you must put the <hi>word</hi> that comes after <hi>will</hi> or <hi>shall</hi> against the lower corner of the <hi>word</hi> that went before them, allowing double the distance from that word for <hi>shall</hi> that you do for <hi>will:</hi> and for <hi>will be</hi> and <hi>shall be,</hi> adding a stroke upon the back of the word that follows them because of the Passive Signification. See fig. 14. <hi>adhuc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some perhaps may object that the places of the Tenses, and the places of the words <hi>of, to,</hi> &amp;c. are confounded, but there can be no hazard of mistake in that, if it be considered that a Verb never comes after any of these words except <hi>to,</hi> concerning
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36695:14"/>
which you have a Rule in its place, and at first dash it will be seen that the word so placed as is directed here, is a Verb.</p>
               <p>Note that <hi>hast</hi> and <hi>hath</hi> must be expressed the same way as <hi>have, hadst</hi> the same way as <hi>had, didst</hi> the same way as <hi>did; wast</hi> and <hi>were</hi> the same way as <hi>was, dost</hi> and <hi>doth</hi> the same way as <hi>do;</hi> and <hi>shalt</hi> and <hi>wilt</hi> the same way as <hi>shall</hi> and <hi>will.</hi> See the last Examples, fig. 14.</p>
               <p>The Persons or Words which go before them will easily shew which should be read.</p>
               <p n="15">15. There are several <hi>ways</hi> of expressing our selves in doing or suffering, which the Latins call <hi>Moods,</hi> some of which fall under our Consideration in this Art. And first,</p>
               <p>The Imperative or <hi>commanding way,</hi> or Mood, wherein we express our selves (when we command) by the words <hi>do, let,</hi> or <hi>be,</hi> as <hi>do you go, let us come, be you obedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Persons or Words to which these words of command are usually affixed or joyned, are <hi>me, thou, him, us, you or ye,</hi> and <hi>them:</hi> concerning which observe the following Rules, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the first Letter of every such Person joyn over it in a commanding manner a straight stroke or short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand <hi>l,</hi> and to distinguish <hi>be,</hi> because it hath a Passive Signification, put a small dash on the back of the said stroke, observe the Examples fig. 15. where you must also take notice that for the word <hi>us</hi> there is a Short-hand <hi>s.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. Secondly, there is the <hi>Optative</hi> or <hi>wishing Mood,</hi> wherein we express our selves by the word
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36695:14"/>
                  <hi>wish,</hi> which is to be signified by a stroke put under the Person in a humble manner, but when the word <hi>wish</hi> comes after any other word it is to be expressed by putting a Short-hand <hi>w</hi> under the said word. See fig. 16.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Thirdly, there is the <hi>Potential Mood</hi> or <hi>way,</hi> whereby we express <hi>what may or ought to be done,</hi> which we do by the words <hi>may, can, would, should, might, ought, may,</hi> or <hi>can hereafter;</hi> concerning which observe that except <hi>have, had,</hi> or <hi>hereafter</hi> come after any of them, they do all belong to the present time, and therefore in that case the word that comes after any of them must be set just against the middle of the word before it.</p>
               <p>The way to express them is thus.</p>
               <p>If any of the said words <hi>may, can,</hi> &amp;c. come after a Person, then the first Letter of such word must be joyned to the Person which is enough to express any of them, but because several of them, as <hi>may</hi> and <hi>might, can</hi> and <hi>could,</hi> begin with the same Letter, you must distinguish them thus; write the first Letter of <hi>might</hi> and <hi>could</hi> close to the upper corner of the Person, and joyn the first Letter of <hi>may</hi> and <hi>can</hi> to the lower corner of the Person, see the Example in fig. 17. where you must also take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that to express the Passive Signification of <hi>be</hi> and <hi>been,</hi> &amp;c. there is a little dash put upon the back of the first Letter of the word.</p>
               <p>If the words <hi>may</hi> or <hi>can,</hi> &amp;c. come after any other word, then the Persons, <hi>I, thou,</hi> &amp;c. you must put the first Letter of such of them as it happens to be, above the Verb, but you must distinguish <hi>may</hi> from <hi>might,</hi> and <hi>can</hi> from <hi>could</hi> as formerly, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36695:15"/>
observe to add the <hi>little dash</hi> for the <hi>Passive Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> See and observe carefully the Example in fig. 17.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the <hi>Optative</hi> and <hi>Potential</hi> come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, observe the last Example, fig. 17.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Fourthly, there is the <hi>Subjunctive Mood,</hi> which some also call <hi>Conjunctive,</hi> because it doth not compleat a Sentence except another Verb be subjoyned or conjoyned, the signs by which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it are the words <hi>when, if, seeing,</hi> as <hi>when you come;</hi> you see that something more is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed or understood, to make the Sentence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, as <hi>when you come you shall hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The manner of expressing these words is thus, you must when they come after any Person, or other word subjoin, (that is to say joyn to the lower part of it) a Short-hand <hi>wh</hi> for <hi>when, f</hi> for <hi>if, s</hi> for <hi>seeing.</hi> See fig. 18.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the signs of the <hi>Optative, Potential,</hi> and <hi>Subjunctive,</hi> come together, as in this Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>I wish when you come you would stay.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which see the last Examples of Figure 18.</p>
               <p n="19">19. How to express <hi>to</hi> and <hi>to be,</hi> which Latins call marks of the <hi>Infinitive Mood,</hi> I refer you to Figure 19. where you have Examples how to use them. As also to express the <hi>must</hi> which is called a Gerund, by putting a Short-hand <hi>in</hi> under the Person or last Letter of the Word before it.</p>

               <head>Of Interrogatory Sentences.</head>
               <p n="20">20. For the words commonly made use of in asking Questions and their Characters, I refer you to number 20. in the Copper Plate, but take these following Rules for the use of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If they or any of them come before any of the Persons, <hi>I, thou, he,</hi> &amp;c. you must put the said Person in the place of the <hi>sign of the time</hi> that goes before it, as in this Example, <hi>What have I?</hi> you must first write the Character for <hi>what</hi> and put <hi>I</hi> in the place of <hi>have,</hi> which according to former Rules is higher than the upper corner of the word going before it, at such distance as it may not be taken for part of that word, and so of all others of this sort. See fig. 20.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Verb</hi> come after the Person, as in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>what shall I do,</hi> write as before, only put the Verb against the middle of the Person which is the present time, and so of all others, observing the former Directions for distinguishing one Mood or way from another, and the words that are Passive from the Active. See fig. 20.</p>
               <p>But it must be observed that the signs of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative or wishing Mood must be joyned to the lower part of the word of Question, as in this Example, <hi>what wisheth he for,</hi> the sign of the Optative Mood must be joyned to the lower end of the word <hi>what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> See fig. 20.</p>
               <p>The signs of the Potential Mood <hi>may, can, should,</hi> &amp;c. must be joyned to the head of the Person, after any such <hi>word</hi> of <hi>Question,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of <hi>may</hi> and <hi>might,</hi> and <hi>can</hi> and <hi>coulds</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36695:16"/>
with one Letter, joyn <hi>might</hi> and <hi>could</hi> to the upper corner of the <hi>Person</hi> on the left side, and <hi>may</hi> and <hi>can</hi> towards the lower corner on the same side. See fig. 20.</p>
               <p>The signs of the Subjunctive Mood <hi>when, if,</hi> and <hi>seeing,</hi> being always to be read before the Person, there is no difficulty in them. See Figure 20. <hi>adhuc.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. When a Question begins with any of these words <hi>do, did, have, had, will, shall,</hi> write the Person that follows after any of those words, and put a prick close to the back of the <hi>Person</hi> to shew that it is a Question, and put the following <hi>Verb</hi> in its proper <hi>time.</hi> See fig. 21.</p>
               <p>But if the word <hi>wish</hi> come after the <hi>Person,</hi> joyn the <hi>mark</hi> of the <hi>Optative</hi> to it, and put the Verb in its proper time. See fig. 21.</p>
               <p>If the words <hi>may, can, should, would,</hi> &amp;c. come before the Person, they must be joyned to the upper part of it as formerly, remembring also to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between <hi>may</hi> and <hi>might, can</hi> and <hi>could,</hi> and betwixt words of a <hi>Passive</hi> Signification and others, according to former Rules. See further, fig. 21.</p>
               <p>Observe if the said words in asking a Question should come before any other word but the Person, the first Letter of each of them must be writ above the word they come before, but remember to write <hi>may</hi> and <hi>can</hi> below the word. See further fig. 21.</p>
               <p>Note that tho at first one would think this last Rule is confounded with that in Number 17 <hi>Page,</hi> yet there is no hazard of mistaking one for the other; for the signs of the Potential Mood in that Rule are always to be put above or below a Verb, but here never.</p>

               <p n="23">23. Many times little words coming together may be joyned so as to be much shortned, especially if all of them end and begin with Vowels, or if the former end with the Vowel, and the latter begin with <hi>h,</hi> as <hi>com on</hi> for <hi>come on, t'us</hi> for <hi>to us, t'im</hi> for <hi>to him;</hi> and often when the first word ends with a Consonant, and the latter begins with a Vowel, as <hi>think ont</hi> for <hi>think on it.</hi>

               <p>The Rules for such Abbreviations are these.</p>

               <p>There are Syllables which are common for end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many words, as <hi>ed, est, eth,</hi> &amp;c. which for swiftness sake may be left out, and yet the Sense not be marred to any understanding Person; for if the <hi>root</hi> of the word be writ, the Sense will easily direct to the last Syllable, as if one should write <hi>thou understa me,</hi> sense will teach that it must be read <hi>thou understandest me,</hi> so <hi>thou lov me</hi> for <hi>lovest, teach</hi> for <hi>teachest;</hi> and so of any other word.</p>

a great many words which very rarely occur; and indeed, I think it impossible to compose such as shall be of constant use (except one accustom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to write only after one Man, and then it is not worth the while to do it) for there is as much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of expressing Conceptions (upon the same Subject) as there is of Faces. But if the Learner think well of that Method, he may by this Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple compose Tables to himself which he will more easily remember, than those of anothers Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for which the Authors have no reason to shew, but only because they will have it so: And tho it (it is true) there is no Art either to be invented or learned without some burden to the Memory, yet there is a great difference betwixt bestowing Pains in learning that which is a Rule in <hi>all cases of that sort;</hi> and that which serves only <hi>one case,</hi> and such as perhaps seldom occurs, and such are most of their Tables.</p>
               <p>I had composed Tables of my own that had some more reference to the things signified than those I now mentioned, and consequently less difficult to learn; but upon the very same Reasons I have here given, I omit them, only giving you a Specimen of them, that if they seem plausible to you, you may exercise your own invention in framing them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the following Exámples.</p>
               <p>I made all the Capital Print Letters to signifie the Titles and Attributes of God the Father, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with the said respective Letters, as A to signifie <hi>Almighty, All-seeing, All-sufficient,</hi> and <hi>All-wise</hi>

distingushed one from another by a prick put at the upper corner on the left side for <hi>Almighty,</hi> at the lower corner for <hi>All-seeing,</hi> at the upper corner of the right side for <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> and at the lower corner of it for <hi>All-wise,</hi> and so of all the Letters of the Alphabet; and then all the small Print Letters to signifie the Attributes of Christ, and some of them those of the Holy Ghost, and the other sorts of Letters to signifie the good and bad Qualities of Men and Things in the same manner.</p>
