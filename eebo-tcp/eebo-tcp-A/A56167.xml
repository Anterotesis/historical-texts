            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>For my writing by way of Quere;</hi> To which I answer, that I had both Presidents and Reasons for it.</p>

            <p>Reasons: 1. I conceived the Questions touching church-government were not rightly stated by most; and that the right stating of them by way of Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would be the best and speediest meanes to decide them. 2. The Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent party had neither then, nor since (to my knowledg) dogmatically resolved or discovered in print, what that church-government is they so eagerly contend for, and pretend to be so plainly set downe in the Word of God (being not y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>t all agreed what they hold, or should desire, except it be this, to be left at free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to doe what they please) and therefore I conjectured such <hi>Queries</hi> to be the only means to discover and refute their concealed Platform. 3. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies concerning church-government, were then and now in agitation in the <hi>Synod</hi> and high Court of <hi>Parliament,</hi> the properest Iudges of them; therefore I thought it better became me in point of modesty and good manners, to expresse my opinion of them by way of <hi>Question,</hi> then <hi>Decision.</hi> Finally, I found all <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> guilty of <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> in their Writings, Sermons, Discourses, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily concluding their form of church-government, to <note n="d" place="margin">The Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geticall Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Mr. Sympson.

               <hi>set form of praying or preaching to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, people, but left all men free to use their liberty and severall gifts in both; on which grounds they condemne all set forms of publike</hi> (if not private) <hi>prayers,</hi> (and some of them the use of the <hi>Lords owne prayer)</hi> together with there ading of <hi>set Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;</hi> upon which very grounds they must also deny all set formes of church-government, as well as of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Preaching:)</hi> And then have positively delineated, exactly proved <hi>the modell of this pretended Government, Discipline, in every particle thereof, by Gospel-Texts, so far as to satisfie mens erronious judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, consciences herein,</hi> that so they might either submit thereto without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, or propound their objections against the same. But in this maine point (whereon the hinge of the controversie turnes) the Respondent is wholly silent, and I shall expect his answer <hi>ad Graecas Calendas.</hi> Only lest he might seem to say nothing, he endevours to prove, that there is a set forme of Church-government prescribed by Christ in the Gospel, not by direct Texts, but from pretended <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities</hi> of his owne fancying, (for which he can produce no Text nor Reason) wherein he hath prevaricated, and shewes himselfe <hi>absurd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, (writes he) <hi>if this were granted (that there is no such set form of Church-government prescribed to all) the Gospell would be</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">He should say <hi>freer,</hi> where the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is left arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> 
               <hi>straiter then the Law, Christ more unfaithfull then</hi> Moses. If we deny these <hi>absurd consequences,</hi> you shall have these sound proofes of both subjoined; <hi>God set a patterne to</hi> * Moses <hi>of a carnal Temple,</hi> (you mistake good Sir, it was a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and that <hi>not carnall) which he charged him not to vary from in a tittle:</hi> (well, I grant it, because you produce <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 25. 40 Heb, 8 5.</note> two full Scriptures for it) Ergo, <hi>he hath prescribed a set pattern of Church-government and Discipline to all Christian Nations, Churches in the new Testament, from which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51482:3"/>
they must not vary in one tittle.</hi> If he (or any other) can shew me such a pattern as he contends for, so clearly delineated to us in the <hi>new Testament,</hi> as that pattern of the Tabernacle God shewed <hi>Moses</hi> was in the <hi>old,</hi> and then produce as direct precepts enjoyning all Christians, Republikes, Churches, not to vary from it in one tittle, as <hi>Moses</hi> had not to vary from his, I shall beleeve his sequell; till then I shall deeme it a true <hi>Independent argument,</hi> and as grosse a <hi>Non-sequitur</hi> as this, which necessarily followes upon the concession of it.</p>
            <p>God shewed and prescribed to <hi>Moses</hi> the expresse pattern or fashion of <hi>Aarons</hi> and his Sons garments, ornaments, under the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. <hi>Ergo</hi> he hath likewise shewed and prescribed the expresse pattern, fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and colour, of all Bishops, Presbyters, Ministers garments, orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under the Gospel, (most likely in the <hi>Roman Ceremoniall</hi> and <hi>Pontificall.)</hi> If the one consequence be ridiculous, the other must needs be so.</p>
            <p>But to quell this your principall Argument, First, <hi>the patterne in the mount</hi> was meant onely of the materials, forme, vessels and utensils of the Tabernacle, not of the Government and Discipline of the Iewish church; therfore very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Secondly, it was shewed only to <hi>Moses,</hi> the <hi>temporall Magistrate</hi> and chief Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Israelites; not to <hi>Aaron,</hi> or any private Independent Priest or Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of the Iewes; yea <hi>Moses</hi> (not they) <hi>was to make, or s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>made according to the pattern in the mount; Ergo</hi> (if there be any consequence from this patterne) not the Independent Minister or congregation, but Kings, chief temporall Magistrates, and Parliaments (the supreme civill Powers, Councels, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e likewise (under the Gospell) to prescribe and set up such a church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as is agreeable to Gods Word: as <hi>Moses, Joshua, David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Joshiah, Nehemiah, and other godly Princes, Governours,</hi> with their Parliaments or generall Assemblies did under the Law: And then what becomes of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Ministers, Congregations claimes to this Soveraigne temporall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, (a part of Christs Kingly office, delegated onely to Kings, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est temporall powers) which was never conferred on them? In fine, if there be any such expresse unalterable divine patterne of church-government under the Gospel, I pray informe me, why it was not as punctually, as particularly descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the new Testament, as the forme of the Tabernacle, of its materialls with all the services, ornaments, appurtenances of it, and of the Temple were under the Law?

            <p>His second Argument. <hi>That Christ should neither be faithfull as a husband, head, nor King of his Church, if he should give others power to order it as they pleased to their owne civill Government not setting downe his owne Lawes for them to walke by,</hi> is both a fallacy &amp; absurdity. There is no man doubts but that Christ in the Scriptures (which some of you refuse to heare read in <hi>our Churches,</hi> though * <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like reading of them be Gods owne ordinance)</hi> hath prescribed to us all necessary Rules Lawes both for our faith lives either in a general or special manner which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>l must pursue. But that he hath punctually or particularly set down any exact
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51482:3"/>
unalterable form of church-government, for all Christian Nations, Churches to follow, under pain of <hi>being unfaithfull in all the former respects;</hi> and that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependens <hi>Modell</hi> alone is that very patterne (the onely point in question) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains on your part to make good. A man may be a faithfull husband, King, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Father, though he prescribe not distinct particular Lawes, to regulate each particular action of his Wife, Subjects, Servants, Children: <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 40</note> 
               <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order,</hi> (a generall rule for church-government) is sufficient to excuse Christ from these your presumptuous reproaches, and regulate all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, though left indefinite, as well as this generall Rule for our Christian conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>Let your conversation be as becommeth the Gospel of Christ:</hi> and this other for our speech, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 29. <hi>Let no corrupt communication come out of your mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, but that which is good to the use of edifying.</hi> You may as well charge Christ with <hi>unfaithfulnesse,</hi> for not prescribing to us a generall <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or every particular action we should doe, every word we should speak, or Ministers preach upon any occasion, as for not prescribing a particular forme of church-government.</p>
            <p>His third Argument, that <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 1, 2. <hi>we read of a</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Belike the Reed by which he measured. it was Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</note>

            <p>After these three <hi>Independent</hi> Arguments, he pretends my third <hi>Quere</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the first, because I suppose a church-government may be consonant to Gods Word in the generall, which is not particularly prescribed in it: A pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty fancy! As if nothing could be consonant to Gods Word, which is not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularized or verbally enjoyned in it: Are not our materiall churches, garments, temporall Magistrates, Majors, Corporations, Parliaments, Courts of justice, Laws of all sorts, yea Festivals, Covenants, monthly Fasts, &amp;c. agreeable to Gods Word, because not literally prescribed in it? Are your private church-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, unmixt Communions (as you phrase them,) erections of Independent congregations without the licence of temporall Magistrates, not consonant to the Word in your owne opinions, though no where extant in it? If not, then all your divine pretences for them vanish, and you yeeld your cause: If yea, you must then recant this pretence of a contradiction, till you are able to prove <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> better then yet you have done.</p>
            <p>Having played the <hi>Logicians</hi> and contradictors part so well, he next betakes himself to his <hi>Anti-queries</hi> to prove a set church-modell: which are three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If no prescript forme</hi> (of church-government) <hi>in the Word, why not Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy (especially regulated and moderated) as well as Presbytery?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answere, if you meane it of Lordly Episcopacy, there are abundant preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Texts against it, to prove it opposite to Gods Word. If of moderated or regulated Episcopacy, the same with Presbytery: if the Parliament by the Synod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and why not you and all others?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If church-government be suited to States, whether Politicians are not more fit to consult about establishing it? Why is an Assembly of Divines called to search the Word about it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, that my position is, <hi>That every church-government ought to be suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Gods Word, as likewise to the civill State;</hi> Therefore Politicians and States-men are fit to be consulted with, to suit it best to the civill State; and an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines, to square it likewise by and to the Word: the true reason why in this our Realme, and all other Christian States (as I can abundantly manifest if need be) Ecclesiasticall Lawe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>what seemes good in your owne eyes, as if there was no King in Israel,</hi> without respect to the publike peace, weale, or glory of God) and then happily you may in time discerne, recant your errour.</p>
            <p n="12">12 To my twelfth <hi>Quere</hi> he onely answers, that I fall a <hi>jeering of my brethren,</hi> (a palpable untruth) <hi>and that I put a nick-name on them, to make them odious; to wit, the title of</hi> Independents, <hi>which they disclaime;</hi> not answering one syllable to the substance of the Question. To which I reply: First, that the title of <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency</hi> (of which you are now ashamed) was at first assumed, approved by your selves, and many of your party doe still owne, though some disclaim it, of purpose to evade the titles of <hi>Separatists</hi> and <hi>Brownists,</hi> with whom you really concurre in practice: Besides, you very well know that this title was imposed on, and owned by you long before I writ; therefore I could not father this brat upon you: But if you be offended with this name, I desire you in your next Pamphlet to discover to us your owne Christian name, with the true title of your party, and the government you plead for as the only way of Christs insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, (all which you have hitherto concealed) and then (God willing) I shall give you a further answer to this cavill, or retract this title; till then, I must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme you, that it most proper for your party, who will have every one of your owne private congregations, a complete absolute corporation, exempred from, unsubjected to, independent on any other, be it a Nationall, Synodall, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall, Parochiall assembly, Parliament or Kings themselves in any Church-affaires: You must therefore still retaine this <hi>Title,</hi> whiles you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine such Paradoxes both in opinion, practice, (and that by meere <hi>Independent inferences)</hi> as justly appropriated to you; <hi>Conveniunt rebus nomina saepe suis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never more exactly verified then in this your suitable name.</p>
            <p>But you object, first, <hi>That you are accountable for your actions to every neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Church, that shall in the name of Christ require it.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That you stand not independent from, but hold communion with all other Churches, both in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and in asking counsell and advice mutually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the first I answer, 1. That if you are accountable for your actions to every
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51482:9"/>
particular neighbour Church, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n why not much more to a Synod or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whose ecclesiasticall jurisdiction over you or your Churches is denied by you? Secondly, if you are thus accountable to every neighbour Church, doe you intend it of Parochiall. Episcopall, or Presbyteriall Churches, as well as Independent; or of Independent onely? If of Independent onely, as I suppose you doe, then you appeale onely to Churches of your owne partie, frame, judgment, and make one of them subordinate, accountable to another, but not to any other Church; which is an apparent schisme, separation from all other Churches, and contradicts your second objection: If of all other sorts of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as well as Independent, you must either grant them true Churches of Christ, and then you have no ground to sever from them; or if false, or no true Churches of Christ, (as you in truth repute them) then by your own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they are no competent Iudges of Ecclesiasticall affaires, nor you accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to them. Thirdly, How (I pray) doe you hold your selves accountable to every neighbour Church? by way of subordination, correction or just appeal? that I am certain you will deny: or only by way of voluntary information and satisfaction, when required, which I conceive you mean? If so only, then this is properly no account at all, or but arbitrary at most, which you may deny if you please; and if you erre, or prove faulty, or refractory, this neighbour Church can but admonish, not enforce you to correct your errours or injustice: and so this will prove but a meere mockery in stead of an account.</p>
            <p>To the second I answer, <hi>That if you stand not Independent from other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but hold communion with them in Ordinances, and in mutuall counsell and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> Then 1. why doe you separate from them as no true Churches, and oppose their way of Government with so much bitternesse? Secondly, why doe you refuse to administer Baptisme and the Lords Supper to those who are their members, in your Churches, unlesse they be professed members of some Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Congregation? Thirdly, why do you not follow their advice counsell, or the Parliaments Synods admonition, and submit therto; who now earnestly perswade you from your way of separation, division, in these distracted times? the end of demanding good counsell and advice being but to follow, not reject it, where there is humility, ingenuity, or sincerity in those who ask it. You must therefore either disclaime these objected concessions, or become more tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the future. 4. You tell us in the next succeeding lines, <hi>That neither I; nor Synods, nor this Synod, are infallible, but as subject to errours as others; and that never</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">Yea, never more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous errours ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>more dangerous errours have been confirmed then by Synods: and therfore men are not bound in conscience to their decrees upon penaltie of sinne, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, &amp;c.</hi> But pray Sir may not you and your Independent Ministers, Churches erre as well as others? Is infallibility annexed onely to your private Chaires, conventicles? If not, then why may not your new-minted <hi>Way</hi> be a meere erronious <hi>By-path,</hi> and no way of Christ as well as other waies, and you erre herein as well as Synods in other things? Why will you have the major vote in your congregationall decisions to over-rule and bind the rest to obedience, (as your practice and opinions intimate) since the major part may possibly be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, as well as the lesse dissenting? Shall nothing binde in any Churches, but what is unanimously voted <hi>nemine contradicente?</hi> or shall one or two dissenting voices over-rule the rest or not be bound by the most? or where all consent, may not all yet be in an errour, and not discerne it, through selfe-love to their

owne wayes and opinions, till others of contrary judgements discover and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of their errour? Away then with this fond argument and evasion; Synods and Parliaments may erre in some things, <hi>Ergo</hi> they must binde us in no thing: Is this good Logicke or Divinity? Good Ministers may and doe erre sometimes in some points of Divinitie, <hi>Ergo</hi> wee will beleeve them in none, no not in those things in which they doe not erre. Will you throw away all the Apple because one part of it only is rotten? or reject Communion with the best of men because they have some infirmities? Deal then with the Ecclesiasticall decrees of Synods and Parliaments as in wisdome, in conscience you are bound to doe: Where they are just, equall, not opposite to the word, embrace, submit unto them; when erronious or contrariant to the expresse word (not to your own sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p n="4">4 Whereas he pretends, that <note n="x" place="margin">Pag. 30. 31</note> 
               <hi>persons of one family or parish may be members of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Churches, without any inconvenience, schisme, or distraction; as well as members of severall companies and trades;</hi> and therefore <hi>Independency</hi> is no occasion of divisions.</p>
            <p>I answer, 1. That <note n="y" place="margin">Amos 3. 3.</note> 
               <hi>two cannot walke peaceably and lovingly together unlesse they are agreed,</hi> especially in matters of Religion; and those who in point of conscience cannot communicate or agree together in one Church, will never questionlesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord well together in one family, bed, parish, kingdom, as experience manifests.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a great difference between severall trades and Halls in one City, parish, kingdome, and severall formes of Church-government, in these particulars which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion unity in the one, but schismes in the others 1. All trades societies hold one another lawfull, usefull, necessary, agreeable to the lawes of God and the Realme
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51482:11"/>
without dispute; &amp; so they breed no contrariety of opinions or disaffection: but each different Church deems the other unlawful, &amp; in no way of Christ, so as they cannot with safe conscience joyn or communicate together: and therupon they sever one from another. 2. Every several trade and society, even in their very trade is subject to the general Government, Laws of the City &amp; Realm wherin they are, to which they appeale and have recourse upon all occasions of difference, none craving an exemption or Independency from the whole Corporation, Parliament or supream Magistrate in matters which concern their government, but deriving their Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Charters, Laws and priviledges from them: which subordination keeps them all in peace and unity. But Independent Churches deny any subordination, subjection to the Ecclesiasticall Lawes and Edicts of Parlements, of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Magistrates or Synods, and will be regulated, obliged onely by their own peculiar Edicts: which must needs occasion infinite Schismes, and disorders: therefore the cases are far different from one the other.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Christians, as Christians, are all of one and the self-same society and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, as those of one Trade or Calling are; therefore they should have all but one common Church and government, as these Trades have: To set then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison upright, we must state it thus; If some of one Fraternity in <hi>London</hi> (suppose the <hi>Merchant-taylers, Sadlers, Mercers,</hi> or the like) should fall out among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and one would have one forme of government, another another, and thereupon divide themselves into severall conventicles and petty meetings in corners, not at their common hall, and one chuse one Government, Master, or Warden, another another, and so sever the company, and continue indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; this (no doubt) would prove an apparent schisme, and seminary of infinite divisions, to the distraction, destruction of the whole Company and Fraternity. This is the true state of your <hi>Independency;</hi> yea Mr <hi>Goodwins</hi> present case in his own Parish, miserably divided, disordered by his <hi>Independent way:</hi> which hath indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to refuse to administer the Lords Supper, (yea Baptisme to some chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Parishioners) for a yeares space or more, though they offer to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by him; esteeming them none of his Flocke, (preaching but seldome to them, though he receive their tithes:) and instead thereof to gather an <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent congregation</hi> to himselfe, out of divers Parishes and his owne, to whom hee prescribes a Covenant ere they be admitted members of it; preaching, praying, administring the Sacrament to them alone in private conventicles, neglecting his Parishioners: which hath engendred such discontents and rents in his Parish, even among the well-affected and truely religious, that he must either desert it or his <hi>Independent way.</hi> What schismes and discords this <hi>New way</hi> hath raised in other Parishes, is so well knowne to the World, that I need no other evidence to prove it a schismaticall <hi>By-path,</hi> and so no <hi>way of Christ</hi> the <note n="*" place="margin">Esa. 9. 6.

               <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> who prescribes nought else but precepts of peace and unity to his Churches, and is most offended with their schismes.</p>
            <p>Finallie, I cannot thinke this way a way of Christ, because I finde it a Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and underminer of <hi>Parliamentary authority,</hi> devesting Parliaments of all manner of jurisdiction in matters of Religion and church-government; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the passage of the <hi>Two independent Brethren</hi> recited in my <hi>Independency examined</hi> p. 3.

            <p>The summe of this large passage is, that there is not onelie an improbabilitie, but absolute impossibilitie, that the Parliament should have any power at all to enact Lawes and Statutes in matters of Religion, church-government, Gods worship or service, because the people who elect them have no such power, and so an impossibilitie of deriving any such authoritie to them; and to affirme the contrarie, is not onely to awake the eyes of jealousie upon them, but exceedingly destructive to, and undermining of not onely their power, but honour, peace, and safetie also. Whether this be not directly to undermine
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51482:12"/>
the authority of Parliaments and temporal Magistrates in all church-affairs and matters of Religion, contrarie to your late Covenant and Protestation, and that in the most; transcendent maner that ever any have hitherto attempted in print, let all wise men judg: I am sory such <hi>ill passages</hi> should fall from so good a pen.</p>
            <p>But to give a short Answer to this <hi>extravagant discourse:</hi> First, this objection might be made against the <hi>generall Assemblies, Parliament: Kings of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, who</hi>

Secondly, God himself (as I formerly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched) used the ministry, assistance of <hi>Cyrus, Artaxerxes, Durius,</hi> with other heathen Princes and Magistrates, for the building of his Temple, and advancement of his worship, for which they made <hi>Decrees, Statutes;</hi> notwithstanding this objected rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son reflects more upon them and their electors, then on such who are Christians <note place="margin">† Twelve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>p.</hi> 4, 5.

Thirdly, most Christian Kings and Magistrates in the World, (even those who claime to be hereditary, as the yet continued formes of their Coronations and instalments manifest) come in by the peoples election, as well as such members of Parliament who are eligible, yet you cannot without disloialty and absurdity, deny them authoritie in matters of Religion and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government. Fourthly, your selfe doe not onely grant, but argue, <note n="b" place="margin">Page 25, 26.</note> 
               <hi>That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private man hath, yea ought to have power to elect and constitute his own Minister:</hi> and no doubt you will grant, that private men have power likewise to set up inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Congregations, which have authority to prescribe such Covenants, Lawes and Rules of Government, Discipline, Worship, as themselves think most agreeable to the Word: If then they may derive such an Ecclesiasticall authority to independent Ministers and Churches, why not as well to Parliaments and Synods likewise by the self-same reason?

               </gap>hly, it is cleare by sundry instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Scripture, and your owne Text, that God doth oft times make use of unsanctified persons, and the rude multitude, (whom you so much under-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue) to advance his glory, propagate his Gospel, promote his Worship, vindicate his Truth, and edifie his Church: He can poure a spirit of prophesie upon <note n="c" place="margin">Num. 22. 35 c. 23, &amp; 24. 1 Sam. 10.

Sixthly, those who have no skill at all in Law, Physick, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, have yet judgment and reason enough to make choice of the best Lawyers, Physitians, Architects, when they need their help. Those who are unfit, or unable to be members of Parliament themselves, (as most of the electors are) have yet had wisdom enough in all ages, and especially at this present, to elect the most eminent &amp; ablest men for such a service: Those who are unmeet to be Kings, Magistrates, Commanders, or Ministers, have yet skill enough to chuse able per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for such offices, &amp; power to delegate to them such Parliamentary, Royall, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisteriall, Pastorall authority, as is necessary for their severall offices, which those who elected them never had actually, but onely originally or virtually in them, not to use, but derive them unto others: why then may not our free-holders, who

have voices in electing the members of our Parliaments, and the Commonalty of the Land, (whom you scandalously terme, <hi>the vilest and most unworthy of men,</hi> though there be a degree of vulgar people viler and unworthier then they in all respects, who have no votes in such elections) have sufficient authority in them to elect and nominate such fitte persons, who by virtue of such nomination or election shall have right and power to enact Lawes, Statutes, in matters of Religion, Worship, and Church-government, not dissonant from Gods Word, to which themselves and others by Gods owne ordinance must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit?
