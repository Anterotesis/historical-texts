            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is that People whose God is the Lord.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is no Instinct that
is stronger and more Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
than the desire of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness:
there is a Charm in
the sound of the word, which
overcomes every one as soon as
it is heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If some Noble Minds
have a largeness of Soul which carries them beyond
all narrow and partial Regards, yet these do most
passionately desire to see the Happiness of their
Countrey. And it must be confessed, that to see
ones Countrey happy, and to feel ones self happy,
are provocations to joy, which few men can possibly
resist. But there are perhaps very few that have the
Notion of <hi>Happiness</hi> which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> here sets
forth: For, having considered all those Blessings
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64568:5"/>
which are apt to make the greatest Impressions on
humane Nature, such as goodly Sons, and beautiful
Daughters, full Granaries of all sorts, fruitful Flocks
of Sheep, and Cattel fit to cultivate the Ground;
and the enjoying all this so securely, that no Enemy
from without should break in upon them, and that
no disorder within should drive any away, or give
so much as occasion to discontent or complaining in
any part of their Countrey or Fields, rendred here
<hi>Streets.</hi> Upon all this he pronounces, That the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
was indeed <hi>happy</hi> that was <hi>in such a case;</hi> but that,
after all this Catalogue of Blessings summ'd up and
set together, there was a <hi>Happiness</hi> that far exceeded
it. It is true, this Opposition is set forth with more
Beauty by the Seventy Translators in these words:
<hi>A People that is in such a case has been esteemed</hi> or
called <hi>happy; but happy is the People whose God is the
Lord;</hi> as if all other <hi>Happiness</hi> was only <hi>imaginary,</hi>
this being the only <hi>real one.</hi> And it is certain, that
if we can find a Nation that has <hi>both these,</hi> we must
esteem it <hi>happy,</hi> without diminution or comparison.
But if, laying the whole matter together, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that We are the Nation to whom both the
Branches of this Blessedness belongs, and that we
are, or at least, if we are not much in fault our
selves, that we may be the just Envy of the whole
World, then we must conclude this Action with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64568:5"/>
all possible Joy, when we find our selves under so
happy an Influence. We feel our selves already
delivered from great Miseries that we had not only
in Prospect, but that had actually seized us. Our
minds give us also the happy Auguries of a Blessed
Settlement; that our Religion shall shine all the
World over, and that our Nation shall give Law
to it. Who can look on this great Assembly, in
which we see a true Representative of <hi>England,</hi>
brought together, and that without those Arts and
Practices that had made the calling of a Parliament
as formidable of late, as it was desired upon all
other occasions: Who, I say, can look on all this
without raising in himself all the just Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of every thing that is Great or Good? Or who
can look back on those black Clouds that were hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over our Heads, and that seemed charged with
Storms and Thunders, and observe the present
Calm, and consider the Steps of Providence, I
had almost said the Prodigies and Miracles of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that have attended our Deliverance,
without letting his Heart run out into all
the joyful expectations possible? You feel a great
deal, and promise your selves a great deal more;
and you are now in the right way to it, when you
come with the Solemnities of Thanksgiving, to
offer up your Acknowledgments to that Fountain
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64568:6"/>
of Life, to whom you owe this new Lease
which he has granted you of your own; this
is the true way both to maintain that which you
have already got, and to improve it to all those
happy ends to which even your Wishes can
carry you. Every man is full of the happy
Change of our Affairs; but they are perhaps but
few who offer up all in Inward Adorations to him
to whom all is due. We have added to our
former sins the shew of many days of Fasting,
and of Rejoicing; and these how much soever
they may affect the Multitude, for whose sake
it is, perhaps, that many are willing to shew an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Compliance with such like Orders, while
they inwardly despise them; yet when they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
with a Contempt that is too gross to be
called Hypocrisie, they can signifie nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be to leave us under the Condemnation
of those who honour'd God with their Lips,
when their Hearts were far from him.</p>
            <p>In the opening these Words I shall not look
further back into the Particulars here enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that make a People happy, than to the
Words immediately preceding my Text, <hi>That
there be no breaking in, nor going out, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
in our streets.</hi> I shall shew you, First,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64568:6"/>
What is signified by every one of them; and in
the next place, I shall consider, how such like Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
may belong to us; and thirdly, I shall shew
you what that superiour and more valuable Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is, of having <hi>the Lord,</hi> the true Jehovah, to be
<hi>the God</hi> of a Nation; and in the last place, I shall
consider what you ought to do for procuring both
to your selves, and to the whole Nation, a share
in this Happiness.</p>
            <p>1. By <hi>breaking in,</hi> may be meant either the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile
Invasion of an Enemy, or any Violences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neighbours round about us. The
Word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> signifies only in general <hi>a
Breach;</hi> and so no <hi>breaking in,</hi> imports no more,
but that there is so firm a Quiet, and that so well
setled, that there is no Disturbance given to the
Publick Safety: But the Seventy Translators have
given a Paraphrase upon it, thus, <hi>That there be no
breaking of the Hedge,</hi> or partition Wall; and this
may be either applied to the whole Nation, which
being considered under the Figure of a Walled
City, every hostile Invasion is like a <hi>Breach</hi> made in
the Walls and Bulwarks of a Town; or it may be
meant more specially, of every Man's Inclosure,
and Property: and so the Blessing of a Nation that
is set forth in this Phrase, amounts to this, That
they are all so safe in general, and every one is so
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64568:7"/>
secure in his own particular, that they need neither
fear the Injustices of their Neighbours, nor the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>By <hi>going out,</hi> may be meant the driving away
the People into some Foreign Land; which was the
Custom of the Eastern Conquests and Empires,
who carried away the more considerable Men of
one Country, and planted them in another; and
then in the way of exchange brought Men from
the Countries where these were put, and planted
them in their Seats, and thus created a Misunderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between the Superiour and the Inferiour Orders
of Men. This Policy appears evidently in the
Account that we have given us of the Captivity of
the <hi>Iews</hi> under the <hi>Assyrian</hi> and <hi>Babylonish</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies.</p>
            <p>By <hi>going out,</hi> may be likewise meant an aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
the Country, when the Inhabitants should
find themselves so little safe within their Inclosures,
that they were forced to seek for that Quiet else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
which they could enjoy no longer at home.</p>
            <p>By <hi>complaining,</hi> or, as the Word is strictly, <hi>a Cry,</hi>
may be either meant that publick Howling that
spreads it self abroad, upon hostile Invasions, and
eminent Dangers; or the more secret Murmurings
of such as go about, seeking Redress for the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that are done them. <hi>Streets</hi> is put for a Word
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64568:7"/>
of a larger signification in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and signifies all
open Places and Fields; and a <hi>Cry</hi> being opposed
to Justice by the Prophet,<note place="margin">Isa. 5. 7.</note> 
               <hi>I looked for righteousness,
and behold a cry,</hi> these Words may be likewise ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the Cries of the Oppressed, with which the
Wise Man was so deeply affected, when he heard
their Groans,<note place="margin">Eccles. 4. 1, 2.</note> and saw <hi>power on the side of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors,
but that they had none to comfort them, that
he praised the dead more than the living:</hi> so that these
words of <hi>no complaining to be heard,</hi> import, that there
should be such an equal and steady Administration
of Justice, that the Poor should have no cause gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them to go and spread their Complaints about
the <hi>Streets.</hi> These words may be yet carried fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that as there should be no cause given to just
Complaints, so the humour of murmuring, and of
making injust ones, should cease; and that as the
Government should be just and equitable, so the
People should have a sutable sense of it. And thus
summing up all this together, the Happiness of a
People, as it is here set forth, amounts to this:</p>
            <p>That a Government is strong and vigorous with
relation to its Enemies abroad, and just and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in its Administration at home, and that the
whole Society and every Member of it is safe;
that none are either driven out of their Country, or
tempted to leave it, and that there is a general Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64568:8"/>
in all mens Tempers, as well as an Equity
in the Government, no Complaints, Murmurings,
nor Censures being to be heard in the ordinary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Concourse.</p>
            <p>I need not add to this Representation of the
Happiness of a Nation, any thing in Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, this were an impertinent imposing on
your Patience. A man that would imploy his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick
to praise Health, or to speak well of the
Sun, would be very unwillingly hearkned to. In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed
if one were to make a Panegyrick on Tyranny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and on a hard and unjust Government, he ought to
turn over all the Common Places of VVit, all
the Stores of Invention, and the liveliest Figures
with which his Fancy could furnish him, to make
so odious a thing look but tollerably, and by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
Truth to Interest, and varnishing it over
with Wit and Eloquence, he might shew how grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
he could plead a very ill Cause: But to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
that which I have set forth, is needless, where
the Sense of every Man goes even before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
that arise either from his own Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or those that others may set before him, and
determines him to conclude, that such a State is a
great Felicity, because he feels it to be so. And
indeed to see the Miseries of those Nations that
have the Advantages of Sun and Soil beyond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64568:8"/>
which yet are happy under a feeble Sun and
fruitless Soil, is an Argument beyond all that Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
or Eloquence can invent. In short, Liberty
and Justice are so naturally desired by all Men, and
the Happiness of them is so sensibly felt, that any
further Discourse for setting them off, is as little
needful, or indeed as little tolerable, as it is to set
forth the Advantages that a man who sees and
hears, has of those who are deaf and blind: So
you see what is meant by a <hi>People that is in such a
case:</hi> And I am sure you all feel somewhat within
you, even the Voice of Nature, telling you how
<hi>happy the People is that is in such a case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Suffer me then to go over these Particulars, that
in them we may have a full Prospect of all that we
ought to propose to our selves, in order to our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Happiness: The first is,</p>
            <p>The securing us against all <hi>breaking in;</hi> which
in the first Sense of the words, is foreign Invasion;
and of this we had very lately just Apprehensions
of two different sorts: The one was our being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
brought under that foreign Yoke, out of
which we had so happily escaped in the last Age, and
which was ready to be laid upon our Necks in this.
A Yoke it is, God knows, that leaves nothing
free; all other Tyranny reaches only to mens
Persons and Estates, but their Thoughts must be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64568:9"/>
enslaved here; Reason it self must be stifled, and
all must be taken upon Trust: Nor are men's
Reasons and Consciences enough for this devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Power, but their Wealth, their Persons, and
their temporal, as well as their spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
must be fetched within this Bondage: And
with this difference, that all men are sure that they
give them their temporal and perishing VVealth,
but none are made sure whether they receive in
exchange that which is called the Spiritual and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
Treasure; we are sure that the saying
of Masses brings in a great Treasure to the Church,
but no man can pretend to be sure that his Friends
Soul is delivered out of Purgatory by them: And
the Shrines and Churches of the Saints are certainly
enriched out of measure, but none of their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
is sure that they interceed for them; so
that upon very fallible and doubtful Assurances, a
vast VVealth is certainly brought into their Hand;
and Imprisonments, Cruelties of all sorts, and
Death it self in its most terrible shape, must be
the Fate of any that but dares to think of shaking
it off. As this is a Yoke, so it is foreign to us; we
owe no dependance to the See that pretends to be
Mother-Church; we received not the Gospel from
any sent by them. The Christian Religion was in
this Island for several Ages before we had any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64568:9"/>
Commerce with that See; nor were we ever subject
to it any other way, than as a Prisoner is in the
Power of him that took him; we have all the just
Titles to an entire Exemption from any acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of them; for even in the time that we
were a Province to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, tho' the
See of <hi>Rome</hi> had all its Authority from the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the City, and that this could go no further
than the Empire; yet even then we were not put
under them, much less can it be pretended that
the Empire being now dissolved, and at an end,
we owe any Homage there any more: And
tho we did run the common Fate of the rest
of <hi>Europe,</hi> of falling under the prevailing Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some dark Ages; yet this Nation did even
during the Darkness, maintain its Liberty the best
it could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It had not force enough for a great while
to get the better in the Dispute; but it felt the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of that Bondage so heavily, that it broke
thro' it at last, and being once made free, it was
a strange Presumption to imagine, that a Nation
which has ever retained such a generous sense of
Liberty, could return to so severe and so ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
a Servitude; and yet our Enemies hoped even
to have gained this Point: We saw the Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
set on foot with a high hand, solemn Embassies
were sent of both sides, and the worst Body of all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64568:10"/>
those who support that Usurped Authority, were
to be our Task-masters. Whether they acted wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this Matter, or not, I shall not determine; but
it is certain, they acted very fairly, by letting us
see our Danger so seasonably, that we had a timely
Warning given us, intimating to us how we were
to be treated. But tho' this Yoke was bad enough,
God knows, this was not all the Misery that was
before our Eyes; we were charmed by the Arts of a
powerful but cruel Neighbour; and they had already
broke in so entirely upon the Counsels here, that
they had nothing to wish for with relation to the
Nation, but to have the People as much under
them, as the Publick Authority was at their dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal:
We were trembling at the Apprehensions they
put us in sometimes, of their having one of the
Keys of <hi>England,</hi> and one of the most important
Posts of the Nation, put into their Hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
fell indeed afterwards into other Hands, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
less cruel, because less strong: But yet in that
there was a particular Character of Reproach to
the Nation, when a People conquered by it were
become the Masters of the chief Posts in it. But
when one Alarm went over, another succeeded:
for from an Alliance which they themselves had
publickly owned, we had reason to apprehend
every thing that was dismal: A Government which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64568:10"/>
had broke Faith both at home and abroad, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
with Characters of Cruelty beyond all that
former Ages had ever dreamt of, and that made War
with Inhuman Fury; that broke, I say, both Edicts
and Treaties with so high a hand, as if they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to affront all that was Sacred among Men;
that had managed their Persecution with so much
barbarous Rage, as if they had intended to let the
World see that the Inquisitors had yet Bowels left
of which they had quite devested themselves; and
that in their Wars have acted that in whole Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which would have passed for a blot before, if
done but in a single Town that had been taken by
Storm. Such a Government, I say, as this is, being
in so close a Conjunction with our own, gave us
the blackest Apprehensions possible. This was the
<hi>breaking in</hi> that threatned us: But though we are no
more in danger to have our Gates set open to such
an Enemy, by those who ought to keep them, yet
we ought still to guard against them. They hate
us, because we dare to be Freemen and Protestants.
They have Skill and Cunning enough to wait for
every Opportunity, and to improve it: This is a
<hi>breaking in</hi> that is to be dreaded, as we do the Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the Sea, or the Eruptions of a devouring
Fire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:64568:11"/>
It is an Union in your Councils, and a Vigour in
your Proceedings, that next to the Blessing of God,
must secure us against the Breaches that may be
made upon us by those two Enemies, who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Character given in the Psalm, <hi>are strange
Children, whose Mouth we know speaks Vanity or Deceit, and
whose right Hand we are sure is a right Hand of Falshood;</hi>
and who, how much soever they may have differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of late, will be probably brought to unite in order
to their first dividing, and then their destroying us.
Excessive Severities upon the account of Religion
will be as needless in themselves, as they may prove
hurtful to the main Design, and dishonourable both
to our Religion and our Nation: For as the one
condemns Cruelty, so we know the other cannot
endure the sight of it. Let us leave upon that Church
the Infamy of Persecution, and not bring on our
selves any share in the Reproaches that we so justly
throw on them for so odious a thing.</p>
            <p>Nothing makes a Bank so strong against the
breaking in of Waters, as the confolidating it well
together; if there is an Universal Concurrence in
the Civil Settlement, and afterwards an Union in
Matters of Religion, we may hope that our Bank
shall neither be <hi>broke</hi> thorow nor yet undermined.
Here suffer me to tell you, that in the beginning of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign our Adversaries saw no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64568:11"/>
hopes of retrieving their Affairs, which had been
spoil'd by Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Persecution, but by setting
on Foot Divisions among Protestants upon very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
Matters. I my self have seen the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the chief Bishops of that time, from which
it appears that the Queen's Stiffness in maintaining
some Ceremonies, flowed not from their Councils,
but from the Practices of some disguised Papists:
And I have had in my Hands the Original Journal
of the Lower House of Convocation in the <hi>5th</hi> Year
of that Glorious Reign, in which the matter of the
Ceremonies was first argued, and when it came to
the Vote it was carried by the greater number of the
Voices of the Members that were present, to lay
down all those Subjects of Contests: but the Proxies
turned it to the severer side. And as these fatal Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
have ever since in a great measure screened
that Party, so they have weakned us and exposed us
to all the Dangers out of which we have now esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
yet so <hi>as by Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Second Sense of <hi>breaking in,</hi> is never to be
forgotten by you, I mean the <hi>breaking</hi> through a
Man's Inclosure; or, in a word, the violating these
two Sacred Things, <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> and the
<hi>Constitution of this August Body,</hi> which is the great
Fence to both: When the only use that was made
of Laws, was to find a colour to break them; when
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64568:12"/>
Justice was only pretended to support the highest
Injustices; when no Man's Fence was strong enough
to resist precarious Judges, and suborned Juries;
when adhering to Law and Religion was become a
Crime, and when Prerogative which is only a power
to preserve the People on extraordinary occasions,
was made the great Engine to destroy them: In a
word, when no Man was safe in his Innocence, nor
secure in his Property; and when the owning the
Concerns of the Nation in this great Body, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a Crime to be expiated by the best Blood
that was in it; when, I say, all these things were done,
then was our Fence not only broken down, but as if
it were not enough to pluck up Park-pales, without
knocking down the Owners with them; so Laws,
Justice and Trials were become the Words of
Form to be made use of for destroying us by Rule
and Method, and were only the Solemnities and
Ceremonies of our Ruine.</p>
            <p>The securing us then against such a <hi>breaking in,</hi> is
the explaining and determining that which lay for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
too loose in General Terms; the shutting of
all those Back-doors, by which corrupt Men had
found a way to escape from the true meaning of the
Law; the providing real Securities against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of the like Dangers for the future, and the
giving Remedies to that which is reparable for what
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64568:12"/>
is past: all this is incumbent on you, that so hereafter
there may be no <hi>breaking in</hi> upon us. This will be
so much the more easy for you to do, because you
have not now a misled Authority, or a corrupted
Party amongst you to strugle against the Methods
which may be suggested. For now those who are
the truest Patriots and the best Friends to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and their Country, must reckon to be the
most acceptable to the Glorious Instrument of our
Deliverance, who carries in his Heart the Words
that he ordered to be put on his Standard, <hi>The
Protestant Religion, and the Liberties of
England:</hi> And who will be the forwardest in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Proposition that may secure and establish them
both. To say all in a Word; You see where, and
how we have been <hi>broke in</hi> upon, and this will best
direct you to secure us for the future, that so hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there may be no more <hi>breaking in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor <hi>going out,</hi> this being the Consequence of the
other, it will not be necessary to dwell long upon it.
No stray Sheep will run out of the Fold if you se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them from the Wolf; Apostates and Deserters
will be no more known among us, if you shelter us
from the Beasts of Prey that would devour us. To
be led into Captivity and become Slaves, is the best
that we can look for, when we fall into their Hands,
who have no pity, or at least dare not shew it, if any
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64568:13"/>
had it. Of this the World has seen an Instance in
<hi>France,</hi> beyond all that former Ages ever knew, for
it was an unheard-of thing to see a Million or two of
People fallen upon, and either made miserable, or
forced to render themselves miserable, by doing that
for which their own Consciences must every day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
them. Multitudes thrown into Prisons and
Dungeons, condemned to the Gallies, and by a
Fury scarce known among Barbarians, the very
Bodies of the Dead were made Subjects on whom
they exercised their Rage. Common Cruelty is
glutted with the Death of an Enemy, but it must be
whetted by the Principles of an inhuman Religion,
that can commit Outrages on the Carcasses of the
Dead: All this was acted with so high a hand that
Men of Quality and Learning, that had been Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in the former parts of their Lives for Vertue
and Gentleness, seem'd to put on all the Fierceness
of Inquisitors, and to divest themselves of all those
Tendernesses which hand long even about the
worst of Men. Insulting and Reproach was become
the Language of the Clergy. And there was so
little Dissimulation in the case, or shew of good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that the barbarous Usage of our unhappy
Brethren was heightned by the Circumstances and
Manner of it. This was the <hi>going out,</hi> or the Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that was to be expected by us after such a <hi>breaking
in</hi> as has lately threatned us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:64568:13"/>
All the Happiness we could have expected was,
that which was the Portion of some of our persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Brethren, that abandoning their Countrey, their
Estates, and their Families, thought themselves but
too happy if they could escape with their Lives
in their Hands, and their Consciences undefiled.
But if such a Dispersion had come upon us, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could we hope to fly? The French had a great
Continent which could not be so narrowly watch'd,
but that some passage or other was still to be found,
whereas we were shut up in an Island. They had us
to fly to; and likewise those Blessed Provinces
which have been the Sanctuaries of the Unhappy,
and the Refuge of all that were persecuted for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
sake, ever since they were a Free-State:
But to vvhom could vve have gone? for as the
States could not have survived our Ruine long; so
that vast number of Refugees whom they received
with open Arms, had stock'd their Countrey and
exhausted their Charity: A long and dangerous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation
to the <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West-Indies</hi> was all the hope
that seemed left us, and even there we could not
think to be long safe from an industrious Malice
which persecutes at the greatest distance.</p>
            <p>Another sort of <hi>going out</hi> that we were beginning
to fall under, was the being tempted to forsake all
those Engagements, that tie a Man to his Family and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64568:14"/>
to his Native Country, and to seek for that Ease by
wandring abroad, which could not be allowed us,
while we lived (tho ever so harmless) at home.
And tho this is not so severe a Lot as to need much
patience to bear it, yet it must be confessed that there
is a Charm in ones Native Air, in Friends and
Kindred, and the easiness of a setled Life, which
Nature cannot throw off without feeling some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancies
to it. The setling all Matters so among
us, that our Country may have Security from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and Justice within, so that instead of tempting
the Inhabitants to wander out of it, it may attract
Strangers from all places to it; this, I say, will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
keep us from <hi>going out:</hi> For an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
needs nothing to recommend his Countrey to
him, but to be set a wandring for some Years.</p>
            <p>That <hi>there be no complaining in our Streets,</hi> no Alarms
nor Crys; this will be best compassed by the giving
our Enemies work abroad: by supporting the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
Protestants, and by forcing an Execution of
the Edicts made in their Favours, and a Reparation
of the crying Injustice that has been done them;
and most particularly, by a Perpetual and Entire
Conjunction with those <hi>Provinces,</hi> that have in so
Noble and indeed Unparallel'd a Manner, supported
and assisted our <hi>Great Deliverer,</hi> in so Vast an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.
This Nation did them great Services
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64568:14"/>
in the last Age, when they were strugling for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
but it was by lending Money and send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them Troops, upon the security of cautiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Towns, though it was then the visible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of <hi>England</hi> to preserve them. But they
have now in a way much more frank, more
dangerous to themselves, as well as more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to us, without either Bargain or Security,
put all to hazzard, because we were ready to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.
It is not to be supposed that so generous
a Nation as this is, can bring upon it self so foul a
blot as ever to forget so vast a service: Their
very name ought to be to us, to speak in a phrase
of Scripture Poetry, <hi>as ointment poured forth.</hi> We were
their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and Friends, and their <hi>Brethren</hi> before:
but now upon this heightning of our Relation and
Obligations to them, if we cannot find out terms
of greater tenderness; yet at least we must study
to feel somewhat, and ever to carry it in our
hearts towards them that cannot be expressed in
words.</p>
            <p>When we have thus secured our selves from
Cries and Allarms, the next care must be to see
Justice and Peace so to flourish at home, and
Rewards to be so equally dispensed, with as little
punishment as can possibly consist with publick
safety, that there may be little occasion given
to Complaint.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64568:15"/>
The exact conduct of Publick Justice; and the
avoiding every Invasion upon the Freedom of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
which is the first, and the most Sacred
of all a Man's Rights, are the surest ways to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all just cause of Complaint: To speak the
truth and to work righteousness; to relieve
the oppressed without respect of persons, to
plead the cause of the Widow and the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and the not ruling over the Consciences of
any with force or cruelty, but the leaving Men
within the limits of a just discretion, as to the
manner of it, the entire freedom of serving God in
the sincerity of their hearts, will put an end to
many heavy and just Complaints, which have
been poured out before God in the bitterness of
many Mens Spirits; whose lives have been made
a burden to them, only because they could not
act contrary to those persuasions, which they
were not able to change or overcome.</p>
            <p>But the removing the just occasions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
is not enough to take away all complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
from us, unless we can deliver our selves
from an impatient and jealous temper, which
forms complaints out of nothing, which creates
imaginary Dangers, and suggests groundless Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies.
This temper having once sowred our
minds, will give an ill taste to every thing:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64568:15"/>
every humour disagreeing to ours, or way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
that we do not like, will be so swelled
up to us by a disturbed imagination, that we
will be often in the state of those <hi>that were in
great fear, where no fear was.</hi> We must put on
a meek and gentle, a humble and good-natured
temper, which <hi>thinks no evil, and believeth and hopeth
all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. And thus I have gone through the first half
of my Text, <hi>Happy is the people that is in such a
case.</hi> But to speak in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, I go now
to shew you <hi>a more excellent way.</hi> For how much
soever all these Blessings may affect you, here
is one of another sort, to which, they all put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
cannot be compared; <hi>Happy is the people
whose God is the Lord.</hi> When Idolatry had spread
it self over the World, every Nation, City, and
Family, had its peculiar Object of Adoration;
which was called its <hi>God,</hi> that was worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by it, and to which the people fled, and
on which they depended in all their Distresses.
This being the Corruption under which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
had fallen. When God inspired <hi>Moses</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
to the <hi>Iews,</hi> a Religion by which he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to wean them from Idolatry, in such a
way as their Capacities and Inclinations could
bear: He proposed himself to them, under that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64568:16"/>
simple Idea, of being the <hi>Iohovah,</hi> that, is he who
truly and necessarily is, that by the simplicity of
this Notion, they might be kept in, and might
not let their minds run out into gross imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
concerning him: for when Images of God
are once formed in peoples minds, they will be
easily led to represent him to their senses in some
visible and gross Shape. But as God was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in so simple and such an unbodied Idea
to them, so he entred into a Covenant with
that Nation, by which they on the one hand
were engaged to worship him only, and to do
it in a way suitable to his Nature, and to those
precepts which he had set before them: so he on
his part promised to them Protection and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
And this is the full meaning of those
Words so often repeated in the Old Testament,
<hi>I am the Lord thy God,</hi> which are sometimes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
to the people of their Duty towards
him; and at other times an assurance to them
of that Protection which they might expect from
God: so that the happiness of a people <hi>whose God
is the Lord,</hi> amounts to these two things, the one
is, that they serve and worship God sincerely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
delivered from the Corruptions and Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Idolatry; and the other is that they
came under the special Care and Protection of God.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64568:16"/>
To make the true Jehovah <hi>our God</hi> imports, first,
that we adore and acknowledge him, and worship
him in Spirit and Truth, and that we free our minds
from every thought that leads to Idolatry, and our
Worship from every Object that may tempt us
to it. The two extreams relating to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
seem to be Atheism and Idolatry, and yet
they come nearer one another than can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined;
for as the one worships no God, so
the other makes that which is worshipped, to
be no God. When we bring God down in our
minds to somewhat that is like our selves, or
only a very little better, the Impression that
such a Religion can make on us will be but
feeble, and it working only on our fears, may
subdue us into a blind compliance to some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
that way prove of advantage to those
who have invented them; but will never puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
nor exalt our natures, which certainly is the
true design of Religion. In a word, Atheism de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
God, and Idolatry degrades him. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
our Idea's of him, and debases all our
Notions of Religion. The pomp and solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it will perhaps affect the Vulgar, but they
being satisfied with the expence and trouble that
their Religion puts them to, grow upon that,
dissolute and immoral, severe and cruel, so that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64568:17"/>
nothing defaces all the Impressions of Religion,
nor destroys all the Seeds of Morality that are
born with us, more than Idolatry. And as the
Heathens departing from the Idea of the great
Gods being the sole Object of Worship, their
mixing with him an Infinity of Inferiour Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and their representing the Divinity by some
visible Objects to their Senses, was the Idolatry
practised all the World over, and into which the
<hi>Iews</hi> did frequently relapse, during the time that
the Old Testament was written, in opposition
to which the true Jehovah was the God of
<hi>Israel:</hi> So another, not unlike this, in all its main
Characters, was introduced among Christians. The
notion of a single Mediator was as much pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the New Testament, as that of one God
is in the Old; and the Worship was reduced to
a plainness and simplicity far different from the
Pomp that was allowed by <hi>Moses:</hi> and yet
how many under-Mediators have been brought
in to divert us from depending solely upon
the only Mediator by whom we are taught to
come to God? And how have the Christian
Churches been defiled with so many visible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Worship, and so gross a Pageantry, as
if the designe had been to make the Idolatry
of Christians appear to be a much more scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64568:17"/>
thing, than that of the Heathens ever was?
But the freeing our Temples and even our
Thoughts from Idolatry, is but one branch of
that which is implied in this, That the Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah
or <hi>Lord is our God:</hi> for this signifies that
we not only do not worship him in a way
unworthy of him; but that we do adore him
in those instances that become this Relation of
his being <hi>our God:</hi> and this we do when we
seriously call upon him and pray to him, when
we do entirely depend on him, and resign up
our selves wholly to his conduct; when we do
sincerely acknowledge, That all the blessings we
receive, come from him; and when, in a word,
we perform all those duties to him, which we
owe to the Author of our Being, and the Giver
of all the good that we enjoy. But if we laugh
at all that is sacred, or set about the performances
of it in so slight a manner, as shew how
little we believe that which we profess; if it is
plain, that Prayers and Thanksgivings, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and Sacraments are only. Words or Rites
of form; and if the whole frame of our Lives,
and the disposition of our Hearts shews that
these things are only masks and disguises put
on to deceive those that have some regard to
them: Then it is plain, That the <hi>Lord is not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64568:18"/>
our God.</hi> And if he is not <hi>our God</hi> in this first
sense, we have no reason to expect that he should
be <hi>our God</hi> long, in the second sense of these
words, that is, That he will protect and defend
us. <hi>He is a sun and a shield, and will give both
grace and glory:</hi> but this blessedness comes only
on <hi>those that trust in him.</hi> It is certain, That accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Phrase in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> the <hi>shields of the
earth,</hi> that is, The defence of the Land, belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God. And how unworthy soever those that have
made him their God may have become of that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet till their sins grow up to that height that he
will throw them off, he will continue to watch
over them, with so distinguishing a Providence,
That all the World shall see <hi>that his eyes are upon
those that fear him, and that hope in his mercy;</hi> he can
and will when he thinks fit, <hi>defeat the councils of
the wise, and make the diviners mad. He taketh the
crafty in the snare, which they themselves had laid:</hi>
And, as we do all with joy feel and acknowledge
this day, he can raise up <hi>deliverances for his people,</hi>
even when they seemed to be as <hi>sheep appointed
for the slaughter:</hi> he can raise up an Instrument,
even <hi>the man whom he has made strong for himself;</hi>
and so animate, direct and conduct him, that he,
with a small Force in opposition to a great and
powerful Army, should yet find no Enemy, but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64568:18"/>
overturn a mighty Empire, and that with so
little confusion and disorder, not to say so
little blood and destruction, that instead of
Scenes of horrour, all was Welcome and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation;
and this God has carried on so far,
that we are now upon the point of seeing all
end in an entire Settlement. Thus tho' God
knows We, I mean all ranks and conditions of
Men, or to enumerate them in <hi>Daniels</hi> words,
<hi>our Kings, our Princes, and our Fathers, and all
the people of the Land, had sinned, and done
wickedly, and rebelled against him;</hi> so that we
had reason to have looked for some heavy
Curse to be poured out upon us, and that
because we had rejected the Lord from being
our God, therefore he should have cast us off
from being his people; yet he in the midst of
all this <hi>wrath,</hi> that we had stirred up against
our selves, <hi>has remembred mercy:</hi> And he has
given us such a Pledge, and all the World
such a proof that he is our God; that if this
does not soften us first into Repentance, and
then into acknowledgments, and to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of those Vows that we made to him
in our Distresses, We may fear that we shall
fall under that Curse of the Tree which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Barren, after the last essay of cultivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64568:19"/>
was made upon it: <hi>Cut it down, why should
it cumber the Ground any longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I come now in the last place to propose
to you those things by which you can secure
to your selves and the Nation this great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Lords being <hi>our God;</hi> I doubt not
but you have all the former part of my
Text enough upon your minds: It is indeed
your Duty, and you ought to do it, but even
in order to the securing our Temporal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
you may all now see how necessary it
is to take care that God be always on our
side, for the best laid and most prospering de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
are soon blasted, when they are crost by
him: You see such revolutions, and such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments
in all humane Councils, and in
the fairest probabilities, that I hope this will
make you for ever consider of what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
the blessing of God is to the success of
every undertaking; and to lay this before you
in instances that are fresh and speaking; you
saw several Assemblies of Parliament, from
which the Nation did expect a happy Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and yet all were disappointed: After
that you saw another, from which you expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
every thing that was fatal, and yet God
made that the means of maintaining our
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64568:19"/>
Laws, and our Religion: You saw a mighty
Army and a vast Revenue fortified by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
Ally; but you could never have hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that this Army which gave you so much
Terrour, should have have had so great a share
in the Glory of your Deliverance, and no Man
could have thought, that the Councils of our
enemies should have done more for us, than
all the Projects of our Friends could ever
have done: you who saw the state of things
three Months ago, could never have thought that
so total a revolution could have been brought
about so easily, as if it had been only the shifting
of Scenes. These are speaking Instances to
let you see of what consequenee it is to a
Nation to have the Lord for its God. We
have seen it hitherto in so eminent a manner,
that we are forced to conclude, that we are
under a special influence of Heaven, and since
in God there is no variableness, nor shadow
of turning; We must confess that if there
comes any change in Gods Methods towards
us, that it arises only out of our ingratitude
and unworthiness. If we will go on in our
Atheism and Immoralities, in our contempt
of God and Religion, and in all those disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that have cried so long for vengeance
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64568:20"/>
upon us; then we may justly apprehend that
this short reviving, will be but an interval of
a moments breathing, to try whether we are
fit for a total deliverance, or indeed capable
of it or not; but that this being abused and
lost by us, we must next fall under more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Calamities, even than those that we late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feared, and that we shall be a hissing,
and a reproach to all the Earth. I shall not
now enlarge upon those things, that every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
person ought to do for diverting so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
a desolation; but shall only Name those
things, that all good Men expect from your
Councils.</p>
            <p>The first is, To secure us for ever, as far
as humane Wisdom and the force of Law can
do it, from ever falling under the just appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of the return of Idolatry any more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us; and the making the best provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
possible against those dangers that lay on
us so lately.</p>
            <p>2. To beat down that Irreligious and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistical
humour, that has gained so much
ground among us, and that impudently scoffs
at all that is sacred in Religion: you cannot
indeed make Men become truly Religious, but
you can make them be both afraid and asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64568:20"/>
of professing themselves Atheists.</p>
            <p>3. You can in a great measure remove that
scandal that falls on all Religion, and on ours
in particular, which is occasioned by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
not so much of Opinions, for God
be thanked there is not much of that, as of
Rites, and matters indifferent, that so we
may be brought to glorifie the Lord our God
with one Heart and with one Mouth.</p>
            <p>4. You can make provisions for the support
of so great a part of our Clergy, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
destitute of the necessary means of subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,
are neither qualified for those Sacred
imployments, nor any way able to render
themselves more capable for maintaining
even the decencies of Divine Worship, much
less for the discharge of so high a Trust, as is
the care of Souls.</p>
            <p>5. You can concur in giving the last finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to our Reformation. Many of the Old
corruptions doe yet remain among us in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
and the Administration of the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
authority is liable to great Objections. I
will not run out into farther particulars, for it
will be easie to find them, and if you once set
about it, you will soon see what work there is
before you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:64568:21"/>
6. And in the last place you ought to put
such Marks of acknowledgment for this great
Deliverance, both with relation to that God
who has wrought it, and to the happy Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by whom he has wrought it, that there
may be a frequent return of the full dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of our gratitude. Now our Fifth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
is to be enriched by a second Service,
since God has enobled it so far, as to be the
beginning of that which we may justly hope
shall be our compleat Deliverance from all
Plots, and Conspiracies? and that this second
Blessing which has fallen on that Day shall
darken, if not quite wear out the former. Let
our Souls, and all that is within us, rejoyce
in that God, who has <hi>saved us from the Lyons
Mouth, and has heard us from the Horns of the
Vnicorn.</hi> Let us in the Words in which the
Psalm begins, Bless the Lord who is our Strength,
our Fortress, and our Deliverer; what are we
that he has thus thought on us, and sent his
hand from above, and delivered us from the
hand of strange Children, whose Mouth speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Vanity, and whose Right Hand is a Right
Hand of falsehood: Let us for all this Sing a
New Song to God, even sing praises to him,
who has hitherto Delivered One, that we
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64568:21"/>
hope shall be to us a <hi>David</hi> from the hurtful
Sword. Let us meditate a little on this great
Salvation that he has wrought for us, and let
us carry it on to those Glorious ends of
settling our Religion, and delivering our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not only from all Oppression and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
at present, but from the danger of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under it for the future. And then let us
Celebrate with the highest acknowledgments,
and the justest and gratefullest Returns possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Him through whose means we enjoy our
quiet, and you the liberty of this free and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
Assembly. Neither the Vastness, nor the
dangers of the undertaking could shake a mind
that is above fear, and yet beyond the rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Ambition, that pushes on an unquiet Spirit.
He has saved the Nation, but leaves it now
the entire liberty of securing it self; and you
know best how this is so to be performed,
that there be no <hi>breaking in, nor going out, nor
complaining in our Streets; for happy is the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that is in such a Case, yea, and happy is the
People whose God is the Lord.</hi>
