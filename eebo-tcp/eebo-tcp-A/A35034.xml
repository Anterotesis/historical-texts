            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>This Committee was by its Conſtitution to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65988:12"/>
of a Choſen Number of Commiſſion Officers Additional to as many Commiſſioners of Parliament as ſhould think fit to be There. Their Power was only Preparatory, and their firſt Order was to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of <hi>a Method to prevent the paſſing of undue Certificates; and to Report their Proceedings therein upon the</hi> Tueſday <hi>following to the Star-Chamber.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Framing This <hi>Method</hi> (which in Courſe was the firſt thing ſhould have been done) ſome Conſiderable time was ſpent upon <hi>Certificates;</hi> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, without any <hi>Method</hi> at all, ſave only that the <hi>Colonels</hi> were to be <hi>firſt,</hi> and the <hi>Reſt</hi> to follow in their <hi>Turns;</hi> and <hi>All</hi> to be put to a preſent Vote, Whether they ſhould <hi>Stand</hi> or <hi>Fall.</hi> This manner of Proceeding begat: many <hi>Heats, Diſorders,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,</hi> for want of an Impartial <hi>Rule,</hi> whereby to Judge of every Man according to his Reſpective <hi>Glayme,</hi> and <hi>Qualification:</hi> till in the End, <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> mov'd the Gentlemen to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of a <hi>Certain Standard,</hi> that ſhould determine all Niceties in <hi>Queſtion:</hi> which was no ſooner A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon but it was Regularly ſubmitted, and Reported to the Star-Chamber, Conſiſting in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Theſe Particulars following.</p>
               <p>He that has not <hi>Any way deſerted his Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Duty to the Late King, or his preſent Maieſty in Their Wars</hi> (which are the words of the Act,) or (as in another Place) that <hi>has ſerv'd the Late King, and his preſent Maieſty through the whole Courſe of the Late Wars;</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Standard for <hi>[Indigence,]</hi> was <hi>Four hundred Found</hi> (in proportion to an <hi>Annuity</hi> of <hi>Fifty</hi> or <hi>Threeſcore.).</hi>

                  <hi>A Reall Command]</hi> for a <hi>Colonel</hi> of <hi>Horſe,</hi> was ſtated at <hi>Two-Hundred;</hi> for a <hi>Captain,</hi> at <hi>Thirty</hi> Horſe: For a <hi>Colonel</hi> of <hi>Foot,</hi> at <hi>Three-Hundred</hi> men; for a <hi>Captain,</hi> at <hi>Forty.</hi> They offer'd likewiſe, what <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> they conceiv'd to have a <hi>Reall Command of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers according to their Commiſions,</hi> and propos'd a <hi>Regimental Order,</hi> as the apteſt <hi>Method,</hi> in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, for <hi>Inſpection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While Matters were in Motion toward this hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Period, there Interven'd <hi>another Queſtion</hi> not to be omitted, and it was occaſion'd by ſomewhat that fell from the Lips of a worthy Gentleman (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at that time the Chaire) which was, that <hi>There were Seaven-Thouſand and Five-Hundred Officers Certify'd,</hi> upon which Computation (Reckoning Thoſe that are probably <hi>Dead</hi> ſince—46, and Thoſe that are known to have <hi>Deſerted,</hi> together with Thoſe that <hi>do not Claim)</hi> the late King muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have loſt his Crown at the Head of above <hi>Twelve-Hundred Thouſand</hi> men. The Effects which This Overture wrought upon the <hi>Truly-Loyal,</hi> and <hi>Suffering</hi> Party (eſpecially proceeding from a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſpake with <hi>Authority,</hi> and upon <hi>Knowledge)</hi> were no other, than as ſo many Lines drawn to a Point; Every man preſſing (though with various Reaſons) to the ſame end [PRINTING,] as the only means to Purge and Reduce that Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious-Liſt; and which way ſoever they lookt, they met with Arguments, both of <hi>Honour,</hi> and of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity</hi> to Perſue it; and ſtill the more narrowly they Conſider'd, the more forcible they found thoſe Arguments. The Caſe They Reaſon'd Thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65988:13"/>
THe <hi>Kingdom</hi> has preſented His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and His <hi>Majeſty</hi> has, at their Requeſt, Gratiouſly Beſtow'd upon His <hi>Truly-Loyal,</hi> and <hi>ſuffering Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi> a Conſiderable Sum of Money, with an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Limitation of it, to the Uſe and Behoof of ſuch Perſons. Shall <hi>Cromwell's Guards now be</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Reward,</hi> and <hi>Character of Loyalty?</hi> or ſhall His Majeſtie's <hi>Bounty,</hi> that was directed ſingly to His <hi>Dutiful Servants,</hi> be Apply'd in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the <hi>Murtherers</hi> of His <hi>Father?</hi> Shall <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and <hi>Loyalty,</hi> be ſupported by the ſame Hand? Or ſhall Thoſe Gentlemen that ever Valu'd Their Honours before Their Lives be ſubjected now at Laſt to mingle Their Names with men of Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and Infamous Forfeitures? And yet all This muſt be done without a ſtrict Examination of This Blended Liſt. Upon the whole, The King's <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are Fruſtrated,</hi> His <hi>Charity Miſemploy'd,</hi> His Loyal <hi>Servants Defrauded,</hi> His <hi>Enemies Supply'd, Loyalty</hi> is <hi>Diſheartn'd,</hi> and <hi>Diſobedience Encourag'd:</hi> beſide the <hi>Profuſion</hi> of the <hi>Publique Treaſure;</hi> the <hi>Hazzard</hi> of His Majeſty taking His <hi>Enemies,</hi> for His <hi>Friends;</hi> and finally, beſide the <hi>ſad Conſequence of Condemning a Party that has been Loyal beyond all Preſident, to be Miſerable beyond all Example</hi> (which muſt needs follow upon the Admittance of ſo many Sharers to This Money.)</p>
               <p>To theſe Arguments (in Order to the <hi>Preſs).</hi> It was Reply'd, that <hi>the King had Poſitively declar'd Himſelf againſt it.</hi> Whereupon, (in Confidence that if ſo it were, it proceeded only from a Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Thing) The Gentlemen drew up their <hi>Reaſons,</hi> and Tender'd Them to the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65988:14"/>
with their <hi>deſires, that his Majeſtle's Pleaſure might be more Particularly beſought concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing That Matter.</hi> Upon which they paſt a Vote, and a Perſon of Eminent Honour and Modeſty, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the King with the Humble Requeſt of the Commiſſioners; to whom, upon the firſt Overture, His Majeſty was pleaſed to expreſs Himſelf, that <hi>there was much to be ſaid</hi> both for, <hi>and againſt it;</hi> Demanding withall, <hi>What Number the Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates might amount to?</hi> It was Anſwer'd, that <hi>They were Reputed to be about Six or Seven Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</hi> Whereupon, His Majeſty Replyed, that <hi>it muſt needs be a great Abuſe then; and that it would be ſo much Money thrown away, if it came to be divided into ſo many ſhares;</hi> in the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; remitting the Buſineſs wholly to the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. Upon the Report of which Gratious Return, the Honourable the Commiſſioners paſt a <hi>Vote</hi> for the <hi>Print,</hi> and ſoon after, <hi>Another</hi> for the <hi>Method,</hi> and <hi>Two more</hi> after That, the <hi>One</hi> in Allowance of the <hi>Book,</hi> and the <hi>Other</hi> of the <hi>Praeface,</hi> wherewith His Majeſty was again Acquainted and Approv'd it.</p>
               <p>So that at length, by the Mediation of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Aids, Agreements, and Authorities, we are poſſeſt of the Liſt; which we find, as we Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; (ſave that <hi>it falls nigh Two-Thouſand ſhort of the firſt Computation)</hi> In This Liſt, we meet with Diverſe Officers that have been long <hi>Dead; ſeveral</hi> that <hi>never</hi> ſerv'd the King <hi>at all;</hi> others that <hi>left,</hi> and fought <hi>againſt</hi> Him. Beyond Theſe <hi>Groſs A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes</hi> we do not preſume to Meddle; and <hi>Theſe are a ſort of People, with Whom we ſhould be very loth to

               </p>
               <p>This Opinion will not ſink into Us for <hi>many Rea-</hi>

which we ſhall only Offer, with ſubmiſſion to <hi>Better.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> we conceive the <hi>Commiſsioners</hi> Nominated in This Act. (and ſitting in the <hi>Star-Chamber)</hi> to be the Competent and Proper <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Meaning</hi> of it; and we have the Honour of <hi>Their Practice</hi> for <hi>Our Authority.</hi> As for Inſtance; It is put to the Vote, <hi>what Officers</hi> ſhould be Reputed <hi>Commiſsion-Officers within the Act,</hi> and which <hi>not?</hi> How come the Commiſſioners in the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> now to be <hi>Judges</hi> of <hi>That Qualification,</hi> more then of the <hi>Reſt?</hi> That the <hi>Perſon Certify'd</hi> be a <hi>Commiſsion-Officer,</hi> and that <hi>being</hi> a Commiſſion-Officer, He be likewiſe <hi>Truly-Loyal,</hi> and <hi>Indigent,</hi> are <hi>Conditions Equally Requiſite,</hi> by the Letter of the Act: and <hi>Five Commiſsioner's Hands</hi> can no more Conclude a <hi>Revolted Captain</hi> to be <hi>Truly-Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> then they can Authorize an <hi>Armourer</hi> to be a <hi>Commiſsion-Officer;</hi> which being <hi>over-Rul'd</hi> in the <hi>one,</hi> holds every jot as ſtrong in the <hi>other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further;</hi> In the <hi>Praeface</hi> to This newly Printed Liſt, the Honourable Commiſſioners have Expreſly <hi>Promis'd,</hi> and <hi>Invited</hi> an <hi>Inſpection:</hi> that is, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of <hi>Perſons,</hi> rather than of <hi>Certificates;</hi> for which Expreſs Reaſon They are rather Enter'd in <hi>Regiments,</hi> than in <hi>Counties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again; The Concluſiveneſs of Five Hands at a Publique-Meeting</hi> Engages the Act in a <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> (and we have heard that <hi>an Act</hi> Repugnant to it ſelf, is ſo far void) The Diſtribution <hi>Made</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Certificate,</hi> Contradicts the Diſtribution <hi>Requir'd</hi> according to the <hi>Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To This, 'tis Urg'd, that <hi>the Certificate is an Act Executed,</hi> and that <hi>though the Body of the Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65988:15"/>
cannot totally Reſcind ſuch a Certificate, they may yet ſuſpend the Iſſuing of the Mony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We Reply; that if the <hi>Diſtribution</hi> were <hi>an Act Executed</hi> too; ſuch a <hi>Certificate</hi> were much a Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Plea, for a <hi>Miſtake Unforeſeen,</hi> and <hi>paſt Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> than it would be in This Caſe; where, upon Proof, the <hi>Perſon</hi> that <hi>demands</hi> the Mony, is but the <hi>Counterfeit</hi> of the <hi>Perſon</hi> that ought to <hi>Receive</hi> it. Again; may they <hi>ſuſpend</hi> the diſtribution <hi>after</hi> the Mony is due, and not as well <hi>Refuſe it utterly</hi> where it can <hi>never</hi> be due? If it be <hi>due,</hi> they are to <hi>Pay</hi> it at firſt; if it be <hi>not due,</hi> they are to <hi>Refuſe</hi> it: for <hi>delay</hi> will not make it <hi>more due,</hi> and the Reaſon of <hi>ſtopping</hi> it for a <hi>moment,</hi> holds for <hi>ever.</hi> So that if they can neither <hi>Reject</hi> the Perſon becauſe of the <hi>Certificate,</hi> nor <hi>Allow</hi> of Him becauſe of the <hi>Act;</hi> the Mony muſt <hi>Eternally</hi> Reſt where it <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>never</hi> come to a <hi>Diſtribution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be alſo Conſider'd, that the Caſe is <hi>Clear</hi> concerning the Perſons, and <hi>doubtful</hi> touching the <hi>Certificates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Wee'll ſuppoſe more Force in the Objection then perchance there is, and that in <hi>Extremity [ſuch TRUE Certificates]</hi> may be ſo Render'd, as to bear it.

of the <hi>Act;</hi> be the Officers Clayme never ſo Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, upon all Honourable Accompts; and Theſe are ſuch as are Excluded, for want of <hi>Five Commiſsioners Hands at a Publique Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> to make their Certificates <hi>Authentique;</hi> which was not to be had in Thoſe Places, where either <hi>the Commiſsioners did not Meet at all,</hi> or <hi>the Officer had no Notice of Their Meeting:</hi> which Caſe (with the <hi>Reſt)</hi> is moſt humbly Recommended to a <hi>Supplemental Act;</hi> (if any Supplement ſhall be thought Neceſſary.)</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third Propoſal,</hi> in order to the Effectual Clearing of This Liſt, is, That in Caſe any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſhall be Appointed to Enquire into the Matter, they may be Empower'd to Examine Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes upon <hi>Oath,</hi> for the <hi>Credit</hi> of the <hi>Proofe,</hi> and for the <hi>Preventing</hi> of <hi>Frivolous Enforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is humbly Propos'd in the <hi>Fourth</hi> Place, That after a <hi>thorow-Examination</hi> of the <hi>Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,</hi> there may be a <hi>Second Liſt</hi> made of rhe <hi>Names</hi> of all ſuch <hi>Truly-Loyall,</hi> and <hi>Indigent Officers,</hi> as, are found <hi>Allowable</hi> according to the <hi>Act:</hi> This <hi>Inſpect'd Liſt</hi> to be Humbly Offer'd to His Sacred <hi>Majeſty;</hi> and His <hi>Royall Favour</hi> Implor'd on the behalf of the <hi>Loyall Officers</hi> therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned; To the End; That being in His Majeſties Eye, They may lie the more open to Thoſe <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies,</hi> and <hi>Employments</hi> for the <hi>future,</hi> whereof
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65988:18"/>
His Princely Goodneſs, ſhall vouchſafe to think them <hi>Worthy,</hi> and <hi>Capable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſonant to the Reaſon of This Propoſal, is the Tenor of the Act, wherein the Lords and Commons have been Pleas'd to Declare their Purpoſe to Tranſmit <hi>an Encouragement of Loyalty to future Ages.</hi> Which <hi>Encouragement</hi> is in Part made Good already; to ſuch as Deſire to enter into <hi>Hoſpitals,</hi> or other <hi>Charitable Foundations;</hi> by <hi>Requiring and Appointing that They Themſelves, their Widowes, and Children, may be Preferred before All Others, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Founders Kindred.</hi> And a further Proviſion is likewiſe Enacted by <hi>a Kate upon Pariſhes, for the Truly-Loyal and Suffering Soldiers in General.</hi> So that only <hi>Thoſe Perſons of Quality</hi> are left in <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> to whom it cannot be Suppos'd with <hi>Juſtice</hi> to the <hi>Publique,</hi> that theſe Allotments were ever Intended. Wherefore, as a Thing moſt ſuitable to the very <hi>Profeſsion</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of the Act; It is with <hi>Reverence,</hi> and <hi>Submiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Propos'd, That ſomething may be done alſo by way of <hi>Recommendation,</hi> for <hi>the Encouragement of the Loyal Nobility and Gentry,</hi> that the <hi>Event</hi> of all their <hi>Hazzards</hi> and <hi>Services,</hi> may not ſeem to Terminate in an <hi>Hoſpital.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65988:18"/>
To Paſſe now from matter of <hi>Neceſsity,</hi> to point of <hi>Honour.</hi> The Truly-Loyall and Indigent-Officers have but Theſe Two Things to Deſire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Liſt</hi> may be exactly <hi>Purg'd,</hi> for the <hi>Honour</hi> both of the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and of the <hi>Party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That upon Sifting the Certificates, what Perſons ſoever ſhall be found Guilty of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, Subornation,</hi> or <hi>Corruption:</hi> They may be Subjected to ſuch <hi>Puniſhment</hi> as belongs to the Quality of the <hi>Offence.</hi>
