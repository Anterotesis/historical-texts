            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ST. Chrysostom</hi> observes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ancient <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that though their Opinions were never so widely different both from the truth and from each other, yet every one pretended that his particular Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was agreeable to the Scripture and founded in it, and that all different Opinions were discountenanced by it, and might be confuted out of it: He observes also further, That the true reason of this their Confidence was, because every one picked out of the <hi>Scripture</hi> all those Passages, which according to the letter and sound of the Words seemed to favour his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Opinion, without at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding their cohaerence and connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the occasion and design of their


<pb facs="tcp:97776:4"/>
being written. Thus from those Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages which speak of Christ as <hi>a Man</hi> and in his state of Humiliation, some were so unreasonable as to collect that he was but <hi>a meer Man,</hi> and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his <hi>Divinity:</hi> Others on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary from those Passages which speak of him as <hi>God</hi> and in his state of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, did as weakly take occasion to deny his <hi>Humanity,</hi> asserting that the <hi>humane Nature</hi> was wholly swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by the <hi>Divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wish the same Observation might not too truly be made, of most of the later Disputes which have arisen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Christians</hi> in our Days. For thus I believe, if we search on the one hand into the ground of many of those Mens Assertions, who love to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Corruption of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the natural Misery of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, we shall find the true Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to be the applying those places of Scripture to the <hi>whole bulk of Mankind,</hi> which are evidently and expresly spoken of some of the


<pb facs="tcp:97776:4"/>
               <hi>worst of Men:</hi> On the other hand, the reason why others have so magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the <hi>natural Faculties of Men,</hi> as to diminish and detract from <hi>the Grace of God,</hi> is because they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied those Texts to the <hi>generality of Men,</hi> which are meant only of the most <hi>perfect Christians.</hi> Again, the Foundation of those Mens Opinion, who have extolled some one particular Virtue, in opposition to, or as an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent for, all other Duties, is their having interpreted those places of Scripture concerning <hi>some one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler Virtue,</hi> which are plainly meant of the <hi>whole Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> and the reason why others have thought no moral Virtues at all, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be practised by Believers, is because they have applied those Texts to the <hi>most Essential and Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Duties of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> which were intended only of the <hi>Ceremonial Performances of the Jewish Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97776:5"/>And thus, to come to the subject of our present Discourses, in the great Business of Repentance and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the reason why some Men have attributed the whole of Mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to such an extraordinary and uncertain Grace of God, as has given Men occasion to sit still in their Sins, in expectation of the time when this extraordinary Grace should be poured down upon them; is because they have fixed that Assistance of God's Grace to an <hi>uncertain</hi> Period, which God himself has constantly annexed to his Ordinances, and which he <hi>certainly</hi> bestows upon Men at their Baptism, or at their solemn taking upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Profession of Religion. And the reason why others have made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance so short and so easie a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is because they have <hi>too largely</hi> applied those great Promises in the Gospel, to <hi>the circular and repeated Repentences of Christians,</hi> which are, at least in some measure, confined to the <hi>great Repentance or Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Unbelievers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:97776:5"/>My design in the following <hi>Essays,</hi> is to endeavour briefly to set this great and most important Matter in its true Light; from the Analogy of Scripture, and from the Sense of the purest Ages of the Primitive Church: To show that at <hi>Baptism</hi> God <hi>always</hi> bestows that Grace, which is necessary to enable Men to perform their Duty; and <hi>that</hi> to those who are Baptized in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, this Grace is sealed and assured at <hi>Confirmation: That</hi> from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward Men are bound with that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to live in the constant practise of their known Duty and are not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect (except in extraordinary Cases) any extraordinary, much less irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Grace, to preserve them in their Duty or to convert them from Sin: <hi>That</hi> if after this they fall into any <hi>great</hi> Wickedness, they are bound to a proportionably <hi>great</hi> and <hi>Particular</hi> Repentance: And <hi>that</hi> as the Gospel hath given sufficient assurance of such Repentance being accepted, to comfort and encourage all true Penitents; so


<pb facs="tcp:97776:6"/>
it has sufficiently shown the <hi>difficulty</hi> of it <hi>at all times,</hi> and the <hi>extreme danger</hi> of it <hi>when late,</hi> to deter Men from delaying it when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of its Necessity, and from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Sins when they hope to have them forgiven.</p>
            <p>There is nothing with which the Devil more effectually imposes upon Men in these latter Ages of the World, than with false notions of Repentance: And if it must be confessed that <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> in the Primitive times were <hi>too severe</hi> in their apprehensions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, 'tis certain there are <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more</hi> in our Days <hi>not severe enough:</hi> At least I am sure there is no Man who has a true Sense of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and a just apprehension of the vast concern of eternal Happiness or Misery, but will be much more desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know the utmost strictness of the Conditions upon which so mighty a Stake depends, than to run the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being mistaken in judging too loosly of them.</p>

Another <hi>Privilege</hi> which was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented and conferred by Baptism, was the <hi>Influence and Assistance of Gods Holy Spirit.</hi> All Persons that were baptized, as their Bodies were washed and purified with <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> so their Minds were sanctified by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God: <hi>But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified, in the Name of our Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11.

                  <hi>witness with their Spirit, that they were the Children of God.</hi> At the first Preaching of the Gospel, this influence of the Holy Spirit frequently discovered it self, in those extraordinary Gifts of Speaking with Tongues, Working Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the History of the Acts of the Apostles.

               <p n="6">6. The last <hi>Privilege</hi> which Persons <hi>Baptized</hi> were intitled to by virtue of that Ordinance, was an <hi>Assurance of a Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Eternal Life.</hi> They received, as hath been said, the Holy Spirit of God; and that Spirit, so long as it dwelt with them, was a <note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 1. v. 22.

out of it again: For as Christ descended into the Earth, and <hi>was raised again from the dead by the Glory of the Father;</hi> So Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons baptized were <hi>buried with him by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi>

These are the Spiritual <hi>Graces</hi> or <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges,</hi> which were represented by the Outward and Visible Signs in Baptism, and conferr'd by their means; And <hi>These</hi> are what <hi>God on his part</hi> engageth and assures to us, in that Great and Holy Covenant.

The first of these Duties which the Persons baptized promised and obliged


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97776:15"/>
themselves to perform, was a <hi>Constant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the Faith of Christ and Profession of his Religion.</hi> They were admitted by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism into the Church and Family of Christ; and they were bound at all times, to own themselves his Disciples: They were so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly <hi>baptized into his Death;</hi> and they<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 3.</note> were oblig'd not to be asham'd of the Cross of Christ, and to confess the Faith of him crucified: They owned publickly at their Baptism, their Belief <hi>in God the Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord;</hi> and they were bound at all times to make Profession of this Faith: They had <hi>with the heart believed unto Righteousness;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10</note> and they thought <hi>that with the Mouth, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> was necessary to be <hi>made unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> They were assured, that if they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Christ before Men,</hi> he would also <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess them before his Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>

                  <hi>and before the Angels of God;</hi> but if they were <hi>ashamed of him, and denyed him before Men, he would also be ashamed of them when he came in the Glory of his Father with the Holy Angels.</hi> And so mighty an effect had this consideration upon the primitive Christians, that in the times of Persecution, when they were tempted to deny their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and renounce the Faith which they had once Embraced, they chose rather to endure the most exquisite Torments that the wit of Man could invent, than either to renounce or dissemble their Christianity;


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97776:15"/>
and those who out of Fear denyed or were ashamed to confess their Faith, they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to have forfeited and renounced their Baptism, as having <hi>crucified to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>

               <p n="8">8. The Second Thing to which Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons baptized solemnly obliged themselves by their Baptism, was <hi>a Death unto Sin, and a New-birth unto Righteousness; i. e.</hi> they engaged utterly and for ever to forsake, all manner of Sin and Wickedness; all <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous and Superstitious Worship of false Gods;</hi> all <hi>Injustice, Wrong, Fraud and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness towards Men;</hi> all <hi>the Pride and Vanity, the Pomp and Luxury of this present World;</hi> all <hi>the Lusts of the Flesh, Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanness, Lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, Gluttony, Drunkenness, Revellings,</hi> and such like: And for the future they promised to make it the business of their lives, to fulfil all Righteousness according to the strictest Rules of the Christian Doctrine and Discipline; to <hi>Worship the only true God, with all Devotion, Reverence and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> to be <hi>exactly just in their Dealings with Men,</hi> and <hi>generously charitable upon all occasions;</hi> in fine, to be <hi>Temperate and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Chast and Pure,</hi> as the Worshippers of God, and the Temples of the Holy Ghost.

was <hi>truly</hi> a being <hi>Washed, Sanctified</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,</hi> in the Name of Christ, and by the Spirit of God: And indeed this was the <hi>principal thing</hi> which was <hi>signified</hi> in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and the <hi>principal end</hi> for which the whole Ordinance was <hi>designed;</hi> This was what the Person to be baptized was to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess with his own Mouth,</hi> when he renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Devil and all his Works; and this was what was principally <hi>represented</hi> by that main part of the Ceremony, <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending into the Water</hi> and <hi>rising out of it again;</hi> For so the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> most fully explains it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Know ye not that so many of us, as were baptized into Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, were baptized into his Death? Therefore we are buried with him by Baptism into Death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the Glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of Life; Knowing this, that our old Man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin:</hi> that is, the design of our descending into the Water to be baptized, and rising again out of it, was to mind us, that as we then received remission of our past sins by Vertue of Christ's having died <hi>for sin;</hi> so we our selves were in like manner to die and be buried <hi>to sin,</hi> and rise again to walk for the future with Christ in newness and holiness of Life. This therefore was the principal thing respected in Baptism, and

But of this more in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The third and last thing, to which Men were solemnly engaged at their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, was <hi>Self-denyal and Contempt of the World.</hi> Our Saviour had told his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, That <hi>whosoever</hi> would <hi>come after him,</hi>

Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself most expresly and excellently argues, <hi>Rom. p.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him; For in that he died, he died unto Sin once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God: Likewise reckon ye also your selves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord: Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</hi> The force of which Argument is plainly this: When we descended into the Water, and rise out of it again, we made publick profession, that as we hoped for pardon of our past sins through the Merits of the Death of Christ; so we our selves would thenceforth die unto sin, that is, utterly cast it off and forsake it, and for the future rise again to walk with Christ in newness and holiness of Life: So that unless from the time of our thus putting off sin, we continue constantly to live in all holiness and righteousness, we have no


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97776:19"/>
just reason to expect Remission by virtue of the Death of Christ, into which we were baptized: For it being the express Condition of the Remission of sin, that we continue no longer in it, but live from thencefotth unto God; the Blood of Christ it self, which was shed to be a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Sins of the whole World, can avail nothing for one that continues in Sin, whom our Saviour himself has parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly excepted from the benefit of the Pardon purchased by his Death and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>

But may we therefore spend <hi>our whole Lives</hi> in little and weak struglings against sin, without ever arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at that pitch of Vertue, which was antiently thought necessary to prepare a Man for Baptism? May we therefore be excused from ever becoming <hi>perfect</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, because we were all along brought up in the Christian Religion, and were never converted by any sudden Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction?

To such a state as this, he <hi>must</hi> resolve to arrive; and he must resolve to arrive at it <hi>timely,</hi> that he may have a certain Title to


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97776:23"/>
the reward of Obedience. There is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any Man so wicked, who does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to repent at one time or other before he dies; and our Saviour <hi>has</hi> indeed in his Gospel made the same Promises to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that he has to innocence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Obedience: But let no Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himself by a fatal Errour: The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to which our Saviour has made such large Promises, is not the <hi>late</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of a <hi>Christian,</hi> but the <hi>timely</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of a <hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Heathen</hi> at his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to Christianity; and is therefore the <hi>very same,</hi> and <hi>no other</hi> than <hi>Baptism</hi> it self. Indeed if a Christian by an unhappy Education be brought up in sin, and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated to Wickedness; whenever he comes by the Power of God's Word, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his Holy Spirit, to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the evil of his Ways and of the necessity of Religion, he is then in the same state that a Heathen Convert is supposed to be at his Baptism, and the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are made to them both: But when a Christian who has a clear Knowledge of his Duty, does notwitstanding <hi>that,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue wilfully all his Life in sin, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is so far from assuring him that God and Angels will rejoyce at his Conversion, if when he grows old he leaves off sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, because he can sin no more, that he has no where promised that such a Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance shall be accepted <hi>at all.</hi> We must

               <p n="2">2. This is what the God-Fathers or God-Mothers promise for a Child at its Baptism; This they promise solemnly in <hi>the presence of God,</hi> and in <hi>the face of the Congregation:</hi> And is it a small thing, to <hi>undertake for the Soul</hi> of a Person to be admitted into the Church of Christ? Is it a light thing to enter into such a Promise solemnly <hi>before God and his Church?</hi> I doubt not but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever considers the matter seriously, will hardly find <hi>any Duty</hi> of <hi>greater Importance,</hi> or <hi>any Promise</hi> of more <hi>solemn Obligation:</hi> yet is there no <hi>Duty</hi> more <hi>generally</hi> and more <hi>shamefully</hi> neglected, nor any <hi>Promise</hi> more <hi>lightly</hi> regarded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a Man be made Guardian to the Son of a deceased Friend, and be intrusted with the Care of his Education, how justly do we expect, <hi>that</hi> he should be careful to have him instructed in all that <hi>necessary Knowledge,</hi> on which depends the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Life and Conversation; <hi>that</hi> he should be zealous to have him further indued with all those <hi>useful Accomplishments,</hi> which may become his Quality and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him in the World; but above all <hi>that</hi> he should spare no pains to <hi>secure</hi> to him <hi>his Estate,</hi> and to <hi>improve</hi> his <hi>Fortunes?</hi> And do we not look upon that Man as the vilest and most unfaithful of Men, who having


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:97776:26"/>
such a charge committed unto him, should wholly neglect all or any of these things? Yet how much a greater Trust does <hi>he</hi> betray, who having the <hi>Soul</hi> of a Child committed to his care <hi>by God and the Church,</hi> neglects wholly to have it taught those ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Truths, in the Knowledge and Practice of which consists its everlasting Happiness; who takes no care at all to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to it that Portion, which God hath designed and prepared for it in Heaven; and who seeing the Soul of an Innocent Babe, (perhaps meerly for want of good Advice and Instruction,) beginning to be over-run with the Seeds of those Vices, which in time must drown it in destruction and perdition, does yet show <hi>no</hi> Care or Concern for it? What greater <hi>Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> can a Man possibly be guilty of towards <hi>the Soul of his Brother,</hi> or what greater <hi>Mockery of God?</hi> 'Tis True, the Education of a Child is not wholly committed to the Care of those who are its <hi>Sureties</hi> in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, but first and principally to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> themselves: But undoubtedly <hi>they</hi> are bound to be <hi>Assistants;</hi> and if the <hi>Parents</hi> either thro' Wickedness neglect to instruct it, or by Death are taken away from it, the <hi>Sureties</hi> must look upon this Care as chiefly devolved upon <hi>Them,</hi> and of which they must give a strict Account.</p>

With what Confusion and Amazement shall we at the day of Judgment hear those who have been committed to our Charge, accuse us for having been thro' carelesness the causes of their Destruction? How shall we be astonisht and cut to the heart, to hear them curse us and say, <hi>Had those who should have instructed us, been as careful to teach us our Duty, as we were capable and willing to have learnt it, we had never come into this miserable condition!</hi> And how will it double the Torments even of Hell it self, to have the punishment not only of our own Sins, but also of all the sins of those, who have been undone by our neglect, inflicted upon us?</p>

What would he have said, if he had lived in these times, wherein nothing is more common, than for Men to take upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves this great Charge, without ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing to think more of it?</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97776:27"/>
when they have been Sureties for a Child, deliver it immediately to its Parents, as if they were by that <hi>Mockery</hi> released from their Promise, and <hi>God</hi> deluded as easily as <hi>Men:</hi> Lastly, Let <hi>those</hi> consider this, who think themselves obliged to restifie their Love to a Child whom they have been <hi>Sureties</hi> for, by some little and trifling Marks of Kindness; while they are at the same time most <hi>inhumanely</hi> and <hi>unchristianly</hi> cruel to it, by neglecting that one great Kindness which they have promised and vowed to do for it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I doubt not but the notorious neglect of this important Duty, is one great cause of the shameless Wickedness of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age. For while <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Sureties</hi> are careless to instruct Children in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Obligation of their Baptismal Vow, vicious Inclinations prevail upon them and insensibly grow into Vicious Habits, before they come to a perfect Knowledge of the <hi>Necessity</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> of the <hi>Extent</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi> of their <hi>Duty,</hi> and of the <hi>Greatness</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> of the <hi>Happiness</hi> annexed to it.

               <p>THAT there is a certain Period of time, <hi>at</hi> which every Man that <hi>is</hi> truly Religious, <hi>began</hi> to be so, and <hi>from</hi> which the beginning of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Life might truly be dated, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: But of what use the <hi>Knowing</hi> and <hi>Fixing</hi> this Period in a Man's own Mind, may be, is generally very little considered: For whilst some have <hi>groundlesly</hi> asserted, that there is a certain Time of every good Man's Conversion, after which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for him to fall away into a state of Wickedness; and whilst others have weakly imagined, that there is a certain Time of Conversion, after which though a


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97776:29"/>
Man does fall into great Wickednesses, yet he cannot fall finally from a State of Grace; most others have thought that there is little or no use of inquiring <hi>at all</hi> into the exact time when the Religious Life begins, or if there were, that it is hardly possible for a Man to Fix and Determine it, since Men generally become Religious not by a <hi>sudden Conversion,</hi> but by a <hi>gradual Progress.</hi> But though it be indeed true, that Men generally become Religious, not <hi>at once,</hi> but <hi>by degrees,</hi> yet may a Man neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less certainly Fix to himself the Period, from whence to date the beginning of his <hi>Religious Life:</hi> For if his Progress has been only from a more <hi>imperfect State of Virtue,</hi> (which consists in a constant sincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to obey all the Commandments of God, but accompanied with many Frailties, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertencies and Surprizes,) to a <hi>more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and uniform practice of Holiness;</hi> he has been all along in the Course of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Life: But if his Progress has been from a <hi>Course</hi> of <hi>known</hi> and <hi>wilful</hi> sin, to a <hi>Victory</hi> or <hi>Conquest</hi> over his Lusts and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; he must reckon his Religious Life from no longer a time, (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any pious Intervals and Struglings which he may have had with his Habitual Temptations,) than from that Period since which he has never fallen into any <hi>known</hi> and <hi>gross</hi> sin. And the <hi>Uses</hi> of a Man's fixing within himself such a Period, would


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97776:29"/>
be <hi>that more assured and settled Peace of Conscience,</hi> which would arise from the distinct and clear View of a well examined course of past Holiness; <hi>that effectual bar against falling into the Act of any known sin,</hi> which would be put by a Man's consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that by such an Act he must lose all the comfort of his past Virtue, and be forced to begin his Religious Life again from a new Period; And above all, <hi>that mighty dread of going on in a circle of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Repenting, Repenting and Sinning,</hi> into which Men would be rowzed, by being brought to understand clearly, that such a course is no part of a Religious Life <hi>at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Now this <hi>Period,</hi> from which I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a Christian to begin his Religious Life, must be either <hi>Baptism, Confirmation</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> In those who are converted from the Profession of any other Religion to that of Christianity, the Period from whence <hi>their</hi> Religious Life ought to begin, is <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism:</hi> And the Principal cause of that strict Piety, for which the Primitive Christians are so deservedly Eminent, seems to be that great rigour with which they insisted upon Mens living in a constant course of Piety from the time of their entring into this solemn Covenant. In those who have been educated from their Infancy in the Christian Religion, the Period from whence


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97776:30"/>
                  <hi>their</hi> Religious Life ought to be dated, is <hi>Confirmation;</hi> the time from their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism being only their <hi>Preparation,</hi> or <hi>time of Instruction.</hi> But then for those who have neglected this great and solemn Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, or have since fallen into any great and wliful sins; the only remaining time from whence <hi>their</hi> Religious Life can be reckoned, is <hi>Repentance, i. e.</hi> the Time since which they have so perfectly had the Conquest over all their Temptations, as not to have been seduced by them any more, into any <hi>gross</hi> or <hi>wilful</hi> sin. Of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> I have already spoken in the <hi>former</hi> Essay; of <hi>Confirmation</hi> I shall treat in <hi>this;</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> in the <hi>next.</hi>

But of this <hi>Confirmation</hi> of Persons baptized at riper years, which was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently administred immediately after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and is therefore by many not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason look'd upon as a Part of the Ceremony of <hi>Baptism it self,</hi> it is not my purpose to speak now more largely. That which I am at this time more especially to consider, is that <hi>Confirmation,</hi> as it is now in use in the Church, whereby those who


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97776:31"/>
have been <hi>baptized</hi> in their Infancy, are at Years of Discretion <hi>perfected</hi> or made <hi>compleat</hi> Members of the Church. And the Design and Use of <hi>Confirming</hi> such Persons, is plainly this: Baptism being a Covenant, wherein there are as well certain <hi>Conditions</hi> promised to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on the part of the Person Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, as certain <hi>Privileges</hi> assured to be conferred on God's part; and Infants, though they be capable of being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Privileges</hi> of Members of the Church, yet not being capable of promising or performing any <hi>Conditions,</hi> any otherwise than by means of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Sureties,</hi> who ingage to instruct them in the Nature and Obligation of the Promises made in their Name at their Baptism; 'tis manifest that these baptized Infants, when they come to Years of Discretion, if they desire to continue to be Partakers of the <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,</hi> which God has appropriated to the Members of his Church, they must be willing also to perform the <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which God has indispensably required of all those Members: That they may enter therefore into these Obligations, with the advantage of greater <hi>Solemnity</hi> and <hi>Choice,</hi> it has most wisely been instituted, that as soon as they be of Age to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Nature and the Obligation of


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97776:31"/>
that Promise, which was made in their Name at their Baptism, they should be brought to make a publick Declaration, in the presence of God and his Church of their taking freely <hi>upon themselves</hi> that Vow, and of their Resolution to live from thenceforward conformably to the <hi>Conditions</hi> of that great and solemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and that upon this publick Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their Faith, and most solemn Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of Obedience, they should by <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Hands</hi> have the great Privileges of Baptism sealed anew and secured to them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And that this might be done the more <hi>solemnly</hi> and <hi>effectually,</hi> so as to have a lasting effect upon the Minds and Lives of Men, as the solemn Administration of Baptism had antiently among the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians; <hi>it were very much to be wished,</hi> that as in those Primitive Times Persons converted to Christianity were not before Baptism admitted as compleat Members to the Communion of the Church, but were esteemed only as Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates desirous to be instructed in the Christian Religion; so those who have now been only baptized in their Infancy, should before Confirmation be looked upon by others, and by themselves too, as no other than <hi>Catechumens: It were to be wished,</hi> that no one might be admitted


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97776:32"/>
to the <hi>Communion,</hi> before he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; and that no one might be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Confirmation,</hi> before he had attained a perfect Knowledge of the extent and obligation of all the Duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and given sufficient evidence of his Resolution to live suitably to that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: <hi>It were to be wished,</hi> that as in the Primitive Church there were certain solemn Times appointed for Baptism, as <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> at which those who were before prepared by a regular course of Catechizing, were admitted with great solemnity into the compleat Communion of the Church; so there were now such solemn seasons appointed, against which Ministers of particular Parishes should for some time before-hand diligently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct and prepare those, who were of Age to be presented to the Bishop to be confirmed: And above all, <hi>it were to be wished,</hi> that the whole Process might be performed with so much <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Solemnity,</hi> that all the Persons confirmed might understand and be convinced, that they came now to have all the <hi>Privileges,</hi> which God hath promised to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Church, <hi>sealed</hi> and <hi>assured</hi> to them; that they now received the <hi>Assistance</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> to enable them effectually to perform their Duty; and that they now solemnly undertook

                  <hi>for themselves</hi> before God and the Church, what their <hi>Sureties</hi> promised for them before at Baptism, to Live from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward in all <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> and in constant <hi>Obedience</hi> to all the Commands of God, the remaining part of their Lives.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Were this excellent <hi>Institution</hi> thus solemnly and religiously observed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great would be <hi>the Effects</hi> which we might justly hope to see pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the use of it. The Effect that the <hi>Imposition</hi> of the Apostles <hi>hands</hi> had upon the first Converts to Christianity, was no less than the induing them with those extraordinary Gifts of <hi>Speaking with Tongues, Working Miracles,</hi> and the like: And though these mighty Operations of the Spirit did afterward by degrees cease; yet the constant <hi>Influence of the Holy Ghost,</hi> and the <hi>Blessing of God</hi> conferred by the Imposition of Hands, did in all succeeding Ages express and shew forth it self in great and very remarkable Effects: It filled Men with <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Internal Strength;</hi> it indued them with <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Fortitude,</hi> to <hi>confess bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> the Faith of Christ Crucified, and to <hi>promote zealously</hi> the Service of the Church; it wrought in their Minds an Ardent <hi>Love</hi> of God, and a continual <hi>Joy</hi> in the Holy Ghost; a perfect <hi>Purity</hi> of Heart, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi>


                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:97776:33"/>
of all Worldly Enjoyments; a boundless <hi>Charity</hi> towards all Mankind, and an infinite <hi>desire of doing good</hi> in their Generation.

If we do really and firmly believe, the <hi>Being</hi> and the <hi>Providence</hi> of God; if


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:97776:36"/>
we be indeed convinced, that the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion</hi> is a <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Divine Will; if we be in earnest persuaded, that there will certainly come a Day of <hi>Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,</hi> wherein every Man shall receive according to that he has done, whether it be Good or Evil; this is a <hi>Faith,</hi> which <hi>will assuredly overcome the World;</hi> this is a <hi>Belief,</hi> which will certainly baffle all the Temptations of Sin and Satan; this will make all the <hi>Glories</hi> of the World seem <hi>mean,</hi> and all the <hi>Pleasures</hi> of Sense <hi>insipid;</hi> in a word, this will inspire Men with such a vigorous Zeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as will make them not only with <hi>Ease and Contentment,</hi> but with a <hi>mighty Pleasure</hi> sacrifice all earthly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, to the doing the <hi>greatest Good</hi> here, and obtaining the <hi>greatest Happiness</hi> hereafter.

and <hi>Discouragements</hi> of a Religious Life: But he that begins to build upon this Foundation, and lays down his first Principles of <hi>Faith</hi> immovable as a Rock, will be able to surmount all Difficulties with <hi>Bravery</hi> and <hi>Constancy,</hi> and will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the end of his Hopes with <hi>Triumph</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The true Reason why so great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those who make Profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, are either wicked and licentious, or at least cold and indifferent in Matters of Religion, is plainly this, That they do not <hi>in earnest</hi> believe, as they pretend and profess to do, the great Articles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: They <hi>in course</hi> profess themselves to be Christians, without having ever consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what Christianity is, and <hi>therefore</hi> it has little or no Influence upon their Lives and Actions. For did Men indeed as firmly believe the Doctrines of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, as the Character they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bear in the World obliges them to pretend they do, it would be in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as strange to find a Man whose <hi>Actions</hi> should give his <hi>Words</hi> the Lye, and his <hi>Life</hi> be unsuitable to his <hi>Profession,</hi> as to hear one disputing whether there were a Hell or no, while he were actually tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the Flames thereof. For though <hi>Faith</hi> has not the Evidence of <hi>Sense,</hi> as indeed it is impossible it should, yet if it


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:97776:37"/>
be well grounded, it could not but have in good measure the same effect upon the Lives of Men, as the Evidence of Sense would have. When a <hi>Temporal Prince</hi> declares, that whoever be found guilty of such or such Crimes, shall certainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go this or that particular Punishment, such a Declaration has generally the same In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon all the Subjects concerned, as if they saw the Punishment already actually inflicted upon the Criminals: When therefore the <hi>Supreme Governour of the World</hi> declares to Mankind his Will, which is their Law and Rule of Life, and inforces the Obligation of that Law by such Threats and Promises, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which is that Declaration of his Will, contains; If these Threats and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of <hi>the Almighty</hi> have not the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Hearts and Lives of Men, as those of an <hi>earthly Prince</hi> in other Cases generally have, is it not evident either that Men do not in earnest believe that these Threats and Promises are indeed the Declaration of his Will, or else that they imagine that though he now so earnestly presses, and seems so severely to exact Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Laws, yet at last he will not punish the Contempt of them? If this be not the case, how comes the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to have lost that Efficacy in reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lives and Manners of Men, for


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97776:38"/>
which it was once so eminent even amongst its Enemies themselves? If <hi>We</hi> do indeed believe the same Gospel, and live under the power of the same Religion, that the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> did; how comes that Religion not to have the same Influence upon <hi>our</hi> Lives and Actions, that it had upon <hi>theirs?</hi> Can we hear Men daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane the Sacred Name of God with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and horrid Oaths; and yet think they believe there is a God, jealous of his Honour, and that will avenge himself on such a Nation as this? Can we see Men cheat and cozen, destroy and prey upon one another, without the least scruple or appearance of remorse; and yet think they believe the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Christian Religion, and the <hi>Severity</hi> thereof? In a word, can we see Men dally with Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for the sake of a few <hi>empty and momentany</hi> Gratifications, hazard their <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi> Welfare? Can we think it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I say, that rational Creatures should act with so prodigious a Carelesness, who yet believe not that the Scene of this World shall be shut up in everlasting O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blivion, but that there will come a Day wherein they must give Account for their Works, and be accordingly happy or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable for ever? No certainly; whatever Pretences Men may make to deceive <hi>others,</hi> and perhaps in some measure <hi>themselves</hi>


                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:97776:38"/>
too, there must lurk some secret Seeds of Infidelity in the Heart of every wicked Man; and the true Reason why <hi>this World</hi> has so much the Ascendant over the Lives of Christians, must be their not having a firm Belief of the Glories of the <hi>other.</hi> Whoever therefore will <hi>so enter</hi> into a religious course of Life, as to be able to <hi>persevere</hi> in well-doing to the end; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will <hi>so lay the Foundation,</hi> as to be able to <hi>finish;</hi> must before all things at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a firm and settled <hi>Belief</hi> of the great Truths of Religion: And as <hi>without this Ground-work,</hi> it is not possible he should ever be resolute enough, to <hi>overcome</hi> the Enemies of his Religion and Happiness; so <hi>with it,</hi> it is not possible he should ever <hi>be overcome</hi> by them. He that has a firm and steady Belief of the Greatness and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of those Riches, which <hi>neither Moth nor Rust doth corrupt,</hi> and to which <hi>Thieves cannot break through to steal,</hi> will never be so dazled with the glittering of Gold, as to let it steal away his Heart and Affections: He that has a great and noble Idea of the <hi>Glory which shall be revealed hereafter,</hi> will never be enticed to squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der away those Talents which God has given him, only in appearing splendid and great <hi>here:</hi> He that hath a strong and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous expectation of those Pleasures which God hath prepared for them that

Can any Man say, that it is a thing unworthy of the Wisdom of God, to make particular Discoveries of his Will to his Creatures, and to set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in a clearer light the rewards and punishments of a future State?

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:97776:46"/>

Mind: The Duties of <hi>Justice, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> which the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion commands us to exercise towards <hi>Men,</hi> are so apparently reasonable, and so directly conducive to the Happiness of Mankind, that even those Men who have broken through all the Bonds of Religion, and the Obligations of Virtue, have yet thought it necessary to the preservation of Society, and the well-being of Mankind, that the observation of these Duties should be inforced by the Penalties of Humane Laws: The Duties of <hi>Sobriety, Temperance</hi> and <hi>Contentment,</hi> which our Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns us to practise in <hi>our selves,</hi> are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably agreeable to the inward Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Humane Nature, and so perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of it, that the principal design of all true Philosophy was to recommend and set off these Duties to the best advantage; though, as the Philosophers themselves confessed, it never was able to work men up to that pitch of cheerful and generous Obedience to the Rules of these Duties, which the Christian Religion in its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and purest State was acknowledged to have done, and which, if it were now believed and practised as it then was, it must still do: Lastly, Even those <hi>positive and external Observances,</hi> (such as the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,</hi> &amp;c.) which are Instituted in the Christian Religion as means and assistances

to keep men stedfast in the practice of those <hi>great and moral Duties</hi> which are <hi>the weightier matters of the Law,</hi> are so free from all appearance of Superstition and Vanity, and so wisely fitted to the end for which they were designed; that many of the Adversaries of our Religion have yet been forced to admire, the Wisdom and the Excellency of their Institution.</p>

Again, The <hi>Principal Motives</hi> of the Christian Religion, I mean the Discovery of a Future State, and the Rewards and Punishments therein to be dispenced; are things so <hi>suitable to the excellent Wisdom of God,</hi> and so <hi>agreeable to the unprejudiced Reason, to the Natural Apprehensions and Expectations of Men,</hi> that were their truth and reality confirmed by no other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or external proof, yet were they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to influence the practice, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Actions of wise and considerate men. That the Soul of Man is immortal, and shall survive after the dissolution of this corruptible Body, is a truth which has always been thought demonstrable from Principles of Reason, and from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the nature of the thing: That Man is a Creature capable of doing good or evil, and consequently of giving account of his Actions, and being judged for them, is also evident: That therefore in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State there shall be a time of Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,

Lastly, Besides all these Proofs of the Truth of the Christian Revelation, drawn from the Consideration of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Thing, God has moreover confirmed it by the most <hi>undeniable external evidence, that ever was given to any Matter of Fact in the World.</hi> The Great <hi>Motives</hi>


                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:97776:49"/>
of the Christian Religion, are things not only <hi>most probable and most credible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> but God has moreover <hi>confirmed</hi> the certainty of them by <hi>most clear Testimony,</hi> (which is a proof suited to all Capacities,) and has most strongly <hi>urged</hi> upon Men the Rewards and Punishments of a future State by the <hi>Preaching and Exhortations</hi> of one, who by that convincing Proof of his <hi>Resurrection from the Dead</hi> did undeniably demonstrate that <hi>he had himself been there,</hi> and was able to give Men a satisfactory Account of the Nature of that State: The great <hi>Duties</hi> of the Christian Religion, are things not only <hi>most reasonable and most excellent in themselves,</hi> but they are more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>taught and inculcated</hi> by one, who has given the <hi>most credible and convincing Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> that could possibly be desired, of his being <hi>sent immediately from God.</hi> The <hi>Miracles</hi> which our Saviour wrought, were to his <hi>first Disciples,</hi> who were <hi>Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> of them, a most <hi>perfect demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Truth of his Doctrine: And the <hi>History of his Life, Death and Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> delivered down to us upon the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi> of those Disciples, are to <hi>Us</hi> also a <hi>sufficient Evidence</hi> of the same Truth. Their having <hi>conversed from the beginning with our Saviour himself;</hi> their having <hi>heard,</hi> and having <hi>seen with their Eyes;</hi> their having <hi>looked upon,</hi> and having

                  <hi>handled with their Hands of the Word of Life,</hi> (as St. <hi>John</hi> expresses it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 1.) made it impossible that <hi>they should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived themselves:</hi> And their whole <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Conversation,</hi> their <hi>Sufferings</hi> and <hi>Deaths,</hi> were invincible proofs against the Adversaries of Christianity, that they had no <hi>design of imposing upon others</hi> They saw all the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment precisely <hi>fulfilled</hi> in the <hi>Life and Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>Sufferings and Death</hi> of our Blessed Saviour; they saw him <hi>confirm</hi> what he taught with such <hi>mighty works,</hi> as his bitterest and most malicious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could not but confess to be above the Power of Nature, even while they were blaspheming that Holy Spirit which wrought them; they saw the <hi>whole course of his Life</hi> to be such, as to all unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced beholders loudly proclaimed his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Commission;</hi> they saw him so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly <hi>despise all worldly greatness,</hi> as once when the People would have made him <hi>a King,</hi> even to work a Miracle <hi>to avoid</hi> that, which was the only thing that was possible to be <hi>the aim and design</hi> of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor: In fine, they saw him <hi>alive after</hi>

                  <hi>his Passion by many infallible proofs,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with him for forty days together, and at last beholding him <hi>ascend visibly into Heaven.</hi> These were such <hi>demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of his being a Teacher sent from


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97776:50"/>
Heaven, and consequently that his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was nothing less than an immediate and express Revelation of the Will of God, that nothing but the <hi>extremest Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Obstinacy</hi> could withstand them: And the same reason that these Disciples of our Saviour had to believe <hi>his</hi> Doctrine, the same reason the rest of the World had to believe <hi>theirs:</hi> They <hi>confirmed</hi> what they taught, by <hi>Signs and Miracles;</hi> they <hi>lived</hi> according to the Doctrine they <hi>Preached,</hi> though manifestly contrary to all the Interests and Pleasures of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent World; and, which no Deceiver could ever do, they <hi>died</hi> with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable cheerfulness and joy of mind, for the Testimony of their Doctrine, and the Confirmation of their Religion. So that unless God should work upon Men by such Methods, as are wholly inconsistent with the Design of Religion, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Virtue and Vice; which we are sure he will not do; nothing can be done more than has already been done, to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Men of Religion,</hi> and to <hi>perswade them to Happiness.</hi> 'Tis true, the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Christ is not such an ocular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration to after Generations, as it was to those Men who <hi>then lived</hi> and <hi>saw him,</hi> and <hi>conversed with him:</hi> But since the matter of fact is as clearly proved to <hi>us,</hi> as 'tis possible for any matter of fact


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97776:50"/>
at that distance of time to be; since the Evidence of <hi>this</hi> is as great and greater, than of most of those things on which Men venture the whole of their Secular Affairs; and on which they are willing to spend all their time and pains; since I say the Case is thus, he that will rather venture all that he can possibly injoy or suffer; he that will run the hazard of losing Eternal Happiness, and falling into Eternal Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, rather than believe the <hi>most credible and rational</hi> thing in the World, meerly because he does <hi>not see it with his Eyes;</hi> 'tis plain that <hi>that</hi> Man does not dis-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the thing, because he thinks the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of it not sufficiently strong,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis <hi>contrary to some particular Interest of his</hi> that it should be true; and for <hi>that</hi> reason he <hi>might</hi> also have disbelieved it, though he had seen it himself.</p>
               <p n="17">17. This is in brief the Evidence which we have, of the <hi>Necessity of Religion</hi> in general, and of the <hi>Truth of the Christian Institution</hi> in particular: And he that would so lay the Foundation of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Life, as to be able to Conquer all the Temptations of the World, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in Well-doing to the end, must <hi>at least so far</hi> consider this evidence, as before all things to work in his own Mind a <hi>Firm, Settled</hi> and <hi>Well-grounded</hi> Belief of the great Truths of Religion. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97776:51"/>
which Effect, this Evidence is most abundantly sufficient. For if in <hi>other</hi> Cases, we assent to those things as <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>demonstrated,</hi> which if our <hi>Faculties of Judging and Reasoning</hi> do not <hi>necessarily</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, do upon the most impartial view appear clearly and plainly to be true; there is the same Reason, why in <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> Matters, we should look upon <hi>those</hi> things likewise to be <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated,</hi> which upon the exactest and most deliberate Judgment that we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable or making, do appear to us to be as clearly and as certainly true, as 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that our <hi>Faculties</hi> do not <hi>necessarily and unavoidably</hi> deceive us, in all our <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning the Nature of God, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proper Happiness of Man, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the difference of Good and Evil.</hi> And if in <hi>other</hi> Cases, we always act without the least hesitation upon the Credit of good and sufficient Testimony, and look upon that Man as foolish and ridiculous, who sustains great Losses, or lets slip great Opportunities and Advantages in Business, only by distrusting the most credible and well-attested things in the World; 'tis plain there is the same reason, why we should do so also in Matters of Religion. So that unless our Actions be determined by some other thing, than by Reason and Judgment; the Evidence which we have


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97776:51"/>
of the great Truths of Religion, ought to have the same effect upon our Lives and Actions, as if they were proved to us by any other sort of Evidence that could be desired.</p>
               <p n="18">18. There are indeed some Men, who being conscious to themselves that they act contrary to all the reasonable Evidence and Convictions of Religion, are yet apt to imagine, that if the great Truths of Religion were proved to them by some stronger Evidence, they <hi>should</hi> by that means be wrought upon to act otherwise than they do. But if the true reason why these Men act thus foolishly, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>the Doctrines of Religion</hi> are not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently evidenced, but because <hi>they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> are hurried away by some unruly Passions to act directly contrary to all Reason and Evidence; 'tis plain (unless God should irresistibly compel them) they might well continue to act as they do, though the Evidence of these things were really greater than it is. They are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to imagine, that if they had lived in our Saviour's time; if they had heard his Preaching, and seen his Miracles; if they had had the advantage of beholding those mighty Works, which he wrought for the proof of his Divine Commission; as the <hi>Jews</hi> then had; they should not like them <hi>have rejected the counsel of God against</hi>

They fansie they should imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately have become Disciples of Christ, and that the Truths which he taught, would have had a most powerful Influence upon the whole course of their Lives. And if their Hearts and Affections were not set upon <hi>this World,</hi> more than upon the <hi>next;</hi> if they valued not the <hi>present enjoyments of Sense,</hi> above the <hi>expectation of the Glory that shall be revealed;</hi> most certainly they would do the same <hi>now.</hi> But if their Hearts <hi>be</hi> set upon earthly things, and their Passions <hi>be</hi> stronger than all the Arguments of Reason; if they <hi>do</hi> indeed so love the Pleasures of Sin now, as that they cannot persuade themselves by all the Motives of Religion to live like Christians; we need not question to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that they might very well have been in the same case, though they <hi>had</hi> lived in our Saviour's time. The <hi>Jews</hi> are a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and standing Instance, how far Prejudice and Affection are able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over the strongest Convictions: When our Saviour began to preach that he was sent from God to instruct them in their Duty, they required a <hi>Sign</hi> of him, and they <hi>would believe</hi> him; but when he had wrought so many Miracles, that <hi>even the World it self could not contain</hi>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97776:53"/>
of Sin and Folly; so it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it would be in the present Case: Should God send a Messenger from the Dead, to assure Men of the certainty of a future state, and the danger of their present Wickedness, as soon as the Fright were over and their present terrible Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions ceased, 'tis by no means impossible that their old vicious Habits and beloved Sins should again by degrees prevail over them. Many there are in our present Age, who pretend to be convinced of the being of Spirits by the powerful demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of their own Senses; and yet we do not observe, that their Lives are more remarkably eminent for exemplary Piety, than theirs, who being convinced by the less violent, but more rational Evidence of the Gospel, go on in a sober, constant, and regular exercise of Virtue and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</p>

may hope to be <hi>religious</hi> without being <hi>vertuous,</hi> and to be accepted of God for some <hi>outward performances,</hi> without a <hi>holy temper and disposition of Mind;</hi> this cuts the very Sinews and undermines the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now therefore to attain right Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the Nature of Religion, a Man ought firmly to persuade himself of these following Considerations: That <hi>the exercise of those great Moral Vertues, of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, Righteousness and Temperance, which are the eternal and unchangeable Law of God, is a thing in its own Nature both truly excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and indispensably necessary to prepare Men for that Happiness which is the Reward of Religion:</hi> That <hi>God truly and sincerely desires to make Men happy, by the exercise of these Vertues:</hi> And that <hi>therefore the great and ultimate Design of all true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is to recommend these Vertues, and to inforce their practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>the exercise of these great Moral Vertues, of Godliness, Righteousness and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, which are the eternal and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Law of God, is a thing in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture truly Noble and Excellent,</hi> is evidently acknowledged by the common Consent and Verdict of all Mens Consciences. These Virtues are the imitation of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God; and as no Man is so bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, as not to admire the Perfections of

THere is but one thing, that I know of, that can with any colour be urged against this Notion of true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I have now laid down: And that is the Doctrine of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> delivered by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in that to the <hi>Galatians.</hi> Which because it is a Doctrine of the greatest Importance, and liable to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreted to countenance the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Errors; I shall therefore in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> by way of Digression, endeavour to give a brief Account of the <hi>Occasion</hi> of the writing these two <hi>Epistles,</hi> and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the <hi>Doctrine</hi> delivered therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Before the coming of Christ, the <hi>Jews</hi> we know were the peculiar People of God, selected out of all the Nations of the Earth to be the Standard of true Religion, and to be the People among whom God would chuse to place his Name.

To <hi>them</hi> God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self prescribed a Law or Form of Worship in a wonderful and miraculous manner; and their Polity also was of Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution

and Appointment; <hi>God shewed his Word unto Jacob, his Statutes and his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto Israel: He did not deal so with any other Nation, neither had the Heathen knowledge of his Laws.</hi> Lastly, <hi>They</hi> were the Posterity of those Patriarchs, to whom God had so often promised and sworn by himself, That in their Seed should all the Nations of the Earth be blessed; and among them was born that Messias, of whom so great things had been Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied, and who was therefore the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Ends of the Earth. These were the great and glorious Privileges, which by the peculiar Favour of God, the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> enjoyed before the preaching of the Gospel; these were the Grounds upon which that People so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued themselves, above the rest of Mankind: And most justly might they have done so, with an humble and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgment of the Mercy and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of <hi>God:</hi> But they look'd upon these high Privileges, not as the free Gift of God, but as a Right and Propriety, to which they only had a just Claim, who could reckon their Descent from <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Patriarchs: All other Nations in the World they look'd upon with the utmost Scorn and Contempt, as <hi>Aliens from the Commonwealth of</hi> Israel, <hi>Strangers to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Promise,</hi> and scarce worthy of

When the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah himself should appear, they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded that he was to establish an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Kingdom over the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation only, and so become indeed the Wonder and Amazement, but not the Salvation of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> This Opinion was so firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted among them in our Saviour's time, that even those who believed in his Name, and were convinced that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was not to be a Temporal but a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Kingdom, did yet imagine that the <hi>Jews</hi> only were to be admitted to be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this his Spiritual Kingdom, and that the Gospel was not to be preached to the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> Till St. <hi>Peter</hi> having an express Command from Heaven not to count any Man common or unclean, as you may read <hi>Acts</hi> 10. went and preached the Gospel to <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion; and his Preaching being seconded by the miraculous effusion of the Holy Ghost upon the Gentile Converts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them that <hi>God</hi> was <hi>of a truth no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specter</hi>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97776:67"/>
no better than tempting God, to put a Yoke upon their Necks, which neither themselves nor their Fathers had been able to bear; they immediately agreed to write unto them, that they did not think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to lay upon them any such Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; as you may see at large, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. And now the Question being decided by such an authoritative Sentence as this, <hi>It seemed good unto the Holy Ghost, and to us the Apostles and Elders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp;c. one would have thought there should have been no more Debate about this Matter: But the rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>Jews,</hi> moved with envy that the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> should be admitted into the Number of the elect People of God as well as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, persisted still in their Obstinacy notwithstanding this positive Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, persuading the Gentile Converts that they <hi>must needs observe the Law of Moses,</hi> and <hi>constraining them to be circumcised;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who as far as he could lawfully, conformed himself to the Humours of <hi>all men,</hi> that he <hi>might by all means gain some,</hi> was forced to circumcise <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Derbe, because of the Jews that were in those quarters,</hi> Acts 16. 3. Though at other times, as being the Apostle to whom was especially committed the preaching of the Gospel to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he always earnestly exhorted his Gentile Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to <hi>stand fast in the liberty wherewith</hi>


                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:97776:67"/>
                  <hi>Christ had made them free;</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and that to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> were written upon this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Occasion; as will be evident to any one, who shall impartially consider the Matter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For that there are abundance of Passages in these <hi>Epistles,</hi> which so evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate to this Controversie, that they cannot possibly be interpreted to any other Sense, is manifest from but cursorily read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Epistles</hi> themselves. A great part of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> is professed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the casting off the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the coming in of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> particularly the 9th, 10th and 11th Chapters: And the 14th Chapter is wholly spent in shewing the unnecessariness of the Jewish obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Days, and distinction of Meats; <hi>One Man esteemeth one day above another, another esteemeth every day alike,</hi> Verse 5. and <hi>I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of it self; but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean,</hi> Verse 14. and so on. In the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> the Apostle tells his Gentile Converts, that he was amazed they should so soon be drawn away from the Truth, by some that <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> them and <hi>would pervert the Gospel of Christ,</hi> Chap. 1. ver. 7. He gives them warning, that the reason why those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:97776:68"/>
of the Gospel persuaded them to Judaize, was only that they might make a fair shew in the Flesh; <hi>they constrain you,</hi> says he, <hi>to be circumcised, only lest they should suffer persecution for the Gross of Christ; For neither they themselves, who are circumcised, keep the Law, but desire to have you circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised that they may glory in your flesh,</hi> Ch. 6. Ver. 12, &amp; 13. He assures them that <hi>in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new Creature,</hi> Ch. 6. ver. 15. He urges them earnestly to <hi>stand fast</hi> in their <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> and not to be <hi>intangled again with the yoke of Bondage,</hi> protesting that <hi>if any man</hi> would be <hi>circumcised, Christ</hi> should <hi>profit him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> but he should become <hi>a debtor to fulfil the whole Law,</hi> Ch. 5. ver. 1. He tells them also how he openly rebuked St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> for withdrawing and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating himself from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>them which were of the circumcision,</hi> Ch. 2. Ver. 12. All which, and many other the like Passages, do so evidently refer to that Controversie, <hi>Whether the Jewish Religion was to be mixed with the Christian, or no,</hi> that I know not whether any one ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to interpret them to any other Sense.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And that those other Parts also of these <hi>Epistles,</hi> which have by <hi>some</hi> been otherwise interpreted, ought <hi>indeed</hi> to be


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:97776:68"/>
understood wholly to relate to the same Controversie, appears sufficiently from the Apostles way of arguing. For according to any other Interpretation, the <hi>Terms,</hi> which the Apostle makes use of, are improper; and his <hi>reasoning</hi> is hard, intricate, and not concluding. As is sufficiently evident from the difficulty that some Expositors have met with, to vindicate St. <hi>Paul</hi> from thwarting the main Design of the Gospel, from contradicting the express Words of some other of the Apostles, and also from contradicting himself. But if these whole <hi>Epistles</hi> be understood to refer to that Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>Whether the Christian Religion be alone sufficient to Salvation, or whether it be necessary to observe together with it the Ceremonies also of the Jewish Law;</hi> the <hi>Terms,</hi> which the Apostle uses, are most apt and proper; and his <hi>Reasoning</hi> is most easie, strong and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive: As will most evidently appear from a brief view of them both.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The design then of the Apostle being on one hand to <hi>magnifie</hi> the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> by setting forth its <hi>sufficiency</hi> to Salvation; and on the other hand, to demonstrate the <hi>insufficiency and unnecessariness</hi> of the <hi>ceremonial observances of the Jewish Law;</hi> the <hi>Terms</hi> which he all along makes use of to express the <hi>Christian</hi> and <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion by, are such as may best serve to <hi>set forth</hi> the <hi>excellency</hi> of the one, and <hi>diminish</hi> the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:97776:69"/>
which Men had taken up of the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> of the other. Thus because the first and most fundamental Duty of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, is <hi>believing</hi> in God, and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> that most perfect Revelation of his Will, which he has made to Mankind by our Saviour Jesus Christ; whereas on the contrary, the principal part of the Jewish Religion, or at least of that Religion which the Judaizing Christians so earnestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, was an <hi>anxious observance</hi> of the burdensome <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the Mosaick <hi>Law;</hi> therefore the Apostle calls the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion <hi>Faith,</hi> and the Jewish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>the Law.</hi> Thus in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ch. 3. ver. 28. <hi>Therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that a man is justified by Faith, without the deeds of the Law;</hi> that is, It clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from what has been already said, that Obedience to the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is sufficient to justifie a Man, without obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Ceremonies of the <hi>Jewish:</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 31. <hi>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? God forbid; yea, we establish the Law;</hi> that is, Do we then, as some Men object, by our preaching up the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion</hi> make void the <hi>Law of God,</hi> or <hi>that Revelation of his Will</hi> which he made to the <hi>Jews?</hi> No, we are so far from that, that by introducing <hi>Christianity</hi> we establish, confirm, and perfect the moral and immutable part of the Law much


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97776:69"/>
more effectually, than the <hi>Jewish Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> were able to do. Thus likewise in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ch. 3. ver. 2. <hi>This only would I learn of you. Received ye the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by the works of the Law, or by the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith?</hi> Or, as 'tis expressed, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>He that ministreth to you the Spirit, and worketh Miracles among you, doth he it by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> that is, I appeal unto your selves, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend so earnestly for the necessity of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Jewish Ceremonies; was it by your observing the Rites of the <hi>Jewish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> that ye received the Gifts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, or by your being converted to the <hi>Christian?</hi> So also, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>The Law was our School-master to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by Faith;</hi> that is, The Jewish Dispensation was appointed by God in condescention to the weakness of that People, to fit them by degrees for the reception of the <hi>Christian:</hi> And ch. 2. ver. 15. The Apostle having rebuked St. <hi>Peter</hi> openly, for withdrawing himself from the <hi>Gentiles</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> adds, <hi>We who are Jews by nature, and not Sinners of the Gentiles, knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ, and not by the Works of the Law;</hi> that is, If we our selves, who were brought


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97776:70"/>
up in the <hi>Jewish Religion,</hi> being convinced that that Religion was not able to justifie us in the sight of God, have thought fit to forsake it and imbrace the <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> in hopes to be justified thereby, how much less reason have you to compel the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were never brought up in the <hi>Jewish Religion,</hi> to conform themselves to the Customs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> after their Conversion to <hi>Christianity?</hi>

Again, because the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> teaches us to expect Salvation not from our own Merits, but from the Grace of God, that is, according to the Terms of that new and gracious Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God has promised to accept of Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty instead of perfect Obedience; whereas on the contrary, the <hi>Jews</hi> depended upon their exact performance of the Works of the Law; therefore the Apostle calls the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion <hi>Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion <hi>Works.</hi> Thus in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ch. 11. ver. 5. <hi>So then at this present time also, there is a remnant accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the election of Grace;</hi> that is, tho' the Jewish Nation having rejected the gracious offer of the Gospel, are thereupon rejected from being the People of God, yet has God reserved to himself a Remnant from among them, even those who have embraced the <hi>Christian Religion; And if by Grace, then is it no more of Works;</hi> that is, and if it be upon account of their having embraced


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:97776:70"/>
the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, that they are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned the peculiar People of God, then is not this Privilege any longer annexed to the Professors of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion; <hi>otherwise Grace is no more Grace;</hi> that is, otherwise the Christian Religion is in vain, and not, what it pretends to be, the Grace of God: Thus also, <hi>ch.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Sin shall not have the dominion over you, for ye are not under the Law but under Grace;</hi> that is, ye are not under the Jewish Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but under the Christian. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ch. 5. ver. 4. <hi>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the Law, ye are fallen from Grace;</hi> that is, whosoever will needs retain the Jewish Religion, he takes upon him to fulfil the whole Law, forsaking the gracious Dispensation of the Christian Religion, and therefore Christ shall be of no effect unto him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Again, because the Duties of the Christian Religion are almost wholly <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Spiritual,</hi> respecting the inward disposition of the Heart and Mind; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, the Ceremonies of the Jewish Law were for the most part <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> and as the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calls them, <hi>Carnal Ordinances,</hi> respecting chiefly the outward purification of the Body; therefore the Apostle calls the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the Jewish Religion <hi>Flesh.</hi>


                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:97776:71"/>
Thus in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ch. 8. ver. 3, &amp; 4. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful Flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the Flesh; that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit;</hi> that is, whereas the Jewish Religion, because of its outward and carnal Ordinances, was weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to make Men truly Righteous; God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful Man to offer up himself a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the Sins of Mankind, established the Christian Religion, which purifying throughly the whole Heart and Mind, and purging the Conscience from dead Works, might through the Grace and Mercy of God avail to justifie Men from all things, from which they could not be justified by the Law. Thus also in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ch. 3. ver. 3. <hi>Are ye so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the Flesh?</hi> that is, Are ye so foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish as to think, that after ye have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Truth of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, you can become yet more perfect by observing the Ceremonies of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Law?</p>
               <p n="8">8. These are the <hi>Terms</hi> which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle expresses the Christian and Jewish Religion by in these <hi>Epistles:</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording


<pb n="127" facs="tcp:97776:71"/>
to this Interpretation, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of both these <hi>Epistles</hi> may clearly be resolved into certain Arguments, by which the Apostle plainly and strongly proves, against the Judaizing Believers, that Obedience to the Christian Religion is sufficient to Salvation, without obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Ceremonies of the Jewish.</p>
               <p n="9">9. His first Argument is this. The Jewish Religion having proved insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make Men truly good, as the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Religion had before done, there was a necessity of setting up another Institution of Religion, which might be more availa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and effectual to that End; now the setting up a new Institution of Religion necessarily implying the abolishing of the old, it follows that <hi>Christianity</hi> was not to be added to <hi>Judaism,</hi> but that <hi>Judaism</hi> was to be changed into <hi>Christianity,</hi> that is, that the Jewish Religion was from thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to cease, and the Christian Religion to succeed in its room. This Argument the Apostle insists upon in the 1st, 2d, 5th, 6th and 7th Chapters to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in the 1st and 4th Chapters to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> In the 1st and 2d Chapters of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he shows that the Jewish Religion had proved insufficient to make Men truly Holy, as <hi>Natural</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had also done: In the 5th and 6th Chapters of that <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97776:72"/>
in the 1st to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Institution of the Christian Religion, as more available to that End; in the 7th Chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi> he shews that this new Institution of Religion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily implies the abolishing of the old one; and this he does from the similitude of a Womans being bound by the Law to her Husband so long as he lives, but if her Husband be dead, she is free from the Law of her Husband; which Similitude he applies, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Wherefore my Brethren ye also are become dead to the Law by the Body of Christ, that ye should be married to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God:</hi> In the 4th Chapter to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he proves the same thing from the Similitude of a young Heirs being under Governors or Tutors, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>I say that the Heir, as long as he is a Child, differeth nothing from a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, tho' he be Lord of all; but is under Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Governors, until the time appointed of the Father; even so we, when we were Children, were in bondage under the elements of the World: But when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem those that were under the Law, that we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the adoption of Sons;</hi> that is, The Jewish Law was an Institution of Religion adapted by God in great Condescention to


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:97776:72"/>
the weak Apprehensions of that People; but when the fulness of time was come, God sent his Son Jesus Christ to institute a more perfect Form of Religion, after the settlement of which in the World, the former Dispensation was to be <hi>disannul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. The second Argument, by which the Apostle proves that the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is sufficient to justifie a Man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixing therewith the Rites of the Jewish, is this: The Summ and Essence of all Religion, is Obedience to the moral and eternal Law of God; since therefore the Ceremonies of the Jewish Law were instituted only for that very reason, that they might promote this great End, and prepare Mens Hearts for the reception of that more perfect Institution of Religion, wherein God was to be worshipped and obeyed in Spirit and in Truth; 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that when this more perfect Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion was settled, the former, which was designed for no other reason but to be a preparatory to this, must be abolished. This Argument the Apostle insists on in the 2d Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in the 3d to the <hi>Galatians:</hi> In the 2d to the <hi>Romans</hi> he shows, that every Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Religion, and particularly the Jewish, was no otherwise of any esteem in the sight of God, than as it promoted


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:97776:73"/>
that great end of Obedience to his Moral and Eternal Law: <hi>For Circumcision,</hi> saith he, <hi>verily profiteth if thou keep the Law; but if thou be a breaker of the Law, thy Circumcision is made Uncircumcision; Therefore if the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision keep the Righteousness of the Law; shall not his Uncircumcision be counted for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision? And shall not Uncircumcision, which is by nature, if it keep the Law, judge thee who by the Letter and Circumcision dost transgress the Law? For he is not a Jew which is one out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, neither is that Circumcision which is outward in the flesh; But he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and Circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter, whose praise is not of Men but of God,</hi> v. 25. to the end. In the 3d to the <hi>Galatians</hi> he argues, that the <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion having been thus instituted only to prepare Men for that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Eternal Law of God, which was to be the sum and essence of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Religion; it follows that when this latter and more perfect Institution took place, there was no need of continuing the former: <hi>The Law,</hi> saith he, <hi>was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come, to whom the Promise was made,</hi> v. 19. And v. 23. <hi>Before Faith came we were kept under the Law, shut up unto the Faith which should afterward be revealed; Wherefore the Law was our School-master to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by Faith; But after that Faith is come, we are no longer under a School-master.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:97776:73"/>11. The Third Argument which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle makes use of to prove that those who were converted to the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, were not bound any longer to observe the <hi>Jewish,</hi> is this: The Religion of <hi>Abraham</hi> was such a Religion, as was acceptable to God, and available to Justification; But now the Religion of <hi>Abraham</hi> was the same with the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, consisting only of <hi>Faith and Obedience</hi> without the <hi>works of the Jewish Law;</hi> (For the Scripture saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, that <hi>the Gospel was Preached before unto</hi> Abraham, and that <hi>his Faith was reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned unto him for Righteousness, when he was not in Circumcision, but in Uncircumcision;</hi>) It follows therefore, that the Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion shall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto us for Righteousness, without the works of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law. This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Apostle largely and strongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists upon in the whole 4th Chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in the 3d to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> as you may there read at large.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The fourth and last Argument, by which the Apostle proves that the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion is sufficient to Salvation without retaining the <hi>Jewish,</hi> is this: The Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> were the Elect and the peculiar People of God; But by the Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> is not meant strictly those who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend from <hi>Abraham according to the flesh,</hi> but <hi>the Children of the Promise,</hi> (that is, <hi>as many as are of the Faith of</hi> Abraham,) <hi>shall be</hi>


                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:97776:74"/>
                  <hi>counted for the Seed:</hi> The true Religion therefore and Service of God, is not confined to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation, who are the Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the flesh, but <hi>the Gentiles also which believe, have attained to Righteousness, even the Righteousness which is of Faith;</hi> that is, those of all Nations, as well <hi>Gentiles</hi> as <hi>Jews,</hi> who embrace the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, which is the same with the Religion of <hi>Abraham,</hi> shall be justified with faithful <hi>Abraham.</hi> And this Argument the Apostle insists upon in the 9th, 10th, and 11th Chapters of the Epistle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and in the 4th to the <hi>Galatians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. This is the Sum of the Arguments, which the Apostle makes use of in these two Epistles, to prove against the <hi>Judaizing Christians,</hi> that there was no necessity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the <hi>Jewish</hi> Religion together with the <hi>Christian.</hi> And from the largeness, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and strength of these Arguments, 'tis evident that the determination of this Question is <hi>indeed</hi> the principal scope and design of the Apostle in these Epistles. For nothing can be more absurd than to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that the Apostle should most strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and largely demonstrate a thing, which was not really the design of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; or that on the other hand he should make a thing the professed Subject of his discourse and yet prove it by such intricate and obscure Arguments, as the wisest and cunningest of Men should never be able to


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:97776:74"/>
reconcile, either with the rest of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or with themselves.</p>
               <p n="14">14. We must not therefore so understand any passages in these Epistles, as if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle designed to magnifie <hi>one</hi> Christian Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in opposition to <hi>all</hi> or <hi>any</hi> of the rest; but only that he would set forth the Perfection of the Virtues of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Ceremonies of the <hi>Jewish.</hi> Thus when he tells us that we are <hi>justified by Faith without Works,</hi> we must not interpret it of the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, in opposition to the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, but of the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, in opposition to the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Jewish.</hi> For so the Apostle himself most expresly explains it, Gal. 5. 6 <hi>In Christ Jesus neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor Uncircumcision, but Faith which worketh by Love;</hi> that is, it matters not whether a Man observes the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or no, if he maintains but the <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Obedience</hi> of the <hi>Christian.</hi> But as to the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, the same Apostle every where urgeth <hi>their</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and particularly the <hi>five</hi> last Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi> are a most earnest exhortation to be fruitful therein.</p>
               <p n="15">15. From which it follows most evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there is no contradiction between St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>James,</hi> when the one says that a Man <hi>is justified by Faith without Works,</hi> and the other saith that <hi>Faith without Works</hi>


                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:97776:75"/>
                  <hi>cannot justifie.</hi> For the one speaking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly of the <hi>Works of the Jewish Religion,</hi> and the other of the <hi>Works of the Christian,</hi> 'tis plain that the <hi>Faith of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> may avail to justifie a Man without the <hi>Works of the Jewish Religion,</hi> (which is the Assertion of St. <hi>Paul;</hi>) tho' it cannot do so without the <hi>Works of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> (which is the Assertion of St. <hi>James.</hi>) The <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, was accounted to him for Righteousness;</hi> that is, his <hi>Faith</hi> was accepted without <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and without observing the <hi>external Rites of the Law:</hi> But it was by <hi>Works,</hi> saith St. <hi>James,</hi> that <hi>Abraham our Father was justified;</hi> that is, it was by real <note n="*" place="margin">

This is the Summ of the Duties, which every one who will in earnest dedicate himself to the Service of God, and serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter upon a Religious Course of Life, <hi>must resolve</hi> to perform. Whoever will <hi>bear his Cross and come after</hi> Christ, must first consider, whether for the sake of <hi>God and Religion,</hi> he can be able to bear the Scorn and Contempt of Impious and Prophane


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:97776:77"/>
Men, and suffer all things rather than be compelled to do any thing to the dishonour of his God; he must consider whether for the sake of <hi>Justice and Charity</hi> he can be able to Sacrifice his dearest Interests, to conquer his most natural Passions, and to despise the Glory and Splendour of the World; and he must ask himself whether for the sake of <hi>Temperance and Purity,</hi> he can be able to mortifie his most darling Lusts, and as a resolute follower of a Crucified Saviour, contemn all the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Flesh and Sense: For unless he can peremptorily resolve with himself to do all this, his Profession of Religion will certainly be in vain, and he <hi>cannot be the Disciple</hi> of Christ. <hi>Which of you,</hi> saith our blessed Saviour, <hi>intending to build a Tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> What is to be done at Confirmation: Of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly renewing the Baptismal Vow.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WHen a Person is thus arrived to a <hi>firm Belief of the great Truths of Religion;</hi> When he <hi>Understands distinctly the Extent and Obligation of his Duty;</hi> and is come to a <hi>settled Resolution of conducting the whole course of his Life, according to that Knowledge;</hi> then is it that he becomes truly <hi>meet for the Kingdom of God,</hi> and is rightly prepared to make a solemn Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his being a Disciple of Christ. Which the Church has wisely ordained should be done publickly at Confirmation: where by <hi>Ratifying with our own Mouth the Vow made in our Name by our Sureties,</hi> we solemnly take upon our selves to perform all <hi>the Duties, which the Condition of our Baptismal Covenant obliges us to observe;</hi> and by Imposition of Hands, (according to the constant practice of the Church since the times of the Apostle) we have sealed and Confirmed to us all the <hi>Privileges, which the condition of the same Baptismal Covenant intitles us to receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>First</hi> therefore, <hi>at</hi> receiving Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>Consider that you now Solemnly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for your self to perform all the Duties,</hi>


                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:97776:78"/>
                  <hi>which the Condition of your Baptismal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant obliges you to observe.</hi> Consider that you now confirm &amp; ratifie, all that your Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reties promised and vowed for you at your Baptism. Consider that you now ingage in your own Person, <hi>To renounce the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this Wicked World, and all the sinful Lusts of the Flesh;</hi> that you now ingage <hi>to stand firm in the Belief of the Christian Doctrine, and never to be ashamed to confess the Faith of Christ crucified, or afraid to own your self his Disciple;</hi> and that you now ingage <hi>to obey from henceforward all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God,</hi> that is, <hi>to live</hi> (with all the Strictness and Purity of the Gospel) <hi>in the constant Practice of every one of</hi> those <hi>Duties,</hi> of which I have briefly set down the Heads in the former Chapter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And consider, that you promise all this <hi>most solemnly, in the Presence of God and before the whole Congregation.</hi> Consider, that you enter into this Promise with <hi>such solemnity,</hi> as lays upon you the strongest possible Obligations to Virtue: Consider that you <hi>so</hi> enter into this Promise with <hi>Knowledge and Deliberation,</hi> that if you shall afterwards fall into any Course of sin, in contempt of such repeated Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the contrary, the Guilt thereof will be extreamly increased; and that therefore you ought <hi>now,</hi> to affect your Mind <hi>deeply</hi> with a sence of the heinousness


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97776:79"/>
of sin, and to strengthen <hi>mightily</hi> your good Resolutions. Antiently, every one that was baptized, was taught to look upon himself as entring into so solemn an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Religion, that if after <hi>that Great and Sacred Vow</hi> he should fall into any wilful and known sin, it could not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him but upon a proportionably <hi>great and long Repentance:</hi> And the same Reason there is now, why every one that by Confirmation dedicates himself to the Service of God, and makes publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of his being a Disciple of Christ, should look upon himself as entring into such a solemn Obligation, as should make him exceeding fearful of falling for the future into any great sin, the Guilt of which will be extreamly increased by being committed after such repeated Vows and Promises to the contrary.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet is this no Reason why any one should defer being <hi>Confirmed,</hi> as if by omitting to bind himself by this New and Solemn Promise, he might continue to sin with less guilt and less danger. For though the guilt of sin be indeed mightily increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, by being committed after repeated Obligations to the contrary; yet if any one omits to renew his Obligations, only for that reason, that he may continue in sin; his sin is then equally heinous and against Knowledge, as if he had renewed


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:97776:79"/>
his Obligation. <hi>Baptism</hi> is a solemn Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to be Religious; and many of the Antients, because they thought sin would be more heinous after so solemn an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, did therefore defer to be Baptized till the end of their Lives. <hi>The Lord's Supper</hi> is also a solemn Obligation to be Religious; and many in our days, because they think sin will be more heinous after so solemn an Obligation, do therefore defer receiving the Communion all their Lives. But 'tis plain these men run into a very great Errour. For the reason why sin after repeated Obligations to the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more heinous, is because it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with greater <hi>Deliberation</hi> &amp; against clearer <hi>Convictions:</hi> When therefore a man who <hi>Believes</hi> Religion, and <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands</hi> its Obligations, omits these Duties for no other reason, but that he may sin (as he thinks) with less danger; his sins are then equally <hi>deliberate,</hi> and against equally <hi>clear Knowledge;</hi> and he more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over adds to them a <hi>contemptuous neglect,</hi> of the means of becoming more Religious.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Certainty of God's Grace, and the Assistance of his Holy Spirit.</head>
               <p n="1">1. SEcondly, <hi>Consider that you come now to have Sealed and Confirmed to you all the Privileges, which the Condition of your Baptismal Covenant intitles you to receive.</hi> At <hi>Baptism</hi> we are admitted into the Church of God, and have a Title to the Graces and Assistance of the Holy Spirit; and at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> this Grace is Sealed and Assured to us, by the external Sign of Imposition of Hands. When therefore you come in this solemn manner to make Profession of your Religion, and to dedicate your self to the Service of God, be sure to come with <hi>earnest desires,</hi> and a <hi>longing Soul,</hi> with <hi>firm Faith,</hi> and a <hi>well-assured Hope,</hi> with a <hi>pure Heart,</hi> and a <hi>Mind prepared for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Holy Ghost;</hi> and God will not fail, to pour down upon you the <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Grace;</hi> to give you strength from thenceforward to overcome both the <hi>inward corruption of your Nature,</hi> and the <hi>outward temptations of the World and the Devil;</hi> to inable you to continue firm in the <hi>Faith of Christ,</hi> and in the <hi>Obedience of his Commands;</hi> to preserve you always from


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97776:80"/>
the <hi>Dominion of Sin,</hi> and to bring you safe unto his <hi>Kingdom of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is nothing more pernitious to the Souls of Men, than an Opinion of the <hi>Uncertainty of the Grace of God,</hi> and its not being annexed constantly to the use of means. If we imagine that our <hi>Nature is so utterly corrupted,</hi> that we can no more <hi>do</hi> or <hi>will</hi> any thing that is good than a dead Body can move, or bring it self to Life, till we be acted by such a mighty and extraordinary Grace of God, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>that we can do</hi> can in the least prepare us to receive; If we imagine that the <hi>Temptations</hi> of the <hi>World and the Devil</hi> are so <hi>strong,</hi> that we cannot possibly overcome them without such a powerful Assistance of the Holy Spirit, as God has not annexed to the use of any <hi>Ordinances</hi> or <hi>Means</hi> of Religion; If we imagine that the <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of God are so <hi>impossible</hi> to be kept, that after all we can do, we must sit still in expectation of being <hi>converted</hi> suddenly by an <hi>irresistible Grace;</hi> this must needs make all our Indeavours <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>faint, dead</hi> and <hi>without heart,</hi> and we shall certainly never be able to <hi>overcome our Temptations</hi> and to <hi>Persevere in Well-doing:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It must indeed be confessed, that the<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>Corruption of our Nature</hi> is really so great, that we <hi>cannot do any thing as of our selves:</hi> It must be confessed, that the Temptations


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97776:81"/>
of the <hi>World</hi> and <hi>the Devil</hi> are really so strong, that we can never, meerly by our own strength, be able to <hi>stand and Persevere unto the end:</hi> It must be confessed, that the <hi>Commandment</hi> of God is so <hi>exceeding broad,</hi> that by all that we can do by our own power, we can never <hi>be justified in the sight of God.</hi> But then if our Saviour <hi>has</hi> deliver'd us from this Corruption of our Nature, and <hi>has</hi> broken all the Powers of Sin and Satan: If Christ by his Death <hi>has</hi> purchased this Grace for us, that upon our attending the Ordinances and Means of Religion which he hath appointed, God will as certainly bestow upon us the sufficient Assistance of his Holy Spirit, as a tender Father cannot deny his Child any reasonable Request: If <hi>God will not suffer us to be tempted above what we are able, but will with the Temptation</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13</note> 
                  <hi>also make a way to escape,</hi> and whenever he requires more of us than we are naturally able to perform, will certainly afford us an extraordinary Assistance proportionable to the difficulty we are obliged to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; (as he constantly did to the Primitive Christians, who through the mighty Power of the Spirit were enabled to bear all the most exquisite Torments, that either <hi>the wit of Man,</hi> or the <hi>Malice of the Devil</hi> could invent, with less concern than we can even indure to hear or read of them:) If all this, I say, be true, 'tis evident that if notwithstanding this we still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:97776:81"/>
in Wickedness, all these specious Pretences will by no means excuse us, but we shall be found to have <hi>done despite unto the Spirit of Grace,</hi> and to have <hi>neglected</hi> our <hi>great Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Think not therefore that the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of your Nature is greater, than that Grace and Assistance which God <hi>now</hi> affords you; For so you may sit still under the Dominion of sin, in a vain expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being converted by some sudden and All-powerful <hi>Grace</hi> of God, till you be surprized by the <hi>Revelation of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgment:</hi> But know, that to all those who are <hi>Baptized in his Name,</hi> and who <hi>Profess and Endeavour to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> God <hi>doth give both to will and to do of his good Pleasure;</hi> and therefore you are from henceforward indispensably bound, to <hi>work out your own Salvation with</hi>

                  <hi>fear and trembling.</hi> Think not that the Temptations of the World and the Devil, are more powerful than that strength wherewith God <hi>now</hi> indues you; For so you will be sure to be overcome by them: But know, that our Saviour has <hi>Overcome the World and the Devil,</hi> so that they have <note n="*" place="margin">Diabolum autem ne timeas: Timens enim Dominum domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naberis illius; quia virtus in illo nulla est. <hi>Hermae Past.</hi> 2. 7.

                  <hi>we</hi> are bound to overcome them also, and to be <hi>more than Conquerours through him that loved us,</hi> Rom. 8. 37.

                  </note> so you will certainly not be able to keep them: But know, that thro' Christ who <hi>now</hi> strengthens you, you may make them <note n="†" place="margin">Ponite ergo vobis qui vacui &amp; leves estis in fide, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Deum vestrum &amp; in corde habete; &amp; intelligetis quia nihil facilius est his mandatis, neque dulcius, neque mansuetius neque Sanctius. <hi>Idem Ibid.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. These are the Qualifications, with which a Person ought to come to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi> that he may receive it with Advantage and Profit.

               <p n="1">1. AND First, <hi>Persuade your self of the necessity of Persevering in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Practice of Religion and Virtue, from this Period.</hi> The <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> thought themselves absolutely obliged, to live in the constant Practice of all Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Virtue, from the time of their Baptism to their Death: And if <hi>we</hi> have taken upon our selves the <hi>same</hi> Baptismal Vow; if <hi>We</hi> have entred into the <hi>same</hi> Profession of Religion; <hi>We</hi> ought also from that time forward to have the <hi>same</hi> Apprehensions. Think not that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a <hi>Publick and Solemn Profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> will be of any advantage to you, unless the following part of your Life be <hi>suitable to</hi> and <hi>worthy of</hi> that Profession. Think not that your present Zeal and warmth of Devotion will stand you in any stead, unless it work in you such a lasting Disposition of Mind, as will afterwards, when Temptation and Trial shall succeed, preserve you stedfast and unmoveable in the performance of your Duty.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:97776:83"/>2. The Christian Life is a Spiritual <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,</hi> wherein we must fight <hi>against</hi> the <hi>Temptations</hi> of <hi>this</hi> World, <hi>for</hi> the <hi>Glories</hi> of <hi>the other;</hi> and the Reward is promised, not to him that shall <hi>fight,</hi> but to him that shall <hi>overcome.</hi> We are told, that many should embrace the Doctrine of Christ, and <hi>receive</hi> his <hi>Word</hi> even <hi>with joy;</hi> but because <hi>in time of Temptation</hi> they would <hi>fall away,</hi> it should profit them nothing to have once been Believers. This whole Life, is a state of Trial and Probation; and however painfully we have laboured, yet if we leave off before our Work be done, we must lose our Reward. <hi>They that run in a race,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>run</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor 9. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>all;</hi> but 'tis not they that <hi>rûn,</hi> but they that <hi>continue</hi> to run without fainting to the end, that shall obtain the Crown. Men are exceeding apt to deceive themselves with an imagination, that some warm fits of Devotion, the doing now and then a work of Charity, and the abstaining from Sin for some time, when perhaps the Temptation is less violent than ordinary, will be look'd upon as the running the Christian Race: But let no Man deceive himself with vain Imaginations: This is indeed <hi>running,</hi> but not so as to <hi>obtain;</hi> this is indeed <hi>fighting,</hi> but not so as to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi> but to <hi>be overcome.</hi> 'Tis not the <hi>struggling</hi> with Sin, or the <hi>interrupting</hi> a wicked Life by some short lived Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

that will intitle us to a Crown of Righteousness; but we <hi>must overcome,</hi> and we must <hi>evidence</hi> our Victory by a steady course of Piety, or our Labour will prove to be in vain.</p>

Terrible are the Threatnings which the Scripture makes to those, who having known their Duty and begun to obey it, shall again return to a course of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness. <hi>If after they have escaped the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the World through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they shall be again intangled therein and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: For it had been better for them not to have known the way of Righteousness, than after they have known it, to turn from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commandment delivered unto them,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 20. <hi>I will therefore put you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, though you once knew this, how that the Lord having saved the People out of the Land of Egypt, afterwards destroyed them that believed not: And the Angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he hath reserved in everlasting Chains under darkness, unto the Judgment of the great Day,</hi> Jude 5, &amp; 6. <hi>Lest there be any Fornicator or profane Person, as Esau, who for one morsel of Meat sold his birth-right; for ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the Blessing, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, for he found no place of Repentance though he sought it carefully with tears,</hi> Heb. 12. 16. <hi>If we sin wilfully, after we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the knowledge of the Truth, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth no more Sacrifice for Sins, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation, which shall devour the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,</hi>

Heb. 10. 26. <hi>It is impossible for those who were once enlightned, and have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come, if they shall fall away, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new them again unto Repentance; seeing they crucifie to themselves the Son of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh, and put him to an open shame,</hi> Heb. 6. 4. The meaning of all which Places is plainly this, not indeed that 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to obtain Forgiveness, but that there is no more <hi>Baptism,</hi> no more <hi>Baptismal Remission;</hi> and that therefore if Men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the clear knowledge of their Duty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse any more into a state of gross Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, they cannot be forgiven but upon such a <hi>great and active Repentance,</hi> as 'tis <hi>exceeding difficult</hi> to renew such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons unto.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of Innocence and an early Piety.</head>
               <p n="1">1. SEcondly, <hi>Consider the inestimable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Innocence, and of an early Piety.</hi> Innocence is a Jewel which no Man understands the value of, and no Man knows what he does when he first parts with it. When a Man is first beaten from his good Resolutions, and seduced by the Temptations of Sin and Folly, he is then driven from his best <hi>strong-hold;</hi> his <hi>Strength,</hi> his <hi>Courage,</hi> his <hi>Assistance</hi> is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; and <hi>when</hi> or <hi>how far</hi> he shall be able to recover them, he cannot tell. When a Man is first inticed to sin wilfully and against knowledge, he makes Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of a <hi>good Conscience,</hi> and parts with that <hi>Peace of Mind,</hi> which how far he shall ever be able to recover, he cannot know. When a Man is first vanquish'd by the Enemies of his Salvation, the World, the Flesh, or the Devil; and prefers any Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or any Interest to his Duty; he then forfeits his Title to the <hi>Crown</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to those who shall <hi>overcome;</hi> and how far his Endeavours will afterwards be accepted, he cannot tell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. While a Person who has entered early into the Profession of Religion, is


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97776:87"/>
yet innocent and uncorrupted with Vice; he begins his Christian Warfare with <hi>firm and unbroken Resolutions,</hi> with a <hi>free and undistracted Mind,</hi> and with the <hi>certain As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of God's Holy Spirit:</hi> But when once he has forfeited this happy Innocence, and is fallen from his first Love; his <hi>Zeal for Virtue</hi> grows less <hi>strict,</hi> and his <hi>hatred against Vice</hi> less <hi>severe;</hi> his <hi>Resolutions</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>weaker and more inconstant,</hi> his <hi>Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons stronger,</hi> and his <hi>Mind more unsettled;</hi> and the <hi>Grace</hi> of God is proportionably <hi>withdrawn</hi> from him; so that it becomes much more difficult to <hi>recover</hi> his first State, than it had been to <hi>preserve</hi> it. Think not therefore, when first Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions offer themselves, that you can <hi>now</hi> yield to them, and <hi>afterwards</hi> return to your Duty: (For if your Resolutions when <hi>firmest</hi> are not able to resist, much less will they do it when they have once been <hi>broken;</hi> if you cannot withstand the temptations of Vice while it is <hi>yet at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> much less will you be able to do it when it has <hi>interested your Passions and insinuated it self into your Affections;</hi> if you cannot maintain your Ground while the Spirit of God is <hi>ready constantly</hi> to assist you, much less will you do it when he has <hi>withdrawn himself</hi> from you:) But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve bravely <hi>now, while it is called to Day,</hi> while you have Time and may do it with the greatest Advantages, to make your


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97776:87"/>
Religion <hi>easie,</hi> and your Happiness <hi>secure;</hi> set out with a mighty Resolution in the Christian Race, and <hi>press forward toward the Mark of the Prize of the high Calling:</hi> Despise all the Temptations of the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Flesh;</hi> and resist the <hi>Devil,</hi> and he will flee from you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, while one who has early enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Profession of Religion, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his Integrity, and stands firm against all the Temptations of Sin and Satan; he carries with him not only a <hi>quiet Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and an <hi>undisturbed Mind,</hi> but such a full <hi>Assurance</hi> and <hi>Joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> as inables him to perform his Duty not only <hi>willingly but cheerfully,</hi> and to despise all the Temptations of this present World as <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Nothing:</hi> But when once he has made Shipwrack of a good Conscience, and is overcome by the Temptations of the World and the Devil, to sin in any gross and notorious Instances; then <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Doubts, Anxieties</hi> and <hi>Scruples,</hi> must be his Portion; and though by Repentance he may recover a <hi>well grounded Hope,</hi> and through the Mercy of God a <hi>certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi> of Pardon, yet not easily <hi>the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and joy</hi> of Innocence. Think not therefore, when you are tempted by Sin, that you may <hi>now</hi> yield to its Solicitations, and <hi>afterwards</hi> by Repentance recover your first peace and quiet of Conscience: (For when once the support of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:97776:88"/>
is lost, <hi>Obedience</hi> will be much more difficult; and <hi>Peace</hi> will not return, but after much <hi>Labour</hi> and many <hi>Fears,</hi> after great <hi>Sorrow</hi> and long <hi>Doubts:</hi> But <hi>resolve now</hi> to resist the <hi>very first</hi> Motions of Sin; and <hi>be convinced</hi> there is no <hi>Pleasure</hi> but in a good Conscience, nor any <hi>Joy</hi> but in the Obedience of God's Commands.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Lastly, While one who has entered betimes into the Profession of Religion, continues resolutely to preserve his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and conquers all the Temptations of Sin; he has a certain Title to that <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding weight of Glory,</hi> that <hi>Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> which God has laid up for those who shall <hi>keep the Faith</hi> and <hi>patiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in well-doing:</hi> But when once he <hi>turns from the holy Commandment delivered unto him,</hi> and is overcome by the intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and allurements of Sin, he forfeits his Title to that Crown of Glory; and <hi>to what degree</hi> his after-endeavours will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him, he cannot tell. That Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance will procure him <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Pardon,</hi> is certain; but to recover the <hi>Reward</hi> and the <hi>Crown</hi> of Innocence, it must be <hi>very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>very effectual.</hi> All that a <hi>late Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> can hope for, is to obtain <hi>forgiveness</hi> and be admitted to Heaven: The <hi>bright Crowns</hi> will be reserved for those, who have <hi>fought the good Fight</hi> and <hi>overcome the World.</hi> Think not therefore, when you are assaulted by Temptation, that you


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:97776:88"/>
may <hi>now</hi> enjoy the <hi>Pleasures of Sin,</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward</hi> by Repentance attain to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Virtue</hi> also: (For though God hath indeed promised that those who are <hi>hired into the Vineyard at the eleventh hour,</hi> that is, those who are late instructed in the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Christ,</hi> or in <hi>the knowledge of their Duty,</hi> shall have the same Reward with those who have <hi>born the burden and heat of the Day;</hi> yet he has no where promised that those who stand idle <hi>in</hi> the Vineyard till the 11th Hour, that is, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they <hi>believe the Gospel</hi> and <hi>know their Duty,</hi> yet defer their Repentance to the last, shall receive likewise the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:) But resolve <hi>now,</hi> as a faithful Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Christ, to resist resolutely the Temptations of the <hi>Devil,</hi> to despise the Glory and Vanity of the <hi>World,</hi> to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Pleasures and Deceits of <hi>Sense;</hi> and then <hi>your Labour will</hi> be sure <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>in vain in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. 'Tis to those who <hi>thus</hi> overcome, that those great and glorious Promises in the <hi>New Testament</hi> are made: <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 7. <hi>He that overcometh, shall inherit all things;</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 3 21. <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne; even as I also over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and am set down with my Father in his Throne:</hi> and the like. <hi>He that overcometh;</hi> that is, He that having embraced the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Christ, and being firmly persuaded of the Truth of his Religion, continues


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97776:89"/>
stedfast in this <hi>Faith</hi> and in the <hi>Obedience</hi> thereof, in spight of all the Temptations of Sin and Satan to the contrary. In the Primitive Times, the great Temptation with which Christians were assaulted, was Persecution; by which they were tempted to deny their Saviour, and to renounce that Faith which they had once embraced, by returning again to the Idolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Heathen Gods: This was their peculiar Conflict and Trial; and he that in that great Trial resisted unto Blood, chusing rather to endure the most exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site Torments, and to die the most cruel Death, than to deny Christ, was said in a peculiar and more emphatical Sense to have <hi>overcome:</hi> And to those Persons we must understand these great Promises, to be <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily</hi> and more <hi>immediately</hi> made. But that they proportionably belong to all <hi>other</hi> Christians also, who in the midst of any <hi>other</hi> Temptations shall <hi>keep the Works</hi> of Christ, and victoriously persevere in their Integrity to the end, is evident: For the Promise is not made to him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh, for that reason because 'tis this or that particular Temptation that he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes; but because he maintains his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritry inviolable to the last, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the force of any Temptation to the contrary. And perhaps if we consider the Matter closely, 'tis not easie to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which is more difficult and shews a


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97776:89"/>
greater constancy of Mind, to <hi>die</hi> for the sake of Christ, or to <hi>live</hi> in the constant contempt of all the Pleasures and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Life; to <hi>part</hi> actually with all our temporal Goods for the Name of Christ, or to <hi>keep</hi> them with such indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency as if we enjoyed them not. Those Persons therefore who entring early into the Profession of Religion, when their temptations to Sin were most numerous and most powerful, continued stedfast in the Love of God and of Virtue, unmoved amidst the perpetual <hi>Allurements of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> the dazling <hi>Vanities of worldly Glory,</hi> and the <hi>manifold Deceitfulness</hi> of Riches; were by the Ancients looked upon with <note n="*" place="margin">Quicunque permanse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint sicut infantes, non <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               <p n="1">1. THirdly, <hi>Resolve to make Religion the main Scope of all your Actions, and the principal Business of your Life.</hi> One great reason, why Religion, which was the <hi>reigning</hi> Principle that <hi>wholly governed</hi> the Lives of the Primitive Christians, has now so <hi>little</hi> influence upon the Actions of Men; is because those Holy Men <hi>sought first the Kingdom of God and his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>


                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:97776:91"/>
and relied upon the Providence of God to have <hi>all</hi> other <hi>things added unto</hi> them; whereas now, Men make Religion not their <hi>first,</hi> but their <hi>last</hi> care; and while their whole <hi>Hearts and Affections</hi> are set upon the things of this present World, they think themselves sufficiently Religious if they spend but some <hi>small Portions of their time</hi> in the outward and Ceremonious Acts of Religion. But if Religion be the same <hi>now,</hi> that it was in the times of the <hi>Primitive Christians;</hi> if the Happiness proposed to <hi>us,</hi> be the same for which <hi>they</hi> so painfully contended; if <hi>our</hi> Obligations, (excepting perhaps some few particular Cases,) be the same with <hi>theirs;</hi> this <hi>slight, careless</hi> and <hi>superficial</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, will not serve our turn. He that will obtain that Crown of Immortality, which God has promised to those who Love and Obey him, must be <hi>effectually</hi> and <hi>Substantially</hi> Religious in the <hi>main</hi> Course of his Life; and he that will be so <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>sincerely</hi> Religious, must make that Religion his <hi>principal</hi> and his <hi>first</hi> Care.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By making Religion the <hi>Principal Care and Study</hi> of our Lives, I do not mean that Men should withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from their Business and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the World, to spend their time anxiously in <hi>Reading, Praying, Meditating</hi> &amp; the like: I hese things are not the <hi>whole,</hi> nor


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97776:91"/>
the <hi>principal part</hi> of Religion; and it is an <hi>Antient</hi> and <hi>Notorious</hi> Errour, to think that Men can become more truly Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by the continued Exercises of a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Retirement,</hi> than by living Soberly, Righteously, and Godlily <hi>in the World.</hi> The Life and Substance of Religion, is to <hi>have our Minds habitually possessed with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest Veneration of the Divine Majesty, and with a desire of expressing at all proper oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, our Devotion to him, and our Zeal for his Honour;</hi> To <hi>endeavour constantly in the whole Course of our Lives, to promote the good and the happiness of all Men;</hi> and to <hi>be Temperate in the use of all earthly Enjoyments, as those who expect their Happiness, not in this World, but in the next.</hi> This is the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of true Religion; And <hi>These</hi> things a Man may make his <hi>principal,</hi> nay, even his <hi>whole</hi> Care, without any way <hi>neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or in the least <hi>withdrawing</hi> himself from his Secular and Worldly Business. There is no Imployment, wherein a Man may not be always doing something for the <hi>honour of God,</hi> for the <hi>good of Men,</hi> or for the <hi>Improvement of the Virtues of his own Mind:</hi> There is no Business, wherein a Man may not make it his <hi>main</hi> Care, to act always like a good Man and a Christian: There is no state of Life, wherein a Man may not keep a constant Eye upon a future State; and so use the things of this <hi>present World,</hi> as that the

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And to make Religion <hi>thus far</hi> the principal Business of our Lives, is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and indispensably necessary. No Man <hi>can</hi> overcome the Temptations of the Word; No Man <hi>can</hi> be truly and effectually Religious; unless he <hi>stedfastly</hi> proposes to himself one great Design of his Life, and indeavours to Act always <hi>regularly</hi> upon that Design. He must <note n="*" place="margin">Quoties quid fugiendum sit, aut quid petendum, voles scire; ad summum bonum, &amp; <hi>propositum totius vitae</hi> respice.

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Contempt of the World.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FOurthly, <hi>Endeavour to get above all the Desires of this present World.</hi> This is the <hi>hardest</hi> Lesson in Religion, but withal the most <hi>necessary</hi> and the most <hi>use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> All Wickedness proceeds from the immoderate desire of some temporal Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or other; and the <hi>Love of the World</hi> is most immediately <hi>the Root of all Evil.</hi> No Man sins, but when he is seduced by an over-fond desire of some Honour, Profit, or Pleasure; and no Man can be sure of preserving his Innocence, so long as he is inslaved to and under the Dominion of any of these Desires. The way therefore to <hi>lay the Ax to the Root of the Tree,</hi> and to remove the Foundation and first Cause of our Misery; is to <hi>get above</hi> all the Desires of these Transitory Enjoyments, and to keep them perfectly in subjection and under the command of Reason: We must be able to contemn these things, even where they are <hi>Innocent;</hi> and then we may be secure that they shall never be able, to seduce and intice us into any thing that is <hi>sinful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Now the means by which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion teaches us to do this, is not


<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97776:93"/>
(as I have already said) by retiring and withdrawing our selves from the World, to neglect all Business and lay aside all Secular Cares; but by fixing our Thoughts stedfastly upon that future State which the Gospel has clearly discovered to us, to fill our Minds with such strong and vigorous Ideas of the Happiness of the <hi>next World,</hi> as will in any state of Life, beget and preserve in us a settled Contempt of all the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The first and lowest degree of this <hi>Contempt of the World,</hi> is a <hi>Resolution not to purchase any of its Injoyments with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of any great and known sin.</hi> This is the very lowest degree of Sincerity; and the least that any one, who pretends at all to be a Christian, can resolve with himself to do for the sake of God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. He that to purchase any Honour or Profit, will not scruple to make use of downright Fraud, or of any Means which he himself knows and is convinced to be Unlawful; He that to gratifie any sensual Appetite, and to injoy a present Pleasure, will venture directly to break a positive and express Command; such a one bids open Defiance to God and Virtue, and can hardly impose upon himself with any vain Imaginations of his being Religious.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The next degree of this <hi>Contempt of the World,</hi> is a <hi>Willingness to part with all things for the sake of Christ, when we cannot</hi>


                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:97776:93"/>
                  <hi>keep them together with our Religion.</hi> This also our Saviour absolutely requires of them that will be his Disciples. <hi>If any Man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren and Sisters, yea, and his own Life also, he cannot be my Disciple; And whosoever doth not bear his Cross, and come after me, cannot be my Disciple,</hi> Luke 14. 26, 27. 'Tis true, this is more peculiarly adapted to those early times of the Gospel, when 'twas impossible for a Man to embrace the Doctrine of Christ, and profess himself his Disciple, but he must immediately forsake all that he had in the World, and become poor in the most literal sense for Christ's sake: But certainly it <hi>thus far</hi> obliges Christians at all times, and even when God does not call them to suffering and parting with all for his sake, that they ought to have such an indifferency for the things of this World, as to be always in a readiness to part with whatever shall come in Competition with their Duty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But there is yet another degree of this <hi>Contempt of the World,</hi> which though less considered, is yet of more universal and more constant obligation: And that is, that <hi>We be sparing and temperate in the use even of Lawful and Innocent Enjoyments, as those who expect their Portion not in the Pleasures of this World, but in the Happiness of the next.</hi> This is the proper and peculiar Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue


<pb n="172" facs="tcp:97776:94"/>
of the Christian Religion; and indeed the only true Rule of <hi>Temperance.</hi> To give Men a full Liberty of satisfying to the utmost all their sensual Appetites in all instances not directly forbidden, and to set their Hearts upon the Injoyment of all worldly Pleasures, as far as they can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly within the Limits of Innocence, is to allow Men a Liberty which Experience shews they cannot bear, and which will certainly seduce them into the Borders of sin: On the other hand, to restrain Men from injoying the good things of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent World any further than is strictly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to preserve their Life and Health, is to lay a snare on the Consciences of men, and to tie 'em up to what God and Nature has not tied them. The only true measure therefore of Christian <hi>Temperance,</hi> is that we so govern our selves with respect to the Injoyments of this present Life, as becomes those who profess to be <hi>followers of Christ,</hi> and <hi>Candidates for Heaven;</hi> who look upon <hi>this World</hi> only as a State of Labour and Trial, but expect their Portion and their Happiness in <hi>the World to come:</hi> That is, that we so use these <hi>present good things,</hi> as to preserve our selves always in the <hi>Disposition fittest for the Performance of our Duty;</hi> to keep the <hi>flesh</hi> always in Subjection to the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and to maintain constantly that <hi>Temper of Mind,</hi> which may prepare and fit us for the <hi>Injoyment of God,</hi> and for the <hi>Happiness of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:97776:94"/>6. The Design of the Christian Religion is to draw off Mens Affections from things earthly and sensible, and to fix them on Nobler and Spiritual Objects: It gives us the most refined Precepts exemplified in the Life of our Saviour, for our Rule to walk by; and sets before us as the Reward of our Obedience, the Happiness of that Place, where we <hi>shall be like to God,</hi> because we <hi>shall see him as he is.</hi> The first thing therefore that our Saviour requires, of them that will be <hi>his</hi> Disciples; is <hi>so</hi> to wean themselves from this <hi>present World,</hi> as to be always prepared for the more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Happiness of that which is <hi>to come.</hi> The first thing that the Christian Religion teaches us; is <hi>so</hi> to look beyond this World in the main Scope of our Lives, and to have so slight an esteem <hi>for,</hi> and be so little immersed <hi>in,</hi> all earthly Injoyments; as to have our Hearts fixed always there, where we expect our Treasure. It teaches us to look upon the good things of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent World, as Talents committed to our Charge; for the doing what good we can in <hi>the present State,</hi> and thereby purchasing to our selves a Treasure incorruptible <hi>in the future.</hi> It teaches us to <hi>set our Affections</hi> wholly <hi>on things above;</hi> and to have <hi>our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation</hi> always <hi>in Heaven.</hi> It teaches us to <hi>love God,</hi> as the Supream and Only Good; and to make it the Business and the Pleasure of our Life, to <hi>Advance his Glory and to promote his Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:97776:95"/>7. This is the Disposition of Mind, which the Christian Religion requires of all its Professors. And that this Disposition of Mind cannot otherwise be attained and preserved, than <hi>by</hi> working our selves up to a great contempt of the World; <hi>by</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very temperate in the enjoyment of earthly Pleasures; and <hi>by</hi> withdrawing our Affections from the desires of them; is evident. No Man who <hi>hath this Worlds Goods,</hi> can cheerfully and bountifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow them to the <hi>Glory of God</hi> and to the <hi>Good of Men;</hi> so long as he retains an over-fond Affection for the <hi>splendour</hi> of the World, and cannot deny himself in any of its <hi>Pleasures.</hi> No Man can set his <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> on things <hi>above,</hi> while he places his <hi>Happiness</hi> in things here <hi>below;</hi> nor have his <hi>Conversation</hi> and his <hi>Citizenship</hi> in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> while his <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Desires</hi> are fix'd on <hi>Earth.</hi> In a word, no Man can love <hi>God</hi> as the Supreme and only Good, and make <hi>Religion</hi> heartily the usiness of his Life; while his Affections are fondly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened on the <hi>Pleasures of Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Gratifications</hi> of <hi>Sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. He that notwithstanding his Belief of the Gospel, does yet retain such a Love for the World, as that he cannot persuade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self without great regret to part with any present Gratification; and is solicitous, not to be as Religious and to do as much good as he can, but to live as sensually, and to


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97776:95"/>
enjoy as much Pleasure, as he thinks pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly consistent with the hopes of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; such a ones divided Affections and unmortified Desires, will certainly be too strong for the Governance of his Reason; and his unwillingness to part with <hi>the Pleasures</hi> of <hi>this Life,</hi> will be in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to deprive him of <hi>the Happiness</hi> of the <hi>next. No Servant can serve two Masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the other; ye cannot serve God and Mammon,</hi> Luke 16. 13. <hi>The carnal,</hi> or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual <hi>Mind,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be,</hi> Rom. 8. 7. And in the 1st Epistle of St. <hi>John,</hi> ch. 2. ver. 15. <hi>If any Man love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him.</hi> The avoiding eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Misery, and acquiring endless Bliss, is not so easie and trivial a matter, as to be the Purchase of a few faint Wishes, the Work of a Mind distracted, and as it were wholly taken up with other Cares: He that hath proposed to us this glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, has yet proposed it upon such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as that we think it worth our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for: He indispensably requires, that we fix our Affections upon heavenly things; and though we may, and ought to make use of the Blessings of this World thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, as Accommodations in our Journey; yet that in the whole Course of our Lives


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97776:96"/>
the general Design of our Actions be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to this great End. If therefore we suffer other things so to interpose, as to steal away our Hearts and Affections; we cannot possibly keep up this Disposition. Man's Nature and Operations are finite; and what time and attention he bestows on one thing, must necessarily be subracted from another. If then the Vanities of this World entertain and busie us, they must unavoidably interrupt our attendance on the <hi>one thing necessary;</hi> and when we begin to look upon these <hi>deceitful things</hi> as our proper Happiness, our esteem will in proportion decrease to those which <hi>real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> are so. Hence the <hi>Cares of the World,</hi> the <hi>Deceitfulness of Riches,</hi> and the <hi>Pleasures of this Life,</hi> are said to <hi>choke the Word, and it becometh unfruitful,</hi> Matth. 13. 22. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 14. And St <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9. That <hi>they who will be rich,</hi> that is, they whose Desires are eagerly bent upon the good things of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Life, <hi>fall into Temptation and a Snare, and into many foolish and hurtful Lusts, which drown Men in Destruction and Perdition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. And that this over-fond Love of the present World, this solicitous Desire after Riches and Pleasure, is inconsistent with that Disposition of Mind which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion requires; seems to be the true and principal Scope of several of our Saviour's <hi>Parables</hi> to demonstrate. The


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97776:96"/>
Parable of the <hi>rich Man,</hi> Luke 16. is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently intended to this purpose. He is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to have been <hi>clothed in Purple and fine Linnen,</hi> and to have <hi>fared sumptuously every day;</hi> and when <hi>in Hell he lift up his Eyes and saw Abraham afar off,</hi> and <hi>cried</hi> to him to <hi>have Mercy upon</hi> him, <hi>and</hi> to <hi>send Lazarus that he</hi> might <hi>dip the tip of his Finger in Water, and cool</hi> his <hi>Tongue;</hi> the Answer he received was this; <hi>Son, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou in thy life-time receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted, and thou art tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</hi> 'Tis not said that he had spent his Substance in <hi>Rioting</hi> and <hi>Drunkenness;</hi> 'tis not said that he had deserved this Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for his <hi>Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi> But only that he had lived <hi>delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and fared <hi>sumptuously;</hi> that he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready <hi>received his good things;</hi> (that is, that he had received a plentiful share of the good things of this present Life, and that he had received and valued them as his Portion and his Happiness;) and that therefore now there remained nothing for him, but to be <hi>tormented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. That the design of this Parable is not meerly to condemn <hi>Rioting</hi> and <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy, Drunkenness</hi> and <hi>Excess,</hi> is evident. For had <hi>that</hi> only been the design of it, the rich Man would have been<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> plainly described to have been guilty of those Vices. But since <hi>our Saviour</hi> does not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:97776:97"/>
lay those things to his Charge, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must <hi>we</hi> do it. The Parable says, he was <hi>clothed in Purple and fine Linnen, and fared sumptuously every day:</hi> And as his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World might be, he may fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be supposed to do so without the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Excess.</hi> As God has placed Men in different Stations in the World, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly made very different distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the good things of this Life amongst them; so it cannot be denied but that these good things may be made use of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to every Man's Quality and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. It cannot therefore be certainly collected from the rich Man's faring sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously, that he wasted his Substance in <hi>riotous living,</hi> as the <hi>Prodigal</hi> is described to have done in the foregoing Chapter; for he would certainly in this Place have been directly accused of doing so, if the Parable had been levelled against nothing less than <hi>Rioting</hi> and <hi>Excess.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Again, that the Design of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is not meerly to condemn <hi>Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness</hi> and <hi>Cruelty,</hi> is also evident. For though it represents the <hi>rich Man</hi> on the one hand <hi>clothed in Purple and fine Linnen, and faring sumptuously every day;</hi> and on the other hand the <hi>poor Man lying at his Gate full of sores, and desiring to be fed with the Crums that fell from the rich Man's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> yet it contains only this Description of the poor Man's Condition in Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97776:97"/>
to that of the rich Man, without taking any notice at all of their Behaviour one to another. Though therefore it may justly be supposed, that our Saviour designed to hint to us, that the poor Man did not meet with that Comfort and Relief, which might reasonably be expected in a Place where there was such plenty and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of all things; and that this did mightily increase the rich Man's Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; yet this is not the thing that is <hi>now</hi> laid to his Charge, and therefore is not the <hi>main</hi> Design of the Parable. Parables are certain familiar ways of representing things to the Capacity of the Vulgar, by easie and continued Similitudes; and the close of the Similitude always shows the <hi>principal</hi> Scope of the Parable; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in most of our Saviour's Discourses to the <hi>Jews.</hi> Had our Saviour therefore in this Parable chiefly designed to shew the evil of Uncharitableness, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation that attends uncharitable Men, he would (when he had represented the rich Man crying out to <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>have Mercy upon him,</hi> and begging that he would send <hi>Lazarus</hi> that he might <hi>dip the tip of his Finger in Water, and cool</hi> his <hi>Tongue,</hi>) he would here, I say, have introduced the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch charging him with his Uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness, as the cause of his being cast into that place of torment. It would have been told him, that since when he lived in


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97776:98"/>
Ease and Plenty, and in the abundant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all the good things of this Life, <hi>he</hi> had had no regard to the then miserable Estate of this <hi>poor Man;</hi> he had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to expect, now that the Scale was turned, and himself fallen into a state of Misery, that the <hi>poor Man</hi> should leave that place of Happiness which is figured to us by <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom, to come and quench the violence of the Flame that tormented <hi>him.</hi> He would have been told that 'twas but just, that since he had <hi>shewed</hi> no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, none should be <hi>shewn</hi> to him; and that he should <hi>receive</hi> no Relief from the poor Man after Death, to whom he had <hi>given</hi> none when he was alive. But instead of all this, we find only that short Reply; <hi>Son, remember that thou in thy life time receivedst thy good things,</hi> therefore <hi>now thou art tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. It remains therefore, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for which this rich Man is represented as condemned to that place of torment, is because he had in his life time received his Portion of good things; that is, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had <hi>received</hi> the Blessings of this World, but because he had received and used them <hi>as his Portion and his Happiness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> He had a large and plentiful Estate; and he spent it in Jollity and Splendour. He was <hi>clothed in Purple and fine Linnen;</hi> and he <hi>fared sumptuously every day.</hi> He denied himself nothing, that tended to the Ease


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97776:98"/>
and Pleasure of his <hi>own</hi> Life; or that could make him look splendid in the Eyes of <hi>others.</hi> Hereupon he <hi>accounted himself a happy Man;</hi> and <hi>blessed himself in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his Riches.</hi> He look'd on them not as Talents committed to him by God, to be employed for the <hi>doing good in his Generation;</hi> but as his <hi>own</hi> Portion, that he might live in Ease and Plenty, and that <hi>his Heart might chear him in the days of his Life.</hi> His <hi>Treasure</hi> therefore was upon Earth; and his <hi>Heart and Affections,</hi> were there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. He set up his Rest here; and was so wholly taken up with the splendour and gaiety of <hi>this</hi> World, that he had no time to think upon <hi>another;</hi> till he found by woful Experience that he <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> settled his Affections upon a wrong Object, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen those things for his Portion and his Happiness which were not to be of equal duration with himself. Thus the Design of this <hi>Parable</hi> seems plainly to be this; to condemn a <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> a <hi>delicate</hi> and <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous</hi> Life: And to show, that for those who have a plentiful share of earthly Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, to make it their main Design to live in Ease and Pleasure, in Gaiety and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour with them; to set their Hearts and Affections upon them; to esteem them as their good things, and to place their Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness in them; is inconsistent with that temper and disposition of Mind, which the Christian Religion requires in those, who


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97776:99"/>
expect their Portion in the Spiritual Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of the World to come. And to this Sense we must understand those Sayings of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 25. <hi>Wo unto you that are full, for ye shall hunger; wo unto you that laugh now, for ye shall mourn and weep:</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>Wo unto you that are rich, for ye have received your Consolation;</hi> that is, ye have received those things which ye accounted your Portion, and wherein ye placed your Happiness.</p>
               <p n="13">13. In like manner, the <hi>Parable</hi> of that other <hi>rich Man,</hi> Luke 12. whose <hi>Ground brought forth plentifully, and he thought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himself, saying, What shall I do because I have no room where to bestow my Fruits? and he said, This will I do, I will pull down my Barns and build greater, and there will I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow all my Fruits and my Goods: And I will say to my Soul, Soul thou hast much Goods laid up for many Years; take thine ease, eat, drink and be merry.</hi> This <hi>Parable,</hi> I say, seems also plainly designed against the same <hi>softness</hi> and <hi>voluptuousness</hi> of Life. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour does not describe this Man to be <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,</hi> and that he would <hi>store up</hi> all his Goods <hi>to no use;</hi> but that he would take the good of them himself, he would eat, drink and <hi>be merry:</hi> 'Tis the same word that we render elsewhere, to <hi>fare sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously:</hi> But <hi>God said unto him, Thou Fool, this night shall thy Soul be required of thee, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

though upon the prospect of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Reward.

If this seem hard to any one, let him consider, that as a Mind sensualized and wedded to earthly things, is <hi>here</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unfit for a <hi>spiritual and heavenly Life;</hi> so it must also <hi>hereafter</hi> be as utterly inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the <hi>heavenly Glory.</hi> If a Man places his Happiness in the <hi>Contemplation of God</hi> and the <hi>Exercise of Virtue</hi> here, he shall continue to enjoy it also hereafter; because <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> continue for ever: But if he places his Happiness in the Pleasures of this World, and in the Enjoyments of Sense; when these things are at an end, his Happiness must be at an end also. Mens Minds are by degrees tinctured, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the Nature of the things they are fixed upon; and in such things as they delight to dwell upon, in such things must be their Portion. Hence <hi>Tully,</hi> and after him some <hi>Christian</hi> Writers have thought, that the Souls of worldly-minded Men shall carry with them into the other State such strong Affections and Desires after the things they delighted in here, that were a sensual Person to be admitted even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Seat of the Blessed,</hi> yet should he find nothing there that could make him happy.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But hower this be (which I shall not now nicely dispute) certain it is that nothing is more <hi>reasonable,</hi> than that those who place their Happiness in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>this</hi> Life, should come short of


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97776:102"/>
the Glories of the <hi>next.</hi> We all know how short and transitory the present Life is, and the Scripture every where tells us that we are Strangers and Sojourners in the World; we are now only in a state of Trial, and travelling as it were through a strange Country to our proper Home: <hi>Whilst we are at home in the Body, we are absent from the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 6. And <hi>here we have no continuing City, but we seek one to come,</hi> Heb. 13. 14. Now therefore if Men <hi>will</hi> stop in the midst of their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and make their Inn their Home; If they <hi>will</hi> place their Happiness in those things, which God has given them only as Conveniences for their present state; what can be more reasonable, than that God should assign them their Portion in those things? Man's Soul is Spiritual and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and by the nobleness of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exalted above the Vanities of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Life; and though by being immersed in Body it be necessitated to converse with sensible and corporeal things, yet does it thirst after more pure and refined Objects; it can look beyond this World to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, and knows that its proper Happiness is by imitating the Life of God to be made partaker of his Glory: Now if Men notwithstanding all this, <hi>will</hi> take up with sensual and earthly Enjoyments; if they <hi>will</hi> clog the flight of the Soul, and stake it down to these ignoble Objects; if


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97776:103"/>
they <hi>will</hi> set their Hearts and Affections on these things, which God has given them as matter for the exercise of their Virtue; what can be more Just than that God should suffer them to satiate themselves with their beloved Pleasures, and deny them those nobler ones which they so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle esteemed? 'Tis certain the Blessings of this World are Talents committed to our Charge, which God expects we should lay out to his Glory and the Benefit of the World; and to whom he has committed many of them, of him he will require the more: He expects we should do what good we can with them; which is called in Scripture, <hi>giving out</hi> our Money <hi>to the Exchangers, that when</hi> our Lord <hi>cometh,</hi> he <hi>may receive</hi> his <hi>own</hi> with Usury: Now if instead of this, we enjoy these things whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our selves, and employ them only to the serving our own worldly Designs; what can be more reasonable, than that God should suffer them to be our Portion and Reward? The <hi>Pharisees</hi> in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's time were notoriously covetous and worldly minded, doing even their acts of Charity meerly for the praise of Men; and our Saviour repeats it no less than thrice in the <hi>Sixth</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that They <hi>had their Reward:</hi> The rich <hi>Jews</hi> also made generally no other Use of their Riches, than to live in Ease and Pleasure, in Gaiety and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; and our Saviour tells them, that they <hi>had received their Consolation.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. FIfthly, <hi>Be particularly careful to resist and avoid those Sins, to which either your Constitution, Company, or Employment, make you most in danger to be tempted.</hi> This is the great Trial of every Man's <hi>Sincerity,</hi> and of his <hi>Growth in Virtue.</hi> He that for the Love of God and the Hopes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven can mortifie and deny his most dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Lusts, can quell and keep under his most natural Passions, can resist and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly overcome those Temptations by which he is most in danger to be seduced into Sin; such a one has an infallible As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of his own Sincerity, and is very near to the Perfection of Virtue. But if there be any one Instance, wherein a Man habitually falls short of his Duty, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges a Lust, a Passion, a sinful Desire; 'tis certain, whatever other Virtues he may be indued with, that he either acts upon wrong Principles and is not sincere; or that his Resolutions are hitherto too weak and ineffectual, to intitle him to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of Religion</hi> here, or to the <hi>Assurance of Happiness</hi> hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:97776:106"/>2. There is no Man whom either the <hi>Constitution of his Body</hi> or the <hi>Temper of his Mind,</hi> the <hi>Nature of his Employment</hi> or the <hi>Humour of his Company,</hi> does not make ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to some particular sort of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations more than to any other: And in this thing it is, that those who have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Sincerity, and will not with others <hi>run into all excess of Riot,</hi> do yet make shift to deceive and impose upon themselves. They think they are indued with many good and virtuous Qualities; they hate Profaneness and professed enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Impiety; they know themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of many great Sins, which they see others continually commit: But some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, to which they are particularly temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they indulge themselves in; and the fatal Mischief is, that those Sins which they see others commit, and to which themselves are not violently tempted, seem most absurd and unreasonable, and easie to be avoided; but that to which they are themselves addicted, they think to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so small as not to be of any very evil Consequence, or so difficult to be resisted as to be allowed for among the unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Infirmities of Nature. Thus to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who have little or no Dealings in the World, the Sins of <hi>Fraud, Injustice, Deceit, Over reaching,</hi> and the like, seem very hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, base and unreasonable; while at the same time they allow themselves in

than the Death of Christ, that great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for Sin, could be repeated; and that therefore however they should sincerely repent, yet there now remained nothing<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 27.</note> more for them, but a <hi>certain fearful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation, which should devour the Adversary.</hi> But that this was a great mistake; and that God <hi>does</hi> admit even the greatest of Sinners, upon their true Repentance, to Forgiveness and Pardon, is evident both from the <hi>Nature of God,</hi> and the <hi>Design of Christianity;</hi> from the <hi>Practice of the Apostles,</hi> and from the <hi>general Sense of the Primitive Church.</hi>

The <hi>Duty of Repentance,</hi> is an <hi>entire change of Mind,</hi> and an <hi>effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Life:</hi> But the <hi>Passion of Sorrow and Remorse,</hi> is such as accursed Spirits shall be for ever tormented with in vain; and such as a dying Penitent can never be secure that this late Repentance will exceed. Many upon a Bed of Sickness, have made

all the <hi>holy Vows</hi> and <hi>pious Resolutions</hi> that could be desired; nay, perhaps there is hardly any wicked Man, who when he thinks he is about to die, does not desire and design to amend; yet how few are there of these, who if they recover, do ever make good those Vows and Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? And no late Penitent can ever be sure, that this would not be his own Case. When an habitual Sinner is <hi>in Time</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the evil of his ways, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves and endeavours in earnest to reform, while he has Life, and Health, and Strength to do it; yet seldom does he at the first trial work himself up to such an effectual and prevailing Resolution against his Sin, as to change his whole course of Life in an instant, and <hi>at once</hi> deliver himself <hi>out of the Bondage of Corruption, into the</hi>

But, Secondly, Supposing a late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to be <hi>hearty and sincere,</hi> yet have we no <hi>positive and absolute Promise,</hi> that it shall be accepted. The plain and express Condition of the Covenant established by Christ, is a <hi>Holy Life;</hi> that is, a constant and persevering Obedience to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, (in a Gospel and Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sense allowing for humane Weaknesses and Imperfections,) from the time of our Baptism, or of our coming to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, until the end of our Lives: And the least that can possibly lay Claim to the Reward promised upon this Condition, is such a Repentance as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the <hi>actual</hi> Obedience of at least some proportianable part of a Man's Life.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:97776:118"/>5. To say that the Original Condition of the Christian Covenant is such, that a Man may safely live wickedly all his Life, and satisfie all his Lusts and Appetites to the utmost, provided he does but leave off and forsake his Sins at the last; is really to take away the necessity of a Holy Life, and to undermine the very Foundation of all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For considering on the one hand how <hi>prevailing</hi> the <hi>Custom of the World,</hi> how <hi>deceitful</hi> the <hi>Temptations of the Devil,</hi> and how <hi>powerful</hi> the <hi>Assaults of Lust and Passion</hi> are; and on the other hand how seldom <hi>sudden Death</hi> happens, and how little the <hi>Excellency of the Christian Life</hi> is understood; it will be hard, according to this Doctrine, to find Arguments suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently strong, to move Men to repent and to reform immediately: If there be no other <hi>danger,</hi> but in <hi>sudden Death;</hi> and no greater <hi>malignity in Sin,</hi> than what may be cured by an <hi>easie and short Repentance at last;</hi> most Men <hi>will</hi> venture to be wicked at present, and trust to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of growing better afterward. Though therefore God may possibly have reserves of Mercy, which <hi>in event</hi> he <hi>may</hi> exercise towards Men in their last extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; yet <hi>Originally</hi> 'tis certain the Gospel Covenant gives no assurance of Comfort, but either to a <hi>constant and persevering Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,</hi> or to a <hi>Repentance evidenced by actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally renewed Obedience.</hi>

               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:97776:119"/>6. At Baptism indeed, or when ever we first come to the knowledge of the Truth, all past sins are so entirely forgiven and wash'd away by the Blood of Christ, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, though it has no time to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it self in the Fruits of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, is without all Controversie available to Salvation: But when Men who have by Baptism Covenanted solemnly with God for a Holy Life, and confirmed that Covenant by other repeated Promises and Resolutions, shall yet wilfully live in Sin; and notwithstanding the express Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of our Saviour and his Apostles, that they who do so <hi>shall not inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> notwithstanding the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Exhortations and Warnings of God's Ministers; and notwithstanding the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Reproaches of their own Consciences, continue obstinately to do so; such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have no reason in the World to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that God will at last accept their <hi>late, unactive,</hi> and <hi>ineffectual</hi> Repentance. The <hi>penitent Thief</hi> was received by our Saviour, as any other Infidel undoubtedly may be, who towards the end of his Life is convinced of the Truth of the Christian Religion, and heartily embraces it; but there is nothing like a Promise in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that the <hi>unactive</hi> Repentance of a <hi>Christian,</hi> who has lived all his Life in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Wickedness, shall be accepted at the Hour of Death: The <hi>Labourers</hi> who

were hired into the <hi>Vineyard</hi> at the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Hour, received indeed the same Wages with them that had born the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and heat of the Day; but our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our has no where promised, that baptized and professed Christians, who are hired into the Vineyard in the Morning, if <hi>they</hi> riot away all the Day in Idleness and Wickedness, shall at Night be accepted for their professing their Sorrow that they have not wrought.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>SEcondly,</hi> True Repentance ought to be very <hi>Great;</hi> that is, he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents ought to affect his Mind with such a <hi>deep Sorrow</hi> and <hi>hatred</hi> of Sin, as will put him upon those afflictive Duties of <hi>Fasting,</hi>

                  <hi>Watching, Praying, Humiliation, Liberal Alms,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the Reason of this is; First, Because in many Cases Repentance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwise be evidenced to be real and sincere. True Repentance is an <hi>effectual change of Mind,</hi> and an <hi>actual amendment of</hi> Life: And as a bare <hi>change of Mind</hi> is not an acceptable Repentance, unless it <hi>produces</hi> an actual <hi>amendment of Life;</hi> so neither is a bare <hi>amendment of Life,</hi> unless it <hi>proceeds</hi> from a real <hi>change of Mind.</hi> There are many Cases, wherein a Man may leave off committing an habitual Sin, and yet not truly repent of it: Some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental change of the Circumstances of his Life, some present worldly and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Interest, or some other like Cause, may restrain a Man from continuing in a customary Sin; and yet he may retain such an affection to it, such a readiness to return to it in his former Circumstances, or at least may have so little Hatred and Resolution against it, as may make him very far from a true Penitent. In all such Cases therefore, where a Man may break off a Sin upon any other Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than the Love of God and a true Sense of Religion; 'tis necessary for the evidencing the Truth of his Repentance, and for the preserving him from impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon his own Mind, that he testifie


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:97776:122"/>
his Sincerity and the Reality of his change of Mind, by some such afflictive, labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or expensive Duties, as will prove him to have indeed attained such a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious temper of Mind, as would be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to preserve him in the like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances from returning again to the same, or to any other the like wilful Sin. Were this rightly considered, Men would not so easily sin on securely <hi>at present,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon themselves with vain hopes of growing better <hi>afterward</hi> with less Pains, when some particular alteration of their Circumstances of Life, or perhaps Age and Sickness, shall have removed their Temptations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But Secondly, When amendment of Life does alone sufficiently evidence the sincerity of Repentance, (as generally and in most Cases it does,) yet ought those who have sinned to do <hi>something</hi> to testifie their Sorrow for past Offences, and to <hi>judge themselves,</hi> that they <hi>may not be</hi>

                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:97776:122"/>
they should again have returned to Sin and Folly: They ought to consider with Confusion of Face the Ingratitude of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>again</hi> committed those things, which are so hateful to God that he has threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to punish the <hi>continuance in them</hi> with everlasting Destruction, and would not <hi>once</hi> pardon them under a less Ransom than the Blood of his only Son: And these Considerations ought to work in them that <hi>Carefulness,</hi> that <hi>Indignation,</hi> that <hi>Fear,</hi> that <hi>vehement Desire,</hi> that <hi>Zeal,</hi> and<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 10.</note> that <hi>Revenge;</hi> of which (St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us) consisteth that <hi>godly Sorrow, which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Repentance to Salvation not to be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of.</hi>
