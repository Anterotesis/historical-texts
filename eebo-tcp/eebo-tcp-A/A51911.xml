            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Easter-Term, 15<hi rend="sup">o</hi> CAROLI,
In the Kings Bench.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was agreed by Justice <hi>Iones</hi> and Justice
<hi>Barckley</hi> (the Lord Chief Justice and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<hi>Crook</hi> being absent) That if the
Sheriff do arrest a man upon <hi>mesne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,</hi>
and return a <hi>Cepi corpus,</hi> and that
the Defendant was rescued; that no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
lieth against the Sheriff: But if the
party be taken upon an Execution, an
Action upon the Case lieth against him; and so is the express
Book of 16 <hi>E. 4. 2, 3. Br. Escape</hi> 37. upon which Book Justice
<hi>Iones</hi> said, That it was adjudged in this Court, as above is said.</p>
            <p>2. It was agreed by the Court, That if a man in pleading
derive an Estate from another man, and doth not shew what
Estate he had from whom he deriveth his Estate, that is a good
cause of Demurrer. And Justice <hi>Iones</hi> said, That if a man
claim a Rent by Grant out of the Land of any other man, it
is not sufficient for him to say, That such an one was seised
and <hi>concessit;</hi> but he ought to express of what Estate he was
seised: So is <hi>Dyer.</hi> But in this Case it was agreed, That the
shewing of what Estate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to be material to the
maintenance and support of the Estate which he claimeth,
otherwise it is not necessary.</p>
            <p>3. An Action upon the Case for words, was brought by one
who was Journey-man and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore-man of a Shoomakers-shop,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64899:3"/>
which was his living and livelihood, for these words, <hi>viz. It
is no matter who hath him, for he will Cut him out of doors.</hi> And
farther the Plaintiff did aver, that the common acceptance
of these words amongst Shoomakers, is, <hi>That he will begger
his Master, and make him run away:</hi> and shewed that he was
particularly endamnified by speaking of those words. And the
Court was clear of Opinion, that the Action would lie. And
these Rules were taken and agreed. For some words an Action
will lie without particular averment of any damage; as to
call a man Thief, Traytor, or the like; these are <hi>malum in se:</hi>
And some words will not bear Action without particular a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment
of some damage; as to say, <hi>Such a one kept his wife
basely, and starved her;</hi> these words of themselves will bear
no Action: but if the party of whom the words were spoken
were in election to be married to any other, and by speaking
of these words is hindred; there with such Averment they will
bear an Action. It was farther agreed, That the words ought
to be spoken to one that knows the meaning of them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they are not actionable, as in the principal Case, they
were spoken to a Shoomaker; but if they had been spoken
to any other who knew the meaning of them, it had been
all one: And therefore scandalous words which are spoken to
one in Welsh, or any other Language, which the party to
whom they are spoken doth not understand, are not actiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And it was agreed, That some words which are spoken,
although of themselves they are not actionable, yet being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent
with words which are actionable, they will bear an
Action. And therefore it was said by Justice <hi>Iones,</hi> That in
<hi>York-shire</hi> (as I remember) <hi>Straining of a Mare,</hi> is as much as
<hi>Buggering:</hi> and because these do amount to as much, with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment
they will bear Action. And all words which touch
a man in his livelihood and profession will bear Action. And
the Opinion of the Court also was, that the Averment ought
to be, That in this (and shew it specially) the Plaintiff was
damnified: and so it was agreed upon these Reasons, that the
Action did lie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64899:3"/>
4. The Opinion of the Court was upon a Judgment given
there, there ought to be two <hi>Scire facias,</hi> one against the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
the other against the Bail; but one only is sufficient in
the Common Pleas, and that two <hi>Nichils</hi> returned do amount
to <hi>Scire feci.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. There was a Contract made at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> that a ship
should sail from <hi>Yarmouth</hi> to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and there was an
Action of Debt brought upon the Contract at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and
it was adjudged that the Action would not lie: and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
was taken betwixt a particular and limited Jurisdiction,
as in this case <hi>Newcastle</hi> is; and a general Jurisdiction, as one
of the Courts at <hi>Westminster</hi> hath: for in the first Case, no
particular Jurisdiction shall hold plea of a thing which is done
<hi>in partibus transmarinis,</hi> although the Original (as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
in the principal Case) be made in <hi>England;</hi> but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in case of general Jurisdiction, as any the Courts at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister</hi>
have.</p>
            <p>6. The Custome of <hi>London</hi> is, that any man in <hi>London</hi> may
pass over, or put over his Apprentices to any other man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the City.</p>
            <div type="case">
               <head>King and Cokes Case.</head>
               <p>7. <hi>WIlliam Marshal,</hi> and other Bailiffs had an Execution <hi>(viz.</hi>
a <hi>Capias ad satisfaciend')</hi> against <hi>Coke</hi> and others; which
Bailiffs came to <hi>Coke</hi>'s house, and lay one night in his out-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
privily; and the next morning they came to his dwelling-house,
and gave him notice of the Execution; but <hi>Coke</hi> shut the
doors of his house close, so as the Bailiffs could not enter;
whereupon they brake the Glass-windows and the Hinge of
the door, endeavouring to enter: whereupon <hi>Coke</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to be gone, or he would shoot them: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
which, they did continue their ill-doing; whereupon
<hi>Coke</hi> shot <hi>Marshal</hi> one of the Bailiffs: and whether this was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64899:4"/>
Manslaughter or Murder, was the Question. And <hi>Rolls</hi> argued,
that it was not Murder for these causes. 1. Because the act of
the Bailiffs in breaking of the Glass and the Hinge of the door
was an unlawful act, and was at their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ril. Where the Kings
Officer may break the house to serve any mean Process or Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
the differences are such as are in <hi>Semaynes</hi> Case, <hi>C. 5.
part</hi> 91, 92. 1. betwixt Real and Personal Actions: In Real
Actions they may break the house to deliver seisin to him who
recovereth; contrary in Personal Actions. 2. There is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the case of the King, and of a common person;
where the King is party, in some cases his Officers may justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the breaking of a house, but not in the case of a common
person. 13 <hi>E. 4. 9. 18 E. 4. 4. 4 Rep. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9 Rep.</hi> 69. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if they could not justifie the breaking of the house at the
suit of a common person; then in the principal Case, they did
a thing which was not warranted by Law: and therefore the
killing of one of them was not Murder. But clearly, if the
Bailiffs had lawfully executed their Office, then it had been
Murder. 2. It was not Murder, because the person was in his
House, which is his Castle and defence, which is a place privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by the Law. 26. <hi>Ass. 23. 3 E.</hi> 3. 330, 305. Besides, the
party is not bound to tarry till the Bailiffs come in and beat
him. 2 <hi>H. 4. 8. 19 H. 6. 31. 34 H. 6. 16. 43 Ass. pl:</hi> 31. 3. This
Authority which is given to the Kings Officer, is given by the
Law, and if he execute it according to the Law, the Law will
protect him; but if he exceed the priviledge given him by the
Law, then all he doth is illegal, and he loseth its protection.
And he resembled it to the 6 <hi>Carpenters case. C. 6. part.</hi> Farther,
one may pretend he hath such a warrant, when he hath it not,
of purpose to rob, or do some other mischief. And it was
agreed by all the Justices, <hi>nullo contradicente,</hi> that it was not
Murder, but that it was Manslaughter; for this reason especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
because the Officer was doing an unlawful act, not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by Law; and therefore it was at his peril if he were
killed. And farther, upon this difference there ought to be
malice in fact or in Law to make Murder; but in this Case
there is none of them, for it is apparent that there was no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64899:4"/>
in fact: and there is no malice implied, for then it ought
to be where a man kills another without any provocation, or
the Minister of Justice in the due and lawful execution of his
Office, which is not our Case; for here he did an unlawful act
at the time he was killed; and therefore it was not Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but Manslaughter. There was a Case tried at the Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> which was thus: One <hi>Lovell</hi> had two
Maid-servants, and one of them without his knowledge, had
received into the house a Chare-woman, who (all being in
their beds) by her negligence let a Thief into the house, and
afterwards called out Thieves, Thieves; and afterwards <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell</hi>
came out of his Bed with a Sword in his hand, and the
Chare-woman calling to mind that she was there without his
privity or his wifes, hid her self behind the Dresser, and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell</hi>'s
wife espying her there, cried out Thieves, Thieves; for
which <hi>Lovell</hi> came and ran her into the brest with his Sword.
And the Opinion of the Justices at the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> and also of
all the Justices of the Kings Bench, was, That it was neither
Murder nor Manslaughter: Not Murder, because there was
no forethought malice; not Manslaughter, because he suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
her to be a Thief; and if she had been a Thief, then it
was clear that it was not Manslaughter.</p>
               <p>8. It was resolved in the Chancery (as the Judges of the
Kings Bench said) That where the Son is of full age, and is
ravished, that the Father shall not recover Damages, because
the Son being of full age might marry himself without the
consent of the Father: and that was the reason given, as I
conceive; and the Case was said to be Sir <hi>Francis Lees</hi> Case.</p>
               <p>9. The Book of Canons is, that the Parson may Elect one
Church-warden, and the Parishioners another.</p>
               <p>10. There can be no Surrender without the Consent of the
Reversioner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64899:5"/>
11. It was Libelled in the Ecclesiastical Court for these
words, <hi>Thou art a Drunkard, or usest to be drunk thrice a week.</hi>
And thereupon Prohibition was Prayed and Granted: and it
was said and agreed, That so it was adjudged betwixt <hi>Vinior</hi>
and <hi>Vinior,</hi> in this Court. The Case in <hi>Dyer,</hi> 254. b. where
the Presentee was refused, because he was a common haunter
of Taverns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was by Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> denied to be Law,
and so agreed by Justice <hi>Iones,</hi> the Lord Chief Justice and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<hi>Crooke</hi> being absent: But Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> was utterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Prohibition. 1. Because the Action in the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Court is only <hi>pro salute animae.</hi> And 2. Because that
Drunkenness is in their Articles, and Presentable. But Justice
<hi>Iones</hi> granted a Prohibition, and said that <hi>Linwood</hi> said well,
That if all things which are against the Law of God (or
words to that effect) should be tried in the Ecclesiastical
Court, the Jurisdiction of the Temporal Court should utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be destroyed.</p>
               <p>12. If there be an Indictment of Forcible Entry, if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that the Plaintiff had <hi>seisin</hi> at the time of the Writ
brought, there can be no Writ of Restitution; for the Statute
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith, If he Enter with Force, or keep him out with Force:
but yet in that case the King shall have his Fine. And there
was an Indictment, which was a principal Case at Bar, which
was, That the Defendant <hi>adtunc &amp; adhuc</hi> doth keep the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
forcibly, whereas the Plaintiff was in possession. And

this Case it was agreed by the Justices, That although there
be a remisness or negligence in the party who was robbed, to
pursue the Robbers, or that he did refuse to lend his Horse to
make Hue and Cry; yet this doth not take away his Action,
nor excuse the Hundred, if notice be given with as much

was robbed, doth not know the Robbers at the present time,

know them, and so he affirm, yet this doth not take away his
Action. And it was resolved also, that notice given in one
Hundred five miles from the place where he was robbed, is
sufficient; and the reason is, because that the party who is a
stranger to the Country, cannot have conusance of the nearest
place or Town. Chief Justice: That notice given at one
Town, and Hue and Cry levied at another, is good. And the

died, the Writ being not returned, and thereupon Debt was
brought against his Executors: and these exceptions were
taken. 1. That the Writ of <hi>Fieri facias</hi> was not returned, and
therefore the Sheriff should not be charged in Debt; but
otherwise if it had been returned. 2. That no Debt lieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

that it would lie against himself, yet it will not lie against

with whom all the other Judges did agree, was of Opinion,
That Debt would lie against the Sheriff where he sells goods
upon a <hi>Fieri facias,</hi> for now he is Debtor in Law, and the
Defendant discharged against the Plaintiff, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e may plead

be answerable to the Plaintiff, and he took the difference
betwixt <hi>Seisin</hi> of goods only, and where the Sheriff seiseth
and selleth them: for till Sale no Debt will lie against him.
And it was said, that Accompt will lie against him; and if
Accompt, by the same reason, Debt. As to the return of the
Writ, he said that the Sheriff is not compellable to make it, and
therefore it's nothing to the purpose; and the difference stands,
where the Sheriff returns a Jury, where not: in case of <hi>Elegit</hi>
the Writ ought to be returned, but not in case of <hi>Fieri facias,</hi>
as is 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. Clerk of the Hampers Case. Farther, I conceive
that it will lie against the Executor, and it is not like the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
which are Personal, where the action <hi>moritur cum Persona:</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:64899:9"/>
but here the goods came to the Executors, and therefore it is
reason to charge them. And it is not like the Case in <hi>Dier,
10 Eliz. 271. a.</hi> where it is said, An Action of Debt will not
lie against the Executor of a Keeper, nor an Escape, for there
the body comes not to the Executor: And this very difference
may be collected out of <hi>Dier</hi> in the place aforesaid; and the
difference will stand where there is a personal wrong done to
him, and where not. And for the Exception, That it doth not
appear whether the <hi>Fieri facias</hi> was brought after the Record
removed or not: To that they said <hi>una voce,</hi> that it appeareth
that it was upon these words of Record, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
was brought hither, and here remained; and it is not
needful to shew, that Errour was brought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Justice <hi>Iones:</hi>
I conceive, that Debt will lie against the Sheriff, because the
Sheriff had it delivered to him to deliver over. And if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
mony to deliver over, Debt will lie for him to whom it
ought to be delivered. So in this Case. And because also the
Defendant is discharged, and may plead the same, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is reason to charge the Sheriff. Farther, I conceive
also, that it will lie against the Executors: And I shall take
this difference, where the wrong is <hi>ex maleficio,</hi> for there it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with the person; and where <hi>ex contractu,</hi> for there it doth
not die with the person. If I deliver goods to a man, and he
di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th, an Action of Trover will lie against his Executors. And
here the Sheriff could not have waged his Law, for the Debt
is brought upon matter of Record, upon which wager of Law
lieth not, but upon simple contract. And the Sheriff hath
here made himself Debtor in Law upon Record. Justice <hi>Crook:</hi>
It is reason to charge the Sheriff, because the Defendant is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,
and may plead that his goods were taken in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the Sheriff in satisfaction of the same Debt. And the
Executors may be charged, because no wager of Law lieth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Debt is here brought upon matter of Record. And he
agreed with Justice <hi>Iones</hi> in the difference betwixt <hi>maleficium</hi>
and <hi>contractum.</hi> And therefore they did all conceive that the
Action would lie. And in <hi>Spekes</hi> Case in the Common Pleas,
it was voted, that the Action would lie against the Sheriff.</p>

for his disobedience, because he would not obey them,
but would erect a Tavern there against their wills, they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same to be an unfit place, did imprison him. And
the Opinion of the Court was, That he should be remanded,
because that the Mayor and Communalty had authority over
him, and they might appoint him a place in which he might
erect his Tavern. For it is a disorderly Profession, and not fit
for every place. And it was adjudged in this Court, That a
Brewhouse ought not to be erected in <hi>Fleet-street,</hi> because it is
in the heart of the City, and would be annoyance to it. And
if one would set up a Butchers shop, or a Tallow-Chandlers
shop in <hi>Cheap-side,</hi> it ought not to be, for the great annoyance
that would ensue. And therefore the Mayor and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
may redress it. And therefore the party was remanded,
and was advised by the Court to submit to the Government
of the City. <hi>Note,</hi> the Recorder certified the Custom, That
the Mayor might appoint a place.</p>
               <p>35. Upon a Recovery in a Court-Baron, against one, he
offered here to wage his Law. And Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> doubted
whether wager of Law would lie in such Case: To which
Justice <hi>Iones</hi> said, Yes; and <hi>Barckly</hi> agreed hereunto, because

which were assigned by <hi>Meade</hi> Plaintiff in the Writ of Error

the Court was clear, that for these two Errors the Judgment
should be reversed: But the Court was clear of Opinion,
That the words of themselves are not actionable, and that
the averment in this Case was idle and to no purpose, because
the words of themselves imply a plain and intelligent sense
and meaning to every man. And it was compared to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,

               <p>38. IN Trespass, the Plaintiff declared, That the Defendant entred
in his Land, and did cut down and carry away
two Loads of Grass in the Plaintiffs Soil, in a certain piece
of Ground, in which the Trespass was supposed to be done,
to strow the floor of the Church; and that he cut two Load<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there, to estrew the floor of the Church, and did not say, that
it is the same Trespass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it was adjudged Error: But
the Court was clear, that the Prescription for cutting of grass
to estrew the Church, was good; because it was but in the
nature of an Easement. And so to have a washing-place in
the land of another; and so the custom here in <hi>London,</hi> to
shoot in the land of another, and so for the Inhabitants of a
town to have a way over the land of another to their Church.
But Mr. <hi>Rolls</hi> who moved the Case at the Bar, said, That it
was adjudged, that Inhabitants of a town by custom, should
have an Easement over the Freehold, or in the Freehold of a
Stranger, but not profit Apprender: But, as I remember, the
Plaintiffs Freehold lay near the Church, and for that reason
the Court might conceive the same to be but an Easement.

Covenant, and alleaged a breach of the Covenants, in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
for want of Tiles, and dawbing with Morter, and did
not shew that it was not Tenantable. And the Opinion of

little Morter, and yet have convenient, necessary and tenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

42. Two referred themselves to Arbitrement, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators
arbitrate, that one of them should pay a certain sum
to the other; and the other in consideration thereof should
acquit him of a Bond, wherein they both were bounden to a
third person in a 100 <hi>lib. &amp; eo circiter:</hi> and it was objected,
That the Arbitrators had arbitrated a thing incertain, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of these words, <hi>eo circiter.</hi> But the Opinion of the Court
was, That there was sufficient certainty, because that in this
Case it doth not lie in their power to know the direct sum,
and because a small variation is not material: but if they (as
in <hi>Salmons</hi> case 5 <hi>Rep.)</hi> will arbitrate that one shall be bound
in a Bond to another, and not express in what sum, the same
is utterly void, for the incertainty. Difference was taken
where the Arbitrators arbitrate one party to do a thing
which lieth in his power, and where not, without the help of
a third person; there the Arbitrament is void: and in the
principal Case, the difference was taken by the Court, where
the Bond is forfeit, and the penalty is incurred, and where
not, or the day of payment is not incurred, there pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the day is a good discharge and acquittance, but
where it is incurred, it is not. But Justice <hi>Iones</hi> said, That
he might compel the Obligee upon payment, although the
Bond was forfeit, to deliver the Bond by <hi>Subpoena</hi> in Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
or that he suffer an Action to be brought against him,
and then to discharge it, and pay it.</p>

               <p>43. THere was an action brought against the Plaintiff in
the Common Pleas, who procured Process to issue
against the Defendant, for his Testimony in his Cause, and a
Note of the Process was lest at the Defendants house, being
sixty miles from <hi>London,</hi> and twelve pence to bear his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which the party did accept. And the party who served the
Process promised the Defendant sufficient costs. And here Mr.
<hi>Iones,</hi> who was of Counsel with the Defendant, took three
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64899:11"/>
Exceptions. 1. Because the Process was not served upon the
Defendant, as the Statute requires, but a Note only thereof, and
it being a Penal Statute, ought to be taken strictly. 2. There
was but 12 <hi>d.</hi> delivered to the Defendant at the time of the
serving of the Process; which is no reasonable sum for costs
and charges according to the distance of place, as the Statute
speaks: and therefore the promise that he would give him
sufficient for his costs afterwards is not good. 3. The party
who recovers by force of this Statute ought to be a party
grieved and damnified, as the Statute speaks, by the not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of the Witness: and because the Plaintiff hath not
averred, that he had loss thereby by his not appearance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he conceived the Action not maintenable. For the first,
the Court was clearly against him, because it is the common
course to put divers in one Process, and to serve Tickets, or to
give notice to the first persons who are summoned, and to
leave the Process it self with the last only; and that is the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
course in Chancery, to put many in one <hi>Subpoena,</hi> and to
leave a Ticket with one, and the Label with another, and the
Writ with the third; and that is the common practice, and
so the Statute ought to be expounded: But if there be one
only in the Process, there the Process it self ought to be left
with the party. For the second, the Court did conceive, That
the acceptance should bind the Defendant; but if he had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it, there he had not incurred the penalty of the Statute. For
he ought to have tendred sufficient costs according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the place, which 12 <hi>d.</hi> was not, it being 60 miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.
But for the third and last Exception, the Court was
clear of Opinion, That the Action would not lie for want of
Averment, that the Plaintiff was damnified for the not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Defendant. And so it was adjudged that the
Plaintiff <hi>Nihil capiat per Billam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>44. The Opinion of the Court was: That whereas one
said of another, <hi>That he will prove that he hath stollen his
Books;</hi> that the words are actionable: for they imply an affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64899:12"/>
and are as much as if he had said, <hi>That he hath stollen
my Books.</hi> And so if I say of another, <hi>That I will bring him
before a Iustice of Peace; for I will prove that he hath stollen,</hi>
&amp;c. although the first words are not actionable, yet the last
are.</p>

in the presence and hearing of the Justices and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
said, <hi>There is not a word true in the</hi> Affidavits, <hi>which I will
prove by forty Witnesses;</hi> and these words were alledged to be
spoken maliciously. And yet the Court was clear of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that they will not bear Action. And the reason was,
because they are common words here, and usual where an
Action is depending betwixt two, for one to say, That the
<hi>Affidavit</hi> made by the other is not true, because it is in defence
of his cause. And so it was here. The Defendant spake the
words upon the reading of the <hi>Affidavits</hi> in a cause depending
betwixt the Plaintiff and the Defendant. And therefore if I
say, <hi>That</hi> J. S. <hi>hath no Title to the Land;</hi> if I Claim or make Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to the Land: Or if I say, <hi>That</hi> J. S. <hi>is a Bastard,</hi> and entitle
my self to be right Heir, the words are not actionable, because
that I pretending Title, do it in defence thereof. And Justice
<hi>Barckley</hi> said, That there are two main things in Actions for
words, the words themselves, and <hi>causa dicendi;</hi> and therefore
sometimes, although that the words themselves will bear A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
yet they being considered <hi>causa dicendi,</hi> sometimes they
will not bear Action. Now in our Case <hi>causa dicendi</hi> was in
his own defence, or his Title, and therefore they will not bear
Action.</p>

justifie for one or two, and sayeth nothing to the other,
that the whole Plea is naught, because the Plea is intire as to

               <p>48. A man pleaded a descent of a Copy-hold in Fee: The
Defendant to take away the descent pleaded, That the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestor
did surrender to the use of another, <hi>absque hoc,</hi> that the
Copy-holder died seised. And the Opinion of the Court was,
That it was no good traverse, because he traversed that which
needed not to be traversed; for being Copy-hold, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
pleaded a surrender of it, the party cannot have it again
if not by surrender. Like the Case of a Lease for years, <hi>Helliers
Case. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rep.</hi> 25. b. For as none can have a Lease for years but
by lawful conveyance, so none can have a Copy-hold Estate,

at the Common Law, there the defendant may plead
a feoffment made by the Ancestor <hi>absque hoc,</hi> that he died

Tenant die seised, that he shall pay a Heriot: The
Lord granted the Seigniory for 99 years, if the Tenant should
so long live: And after that he made a Lease for 4000 years.
Tenant for Life is disseised, (or more properly, ousted) and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Here were two Questions: 1. Whether there were any He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
to be paid, and admitting there were, yet who should
have it, whether the Grantee for 99 years, or he who had the
4000 years? And the Court was clear of Opinion in both
points without any argument, 1. That a Heriot was to be paid,
not withstanding that the Tenant did not die seised, because
he had the estate in right, and might have entred, although he
had not the possession. And Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> compared it to
the Case in <hi>C. 3. Rep. 35. a.</hi> in <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Bakers</hi> Case, where
a man hath one acre of Land holden in <hi>Capite,</hi> and a hundred
acres of Socage Land, and afterwards he is disseised of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite</hi>
Land, and afterwards makes his will of all his Socage
Land, in that case he is a person having of <hi>Capite</hi> Land, as the
Statute speaks. And yet that right of <hi>Capite</hi> Land shall make
the devise void for the third part; for notwithstanding the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seisin,
yet he is Tenant in Law. And as to the second point,
the Court was clear of Opinion also, That he in remainder, or
he that had the Estate for 4000 years (for note the Action was
brought by him in the Remainder for the Heriot) should not
have it: And their reason was, because the Tenant for
life was not the Tenant of him who had the future interest of
4000 years, but of him who had the interest for 99 years. But
they were not clear of opinion, that the Grantee for 99 years
should have the Heriot. Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> was, that the Grantee
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64899:14"/>
for 99 years should have it. But Justice <hi>Iones</hi> (there being
then none in Court but they) <hi>haesitavit.</hi> And the reason of the
doubt was, because that <hi>eo instante</hi> that the Tenant died,
<hi>eodem instante,</hi> the estate of the Grantee for 99 years determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.
Justice <hi>Iones</hi> put this Case: A Seigniory is granted for
the life of the Tenant, the remainder over in fee; the Tenant
dieth, Who shall have the Ward? Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> said, he
who is Grantee of the particular estate: but <hi>Iones</hi> seemed to

Bench did exhibit an Information against the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Shoreditch</hi> for not repairing the High-way. And
the Issue was, Whether they ought to repair it or no? And
it was said by the Court, That by the Common Law, the
Inhabitants of a Parish ought to repair all High-ways lying
within the Parish, If prescription did not bind some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64899:15"/>
person thereto; which was not in this Case. And in this
Case some of the Inhabitants would have been Witnesses to
prove that some particular Inhabitants lying upon the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
had used time out of minde to repair it, but were not
permitted by the Court, because they were Defendants in the
Information; wherefore the Jury found, That the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
ought to repair the way.</p>
               <p>63. Two men and their wives were Indicted upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of Forcible Entry, who brought a <hi>Certiorari</hi> to remove
the Indictment into the Kings Bench. Some of them did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to be bound to prosecute according to the Statute of
21 <hi>Iac. c.</hi> 8. and therefore, notwithstanding the <hi>Certiorari,</hi> the
Justices of Peace did proceed to the trial of the Indictment:
and here it was resolved, That whereas the Statute is, The
parties Indicted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall become bound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That if one of the
parties offer to find Sureties, although the others will not,
yet that the cause shall be removed; for the denying of one
or any of them shall not prejudice the other of the benefit
of the <hi>Certiorari,</hi> which the Law gives unto them: And the
Woman cannot be bounden. And it was farther resolved,
that where the Statute saith, That the parties Indicted shall
be bound in the sum of ten pounds, with sufficient Sureties,
as the Justices of the Peace shall think fit, that if the Sureties
be worth ten pounds, the Justices cannot refuse them, because
that the Statute prescribes in what sum they shall be bound.

That where the Statute of 3. <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 5. enables them to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain

and Justice. And here it was farther resolved, that after a
<hi>Certiorari</hi> brought, and tender of sufficient Sureties, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Statute, all the proceedings of the Justices of Peace
are <hi>coram non Iudice.</hi>

               <head>The Argument of the Lord Chief Iustice, in

               <p>64. <hi>STowel</hi> was Lord of a Mannor, and <hi>Iames</hi> one of the
Tenants, and there the custome was, That the Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of the Mannor might make Laws and Ordinances for
the well-ordering of the Common. And the custome was also
to Assess a penalty or a pain upon those who brake those Laws
and Ordinances. And also to prescribe to distrain for the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty.
The Steward made an Ordinance, That he who put
his Cattle beyond such a bound, that he should pay 3 <hi>s. 4 d.
Iames</hi> offended against this Ordinance, upon which the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was assessed, and a distress taken by <hi>Tintny</hi> Defendant in
the <hi>Replevin,</hi> Plaintiff and Baily of the Lord of the Mannor;
And Judgment was given for him in the Common Pleas, and
damages assessed: Upon which a Writ of Error was brought.
In this Case it was agreed by the whole Court, that the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
was reasonable: And the difference taken where the
Law or Ordinance takes away the whole profit of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners,
and where it abridgeth it only, or adds limits or
bounds to it, as in this Case. And farther it was agreed, That
the Commoners are bound to take notice of these Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But in this Case, the Er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or which was assigned was this,
That damages were given for the Defendant, where no dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
ought to have been given: And of that Opinion was the
Lord chief Justice, that no damages ought to have been given;
and with him agreed Justice <hi>Iones;</hi> but Justice <hi>Crook</hi> and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<hi>Barckley, è contra.</hi> It is clear, that at the Common Law,
the Defendant shall not have damages, although as to some
intent the Avowant be as it were a Plaintiff and Actor.
21. <hi>H. 6. 2. 6. H. 4. 11. 35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> H.</hi> 6. 47. Then the Question ariseth
only upon these two Statutes, <hi>viz. 7. H. 6. cap 4. 21. H. 8. c.</hi> 19.
And first, whether our Case be within the Letter of these
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64899:16"/>
Laws; Admitting that not, Whether within the mischief, so as
that it shall have the same remedy. And I conceive, it is not
within the Letter or Equity of these Statutes: Not within
the Letter; for they speak, Where a man distrains for Rents,
Customs and Services, or damage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>easant. And in our Case,
he doth not distrain for any of them; for it is manifest, that he
doth not distrain for Rents, Services, or Damage feasant:
And it is as clear, that he doth not distrain for Customs; for he
distrained for a penalty assessed by Custom. 1. In <hi>Alcocks</hi> case
it was here resolved, That where a prescription was alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to distrain for an Estray, and found for the Avowant,
that no damages should be in that case. For it was here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
that the Customs intended in 21 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 19. are
Customs which are Services. 2ly. I hold it not within the
Equity; for the mischief at the Common Law was, That da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
were not to be recovered for such Rents, Services, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And this penalty is no Service. And I conceive clearly, That
it was not the meaning of the Makers of the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to extend to such penalties. And here I further take the
difference which is in <hi>Pilfords</hi> case in the 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 116. In all
cases where a man at the Common Law cannot recover da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages:
If a Statute give damages, there he shall recover no
costs; for the same is an Act of Creation, which gives remedy
where none was given before. But where there is an Act of
Addition, which increaseth the damages at the Common Law,
there notwithstanding he shall recover costs also. So in our
Case, these being Acts of Creation which give remedy where
there was no remedy before, shall be taken strictly according
to the Letter, and shall not extend to such penalties as in our
case: And upon this difference he cited the Cases in <hi>Pilfords</hi>
case, and especially the Case upon the Statute of 5 <hi>E.</hi> 6. of
Ingrossers; the Plaintiff shall not recover costs, but only the
penalty given by the Statute grounded upon 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 10. I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,

<hi>nulla damna debent esse adjudicanda per Legem terrae;</hi> but he

That by the Statute of 4 <hi>Iac. c.</hi> 3. which giveth costs and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
to the Defendant in certain Actions there specified
where the Plaintiff shall recover damages, and that where
the Plaintiff is Non-suit, or verdict pass against him, That
Demurrer hath been construed to be within that Statute. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that it is an Act of Creation, I agree that: and
answer, that Demurrer is within that Statute, and the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
of it, but it is not so in our Case; for in our Case there
is no such mischief: For there is no colour to extend it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

Priviledge; but for Offices which may be executed by Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

               <p>66. THe doubt in this Case did arise upon two several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures

The chief Justice, Justice <hi>Crooke,</hi> and Justice <hi>Barckley,</hi> were
clear of Opinion, That it was a grant of a Freehold to begin
at a day to come. And for that the Case is thus: In the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture
of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. there is a recital of a former Lease for years:
And by this Indenture in 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. another Lease was to begin
after the first Lease determined, the remainder in Fee to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
And upon that the three Justices before were clear in
their Judgments, That it was a Grant of Freehold to begin
at a day to come, which without doubt is void, 8 <hi>H. 7. 39 H.</hi> 6.
and <hi>Bucklers</hi> case, 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> And in 8 <hi>H.</hi> 7. the difference is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
betwixt the grant of a Rent in <hi>esse,</hi> and Rent <hi>de novo.</hi> A
Rent <hi>de novo</hi> may be granted <hi>in futuro,</hi> but not a Rent which
is in being. But Justice <hi>Iones</hi> in this Case was of Opinion,
That here is not any grant of a Freehold to begin at a day to
come, because in this case the Lease doth begin presently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Lease recited is not found by the Jury, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now it is all one as if there had been no Lease at all; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
in the case of the King, because it passeth a good estate
of Inheritance to the Grantee. And therefore if I make a Lease
for years unto a man after the expiration of such a Lease,
where in truth there is no such Lease in being, the Lease shall
begin presently. The Question upon the Indenture of 2 <hi>&amp; 3 P.

grant all his Lands, it is altogether incertain and void; but if

                  </gap>y
in particular. And it was agreed, that convenient cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
is sufficient: And therefore it was said by Justice <hi>Iones,</hi>
That if I grant all my Rents in <hi>Dale</hi> which I have of the part
of my Mother, that he conceives the same to be good. The
first reason wherefore this grant shall be good notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the false recital, was this, because the words here, All
which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not words of denotation or restriction, but of
suggestion or affirmation, and therefore shall not make void
the Grant. And here the difference was taken between the
Case of a common person, and of the King; Suggestion which
is false in the Case of the King, makes the Patent void; but
contrary in the case of a common person: And therefore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the King be deceived either in point of profit or in point of
Title, his Grant is void, 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. Where he is not deceived in
point of profit, he shall not avoid the Grant. 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
reason, That a Deed ought to be construed <hi>Vt res magis
valeat quam pereat, 34 H.</hi> 6. A man having a Reversion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth
his land in <hi>Manibus,</hi> thereby the Reversion passeth, 9 <hi>E
4.</hi> 42. Release of all Actions against Prior and Covent, shall
be construed and intended all Actions against the Prior
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64899:18"/>
only, for an Action cannot be brought against the Covent.
Farther, by this construction you would avoid this deed; and
by the Rule of Law, the deed and words of every man
shall be taken very strong against himself, <hi>ut res magis valeat,</hi>
as is said before. And it is against reason to conceive that it
was the meaning of the parties that nothing should pass. A
third reason was, because the grant was a distinct clause of it
self. And the words which were objected at the Bar to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictive,
were in another distinct clause, and therefore shall
not restrain that which was before; for words restrictive
ought to be continued in one and the same sentence: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they having granted all their Tithes in <hi>Chesterton</hi> by one
clause, the false recital afterwards in another clause shall not
make the grant void. See 3 <hi>&amp; 4 Eliz. Dyer in Wast, 31 Eliz.</hi>
the Lord <hi>Wenworths</hi> Case in the Exchequer upon this Rule of
distinct clauses: And <hi>Atkins</hi> and <hi>Longs</hi> case in the Common
Pleas, upon which cases Justice <hi>Iones</hi> did rely. The fourth
reason was, That construction ought to be made upon the
whole Deed: And it appeareth by the context of the Deed,
That it was the meaning of the parties to grant the Tithes
by the Deed. Further, the Exception of the four things
sheweth, That it was the meaning of the parties to grant all
things not excepted, as the Tithes in this Case; For <hi>exceptio
firmat Regulam;</hi> And to what purpose should the Exception
be, if they did not intend to pass all other things not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?

Wherefore it was agreed by the whole Court, that Judgment
should be given for the Defendant. And the Opinion of the
Court was clear also, That although some of the Tithes had
been in the Tenure of <hi>Margaret Pet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e,</hi> that yet the grant was
good. And that was after Argument upon the Demurrer, to
avoid all scruples to be after made by Counsel; because it was
conceived, That some of the Tithes were in her Tenure.</p>

Brisco 9 Iac.</hi> purchased Copyhold to him and his Son for their

an Inholder; and about twelve years after, a Commission of
Bankrupt is obtained against him; And thereupon the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyhold-land
is sold by the Commissioners to the Defendant.
<hi>Ralph Brisco</hi> dieth, and his Son <hi>Iohn Brisco</hi> entred, and made
the Lease to the Plaintiff: The Defendant entred upon him,
and he brought an <hi>Ejectione firme.</hi> And Judgment was given
upon solemn argument by the Justices for the Plaintiff. The
first point was, Whether an Inholder be a Bankrupt within
these Statutes: And it was resolved by all the Justices, <hi>viz.
Iones, Crook, Barckley,</hi> and <hi>Bramstone</hi> chief Justice, that an
Inholder <hi>quatenus</hi> an Inholder is not within these Statutes:
Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> and Justice <hi>Iones,</hi> one grounded upon the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Verdict, the other upon the Statutes, did conceive,
That an Inholder in some cases might be within these Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.
Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> did conceive upon this special Verdict,
that this Inholder was within them; because it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound, That
he got his living by buying and selling, and using the Trade of
an Inholder. And he conceived upon these words, Buying and
selling in the verdict, and getting his living thereby, although
that the Jury have also found him an Inholder, that the same
is within the Law. And he agreed, That he who liveth by buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or selling, and not by both, is not within the Law; but in
our case the Jury have found both, And it hath been adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That he who buys and sells cattle, and stocks his ground
with them, that he may be a Bankrupt within those Statutes.
I agree, that a Scrivener was not within 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> for he doth
not live by buying and selling, but by making use of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of other men; but now he is within 21 <hi>Iac.</hi> But in our
case the Inholder buys his grass, hay, and grains, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
also for his Guests, and by selling of them he lives. But he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64899:19"/>
agreed, That if the Jury had found, that he was an Inholder
only, and not that he did get his living by buying and selling,
that in that case, he was out of the Law: And for these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
he did conceive, That this Inholder, as by the special
Verdict is found, was within the Statutes of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and
21 <hi>Iacobi.</hi> Justice <hi>Iones:</hi> An Inholder may be, or not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
these Laws upon this difference. That Inholder who gets
his living meerly by buying and selling (as many of the Inhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
here in <hi>London</hi> do) they are within these Statutes: But
those who have Lands of their own, and have hay and grain
and all their provisions of their own, as many have in the
Country; those are not within the Statutes. Farther he said,
That buying and selling doth not make men within these Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
for then all men should be within the Statutes; but they
ought to be meant of them who gain the greatest part of their
living thereby, and live chiefly or absolutely thereby. But
<hi>Bramston</hi> chief Justice, and Justice <hi>Crook</hi> were clear of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that an Inholder could not be a Bankrupt neither by the
Statutes, nor according as it is found by the special Verdict.
And their reason was, because that an Inholder doth not live
by buying and selling, for he doth not sell any thing, but utter
it: He which sells any thing doth it by way of contract; but
an Inholder doth not contract with his Guests, but provides
for them, and cannot take unreasonable rates, as he who sells
may; and if he doth, he may be Indicted of Extortion, which
the seller cannot. Wherefore they concluded, that an Inhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is not within the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz. &amp; 1 Iac.</hi> Justice
<hi>Crook</hi> remembred these Cases; <hi>Webb</hi> an Inholder of <hi>Vxbridge</hi>
brewed in his house, and sold his Beer to his Guests: And it
was adjudged in the Exchequer, that it was not within the
Statute of Brewers. And <hi>Bedells</hi> Case, who being a Farmer
bought and sold cattle; and adjudged, that he was not a
Bankrupt within these Statutes. And he put th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>se cases up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this reason, That where the Statutes said, Get their living
by buying and selling, that it ought to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>or the greater part;
that they gain the greater part of their living thereby. And
he said, that if a Gentleman buy and sell Land he is not within
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64899:20"/>
the Statutes; for it ought to be taken, those who buy and sell
personal things. The second point. It was agreed by all, that
Copyhold is within the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz. &amp; 1 Iac.</hi> First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is no prejudice to the Lord, because there ought to be
composition with the Lord, and the Vendee; And although
the sale ought to be by Indenture, yet the Vendee ought to
be admitted by the Lord. And the difference in <hi>Heydons</hi> case
in 3 <hi>Rep.</hi> was agreed. Secondly, It is expresly within 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
and therefore within 1 <hi>Iac.</hi> also by way of recital, although
the Statute of 1 <hi>Iac.</hi> hath new provisions. And by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 21 <hi>Iac.</hi> it was said, That these Statutes shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued
most beneficial for the Creditors, because their ground
is <hi>suum cuique tribuere, 5 Eliz. Dyer. Vmpton</hi> and <hi>Hides Case,</hi>
The Acts of Explanation shall be taken most beneficial and
liberally. And the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> says expresly, That the
Commissioners shall dispose of Lands, as well Copy as Free.
But although a Copyhold be not within the later part of
13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> expresly, yet by connexion it is. And the Statute of
13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> guides the Statutes 1 <hi>&amp; 21 Iacobi.</hi> Justice <hi>Iones</hi>
did agree, That the Copyhold is within 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> but not the
person of the Copyholder, although the person be within
1 <hi>Iac.</hi> And the chief Justice said, That his Opinion was, that
upon the Statute of 21 <hi>Iac.</hi> which is, That these Statutes shall
he taken liberally: that Copyholds, although they had not
been named, had been within these Statutes. It was said by
Justice <hi>Barckley,</hi> who argued for the Defendant. That the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
hath not found within 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> because the verdict hath
not found fraud expresly, but badges only thereof. See <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riel
Littletons Case</hi> in the Chancellor of <hi>Oxfords Case,</hi> That
the Fraud ought to be expresly found, but so it is not here; for
here it is found, that the Son was an Infant at the time of the
purchase; and also that the purchase was with the mony o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

apparent, &amp; ought not to be found particularly. But it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
by all the other Justices, That here was not fraud appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and therefore it ought to be found by the Jury. The
third and chief point in this Case was, He being no Inholder
at the time of the purchase, and afterwards becoming an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder,
whether he were within the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> And
it was resolved he was not. But here Justice <hi>Barckley,</hi> who
argued for the Defendant, was against it. And he argued, that
if a man purchase and sell, and afterwards become a Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and Bankrupt, that that was not within the Statute; but
if he keepeth the Land in his hands, there he conceived him
within the Statute, as it was in this case. And he was against
the Book of the Chancellor of <hi>Oxfords Case,</hi> of relation to
devest the Advowson; and he said, It is not like to the Case
in 6 <hi>&amp; 7 Eliz.</hi> there cited. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Eriches Case</hi> in the 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> there
is a Rule taken, that <hi>A verbis legis non est recedendum;</hi> and in
our Case it is within the express words of the Statute, which
are, <hi>That if any person which hereafter shall become a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,</hi>
&amp;c. And here, he after became a Bankrupt. But it was
resolved by the others, with whom Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
after, that it was not within the Statute. Justice <hi>Crook</hi>
argued, That it is not within the words of the Statute, which
are, If the offender purchase, and that the sale shall be good
against the offender: and here, he was not offender at
the time of the purchase; and using no Trade, shall he be
punished for that after? Besides, here the so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> should be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
for the offence of the Father, which the Law of God will
not suffer. <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Cullamers Case, 2 Rep.</hi> he ought to be
endebted at the time, otherwise he is no offender; And he
might give away his goods before he was in Debt. And the
mischief here will be, That Lands purchased 40 years before
should thereby be defeated. And I hold, that it a man ba a
Tradesman, and afterwards leaves his Trade, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
and afterwards becomes a Tradesman again, and a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
that he is not within the Statute. But Justice <hi>Iones</hi> was
of opinion, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he be a Tradesman at the time, although not
an offender, yet he is within the Statute. But the chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64899:21"/>
did argue, that he ought to be an offender, and the thing
which makes him to be an offender is his intent to defraud his
creditors. <hi>Iones:</hi> It shall be hard in this Case to cause the
estate to be reached by this Statute, for perhaps it was for the
marriage of the son, and perhaps the son might sell it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the father become Bankrupt, it would be hard to void the
sale. The Chancellor of <hi>Oxfords</hi> case was a stronger case, for
there the party was Indicted. And if a man be Accomptant
to the King, and afterwards sell, yet the sale shall be avoided
by the King. But if he be not accomptant and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th, and
afterwards becomes Accomptant, the sale shall not be defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And here he became Inholder after the purchase, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a clear man at the time of the purchase, he shall not now
be within the Statute. Chief Justice: If that should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
all things which the party did should be defeated, and
therefore he agreed, That although he be a Tradesman, yet if
he be not in debt; if he purchase for another, or give unto
another, if no fraud be found, it is not within the Statutes.
And Judgment accordingly was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

the Jury gave a special verdict. They found that the Office was
granted by one Bishop to one for life, which was confirmed by

that <hi>Iohn Young</hi> Bishop did grant the said Office of Register to
<hi>Iohn Young</hi> his son now Plaintiff in Reversion. (And that the
Office was to be executed by the said <hi>Iohn Young</hi> or his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which <hi>Iohn Young</hi> the son was but of the age of 11 years
at the time of the Grant; but they found that he was of full
age before the Tenant for life died. And then they found that
<hi>Iohn Young</hi> the Bishop died; and that his Successor granted
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64899:21"/>
the Office to the Defendant, who executed many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Office: And whether upon the whole matter the
Defendant were a disturber or not, was the Question: And
it was adjudged by all the Justices without any solemn and
open argument, that the Defendant was a disturber: But the
case was argued by Counsel on both sides, whose arguments
and reasons were briefly following. <hi>Maynard</hi> for the Plaintiff;
There are two points. 1. Whether the grant be good within
the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz. 2ly,</hi> Whether the Grant to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
be good: And he held it was, because it was to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by his Deputy. The word of the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> are,
<hi>[Of any thing belonging to the Bishoprick]</hi> and in our Case the
Office of Registry is belonging to the Bishoprick. The second
doubt is, Whether the Grant in Reversion be convenient; and
I hold it is, although not absolutely, yet necessarily: And
therefore we are to see, 1. What conveniencie is requisite; and
2. Whether such conveniencie be within the Law: For that,
it ought to be enquired, How this office hath used to be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the use ought to guide the conveniencie. See the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Salisburies Case;</hi> a grant of an Office to two, which
hath not been used to be so granted, is not good. <hi>Pase. 1 Car.
Rot.</hi> 207. the Bishop of <hi>Chichesters Case.</hi> Where the Question
was upon the usual Grant of Fees: and there because it was
found that there was a grant of greater Fees than the use and
custome warranted; It was adjudged good for so much as the
custom did warrant, and void for the residue. And the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
it self speaks of usual Rent; all which proves, That use
ought to guide the conveniencie. 2d Point, That the grant to
an Infant was good, because it is granted to be executed by
his Deputy. I grant, that an Infant cannot be an Attorney, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
an Attorney cannot make a Deputy. And this Grant is
not inconvenient <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> neither to the Grantor, nor to
the Grantee. 1. It is not inconvenient <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> for such
an Office is grantable to one and his heirs, which by possibility
may descend to an Infant, and there he shall execute it by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty;
and the same inconvenience is in this Case, if there be
any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if the execution of an Office may be by Deputy
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64899:22"/>
where the party is not able, the same reason is in this Case.
2. It is not inconvenient to the Grantor, because as it is presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
when a man grants an Office to one and his heirs, that
he s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s that the same by possibility may descend to an Infant;
so he says in our Case, at the time of the grant, he is an Infant.
3. It is not inconvenient to the Grantee, for it is for his
benefit. 27 <hi>H. 8. 28. 8 E.</hi> 4. 7. But here it may be objected, That
this Office doth concern the Commonwealth, and if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
commit any offence he shall not be punished, because i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
should be inconvenient: To that I answer, that the Infant
ought to execute it by his sufficient Deputy, and he himself
shall be charged for any escape, and by forfeiture of his Office
as any other may. Besides, you shall never prejudice any i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>

schooling. But it may be farther objected, That it concerns the
administration of Justice, which an Infant cannot do. To which
I answer, that he may make a Deputy, who ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
sufficient by the Ordinary, and he may well execute it
26 <hi>H. 6. Grants</hi> 12. An Infant elected Parson to serve a Cure

                  </gap>
by descent. But in our Case, the grant <hi>à fortiori</hi> shall be good
because it is executory. And he took the difference between
an Executory grant as here, which by possibility may be mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
good, (as in out Case it was, because that the Grantee was o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
full age before the Office fell in possession) and where an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
vests immediately: Farther, he conceived the Case the
stronger, because the Deputy came in by the allowance of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may be prejudicial by possibility, I conceive it <hi>apparens nocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum;</hi>
as 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> 101. and therefore the like Nusance, as the

an Infant is not capable of this Office, because <hi>Misfea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans

of Wast, or an Action upon the case. 8 <hi>Rep. 95. Doct.

his Deputy, make the Grant good: I hold it doth not. 7 <hi>Eliz.

And if it be so, if this Grant should be good, here should be a
Misdemeanor in the Office, and none should be punished for
it; which should be inconvenient: for the Deputy cannot
be charged, nor the Officer in our Case, because he is an
Infant, and therefore the Grant is not good. The 3. Quest.
Whether this subsequent Act of the Infant coming of full age,
before the falling of the Office into possession, hath made the
Grant good. I hold, that not, upon the common Rule,
<hi>Quod initio non valet, &amp;c.</hi> So is the Bishop o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Sir <hi>George Reignalls Case,</hi> and 27 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 10. The 4. Question,
Whether this Grant in Reversion to a man of full age, be
good at the Common Law? and I hold it is not; because it is
a judicial Office, which is not grantable in Reversion: with
which agrees 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> Auditor <hi>Curles Case.</hi> The 5 Question,
Whether it be within the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> And I hold it is
not, because that must take effect from the time of the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64899:23"/>
of it, as the Statute speaks. 6. I conceive it is not a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Grant, because it is not within the exception of the
Statute, <hi>Et exceptio firmat Regulam.</hi> It was objected, That
Usage makes these Grants good. I conceive the contrary,
That Usage is not a Rule to measure a thing, whether it be
convenient or not. And a grant may be good, which is not
used. And the Courts of Justice ought to judge what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
or necessary, and what not. So in <hi>Litt.</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,
<hi>Say</hi> and <hi>Smiths</hi> case. Besides, it is not Necessary, for
he stands but for a Cypher, and doth nothing, and therefore
not Necessary. Besides, it is inconvenient, and takes from the
Successor <hi>honorem munificentiae,</hi> for by the same reason that he
may grant one, he may grant all the Offices in Reversion,
so as his Successors shall not have one to grant; and by this
means shall take away a flower of the Bishoprick. 10. <hi>Rep.
61.</hi> a. The Opinion of <hi>Popham</hi> Chief Justice: An Office is not
Grantable in Reversion by the Bishop. But the Court was
clear of Opinion, without Argument for the Plaintiff, That
the Grant is good. <hi>Crooke</hi> he denied that such an Office is
not grantable in Fee, and instanced in the Ushers Office and
Chamberlains of the Exchequer, which are Judicial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and yet granted in Fee: And it was denied that this is an
Office of Judicature, but Ministerial only. To that which
was objected, That the Action doth not lie against an Infant;
It was answered, That an Action upon the case doth lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
an Infant Executor; an Action upon the Case will lie
against an Infant for a Nusance, or for words, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law. And in our Case he shall forfeit his Office. An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Infant may be Executor, in which greater confidence and
trust is reposed; and in our Case the Grant to an Infant is not
void <hi>ab initio,</hi> but voidable only upon <hi>contingent;</hi> And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
conceive, that if the usage will warrant it, That he may grant
all the Offices in Reversion: and upon that difference depends
the Opinion of <hi>Popham,</hi> in the 10. <hi>Rep.</hi> for there it doth not
appear, that the Custom was to grant in Reversion: And
therefore it was not good. <hi>Barckley:</hi> The King may grant i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64899:23"/>
there is no question, but that Custom may make an Office
grantable in Reversion, in the case of a common person. 1 <hi>H. 7.
Crofts</hi> case. Also the case of the Usher of the Exchequer gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Fee. And there is no question, but a Judicial Office
may be granted to one and his Heirs. And the Office of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of the Fleet, which is an Office of great trust, is granted
in Fee. And as such Offices may descend to an Infant; so a
Feme covert may have such an Office, for she may have a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
who may execute it; and so an Infant may have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty.
7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. There is a difference amongst Infants; an Infant,
before the Statute of 10 <hi>Eliz.</hi> might have been Presented to
a Benefice, and he was Parson <hi>de facto.</hi> So a meer Lay man:
but the same ought to be understood of an Infant who was of
age of discretion. A Preb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the age of 3 years, and was adjudged void, because he was not
of age of discretion; but if he had been, it had been good.
And I conceive, that it is necessary and convenient that it
should be granted in Reversion, for by that means the Office
would never be vacant, and should be always provided of
those who were sufficient to execute it. So in our Case the
Infant may be instruct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d before he come of full age. And
farther, as an Infant when he is Presented, is to be allowed or
disallowed by the Ordinary; so the Deputy is by the Court.
The Statute of 1 <hi>El.</hi> makes against you; for although it be
not within it, yet it may be good at the common Law, like
the concurrent Lease, which is good at the common Law, and
not within the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> The rest of the Justices did
all agree with <hi>Barckley.</hi> And Justice <hi>Iones</hi> said, that <hi>Scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers</hi>
Case, cited by my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in <hi>Institutes</hi> 3. b. was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
contrary, That an Infant was capable of a Stewardship
in Reversion; and he said that it was adjudged in the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
that an Ignorant man was capable of an Office in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;
which doth not differ from our Case.</p>

               <head>Sir John Saint-Johns Case.</head>
               <p>69. THe Lady <hi>Cromwell</hi> was possessed of divers Leases, and
conveyed them in trust, and afterwards married
with the said Sir <hi>Iohn Saint-Iohn;</hi> and afterwards she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the mony which came of the trust, and with part of it
she bought Jewels, and part she left in Mony, and died. And
Sir <hi>Iohn Saint-Iohn</hi> took Letters of Administration of the
goods of the Wife: And the Ecclesiastical Court would make
him accomptable for the Jewels, and for the Mony; and to
put them into an Inventory. And the Opinion of the Court
was, That he should not put them into the Inventory, because
the property is absolutely in the husband, &amp; he hath them not
as Administrator; but things in action he shall have as Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrator,
and shall be accomptable for them: and in that case
a Prohibition was granted as to the Mony. It was moved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
this Term, That the Lady <hi>Saint-Iohn</hi> did receive part of
the Mony, put it out, and took Bonds for it in the names of
others, to her use; and the Spiritual Court would have him
accompt for that, and thereupon a Prohibition was prayed;
but the Court would not grant it. And there <hi>Barckley</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in Opinion, and so did the Court, some being for it, and
some against it. The reason given wherefore the Prohibition
should not be granted, was, because the Mony received upon
the trust, is in Law, the Monies of the Trustees, and the wife
hath no remedy for it, but in Court of Equity; and therefore
that the husband should have it as Administrator. The reason
urged wherefore the Prohibition should be granted, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
here the trust was executed, when the wife had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Mony, and by the Receipt the husband had gained
property therein as husband, and therefore should not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable
for it. Farther, here the Ecclesiastical Court should
determine the trust, of which they have no Jurisdiction, for
they have not a Court of Equity. And the Court ruled, That
the Counsel should move in Chancery for a Prohibition, for
in Equity the mony did belong to the wife. And here it was
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64899:24"/>
agreed, That if the Trustees consent that the wife shall receive
the mony, as in our Case the contrary doth not appear, that
there the husband might gain a property as husband; but
because the Court conceived, that the Ecclesiastical Court
had not Jurisdiction, a Prohibition was granted. And here it
was agreed, That if a woman do convey a Lease in trust, for
her use, and afterwards marrieth, that in such case, it lies not
in the power of the husband to dispose of it; and if the wife
die, the husband shall not have it, but the Executor of the
wife; and so it was said, it was resolved in Chancery.</p>
               <p>70. <hi>Barckley</hi> and <hi>Crooke,</hi> there being no other Justice at
that time in Court, said, That upon a Petition to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
or any other Ecclesiastical Court, no Prohibition lieth.
But there ought to be a Suit in the Ecclesiastical court. And
by them, a Libel may be in the Ecclesiastical court, for not
repairing a way that leadeth to Church, but not for repairing
of a high-way: and upon suggestion that the Libel was for
repairing a high-way, a Prohibition was granted.</p>
               <p>71. Many Indictments were exhibited severally, against se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
men, because each by himself, suffered his door to be
unrepaired, and it was shewed in the Indictments, that every
one of them ought to repair: And thereupon it was moved,
that they might be quashed; but the Court would not quash
them without certificate, that the parties had repaired their
doors; but it was granted, that Process should be stayed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
motion of Counsel that reparation should be immediately
done. But at the same time, many Indictments, for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
of the high-way, which the Parishioners ought to have
repaired, according as it was found by Verdict, the same
Term were quashed for the same defect: But in truth, there
was another fault in the Indictment, for that it was joynt one
only, whereas there ought to have been several Indictments;
but they were quashed for the first defect.</p>

                  </gap>se reasons, because the Pledges <hi>de retorno habendo,</hi> are
given by that Statute, as 2 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 15. and 9. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 42. b. And
that Statute saith, That Pledges shall be taken by the Sheriff,
and therefore no other can take them, notwithstanding that
Pledges might be found here in Court. And 3 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 3. and
<hi>F. N. B.</hi> 72. a. say, That where Pledges are found, that they
shall remain, notwithstanding the removal of the Plaint by
<hi>Recordari:</hi> and the reason is, because the Sheriff is a special
Officer, chosen to that purpose by the Statute, and therefore
no other can take them. Besides, there would be a failer of
Justice, if the Court should put in Pledges, for then there
might be no remedy against the Sheriff, for that he found no
Pledges, and no remedy against the Pledges, because they are
not found according to the Statute, and so a failer of Justice;
and by that means the Sheriff should frustrate and avoid the
Statute; for no Pledges should ever be found, and so he should
take advantage of his own laches and wrong. Farther, it was
objected, that these proceedings are the judicial act of the
Court, and therefore the Court will not alter or diminish
them. <hi>L. Entries</hi> 1. and 3 <hi>H.</hi> 6. And farther, it was said,
That the cases of <hi>Young</hi> and <hi>Young,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hussies</hi> case, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged

in <hi>Replevine,</hi> as our case is, for which there is special Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
made by the Statute. But it was answered, and agreed by
the whole Court, that Pledges may be found by this Court:
for the Pledges given by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>West.</hi> 2. are only to
give remedy against the Sheriff; and if the Sheriff do not
his duty, but surceaseth, we may as at the Common Law put
in Pledges, and yet notwithstanding remedy may be against
the Sheriff upon the <hi>Statute</hi> for his neglect. And farther it
was agreed, That Pledges may be found at any time before

were alledged. 1. That the Action will not lie, because in
truth there was a just Debt due to <hi>Hull,</hi> in whose name he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
2. Because it is not shewed, that the causes of Actions,
which the other Creditors had against him, did arise within
the Jurisdiction of the Court of <hi>Bristow.</hi> And notwithstanding

Court upon this difference; where <hi>Hull</hi> himself sueth or
commenceth Suit against the Plaintiff, there although by
that Suit he draw all the Creditors upon the back of him, and
so perhaps undo him, yet because it was a lawful act; no Action
upon the Case lieth against him: But where one commenceth
Suit against another, in the name of another, and without his
privity, that is Maintenance, which is a tortious Act, and
therefore an Action will lie: so in the principal case. As to the

the Arrest and Imprisonment, like the case where a man

which cause a Prohibition was granted.</p>
            <p>80. <hi>Habeas corpora</hi> was directed to the Porter of <hi>Ludlore,</hi>
to bring the bodies of <hi>Iohn Shielde</hi> and <hi>William Shielde</hi> into
the Kings Bench; the case shortly (as appears upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn)
was this. <hi>Powell</hi> the Father brought a Bill, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of an Information, against the said <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>William
Shield,</hi> before the Council of the Marches in <hi>Wales,</hi> for an
unlawful Practice, Combination, and Procurement of a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine
Marriage in the night, betwixt <hi>Mary Shield</hi> a Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servant,
and the Son of <hi>Powell,</hi> who was a Gentleman of
good credit and worth, the Parson also being Drunk, as he
himself sware, and the same also being without Banes or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence;
for which offence they were severally Fined to the
King, and an hundred Marks damages given to the Plaintiff,
and farther ordered by the Council, that they should be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
till they paid their several fines to the King, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
to the Party, and found Sureties to be bound in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognisance
for their good behaviour, for one year, and till
they knew the farther Order of the Council: and these were
the causes which were retorned. And upon this retorn, <hi>Glynn,</hi>
who was of Counsel with the Prisoners, moved many things;
and many of them, as was conceived by the Court, altogether
impertinent. But the Objections which were pertinent were
these. First, That the Councel of the Marches, as this case is,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64899:28"/>
have no Jurisdiction, because the clandestine Marriage is a
thing meerly Spiritual, and therefore not within their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.
The second was, That they have exceeded their
Instructions, in that they have given damages to the party
above fifty pounds. For by their Instructions, they ought not
to hold Plea where the Principal or Damages exceed fifty
pounds. But as to the first he said, there may be this Objection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That they did not punish them for the clande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
which in truth is a thing meerly Spiritual, but for the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Practise and Combination, and for the execution of it.
To which he answered, That they have not Juristiction of
the Principal, and therefore not of the Accessory: (here note
that it was afterwards said by <hi>Bramston</hi> Chief Justice, That
the unlawful Practise and Combination was the Principal,
and the clandestine Marriage but the Accessory; which was not
contradicted by any.) Farther, it was objected by <hi>Glynn,</hi> That
they were Imprisoned for the damages of the Plaintiff, and it
doth not appear, whether it was at the Prayer of the Party,
as he ought by the Law. <hi>Bankes,</hi> the Kings Atturny-General
contrary. And as to the first, Their Instructions give them
power to hold Plea of unlawful Practises and Assemblies:
And this is an unlawful Practise and Assembly, and therefore
within their Instructions: And although that Heresie, and
clandestine Marriage, and such offences, <hi>per se</hi> are not within
their Instructions, yet being clad with such unlawful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
and practises, they are punishable by them. As to the
second he said, The Instruction which restraineth them that
they do not hold Plea above fifty pounds, is only in civil
Actions, at the several suit of the party: But there is another
Instruction, which gives them power, where the cause is cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
to assess damages according to the quality of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and at their discretions. As to the third Objection, he
said, That the Retorn, being that they were in execution for
the damages, it ought to be meant at the Prayer of the Party,
otherwise it could not be. For which causes he prayed th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
the Prisoners might be remanded. And the whole Court
<hi>(Crooke</hi> being absent) were clear upon this Retorn, That they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64899:29"/>
should be remanded; because it appeareth that their Fines to
the King were not payed: And therefore, although that the
other matters had been adjudged for them, yet they ought to
be remanded for that one. And as to the Objections which
were made, the Court agreed with Mr. Attorney, except in
the point of Damages, and for the same reasons given by him.
But as to the point of the Damages, whether they have gone
beyond their Instructions, and so exceeded their power in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
above fifty pounds damages or not; It seemed to the
Court they had; and as it seemed to them, if the Retorn
had been, That the Kings Fines were paid, it would have been
hard to maintain that the assessing above fifty pounds dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
was not out of their Instructions: but because the Kings
Fines were not paid, they were Remanded, without respect
had thereunto; for the reasons given before.</p>
            <p>81. It was said by the Court, That when Judgment is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in this Court against another, and Execution upon it, and
the Sheriff levieth the mony; the Lord Keeper cannot or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the mony shall stay in the Sheriffs hands, or order
that the Plaintiff shall not call for it: for notwithstanding
such Order he may call for it. And it was farther said by the
Court, That an Attachment shall not be granted against the
High Sheriff for the contempt of his Bayliffs. And a Writ
of Error is a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to an Execution; but then there
ought to be notice given to the Sheriff: otherwise, if he not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
serve the Execution, he shall not run in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
for which an Attachment shall be granted.</p>
            <p>82. <hi>Serjeant Callis</hi> came into Court, and moved this case:
<hi>Chapman</hi> against <hi>Chapman,</hi> in Trespass done in Lands within
the Dutchy of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> which were Borough-English, where
the custome was, that if there were an estate in Fee in those
Lands, that they should go to the younger Son, according
tthe custome; but if in Tail, the should descend to the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64899:29"/>
Heir at Common Law: And it was moved by him, that the
custom was not good, because it cannot be at one time cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomary,
and go according to the custom, and at another
guildable. And the whole Court <hi>(Crooke</hi> only being absent)
were against him, that the custom was good.</p>

at issue, and found for the Plaintiff. <hi>Glynn</hi> moved in arrest
of Judgment, that the Issue was ill joyned, because it was not
a direct affirmative, but by inducement only. And the whole
Court was against him. And Justice <hi>Iones</hi> said, That if I say,
that not only Mr. <hi>Glynn</hi> hath been at such a place, but also
Mr. <hi>Iones,</hi> without doubt it is a good affirmative, that both
have been there. But they all agreed, that the pleading was

thus: <hi>A.</hi> wife of <hi>I.S.</hi> intestate, promiseth to <hi>B.</hi> to whom Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
was committed, that if he shall relinquish the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
at the request of <hi>C.</hi> and suffer <hi>A.</hi> to Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
that <hi>A.</hi> will discharge <hi>B.</hi> of two Bonds. In <hi>Assumpsit</hi>
brought by <hi>B.</hi> in the common Pleas, he alledged that he did
renounce Administration, and suffered <hi>A.</hi> to Administer, and
that <hi>A.</hi> had not discharged him of the two Bonds. And it
was found for the Plaintiff. And thereupon Error was
brought, because <hi>B.</hi> doth not shew, that he did renounce the
Administration at the request of <hi>C.</hi> And <hi>Rolls</hi> for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff,
in the writ of Error, did assign the same for Error. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<hi>Barckley</hi> (all the other Justices being absent) held that it
was Error; for consideration is a thing meritorious, and all
ought to be performed, as well the request on the part of <hi>C.</hi>
as the permission of the part of <hi>B.</hi> which ought to be shewed:
For perhaps <hi>B.</hi> was compelled to relinquish it in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Court, as it might be; for of right the wife ought
to Administer. And therefore it ought to have been aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that it was at the request of <hi>C.</hi> And therefore, if it had
been that he should renounce at the charge of <hi>C.</hi> it ought to
be averred, that it was at the charge of <hi>C.</hi> And it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed.</p>

Parson also Libelled for Tithes of Conies; and for that also
he granted a Prohibition, for they are not Titheable, if not

               <p>88. IN Debt upon the Statute of 1 <hi>&amp; 2 Phil. &amp; Mar. c.</hi> 12.
the words of which Statute are, <hi>That no man shall take
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64899:30"/>
for keeping in pound, impounding, or poundage of any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of distress, above the sum of four pence, upon pain of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of five pounds, to be paid to the party grieved.</hi> And the
Plaintiff shewed that his Cattle were distreyned and impoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and that the Defendant took of him ten pence for the
poundage: And thereupon the Plaintiff brought an Action
for the penalty of five pounds, and found for the Plaintiff.
And the Judgment was, That he should recover the five
pounds, and damages, <hi>ultra &amp; praeter</hi> the mony taken for
the poundage. And thereupon a Writ of Error was brought,
and three things assigned for Error. First, because the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was brought for the penalty of five pounds only, and not
for the six pence which was taken above the allowance of
the Statute, which ought not to be divided. Which was
answered by Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> (all the other Justices being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
That notwithstanding it is good; for true it is, that he
cannot bring his Action for fifty shillings, part of the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
because it is entire; but here are two several penalties,
and he may divide and disjoyn them if he will, or he may
wave the six pence. For <hi>quilibet potest renunciare, juri pro se
introducto.</hi> The second was, That he doth not demand that
which is <hi>ultra &amp; praeter</hi> the four pence given by the Statute:
and yet the Judgment is given for that, which is not good:
To which Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> said, That the Judgment was good.
For no judgment is given for that which is <hi>ultra &amp; praeter</hi> the
four pence, but only for the four pounds, because he doth not
demand it. And we cannot judge the Judgment to be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
by Implication. The third Objection was, That
Costs and Damages are given, which ought not to be upon a
penal Law. For he ought not to have more than the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
giveth; and therefore upon the Statute of <hi>Perjury,</hi> no
Costs are given: so upon the Statute of <hi>Gloucester</hi> of Wast,
the Plaintiff shall recover no more than the treble value. But
<hi>Rolls</hi> who was on the contrary, said, That there are many
presidents in the common Pleas, that Damages have been
given upon this Statute. But <hi>Barckley</hi> and <hi>Iones,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
came, and seemed to agree with Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64899:31"/>
the whole, was against it, That no Damages ought to be
given; and desired that the Presidents might be viewed. But
here <hi>Rolls</hi> offered this difference: Where the penalty given
by the Statute is certain, as here, upon which he may bring
Debt, there he shall recover Damages: but where the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
is uncertain, as upon the Statute of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> for tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

have certainty; but here it is not shewed, what Corn it
was. And the <hi>Anglicè</hi> is void, and therefore no more than
Trover and Conversion of so many Sheaves, which is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
incertain; and therefore not good. The other thing
is, That the Plaintiff sayth, that the conversion was <hi>ad usum
ipsorum,</hi> which cannot be, for the wife hath no property du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the life of the husband; and therefore cannot be <hi>ad usum
ipsorum.</hi> And he cited two Judgments in the point, where it
was adjudged accordingly. And Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> said, that it
had been many times so adjudged. But Justice <hi>Iones</hi> said, that
there may be a Conversion by the wife to her use, as in this
case to bake the Barley into bread, and to eat it her self.
And <hi>Bramston</hi> Chief Justice said, that a wife hath a capacity
to take to her own use; for there ought of necessity to be
property in the wife, before the husband can have by gift in
Law: and they desired to see Presidents. And therefore it
was adjourned, as to this point. But by the whole Court, the
other was not good.</p>

               <p>95. <hi>MAynard</hi> for the Plaintiff, in the Writ of Error, That
the Judgment was erroneous: First, because the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
and costs were given, where none ought to be given,
being a penal Law: and therefore no more than the penalty
shall be recovered. And he remembred the rule taken in <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi>
case. 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 116. a. and he cited divers Presidents also
for it. <hi>Cokes</hi> Book of <hi>Entries 31 &amp;</hi> 41. And Presidents
upon the Statute of <hi>Perjury.</hi> 38, 39. Secondly, because he
divided the Penalty given by the Statute, which ought not to
be, for by such means the offender should be doubly vext;
for he might sue him after for the six pence <hi>praeter &amp; ultra</hi>
that which was taken for the distress. And he said, it is like
to the case of an Annuity, which is entire and cannot be
divided. Thirdly, he said, That the Judgment it self was
erroneous, because that Judgment is given for more than he
demands. For the Judgment is, <hi>quod recuperet 5. li. ultra &amp;
praeter,</hi> that which is above the 4 <hi>d.</hi> given by the Statute.
<hi>Rolls</hi> contrary, that the Damages and Costs are well given;
and the same is out of the rule of <hi>Pilfords</hi> case: because that
the Action is no new action, but the thing is a new thing, for
which the old Action is given: And the Damages and Costs
are here given for the Suit and Delay, and not for the Offence.
And he cited also Presidents for him, <hi>viz.</hi> The new Book of
<hi>Entries</hi> 163, 164. For the second point, he said, That they
are several penalties which are given, and therefore he might
bring his Action severally for them, if he would. As to the
third point, That Judgment is given for more than the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
declares: it is not so, for then the Judgment shall be
made vitious by Implication, which ought not to be. And as to
dividing of the penalty and Judgment, the same was good
by the whole Court, for the reasons before given. As to
the giving of Costs, <hi>Iones</hi> and <hi>Bramston</hi> Chief Justice concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that they were well assessed, upon the presidents before
cited: But <hi>Barckley</hi> doubted thereof, and did conceive that

no costs should be given in this case, and that upon <hi>Pilfords</hi>

pleading) What estate <hi>Dawes</hi> the Conusee hath before
Entry, the Deed not being inrolled. For it was agreed by the

there was an Action brought before the Council of the

was, Whether the Rent were in satisfaction of her Dowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have Jurisdiction. But <hi>Iones</hi> and <hi>Barckley</hi> Justices, were of a

               <p>100 Serjeant <hi>Iermayn</hi> came into the Court, and shewed
cause why a Prohibition should not be granted in the case of
<hi>Skinner</hi> before; who Libelled for Tythes of Coppice rooted
up. He agreed that for timber-trees, above the growth of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
no Tithes should be paid; and so he said was the common
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64899:34"/>
Law, before the Statute of 45 <hi>E.</hi> 3. which was but a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Common Law. And he said, That as the body
of the tree is priviledged, so are the branches and root also;
which is a proof, that where the body is not priviledged, there
neither shall be the root <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or branches. And in our Case he
Libels for roots of underwoods, and the underwood it self
being titheable, therefore the roots shall be also tithable.
And he said, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> are not parcel of the Land. But
Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> was against it; for they are not <hi>crescentia,</hi> nor
<hi>renovantia,</hi> as Tithes ought to be; and therefore no Tithes
ought to be paid for them: and he said, that a Prohibition
hath many times been granted in the like cases. But Dr. <hi>Skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
did alledge a custome for the payment of Tithes of them.
And upon that they were to go to trial: And here it was
said, that Dr. <hi>Skinner</hi> had used to have some special particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
benefit of the Parishioners, in lieu of Tithe of Roots. And
thereupon <hi>Barckley</hi> said, That it is a Rule, where the Parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
doth any thing which he is not compellable by the Law
to do, which cometh to the benefit of the Parson; there if
he demand Tithes of the thing, in lieu whereof this is done,
that a Prohibition shall be granted. And there is another
rule: That Custom may make that titheable, which of it self
is not titheable. And here he said to Dr. <hi>Skinner</hi> being then in
Court, That he had two matters to help him, and if any of
them be found for him, that a Prohibition ought not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</p>
               <p>101. Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> said, That if a man be living at the
day of <hi>Nisi prius,</hi> and dieth before the day in Banck, the
Writ shall not abate. So if a man be living the first day of the

                  </gap>rliament, and dieth before the last day, yet he may be At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted:
and the reason is, because in the eye and judgment
of Law, they are but one day by relation, which the Law
makes.</p>
               <p>102. There were three Brothers, the Eldest took Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the goods of the Father, and after Debts and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64899:35"/>
Legacies paid, the younger Brothers sued the eldest in the
Ecclesiastical Court, to compel him to distribute the Estate.
And thereupon a Prohibition was prayed, and denied by the
Court: for they having Jurisdiction of the Principal, may
have Jurisdiction of the Accessary.</p>
               <p>103. <hi>A.</hi> Libelled against <hi>B.</hi> in the Spiritual Court, for
these words: <hi>Thou art a Drunkard, and usest to be Drunk thrice
a week.</hi> And upon that 150 <hi>Caroli,</hi> in Easter-Term (as you
may see before) a Prohibition was prayed, and granted. And
now <hi>Littleton</hi> the Kings Sollicitor came in Court, and moved
for a Consultation: and he said, that the Statute of <hi>Articuli
Cleri</hi> gave power unto the Ecclesiastical Court to have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nusance
of those and the like words. <hi>Register 49 F. N. B.</hi> 51.
They may hold plea for defamation; as for calling Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,
or Usurer. 13 <hi>H. 7. Kellaway. 27 H.</hi> 8. 14. And he
cited many Judgments in the like cases, where Prohibitions
had not been granted: and amongst others this Case. <hi>Mich.
20 Iac. inter Lewis &amp; Whitton</hi> Libel in the Ecclesiastical
Court, for calling him Pander, and no prohibition granted.
And the like Case was for calling another Pimp, and no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
granted. Justice <hi>Iones:</hi> That a Prohibition should
be granted; for they have conusance of defamation, for any
thing which is meerly Spiritual, or which doth concern it,
where they have conusance of the principal, else not: as in
Heresie, Adultery, and the like: but in this Case they have not
Conusance of the principal. True it is, that it is <hi>peccatum:</hi>
But if they should punish every thing which is Sin, they
would altogether derogate, and destroy the Temporal Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
And therefore if I say, that another is an Idle man,
or envious, these are deadly Sins; and yet they have not
Conusance of them. And he cited <hi>Coltrops</hi> Case, adjudged
in the Common pleas, which was our very Case in point:
and there he said that upon solemn debate it was adjudged,
That a Prohibition should be awarded. <hi>Bramston</hi> Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
agreed. <hi>Barckley</hi> contrary, That a Consultation should
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64899:35"/>
be awarded: and he said, in many Cases, although they have
Jurisdiction of the principal, yet they shall not have Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance;
as in the Case of 22 <hi>E. 4. tit' Consultation.</hi> But he
said, that the Offence of Drunkenness is mixt, and is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against the Spiritual, and Common Law also; and if
it be mixt, both may hold plea: and Adultery and Murder
are the common effects of Drunkenness; which are offences
against both Laws, and therefore he shall be punished by both.
But yet <hi>Barckley</hi> yielded to the Judgment cited by <hi>Iones.</hi>
And therefore the whole Court <hi>(Crooke</hi> being absent) was,
That a prohibition should be awarded.</p>
               <p>104. <hi>Rolls</hi> moved this Case: The Parishioners of a certain
Parish in <hi>Devonshire,</hi> did alledge a Custom to chuse the two
Churchwardens of the Parish, and they did so; the Parson
chose another: and the Archdeacon swore one of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens
chosen by the Parish, and refused to swear the other,
but would have sworn him who was chosen by the Parson.
And because they did refuse him, they were Excommunicate.
<hi>Rolls</hi> prayed a <hi>Mandat</hi> to the Archdeacon, to compel him to
swear the other chosen by the Parish; and a Prohibition also,
by reason of the Excommunication. And he cited a preee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
for it, which was the case of <hi>Sutton-Valence</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi>
And the whole Court <hi>(Crooke</hi> being absent) inclined to grant
them: for they said, they conceived no difference betwixt
<hi>London</hi> and the Country, as to that purpose: for as in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
they are a Corporation, and may take Land for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the Church: So throughout <hi>England,</hi> they are a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,
and capable to take, and purchase Goods for the
benefit of the Church. And therefore they did conceive there
was no difference. See the case before, the case of the Parish
of Saint <hi>Ethelborough, London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>105. <hi>Keeling</hi> moved to quash an Indictment of Rescous,
because it is shewed that the Rescous was at <hi>W.</hi> and doth not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64899:36"/>
shew that <hi>W.</hi> was within this County; and if it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the County, then it was an Escape, and no Rescous: And
we cannot aver in this case, that it was out of the County.
Farther, it was not shewed where the Rescous was, so that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the matter it is no Arrest; nor was the Indictment <hi>vi &amp;
armis,</hi> as it ought to be. As to the first, the Court strongly
inclined, that they might well intend it to be within the
County, because the Indictment says, <hi>in Com. meo. apud W.
tent.</hi> But for the other Exceptions, the Indictment was quash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>106. In Trespass of Assault and Battery, and Wounding,
the Defendant pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> as to the Wounding; and
pleaded special matter of justification as to the Assault and
Battery; and found for the Plaintiff; and it was moved in
arrest of Judgment, That the plea was repugnant, for As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
and Battery doth imply Wounding, and therefore it is
repugnant for him to justifie it, for it is a confession of woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
But Justice <hi>Crooke</hi> and Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> (the others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
absent) were clear, that the plea was good; for so is the
common form of pleading: and farther, he might be guilty
of the Battery, and not of the wounding: for <hi>Crooke</hi> said,
Wounding implied Assault and Battery; but not <hi>è contra.</hi>

But <hi>Rolls</hi> contrary, and here is no variance: for the alledging
of striking of the horse was only inducement to alledge the

which could not be, if he were not lawful Tenant; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
adjudged good, notwithstanding that general allegation.
See new Book of <hi>Entries, Mollins</hi> case, 98, 99. a strong case

to shew the Inrolment; and for these reasons, prayed
Judgment for the Plantiff. Serjeant <hi>Wild</hi> for the Defendant,
That the shewing of the Inrolment is not helped by the Issue
joyned, being matter of substance; for he saith, that <hi>virtute
cujus,</hi> and of the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of uses, that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
was seised, and we ought not to intend an Estate by any
other means or seisin, than himself hath alledged. And th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64899:37"/>
it ought to be adjudged upon his own pleading, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Defendant hath any estate without inrolment or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
by force of the Statute of Uses. And I conceive he hath
not. True it is, that all circumstances ought not to be pleaded,
but the substance, <hi>viz.</hi> the Inrolment; and therefore it ought
to be pleaded, as <hi>Fulmerston</hi> and <hi>Stewards</hi> case is in the
Commentaries, and 2 <hi>Eliz. Dyer.</hi> And no estate passeth
without Inrolment: not a Fee-simple; for then there ought
to be Inrolment according to the Statute: and no estate at
will can pass without Entry, for that is as <hi>opposit' in objecto,</hi>
that a man shall be tenant at will against his will; for his
Entry proves his intent to hold at will. For <hi>Littleton</hi> saith,
By force whereof he is possessed; so that there ought to be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
to make an Estate at will. And in case of a Lease for
years, although it be true that he is a Lessee for years to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
purposes before Entry, yet an Entry ought to be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And <hi>Dyer</hi> 14. is <hi>non habuit; non occupavit</hi> is no good
plea in a Lease for years; contrary in the case in a Lease at
will; which is a strong proof, that he is not Lessee at will
before entry. 3 <hi>Iac.</hi> betwixt <hi>Bellingham</hi> and <hi>Fitzherbert.
5 El. Dyer. 10 Eliz. Mockets case, &amp; Mich. 15 Iac.</hi> betwixt <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry</hi>
and <hi>Stacie,</hi> resolved that a release to the Bargainee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Inrolment is not good: And by consequence he hath not
an estate at will before Inrolment, or Entry made; for if he
had, the Release should be good. 18 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Lord <hi>Lovells</hi>
case, that no estate at Will. Lastly, <hi>Parrolls font plea,</hi> and the
case of a man shall not be taken to be otherwise than he hath
pleaded it; and he having pleaded that <hi>virtute cujus,</hi> and of
the Statute of Uses, that the Defendant was seised, he shall
be concluded thereby. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. A man shewed, that another
licenced him to enter into his land and occupy for a year, it is
not good, but he ought to plead it as a Lease. Besides, the
<hi>virtute cujus</hi> is not traversable, as the 11 <hi>Rep. Pridle</hi> and
<hi>Nappers</hi> case is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Rolls</hi> accord, and he said, That if it shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued,
That the Conusee shall have an estate by Disseisin, the
Plaintiff ought to plead it, that the Defendant was seised by
way of disseisin. And where it was objected, That this is a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64899:37"/>
Writ, and not a Declaration, he answered, It is a Writ and
Declaration also; and therefore he ought to declare his case
at large, and the defect of the Conveyance, <hi>viz.</hi> the want of
Inrolment is not supplied by the <hi>virtute cujus.</hi> And he having
made that his Title, you ought to judge upon it, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.
But the whole Court, <hi>viz. Bramston</hi> Ch. Just. <hi>Crooke,
Iones,</hi> and <hi>Barckley,</hi> Justices, That the <hi>Scire facias</hi> was good,
for it was said that the Defendant <hi>perquisivit sibi &amp; heredibus
suis,</hi> and concludes, <hi>virtute cujus,</hi> and of the Statute of Uses,
he was seised; which is a good averment that he hath a Fee,
and it was not material how he hath it: and he need not
shew his Title so fully, being a stranger to it. And this being
an equitable Action, if the Court upon this Writ shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
sufficient matter, upon which the Plaintiff may bring his
Action, it is good: and the Court ought to give Judgment
for him: for being but matter of form, it is not material, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
a <hi>Demurrer</hi> had been special upon it. And wheresoever
there is damnification, there the Court ought to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the Plaintiff, notwithstanding a defect of form in the
Writ. And <hi>Barckley</hi> said, That if a man be seised of <hi>Bl.</hi> acre and
<hi>Wh.</hi> acre, and acknowledgeth a Statute; and afterwards makes
a Lease for years of <hi>Wh.</hi> acre, the remainder over in Fee, &amp; then
the Conusee purchase <hi>Bl.</hi> acre, and extendeth the land of the
Lessee for years; he held, that he in the remainder should
have an <hi>Audita querela,</hi> or a <hi>Scire facias</hi> for the damnification,
which came to his interest. And he held, that he who had but
<hi>interesse termini</hi> should have an <hi>Audita querela,</hi> That one joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
only might have an <hi>Audita querela,</hi> and that the death of
one of them should not abate the Writ. And he held that <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stui
que use</hi> before the Statute, might have an <hi>Audita querela:</hi>
all which proves it to be but an equitable Action, upon which
the Law doth not look with so strict an eye, as upon other
Actions. And as to the Objection which was made by <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that he ought to shew, That the Conusee had an estate by

And by the whole Court <hi>(Crooke</hi> only absent) they
cannot do it, for after a <hi>transmittitur,</hi> they have not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord

stands betwixt the Common Pleas and the Kings Bench,
and betwixt the Kings Bench and the Exchequer. For the
Record remains always in this Court, notwithstanding a Writ
of Error brought in the Exchequer-chamber; and therefore
we may amend after. Wherefore the Court said, that if the

Action of Debt in the right of the Wife, as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministratrix
to <hi>I. S.</hi> And the Defendant being arrested at
their suit, did promise to the Husband, in consideration that
the Husband would suffer him to go at large, that he would
give him so much. The husband and wise did joyn in an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon the Case, upon the promise made to the husband
alone. And upon <hi>Non assumpsit</hi> pleaded, it was found for the
Plaintiff. <hi>Porter</hi> moved in arrest of Judgment, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
being made to the husband only, that they ought not to
joyn in the Action. <hi>Barckley:</hi> the Action is well brought, for the
husband is Administrator in the right of the wife: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the consideration were not good. For if he were not
Administrator, then he could not suffer him to go at large:
and then if he be Administrator in the right of his wife, the
promise which is made to the husband, is in judgment of
Law also made to the wise; and they ought to joyn in the
Action. But <hi>Crooke Iones,</hi> and <hi>Bramston</hi> Chief Justice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

And they said (against the Opinion of <hi>Barckley)</hi> that

that so had been the Opinion of the Court, where the party
pleads the <hi>Modus,</hi> and where not; for if he plead it, there
notwithstanding a Sentence, Prohibition hath been granted;

the Court refused to grant a Prohibition.</p>
               <p>112. The Parishioners of a Parish, together with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

render Accompt, and recovered against them, and Costs taxed.
Afterwards the Parson released the Costs, and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Parishioners sued for the Costs: and thereupon a
Prohibition was prayed; because that the Costs are joyntly
assessed, and the release of one would bar the others. But
the Opinion of the whole Court, that a Prohibition shall not
be granted: For the costs recovered there, an Action might be
sued in the Ecclesiastical Court: and therefore although that
in our Law, the release of one shall bar the others; yet the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>113. IN Debt upon a Bond, the Defendant prayed Oyer
of the Condition, which was entred, <hi>in haec venba.
The Condition of this Obligation is such, That if the Obligor
did deliver to the Plaintiffs two hundred weight of Hops in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of ten pounds already paid, and fifty five pound to be
paid at the delivery; and the Plaintiffs to chuse them out of
twenty four Bags of the Obligors own growing, and to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
at</hi> F. <hi>at a day certain. Provided, that if the Plaintiffs
should dislike their Bargain, that then they should lose their ten
pounds: and if they liked they should give ten pounds more,</hi>
&amp;c. Upon Oyer of which, the Defendant pleaded, that
the Plaintiffs <hi>non elegerunt.</hi> And upon that the Plaintiffs
did Demur in Law: and shewed for special cause of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer,
that the Plea was double. <hi>Withrington</hi> for the
Plaintiffs, that the Plea is double, in that the Defendant hath
alledged, that he was ready, and that the Plaintiffs <hi>non ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerunt;</hi>
which are both issuable pleas, and each of them, of
it self (admitting no request of the part of the Defendant
requisite) is sufficient in bar of the Action. Besides, he
conceived, as this case is, that the first act ought to be done
by the Defendant; for he ought to shew the bags, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
the Plaintiffs to make election. And he compared it
to the case in 44 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 43. and also to <hi>Hawlins</hi> case, 5 <hi>Rep.
22.</hi> Farther, he conceived that the Defendant ought to have
alledged, that he had twenty four bags, and twenty four bags
of his own growing: for if he have not them, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for the Plaintiffs to make choice, and by consequence
the condition broken. <hi>Twisden</hi> contrary, That the plea is
not double, for the alledging himself to be ready, was but
inducement to the subsequent matter, <hi>quod non elegerunt.</hi> And
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64899:39"/>
he relied only upon their election; and in proof thereof he
relied upon the Books, 1 <hi>H<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 7. 16. and 24 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 19. Farther,
here no notice is requisite, not he ought not to aver that he
had them; for he being bound to deliver them, he is estopt to
say that he hath them not. 19 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 314. and 3 <hi>Eliz.

                  </gap> bags for them to make choice of. And
the whole Court strongly enclined against the Plaintiffs, for
the reasons before given, and they advised them to waive the
Demurrer, and plead <hi>de novo;</hi> which they did.</p>

               <p>114. IN an Action upon the Case upon <hi>Assumpsit,</hi> it was
agreed by the whole Court, That where there is a
mutual promise, <hi>viz. A.</hi> promiseth to <hi>B.</hi> that he will do
such a thing; and <hi>B.</hi> promiseth to <hi>A.</hi> that in consideration
thereof, that he will do another thing; If <hi>A.</hi> bring an Action
against <hi>B.</hi> and alledge a breach <hi>in non faciendo,</hi> and saith that
he is ready to do the thing which he promised, but that the
other refused to accept of it: Notwithstanding the breach
is well laid, and the Action well lieth; for it was idle, and
more than the Plaintiff was compelled to do, to shew that
<hi>paratus est</hi> to do the thing which he promised: So that if
there were a breach upon the part of the Defendant, it is
sufficient, and if there was a breach on the Plaintiffs part,
the Defendant ought to bring his Action for it. And the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
was taken by <hi>Bramston,</hi> Where the promise is conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and where absolute, as in our case. And agreeing with
this difference, it was said at the Bar and Bench, That it was
adjudged.</p>
               <p>115. <hi>Hutton</hi> moved to quash certain Presentments, because
they were taken in a Hundred-Court, which is not the Kings
Court; and therefore <hi>coram non Iudice.</hi> It was said by Justice

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64899:40"/>
then they were lawfully taken. <hi>Barckley</hi> and the whole Court
answered, because it doth not appear to the Court, whether
there was so or not, that the Presentments were void.</p>
               <p>116. Concerning damage clear, It was agreed, that it was
hard that the Plaintiff should be stopt of his Judgment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he had paid his damages clear. For perhaps, if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
be <hi>insolvant,</hi> the Plaintiff should pay more for da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
clear, than he should ever get. And therefore the
Court was resolved to amend it. This damage clear, is twelve
pence in the pound of the damages given to the party in this
Court, and two shillings in the Common pleas. See the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister,</hi>

Case, upon a promise for divers Wares and

the plea was holden to be no good plea; wherefore Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

That <hi>A.</hi> should sell to <hi>B.</hi> all his Mercery Wares, and take his

and his wife ten pounds, at a place out of the Jurisdiction,
And thereupon, upon an Action brought upon the Bond, a
Breach was assigned for not payment of the mony at the
place. And here it was objected, That it was Error, because
it was there assigned, for Breach, the not payment of the
mony at a place out of Jurisdiction: and for that cause the
Judgment was not well given. Secondly, because that the

And where it was before objected, The great inconvenience

though that Alimony be expressed in their Commission, that

should be useless, if they might not do it: and therefore he

But they doubted whether the citing out of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
were good or not, for the great prejudice which might
ensue to the party in losing his Appeal. And in answer to
the Objection of <hi>Rolls,</hi> the Chief Justice said, That the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical

had, yet all the Jurisdiction of the Spiritual Court is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

them. And a Prohibition was prayed, and granted by all the

               <p>142. A woman brought a Writ of Dower, and recovered,
and upon a suggestion made upon the Roll that the husband
died seised, a Writ of enquiry of Damages issued forth. And
before the Retorn thereof, a Writ of Error was brought; and it
was by <hi>Steward</hi> against <hi>Steward;</hi> and two things were moved:
1. Whether Error would lie before the Retorn of the Writ
of Enquiry, or not. 2. Whether the Writ of Error be a <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeas</hi>
to the Writ of Enquiry. And by <hi>Taylor</hi> and <hi>Rolls</hi>
Serjeants, That Error doth not lie before Judgment upon the
Writ of Enquiry. And this case they compared to <hi>Medcalfes</hi>
case 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 38. But by Serjeant <hi>Bacon</hi> it is well brought.
Dower is by the Common Law, and damages are given by
the Statute of <hi>Merton,</hi> and that is the main Judgment. 5. <hi>Rep.

and distinguished from other cases. And it was argued by
another Serjeant, That the Error was well brought, because
that in Dower the Judgment doth determine the Original:
and therefore at the Common Law Error will well lie. And
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64899:46"/>
the damages are given by the Statute of <hi>Merton,</hi> but that
doth not alter the Judgment, or the nature of the Action.
It differs from the case of Judgment in an <hi>Ejectione firme,</hi>

is given. No Error lieth before Judgment be given for the
other: for the whole matter is not determined. But in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

was ruled and resolved, That a Writ of Error brought, was
not a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to the Writ of Enquiry of damages. But it
was resolved by all the Judges, that the Error was well
brought, for the reasons before given: and that Error is a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persedeas</hi>

levied a Fine and died, Tenant for life died, the

the Unkle who levied the Fine should be barred or not:
<hi>Iones:</hi> that it should; his chief reason was, because the
Son must make his conveyance by the Father, and as to him
he is barred. As in a Writ of Right, he ought of necessity
to name his Father, and that by way of Title, so here. But
<hi>Crooke</hi> and <hi>Barckley</hi> contrary; and their reason was, because
that here the Issue of the Unkle doth not claim in the right
line, but in the collateral. Secondly, because the naming of the

only. Note, that Serjeant <hi>Rolls</hi> in the Argument of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants

a release to one, shall discharge both. <hi>Rolls</hi> contrary, that it

that no attaint will lie upon such uncertain Verdict, so as the

there damages are only to be recovered, but in an <hi>Ejectione

That although the certainty may appear to the Jury, yet that
is not enough, for they ought to give judgment, <hi>&amp; oportet quod

had found him guilty of a Room, it had been good, and so

Law takes notice. The Opinion of <hi>Crawley,</hi> wherefore the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict

although the Jury found it in <hi>tanto,</hi> &amp;c. And where there

against the Prohibition, for he said the Defendant had exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited

ought to have demurred to the Jurisdiction; and he said that
where parties assent to a Decree, there the Kings Bench will
not grant a Prohibition. For he said, that by the same reason
that a man may chuse Arbitrators, he may elect his Judges;

found to be indebted unto the other party, in so much mony

for her life, and after her decease to <hi>I. S.</hi> and died. <hi>I. S.</hi> in the
life of the wife did commence Suit in the Court of Equity,
there to secure his Interest in Remainder, and thereupon this
Prohibition was prayed. And the Justices, <hi>viz. Banks</hi> Chief
Justice, <hi>Crawley, Foster (Reeve</hi> being absent) upon considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the point before them, did grant a Prohibition, and the
reason was because the devise in the remainder of goods was
void, and therefore no remedy in equity, for <hi>Aequitas sequitu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

6. 30. Br. Devise</hi> 13. and <hi>Com. Welkden &amp; Elkingtons</hi> Case,
betwixt the devise of the use and occupation of goods, and the
devise of goods themselves. For where the goods themselves
are devised, there can be no Remainder over; otherwise,
where the use or occupation only is devised. It is true that
heir looms shall descend, but that is by custome and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of them, and also it is true that the devise of the use and
occupation of Land is a devise of the land it self, but not so
in case of goods, for one may have the occupation of the
goods, and another the Interest, and so it is where a man
pawns goods and the like: For which cause the Court all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed

Plaintiffs Attorneys hand, <hi>ad libitum defendentis, &amp;c.</hi> And
the Plaintiff doth not aver that a note was delivered by
the Attorney of the Plaintiff to the Defendant; and the

Plaintiff, and it was moved in arrest of Judgment for the
reason given before: <hi>Rolls</hi> contrary, that there needs no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment,
and he said it was <hi>Wilmots</hi> case adjudged in this
Court, <hi>Hill. 15 Car.</hi> where the Case was, that the Defendant
should pay to the Plaintiff such costs as shall be delivered by
note of the Attorneys hand: and it was here adjudged that
there needs no averment, because it was to be done by a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
but otherwise it had been, if it had been to be done by the
Plaintiff himself: and by the Justices, the only question here
is, Whether the Attorney shall be taken for a stranger or
not? Justice <hi>Foster:</hi> that the Defendant ought first to make
his election; which is, to pay either the eight pound which is
certain, or the costs which shall be delivered by a note of the
Attorney. Besides, here the Attorney is a stranger, because the
suit is ended, and to the Defendant he is totally a stranger,
and therefore he ought to seek him to have the note delivered
to him. But notwithstanding he did conceive that as this
Case is, Judgment ought to be stayed, because the Plaintiff
hath not well entitled himself to the Action, because he hath
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64899:56"/>
not averred that there were costs expended in such a suit: and

notice: and if the Case had been such, that the Plaintiff him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

And I conceive, that if the Case had been that the Plaintiffs

the Attorney be a stranger or not? and I conceive that
it is not in the power of the Plaintiff to compel him to bring
the note, and is all one as a stranger, and therefore the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

that it was taken by Piracie and not by Letters of Mart, as

by <hi>Foster</hi> a Prohibition ought to be granted, for whether the

and so he said it was adjudged in such a case, for whether the

of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that by this means you should take

which he said lieth of a Ship, or Trover and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and so have had the matter found specially. <hi>Bankes</hi> Chief
Justice conceived that there should be a Prohibition, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
upon such pretence that it was not lawful prize, and
by consequence the sale void, you would utterly take away
the Jurisdiction of the Common Law. But because there was
some misdemeanor in the Vendee, the Court would not award
a Prohibition, but awarded that the buyer should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
time given him by the Court of Admiralty to find
out the seller to maintain his Title, and in the mean time that
he give good caution in the Admiralty, that if it be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

               <p>189. <hi>RVdston</hi> brought an Action of debt upon an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against <hi>Yates</hi> for not performance of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
according to the Condition of the Bond: the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
pleaded that the Arbitrators <hi>Non fecerunt arbitrium,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they were at issue, and found for the Plaintiff; and
it was now moved in arrest of Judgment by <hi>Trevor,</hi> that the
Defendant was an Infant, and therefore that the submission
was void, and by consequence the Bond which did depend
upon it: and he conceived the submission void, First, because it
is a Contract, and an Infant cannot contract: and he took a
difference betwixt acts done which are <hi>ex provisione legis,</hi> and
acts done <hi>ex provisione</hi> of the Infant; an Infant may bind
himself for his diet, schooling and necessary apparel, for
that is the provision of the Law for his maintenance; but a
Bond for other matters, or Contracts of other nature which
are of his own provision, those he cannot do. Secondly, an
Arbitrator is a Judge; and if an Infant should be permitted
to make an Arbitrator, he should make a Judge, who by the
Law is not permitted to make an Attorny, which were against
reason. Thirdly, it is against the nature of a Contract, which
must be reciprocally binding; here the Infant should not be
bound, and the man of full age should be, which should be a
great mischief. And where it is objected, it may be for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit:
To that he answered, that the Law will not leave that
to him to judge what shall be for his benefit, what not: and to
this purpose amongst other he cited it to be adjudged, That
where an Infant took a shop for his trading, rendring ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and in debt brought for the rent the Infant pleaded his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie,
the other replied that it was for his benefit and liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that Judgment might be stayed. <hi>Bramston, Heath</hi> and <hi>Mallet</hi>
Justices, <hi>(Barckley</hi> being then impeached for High Treason by
the Parliament) were clear of Opinion, That the submission by
an Infant was void; and they all agreed, That if the Infant was
not bound, that the man of full age should not be bound; so
that it should be either totally good, or totally void. But
<hi>Ward</hi> who was of Counsel with the Plaintiff said, that the
case was not that the infant submitted himself to the award,
but that a man of full age bound himself, that the Infant
should perform the Award, which was said by the Court quite
to alter the Case. To that <hi>Trevor</hi> said, that the case is all
one; for there cannot be an Award if there be not first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
submission: and then the submission being void, the Award
will be void, and so by consequence the Bond: and to prove
it, he cited 10 <hi>Rep. 171. b.</hi> where it was adjudged that the
non-performance of a void Award did not forfeit the Bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the reason wherefore the party himself was bound to appear

               <p>191. One said of Mr. <hi>Hawes</hi> these words, <hi>viz. My Cozen</hi>
Hawes <hi>hath spoken against the Book of Common Prayer; and
said it is not fit to be read in the Church:</hi> upon which <hi>Hawes</hi>
brought an Action upon the case, and shewed how that
he was cited into the Ecclesiastical Court by the Defendant,
and had paid several sums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Defendant denied
the speaking of these words: upon which they were at is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
and it was found for the Plaintiff; and now it was moved
by <hi>Keeling</hi> for stay of Judgment, That the words are not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionable;
as to say, A man hath spoken against a penal Law,
which doth not inflict punishment of life and member, will
not bear Action; and the punishment which is inflicted by
the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. is pecuniary only and not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral;
but in default of payment of the sum, that he shall
be imprisoned for such a time, which meerly depends upon the
non-payment, and is incertain: And by the same reason he
said, to say of a man, that he hath not Bowe and Arrows in
his house, or not a Gun: or to say of a man, That he hath
spoken against any penal Law whatsoever, would bear Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which should be unreasonable: wherefore he prayed that
Judgment might be stayed. <hi>Brown</hi> contrary; the words are
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64899:59"/>
actionable, because that if it was true that he spoke them, he
subjected himself to imprisonment by the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
although not directly, yet in default of payment; so as there
might be corporal damage: and to prove it, he cited <hi>Anne
Davies</hi> Case 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 17. a. where it is said, that to say that a
woman hath a Bastard will bear Action, because that if it were
true, she was punishable by the Statute of 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Further,
he said, that if the words are not Actionable, yet the Action
will lie for the special damage, which the Plaintiff hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in the Ecclesiastical Court. Justice <hi>Mallet:</hi> the words
of themselves are not Actionable, because that the corporal
punishment given by the Statute doth depend upon the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment,
and is not absolute of it self; but the Action will
lie for the temporal damage, and therefore he conceived that
the Plaintiff ought to have Judgment. Justice <hi>Heath:</hi> that
the Plaintiff ought to have Judgment for the pecuniary
Mulct is a good cause of Action, there being in default of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a corporal punishment given. But here is not only <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria,</hi>
but <hi>damnum</hi> also; which are the foundations of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon the Case: and if the words of themselves be not
Actionable, yet the Action will lie for the damage that the
Plaintiff here suffered by the citation in the spiritual Court.
<hi>Bramston</hi> Chief Justice doubted it, and he conceived it hard
that the words should bear Action, because as he said the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
punishment doth meerly depend upon the not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and upon the same reason, words upon every penal
Law should bear Action; and therefore this being a lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Case, he took time to consider of it. It was said, To
say of a man, that he had received a Romish Priest, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
Actionable, and that was agreed, because it is Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
At another day the Case was moved again, and Justice
<hi>Mallet</hi> was of the same Opinion as before, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
words themselves were not actionable, but for the special da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
that the Action would lie; and he said, that one said of
another, <hi>That he was a Recusant;</hi> for which an Action was
brought in the Common Pleas, and he conceived the Action
would not lie. Justice <hi>Heath</hi> was of the same Opinion as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the words o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> themselves would bear Actio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64899:59"/>
conceived, That if a man speak such words of another, that if
they were true, would make him liable to a pecuniary, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
punishment, that they would bear an Action, and here
the Plaintiff was endamaged, and therefore without questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they will bear an Action. <hi>Bramston</hi> Chief Justice, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
also; That the words are not Actionable, neither of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
nor for the damage; not of themselves, for no words
which subject a man to a pecuniary Mulct if they were true,
either at the Common Law, or by the Statute, will bear an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
For by the same reason, to say that a man hath ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
a Cottage, or to say that a man hath committed a Riot,
would bear Action, 37 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the <hi>Common Pleas.</hi> One said
of another, <hi>That he did assault me, and took away my Purse
from me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and upon <hi>Not Guilty</hi> pleaded, it was found for the
Plaintiff, and Judgment was stayed, because he might take
his purse from him, and yet be but a Trespasser: So as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that words ought to have a favourable construction, to
avoid multiplicity of Suits: and if these words would bear an
Action, by the same reason words spoken against every penal
Law should bear Action, which against the reason given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should be a means to increase Suits. And he took it for
a rule, If the words import scandal of themselves, by which
damage may accrue, then the words will bear action without
damage, otherwise not, and therefore the damage here shall
not make the words Actionable which of themselves are not
actionable, as I conceive they are not. Besides, by this means
the Act of a third person should prejudice me, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
reason, as here the Act of the Ordinary by the Citation
and damage thereupon accrued, which perhaps might be <hi>ex
officio</hi> only, for which cause he conceived that Judgment
should be stayed, but because there were two Judges against
one, Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

therefore he cited the 8 <hi>Rep. Turners</hi> Case, to which Maynard
replied, that that doth not make it good, because that issue
cannot be taken upon it. At another day, the Judges gave their
Opinions; Justice <hi>Mallet:</hi> That the Plea is not good, because
that it is too general, and <hi>non constat</hi> whether within their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
or not: and where it was objected that he is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the Court, and ought to obey their commands, and
therefore it should go hard that he should be punished for it,
he conceived that there is a difference betwixt an Officer of an
inferiour Court which ousts the Common Law of Jurisdiction,
and one of the four Courts at <hi>Westminster;</hi> for where an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
justifies an Act done by the command of an Inferiour
Court, he ought to shew precisely that it was in a Case with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

the Court, and if he have done his duty, it should be hard that
he should be punished for it: and he agreed that there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt the Act of a Constable and a Justice of Peace,
and the Act of a Servant of a Court, for the Servant ought to
obey his Master; and although it be an inferiour Court, yet it
is a Court of Record, and confirmed by Act of Parliament
and all that is confessed by the Demurrer. <hi>Bramston</hi> Chief
Justice: that the Plea is naught, because that it is too general
and incertain; true it is, that it is hard that the Officer
should be punished in this case for his obedience to which he
is bound, and it is as true that the Officer for doing of an act
by the command of the Court, whether it be just or unjust, is
excused, if it appear that the Court hath Jurisdiction: but
here it doth not appear that the Court hath Jurisdiction; and
if the Court had not Jurisdiction, then it is clear that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
by obeying the Court when they have not Jurisdiction,
doth subject himself to an Action of false imprisonment,
as it is in the Case of the Marshalsy in the 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> but it was

               <head>The Bishop of Hereford and Okeleys Case.</head>
               <p>196. THe Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> brought a Writ of Error a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Okeley,</hi> to reverse a Judgment given in the
Common Pleas: the point was briefly this. One under the
age of twenty three years is presented to a Benefice, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Patron in this case shall have notice, or that lapse
otherwise shall not incur to the Bishop, which is grounded
upon the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 12. And upon debate by the
Counsel of the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error, that which
was said being upon the general Law of notice, nothing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Court against the Judgment given in the Common
Pleas upon solemn debate, as it was said, and therefore they
gave day to shew better matter, or else that Judgment should
be affirmed. The Reasons of the Judgment in the Common
Pleas were two. First, upon the Proviso of the Statute, which
says, That no Lapse shall incur upon any deprivation <hi>ips<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
facto</hi> without notice. Second reason was upon the body of
the Act; which is, That admission, institution, and induction
shall be void, but speaks nothing of presentation; so as the
presentation remaining in force, the Patron ought to have
notice, and that was said was the principal reason upon
which the Judgment was given: and upon the same reasons
the Court here, <hi>viz. Mallet, Heath,</hi> and <hi>Bramston<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Justices, held
clearly that the notice ought to be given, or otherwise that
Lapse shall not incur: but they agreed that if the Act had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided
the presentation also, that in such case the Patron
ought to have taken notice at his peril, being an avoydance
by Statute, if the Proviso help it not.</p>

<hi>B.</hi> brought an Action upon the case, &amp; shewed how
that he got his living by buying and selling, but did not shew
of what profession he was; and by all the Court, <hi>viz. Foster,
Reeve, Crawley,</hi> and <hi>Bankes</hi> in the Common Pleas, the Action
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64899:62"/>
will not lie. First, because he doth not shew of what Trade
or profession he was; and it is too general to say that he got
his living by buying and selling. Secondly, because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that he had shewed of what Trade he was, as that he
was a Mercer, as in truth he was, that yet the words are not
actionable, because there is nothing shewed to be done with
them, or that he used them: and it can be no scandal, if the
words do not import an act done by the false weights, for
he may keep them and yet not use them; and he may keep
them that another do not use them; and the keeping of false
weights is presentable in Leet, if the party use them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
not. And where one said of another, <hi>That he kept a false
Bushel, by which he did cheat and cousen the poor;</hi> the same
was adjudged actionable, that is, True; and differs from this
case, for there he said, he not only kept them, but used them,
and cheated with them; but it is otherwise in our case: and this
case was compared to <hi>Hobarts Reports,</hi> where one said of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
<hi>That he kept men which did rob upon the High-way:</hi>
and adjudged that the words were not actionable, for he
might keep them and not know of it. <hi>Bankes:</hi> the action upon
the case for words is to recover damages: and here it can be
no damage. First, because he doth not shew of what profession
he was: and Secondly, because although he had shewed it,
yet the words will not bear Action: and Judgment was given
against the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>198. It was moved by Serjeant <hi>Wild,</hi> That depositions ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the Ecclesiastical Court might be given in evidence in
a Trial in this Court; and the Court was against it, because
they were not taken in a Court of Record; and they said, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the parties were dead, yet they ought not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed;
and by <hi>Bankes</hi> Chief Justice, no depositions ought to
be allowed which are not taken in a Court of Record. and
<hi>Foster</hi> and <hi>Reeve</hi> were of Opinion, that although the parties
would assent to it, yet they ought not to be given in evidence
against the constant rule in such case. <hi>Crawley</hi> contrary, for
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64899:62"/>
he said, that a writing which by the Law is not Evidence,
might be admitted as Evidence by the consent of the parties.</p>
               <p>200. A man was bound to keep a Parish harmless from
a Bastard-child, and for not performance thereof, the Obligee
brought Debt upon the Bond: the Defendant pleaded that he
had saved the Parish harmless, and did not shew how the
Plaintiff replied, and shewed how that the Parish was war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before the Justices of Peace at the Sessions of Peace, and
was there ordered by Record to pay so much for the keeping
of the childe; and because the Defendant had not saved him
harmless, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Defendant pleaded, <hi>Nul tiel Record,</hi> upon
which the Plaintiff did demur. And here two things were
resolved: First, that the Plea <hi>Nul tiel Record</hi> upon an Order
at Sessions of Peace is a good Plea, because that an Order at
the Sessions of Peace is a Record. Secondly, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Judgment ought to be given for the Plaintiff, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the affirmative that he hath saved the Parish harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and doth not shew how as he ought to have done: but
he ought to have pleaded <hi>non damnificatus,</hi> and that had been
good without any further shewing, which he hath not done,
and therefore the Plea was not good; and it was agreed that
the same was not helped by the Demurrer, because the same
was matter of substance, but the Plaintiff might take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of it notwithstanding, and therefore Judgment was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>201. In Debt Judgment was given against the principal,
whereupon a <hi>Scire facias</hi> issued forth against the Bail, and
Judgment upon <hi>Nihil dicit</hi> was given against them: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Writ of Error was brought, and Error assigned, that there
was no warrant of Attorny filed for the Plaintiff; and upon
debate whether the warrant of Attorny ought to be filed or
on, the Court seemed to incline their opinion upon these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
but gave not any Judgment. First, where it may
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64899:63"/>
appear to the Court, that there was a warrant of Attorny, and
where not. If there was not any warrant of Attorny, there
they cannot order the making of one; but if there was one,
they conceived that they might order the filing of it. Second
difference, Where the warrant wanting, were of the part of
the Defendant, and where of the part of the Plaintiff, in the
Writ of Error: if it be of the part of the Plaintiff, such a
warrant of Attorney shall not be filed, because he shall not
take advantage of his own wrong: the last thing was, where
the Record by the lachess of the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error
is not certified in due time, there the warrant of Attorny shall
be filed: And the Books cited to warrant these differences
were, 2 <hi>H. 8. 28. 7 H. 4. 16. 2 Eliz. Dyer 180. 5 Eliz Dyer

                  </gap>e there is no warrant
of Attorney, and where there is; and he said, there are many
Presidents accordingly, and that the same is holpen by the
Statute of 8 <hi>H. 6. cap.</hi> 1, 2. But <hi>Bankes</hi> Chief Justice contrary,
That it is not helped by the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 6. and so it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved

                  </gap>onotharies
so search Presidents, but yet he said they should not sway him
against the printed Law, because they might pass <hi>sub silentio.</hi>
And the Chief Justice observed also, that the same is not hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
by the Statute of 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> for that helps the want of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of Attorny after Verdict only, and not upon <hi>Nihil dicit,</hi>
as this case is, or upon wager of Law, or upon confession, or
<hi>non sum informatus:</hi> And the Court said, That it shall be a
mischievous case, that Attornies should be suffered to file
their warrants of Attorny when they pleased; and therefore
they gave warning, that none should be filed after the Term,
and willed that the Statute of 18 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 16. should be put
in execution.</p>

First, that it appeareth not by the Certificate, that the

Thirdly, it appears by the Certificate, that it was presented
by the Jury, That the Plaintiff ought to repair such a Wall,
but it is not shewed for what cause; either by reason of
his Land, prescription or otherwise. Fourthly, they present
that there wants reparation, but doth not shew that it lies

it is presented that such a Wall wanted reparation, and the
Commissioners assessed the Plaintiff for reparation of that

that the Plaintiff ought for to repair it; whereas they ought
to have done it upon presentment, and not upon informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

the Plaintiff, and for not payment sold the distress, which by
the Law they ought not to do, for that enables them only
to distrein; and it was intended by the Statute, that a Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin

upon which they were at issue, and the <hi>Venire facias</hi> was

now it was moved in arrest of Judgment, that it was a mis-tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
because the <hi>Venire facias</hi> ought to have been of the body
of the County, and not of the City, which was also a County
of it self: but it was resolved by the Judges, <hi>viz. Foster, Reeve,</hi>

the trial was good: and this resolution was grounded upon the

the Law (as was agreed) in point to this case, but the Case a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid.
And it was taken for a rule, that where it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
upon the Record, that there is a more proper place for
trial, than where the trial was, that there the trial is good: but
here is not a more proper place. Further, the chief Justice said,
that it was not possible to be tried in the body of the County,
because that the payment was to be in the City; and he said, it
is true, that if a man speak generally of the County of <hi>Lincoln;</hi>
it shall be intended of the body of the County, and not the
City, because that the City is but derivative out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:

of a County, not of a particular liberty: Yet it was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
here, because the trial was in the most proper place, and
could not be otherwise, that the <hi>Venire facias</hi> was well awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

it was now argued by Serjeant <hi>Whitfield</hi> for the Plaintiff, that
the Obligation stood good against the Defendant, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the eating of the Seals of the two others: and his
reason was, Because that where three are bound joyntly and
severally, that is all one as if they had been several Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
for as when three are bound joyntly and severally there
may be one <hi>Precipe,</hi> one Declaration, and one Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them all together; so when three are bounden joyntly
and severally, there may be several <hi>Precipes,</hi> several Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and several Executions against them, so it is as it
were several and distinct Obligations, and therefore the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of part, is not the avoiding of the whole. Further, he put
cases where a Deed which is intire may be void in part, and
good for the residue, 14 <hi>H. 8. 25 &amp; 26. 9. H.</hi> 6. 15. and
<hi>Piggots Case, 11 Rep.</hi> 27. Where it is resolved that if some of
the Covenants of an Indenture, or conditions of a Bond are
against the Law, and some good and lawful, that in that case
the covenants and conditions which are against the Law, are
void <hi>ab initio,</hi> and the others shall stand good: and he cited
the 5 <hi>Rep. 23. Matthewsons Case,</hi> as a strong case to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
But the Court said, that that case of the 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> differed
from this case: for there certain persons covenant <hi>separatim,</hi>
and there the breaking of the Seal of one of the parties from
the deed shall not avoid the whole deed, for it is as several

plead <hi>non est factum,</hi> because it is not the same deed: so in this
case it is not the same deed, for whereas it was joynt at the
first, now if the deed should stand good against the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
only, it should be his Bond only, where it was his
Bond, and the Bond of another at the first, and so not the same
Bond; and 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 5. ought to be taken of a Bond joynt and
several, because that most Bonds are so, and then it is clear
our very Case, and there it is resolved, That if two be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in a Bond, and the Seal of one is dissolved and taken
from the Bond, that it avoids the whole deed, and it is not an
Obligation joynt and several, but joynt or several at the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of the Obligee, for he cannot use both; and when he
hath by his own Act deprived himself of this Election (as in
our Case) which goes in prejudice of the Obligor, who is the
Defendant, the whole Bond is thereby gone, for by that
means the Defendant only shall be charged, where both
were; and therefore he conceived that if I grant unto a man an
Annuity, or a robe, if the grantee release one of them, both are
gone, because he hath deprived himself of Election: so in this
case: he by his default should prejudice the defendant here,
which ought not to be, &amp; he compared this case to <hi>Laughters
case, C. 5. Rep.</hi> 21. Besides, if the whole deed should not thereby
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64899:66"/>
be avoided, it should be a great prejudice to the Defendant, in
as much as if all happen to be in execution for the debt
due upon that Bond, as by the Law they may, and the one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape,
the same should give advantage to the others to have
<hi>Audita querela,</hi> and by that to discharge themselves, which
the Defendant here should lose, if the Obligation should stand
in force as to him only, 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 136. Sir <hi>Iohn Needhams</hi> case, If
a woman Obligee taketh one of the Obligors to be her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
the same is a discharge to the other. Two commit a
trespass, the discharge of one is the discharge of both, yet it is
there joynt or several at the will of the party who releaseth.
But it may be objected, that it is a Casual act here, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shall not be so prejudicial to the Plaintiff here. To that he
answered, That that shall not help him, because it is his own
lachess and default; and the same Objection might have been
made in <hi>Piggots</hi> case, where the Obligation is altered in a
material place by a stranger without the privity of the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gee,
and yet there it was resolved that the same shall avoid
the deed. Besides, if the Obligee had delivered the same over
to another to keep, and it had been eaten with Rats and
Mice, yet that would not excuse him, and by the same reason
shall not help the Plaintiff here. <hi>Matthewsons Case, C. 5 Rep.</hi>
differs much from this case, because there the Covenants are
several, and not joynt as in this Case, and therefore if the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee
doth release to one of the covenanters, that shall
not discharge the others. For the Cases of 14 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and
<hi>Piggots Case</hi> they differ much from our Case, for there the
covenants or conditions against the Law are void <hi>ab initio</hi> by
the construction of the Law, and no alteration as in our case
by the Act or default of the party by matter <hi>ex post facto,</hi> and
therefore those Covenants or Conditions against the Law can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
vitia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e those which were good and according to Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they took not any effect at all. So if a Monk and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
be bound, the Bond is void as to the Monk, and good
as to the other, because there is no subsequent alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by the party; but the same is void by construction of law
<hi>ab initio:</hi> and upon the same reason stands the Case of the Fine
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64899:66"/>
put of the other side. For which causes he prayed Judgment
for the Defendant. Note, the Court, <hi>viz. Foster, Reeve, Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
and <hi>Bankes</hi> Chief Justice did strongly incline that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ought to be given for the Defendant; and their reason
was, That if the Obligee by his Act or own lachess dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
one of the Obligors, where they are joyntly and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
bound, that the same discharges them all: but gave
day for the further debating of the Case, for that this was the
first time it was argued.</p>
               <p>207. By Justice <hi>Foster</hi> and <hi>Bankes</hi> Chief Justice, a Trust
is not within the Statute of 21 <hi>Iac. cap.</hi> 16. of <hi>Limitations;</hi>
and therefore no lapse of time shall take away remedy in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
for it; but for other Actions which are within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and the time elapsed by the Statute, there is no remedy
in Equity; and that (they said) was always the difference ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by my Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry:</hi> but Justice <hi>Crawley</hi> said,
that he had conferred with the Lord Keeper, and that he told
him that remedy in Equity was not taken away in other Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
within this Statute.</p>
               <p>208. It was said by the whole Court, that they never
grant an Attachment without an <hi>Affidavit</hi> in writing.</p>
               <p>209. The Case before of the warrant of Attorney, was
betwixt <hi>Firburne</hi> and <hi>Cruse,</hi> and was entred <hi>Trinit. 17 Car.</hi>
And now it was resolved upon reading of Presidents in
Court, that no warrant of Attorney shall be made or filed,
because that it is an error and not helped, being after judgment
in <hi>Nihil dicit,</hi> &amp; that none of the presidents came to our case.
The greatest part of presidents were these, <hi>viz.</hi> the first was
1 <hi>Car. Taylor</hi> against <hi>Thellwell,</hi> the same appeared to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
demurrer, and no Judgment given. Another was <hi>Mich. 3
Car. Peasgrove</hi> against <hi>Brooke,</hi> and in that Case it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64899:67"/>
that any Writ of Error was brought. Another was,
<hi>Paseh. 5. Car. Tayler</hi> against <hi>Sands.</hi> Another <hi>Hill. 6. Car.
Smith</hi> against <hi>Bland,</hi> in that it was conceived to be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
only; and it was agreed for Law, that where there
was a warrant of Attorney, it might be amended for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
defect in it, as where there is a misprision of the name
or the like, as it is resolved <hi>Br.</hi> amendment 85. and so is
1 and 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar. Dyer 105. pl.</hi> 6. expresly, where <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia</hi>
for <hi>Elizabetha</hi> in the warrant of Attorney was amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
and that after a Writ of Error brought by construction
of the Statute of 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. and so is 9 <hi>E. 4. Br.</hi> amendment 47.
And Justice <hi>Reeve</hi> said, it cannot appear to us by any of the
said Presidents, whether there was a warrant of Attorney or
not: and perhaps upon examination it might appear to the
Judges that there was a warrant of Attorny, which is helped
by the Statute of 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. and that might be the reason which
caused them to order that it should be filed; but that doth not
appear to us, and therefore the presidents were not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Besides, it doth not appear by any of them whether judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were given or not; and before judgment it may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
as the Book is, 9 <hi>E. 4. 14. br.</hi> amendment 47. Besides,
in one of them the Plaintiff did neglect to remove the Record,
which is the very case in <hi>Dyer,</hi> and that was the reason that
the warrant of Attorney was filed, but in this Case there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to be no warrant of Attorney it is not helped by the
Statute of 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. and after a Judgment, and that upon <hi>Nihil
dicit,</hi> which is not holpen by the Statute of 18 <hi>Eliz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and there
is no Lachess in removing of the Record by the Plaintiff, and
for these reasons the whole Court was against the Defendant
in the Writ of Error, that it was Error, and therefore ought
not to be amended. Note, that in this Case it was moved that
the warrant of Attorney might be filed in this Court, after
Error brought in the Kings Bench: but observe, that if it had
been a thing amendable, that had been no impediment to it,
for things amendable before Error brought, are amendable
after, and if the inferior Court do not amend them, the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
may, and so it is adjudged 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 162. in <hi>Blackm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and doth not shew the certain number of them, and
therefore the Information which was in the nature of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
was not good for the incertainty. But <hi>per Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the same was mistaken, for it saith, that he drave with eleven
horses. The second exception was, That the usual weight
which it ought to carry is not shewed; but that was ruled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to be a mistake, for it saith 2000 weight. The third was,
that it is not shewed in the Information that the way did lead
to other Market-Towns than from <hi>Oxford</hi> to <hi>London;</hi> but it
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64899:68"/>
was ruled to be good notwithstanding that exception, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that the place <hi>à quo,</hi> and the place <hi>ad quem</hi> is set down.
And it is not material whether it lead to other towns or not.
The fourth exception was, That the Nusance is said to be in
a place called <hi>Lobbe-Lane,</hi> and it is not shewed of what
quantity or extent that Lane is, <hi>viz.</hi> how many poles or the
like: but it was ruled to be good, notwithstanding that, First,
because that the Jury have found that the way was stopt that
the people could not pass; and if it was so, then it's not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
how long it was. Secondly, <hi>Lobbe-Lane</hi> is said only
for the certainty of the place, that the Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e might come from
it: for of necessity it will be a Nusance through the whole way
betwixt <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>London.</hi> And Lastly, the Nusance is laid
to be through all <hi>Lobbe Lane,</hi> and therefore it is good not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that exceptson also. And therefore the matter
and form of the Information being admitted good, then the
Question was, what Judgment sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould be given in this Case;
whether that the Carrier should repair it at his own costs, or
should be fined for the Nusance to the Commonwealth or
not? Justice <hi>Mallet:</hi> there are several Judgments in Cases of
Nusance; if it be an assise <hi>quia levavit,</hi> or <hi>quia exaltavit,</hi> it
ought to be part of the Judgment, that the Defendant demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
it at his own costs: so where a Nusance is to a River,

for that is a High-way which leadeth to a Port to which
all resort, and therefore a stronger Case: but he conceived
that the Judgment should not be that he should repair it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is said in the Information, that the Township ought,
and therefore it differs from those Cases: and he doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he should be fined or no, because that the information is
not <hi>vi. &amp; armis,</hi> and not against any Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ute, for then it should
be a contempt, and so fineable: but notwithstanding he agreed,
that he should be fined. First, becaus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon any Villain to take away his wainage; and
he said, that he conceived that the fine set upon him ought
to be the less, for the great prejudice which might come to
the Defendant, because that the Township might have an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon the Case against him, because they are bound to
repair it, and therefore he cited 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 27. Further, he took
exception to it, that it is not shewed of what value or estate
the Defendant is, so as we might know what fine to impose;
for such fine ought to be imposed <hi>Salvo w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and he compared it to the Case in 4 E 4. 36. a Juror
is demanded, and doth not appear, he shall be fined to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of his estate for a year: but that ought to be enquired of
by the Jury, and not set by the Court, because they do not
know the value of his estate, so in this Case: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
he agreed, that he should be fined, because it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to us how great his fault was, and the fine ought to be as
aforesaid, and therefore he set a fine upon him of four Marks.
Justice <hi>Heath:</hi> two things are here considerable, whether there
shall be any Judgment as this Case is; and admitting that there
shall, what Judgment shall be given; and he agreed that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
should be given, because that the Information is good,
as well for the form as for the matter of it: it is good for
the matter of it, because <hi>Malum in se &amp; ad nocumentum pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum,</hi>

is incident to a fine, but he did not determine what the

And because we will not offend as the Star-chamber did by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
too high fines, for which it was justly condemned; so
upon the other side, we ought not to set so small fines, that we
injure Justice, and be thereby an occasion to increase such faults
where we ought to suppress them: and therefore he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the fine set by <hi>Mallet</hi> too little; but he agreed, that
the Judgment should be fine and imprisonment; but he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jorned
the setting of the fine, until he had consulted with the
Clerks, whether it should be inquired of by Commission, or
other good information. <hi>Bramston</hi> Chief Justice, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
is good for the matter and the form: but he obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
that where it is said, that he did drive <hi>quoddam gesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium,</hi>
that <hi>gestatorium</hi> is a word incertain, and that therefore
the Information should be insufficient; but he agreed that

               </hi>

Court; where the Case was, that a man brought an <hi>Ejectione

and resolved that it was naught for the incertainty, but the
Chief Justice here said that it had been good if it had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained

Case, and therefore he agreed that the Information here was
good notwithstanding that exception by reason of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glicè,</hi>
this offence is an offence against the Commonwealth,
and such an offence for which a man may be indicted, for it

(and so Justice <hi>Heath</hi> which I before omitted) that the Township
cannot have their Actions, for so there should be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity

conceived that if any man had a special and peculiar damage,
then he might have his Action, otherwise not: as if a man
were bound by prescription or tenure to repair that place

the Jury referred to the Court: and the points upon the
Case are two. First, whether the words spoken by <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e</hi> the
Executor be a sufficient assent to the devise or not: admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that it is, then the Second Point is, Whether th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> assen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
came in due time or not, as to the interest of <hi>Iohn Holloway</hi> in
the remainder, because he died before the words spoken
which should make the assent; and as to that, the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>int is
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64899:70"/>
no other, but that the Legatee dieth before assent to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacie,
whether assent afterwards came too late, or that the
Legacie shall be thereby lost or not, that is the Question: and
by Justice <hi>Mallet,</hi> it is a good assent, and that in due time,
And here some things ought to be cleared in the Case. First,
that the devise to <hi>Iohn Holloway</hi> in the Remainder is good by
way of executory devise. Secondly, that the devise by <hi>Iohn
Holloway</hi> to <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>George</hi> is a void devise, because but a
possibility. Thirdly, that the assent to the first devise is an
assent also to him in the remainder. And lastly, that if an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor
enter generally, he is in as Executor and not as devisee:
all which are resolved in <hi>Lampetts</hi> and in <hi>Matthew Mannings</hi>
Case. Now these Cases being admitted, the Question is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that <hi>Lowe</hi> the Executor here hath made a sufficient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
to take the Term as Devisee in the right of his wife,
or not: for he hath his Election to take it as executor, or in
the right of his wife; and as I conceive he hath made a good
Election to have it as Legatee in the right of his wife. The last
words, <hi>viz. That then it remains to the</hi> Holloways, which is
impossible by Law to be, because that the devise to them was
void, he did not waigh, because but additional, and the
first words of themselves are sufficient to make an assent, it is
not a transferring of an Interest, but an assent only to it,
which was given by the first Testator, and after assent, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visee
is in by the first Testator, and that being but a perfecting
Act like an Attornment, and admittance of a copy-holder, the
Law always favours it, for the Law delights in perfection, and
therefore an assent by one Executor shall binde all, so an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
by one Infant-Executor above 14 years shall binde the
other, so an assent to the particular Tenant is good to him
in the Remainder; Admittance of a Copyholder for life, is
admittance of him in the remainder: which Cases shew that
an assent being but a perfecting act, the Law shall always make
a large construction of it: and he said, that <hi>Mannings</hi> case in
the 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> is the very Case with our Case, as it appeareth in
the pleading of it in the new Book of <hi>Entries 149. b.</hi> and also
in <hi>Mannings</hi> Case aforesaid, but that Case was not resolved
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64899:70"/>
upon that point, for the devise there was, paying so much, and
the devisee being also executor payed the money, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was ruled to be a sufficient assent to the Legacie, and
therefore our case may be doubted notwithstanding that case;
and for my part I conceive it a good assent to the Legacie in
our Case. And for the second point, I hold that the assent
comes in due time to settle the Remainder, although that <hi>Iohn
Holloway</hi> were dead before, for otherwise by this common
casualty of death, which may happen so suddenly that an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
cannot be had before, or by the wilful obstinacie of the
Executor, that he will not assent, Legatees should be defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their Legacies, which would be a great inconvenience.
Besides, I hold that the devise by <hi>Iohn Holloway</hi> was void, he
having but a possibility at the time of the devise, and therefore
that it remain to his Executors, and by consequence, that the
<hi>Ejectione firme</hi> brought by their Lessee will lie. Justice
<hi>Heath</hi> acc. for the Plaintiff: Three things are here considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
First, whether there need any assent at all of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to a Legacie. Secondly, whether here be an assent or
not. Thirdly, whether this assent come in due time or not.
The first hath been granted, that there ought to be assent, for
the great inconvenience which might happen to Executors if
Legatees might be their own carvers, and so are all our Books
except 2 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 16. and 27 <hi>H.</hi> 6, 7. which seem to take a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
where the Legacie is given in certain and in <hi>specie,</hi> there
it may be taken without assent, but where it is not given in
certain, there it cannot; but he held clearly the Law to be
otherwise, that although it be given in certain, yet the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
cannot take it without assent of the Executor; for so the
Executor should be subject to a <hi>Devastavit</hi> without any fault
in him, or any means to help himself, which should be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient.
Then the second thing here to be considered is,
Whether there be an assent or not: It is clear, that if an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor
enter generally, he shall be in as Executor, and not as
Legatee, for that is best for him to prevent a <hi>Devastavi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</hi> and
it is as clear, that if he declare his intention to be in as Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatee,
that then he shall be so: then the Question here is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64899:71"/>
the words in our Case be a sufficient declaration of the
mind of the Executor to take the same as Legatee in the right
of his wife or not: and I hold that it is. He agrees that the
second words are not so weighty as the first; but he held the
first words are sufficient of themselves to make an assent: and
when he saith, that then it remains to the <hi>Holloways,</hi> that
proves that he took notice thereof as a Legacie, and that he
would have it in that right, although in truth the devise
by <hi>Iohn Holloway</hi> was void, so as it could not remain to
them. For the third, he held that the assent came in due time,
otherwise it might be very prejudicial to Legatees, for else by
that means they may be many times defeated of their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies:
for put Case that an Executor will not assent, and the
Legatee dieth before he can compel him to assent, or that
the Legatee dieth in an instant after the devisor, in the 5 <hi>Rep.
Princes</hi> Case it is resolved that an Infant under 17 may not
assent to a Legacie, nor the administrator <hi>Durante minori aeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te;</hi>
then put case that the Legatees die during the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
<hi>durante minori aetate,</hi> in whose time there cannot be
an assent, It would be a v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry great mischief, if that in any of
these Cases the Legatees should be defeated of their Legacies,
when by possibility they could not use any means to get
them: wherefore he held clearly that the assent of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
after the death of the Legatee came in good time,
and therefore he concluded for the Plaintiff. <hi>Bramston</hi>
Chief Justice also for the Plaintiff. For the first point,
he held that there is a good assent; and he said, that
<hi>Mannings</hi> Case hath the very words which our Case hath, but
my Lord <hi>Cooke</hi> did not speak of these words in the Report of
the Case, because he conceived that the payment of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
was a sufficient assent to the Legacie: but further I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that it differs fully from <hi>Mannings</hi> Case, for there it is
found expresly, that the Executor had not Assets, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it should be hard to make him assent by implication,
thereby to subject himself to a <hi>Devastavit;</hi> for as I conceive,
an Executor shall never be made to assent by implication
where it is found that he hath not Assets, but there ought to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64899:71"/>
be an express assent, by reason of the great prejudice which
might come unto him, but in our Case it is not found that
<hi>Lowe</hi> had not Assets: an Infant cannot assent without Assets;
but if there be, then it shall bind him, and perhaps that was
the reason that my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> did not report any thing of
these words, whether they were an assent or not; and his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
over them without saying any thing of them, seems part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to grant and agree, that they did not amount to an assent.
A man deviseth unto his Executor paying so much, and he
payeth it, it is a good assent to the Legacie; so is <hi>Matthew
Mannings</hi> case 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> and <hi>Plowden Comment. Wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>den</hi> and <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingtons</hi>
case: and he said, that an assent is a perfecting act
which the Law favours, and therefore he said that it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged,
that where an Executor did contract with the devisee
for an assignment of the Term to him devised, that it was a
good assent to the Legacie. For the second point also he held
clearly that the assent came in due time; for otherwise it should
be a great inconvenience, for by that means it should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to all Legacies; for of necessity there ought to be an
assent of the Executor, and if he will not assent, and the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
dieth before he can compel him to assent, or if the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
dieth immediately after the Devisor before any assent to
the Legacie, in the first Case it should be in the power of the
Executor, who is a stranger, to prejudice me; and in the latter
Case, the Act of God should prejudice me, which is against
two Rules of Law, that the Act of a stranger, or the act of
God shall not prejudice me, wherefore without question the
assent comes in due time. Besides, If a Legatee dieth before
assent to a Legacie, the same shall be assets in the hands of his
Executors; and the Legatee before assent hath an interest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandable
in the Spiritual Court. An Executor before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
shall not have an Action, but he may release an Action,
because that the right of the Action is in him: so in this Case,
although that the Legatee before assent hath not an interest
grantable, yet he hath an Interest releasable. A man surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Copyhold-Land to the use of another, and the surrende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ree
dieth before admittance, yet his heir may be admitted;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64899:72"/>
and this Case is not like those Cases put at the Bar, where
there is but a meer possibility, and not the least Interest; as
where the grantee of a reversion dieth before Attornment,
or the devisee before the devisor, in those Cases the parties
have but a meer possibility, and therefore countermandable
by death: but it is otherwise in our Case, as I have shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and therefore I conclude that here is a good assent, and
that in due time, and therefore that the <hi>Ejectione firme</hi> brought
by the Plaintiff well lieth.</p>

the Bond was conditioned to perform an award: to which the

themselves to Arbitrament, and found that the Arbitrators
made an Award, and found the Award <hi>in haec verba;</hi> but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they found that <hi>Watson</hi> was within age at the time of
the submission: and whether upon the whole matter the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator
had made any award or not, the Jury left it unto the
Court; so as the Question is no other, but whether an Infant
may submit himself to an award or not: for it was agreed, that
if the submission were void, that the award was void, and by
consequence the Bond void; and note, that the Case was, that
<hi>Yates</hi> bound himself that <hi>Watson</hi> who was an Infant should
perform the Award; and the Condition recites, that where

and stand good as to the man of full age. There are but
two Books express in the point, 14 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 12. &amp; 16 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 14.
and none of those are of any authority; in the first there is
no debate of the Case. And the second is a flat quere: and as I
conceive the better Opinion is, that the award is void; for
where it is there objected that it may be for the avail of the
Infant, <hi>Br. tit.</hi> Coverture and Infancie 62 says Quere of that,
for it may be that the recompence given by the award, may
be of greater value than the Law would give in the Action,

resolved that if the Infant had been bound to perform the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that the Obligation had been void. Further, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
that if it appear afterwards to be to his prejudice, that
that shall make the award void; but the principal point was
not adjudged, because that the parties agreed. But whereas
it was then, and now also objected, That if an Infant cannot
submit himself to an Arbitrament; that thereby he should be
in a worser case than a man of full age, for he may have done
a Trespass which subjects himself to damages by suit in Law,

and he is worse than a Judge of the Court is, he is not sworn,

Case without submission, than by it: and if an Infant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chuse an Attorney, much less a Judge, for an Arbitrator
is a Judge: an Infant cannot bind himself Apprentice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it may be pretended to be for his benefit; so 21 <hi>H. 6.
31.</hi> he cannot chuse a Bayliff, yet that is for his benefit; he
cannot give an acquittance if he do not receive the money,

Infant is good, because it is apparent for his benefit: an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
is <hi>in custodia Legis,</hi> and therefore we are bound by Oath
to defend him. Besides, an Infant hath not power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of his goods himself, and then how can he give such a
power to another? For which reasons he conceives the submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
void; and if no submission, no award; and therefore he
gave Judgment against the Plaintiff, <hi>Quod nihil capiat per
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>illam.</hi> Justice <hi>Heath</hi> also against the Plaintiff: True it is,
that in this Case a stranger is bound that the Infant shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the award, but that recites the submission by the Infant;
and the issue is, whether they made any award or not, so as the
ground is, whether there be any submission or not; for no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
no award, that so by consequence Judgment ought to
be given against the Plaintiff: and he held clearly that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
is void, that an Infant cannot submit himself to an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrament:
the Judgment of Arbitrators (provided that they
keep themselves within their Jurisdiction) is higher than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Judgment given in any Court; for if they erre, no Writ of
Error lieth to reverse their Judgment, and there is not so
much as equity against them, and therefore it should be a hard
case, that an Infant should have power to submit himself to
that which should be final against him, and no remedy; for,
<hi>consensus tollit errorem:</hi> wherefore he conceived that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
was void; and if that which is the ground fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ls, all
fails. An Infant may take any thing, for that is for is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and cannot prejudice him; and the Church l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Infant is in perpetual Infancie, and <hi>conditionem meliorem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
potest,</hi> but <hi>deteriorem nequaquam:</hi> And where it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
in this Case, that this submission might be for the avail
of the Infant, and therefore should be good; he answered, and
took this for a rule, that an Infant shall never submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to any thing under a pretence of benefit, which by pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
may prejudice him; and with that agreeth the better
Opinion of 10 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 14. that it shall not bind him because it
may be to his prejudice, for they may give greater damages
than peradventure the Law would give in any Action brought
against an Infant. But 14 <hi>H.</hi> 4. is not any Authority. Where
it was objected, that it shall be voidable at the election of
the Infant; To that he answered, that it is absolutely void,
and therefore there cannot be any Election; and it should be
hard, that the man of full age should be bound, and the Infant
not: an Infant shall not be an accomptant, because that Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
cannot be assigned to him; and he conceived that an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
cannot bind himself an Apprentice, but it is usual in
such cases for some friend to be bound for him; and as this
Case is, it appeareth by the Award that it might be for the
prejudice of the Infant. For the Arbitrators award, that the
Infant shall pay five pound for quit-Rents and other small
things; now what these small things were <hi>Non constat,</hi> and
they might be such things, for which by the Law the Infant
was not chargeable; and by the same reason that they may
assess five pound, they might have set twenty pound and more;
and it should be inconvenient that an Infant should have such
a power to submit himself to the Judgment of any which
might charge him in such manner. Besides, part of the Award
is void for the incertainty, for it is said small things; and it
doth not appear what in certain; and void in part, void
in all; and for these reasons he gave Judgment against the
Plaintiff. <hi>Bramston</hi> Chief Justice agreed, that the submission is
void, and not voidable only, as it was objected; for then it
should be <hi>tale arbitrium</hi> until reversal of it. 10 <hi>H.</hi> 6. and 14
<hi>H.</hi> 4. are no Authorities; or if they be, the best Opinion is for
the Infant, as it hath been observed, and <hi>Knight</hi> and <hi>Stones</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:64899:74"/>
Case cited before is no authority, for no Judgment was given
in the Case. But all in that case agreed, that the award was
void; because it was awarded that the Infant upon the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of an hundred pounds should make a release, which
proves that the submission was also void; because that if it
should be good, by the same reason the release. Where it was
objected, that it shall be voidable at the Election of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant;
To that he answered, that the submission ought to be
either absolutely good, or absolutely void; for the end of an
Arbitrament is to conclude and compose controversies, and
the Arbitrators are Judges to determine them; which should
never be done, if it should lie in the power of the Infant to
make good or frustrate the Arbitrament at his Election; for
which cause, to say that it shall be conditional is against the
nature of an Arbitrament; and to say, that it shall bind the
Infant absolutely cannot be; and to say, that it shall bind the
one and not the other is unequal: Besides, there can be no
election in this case; for if he were within age, nothing binds
him, if at full age he ought to perform it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Besides, the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it self, as this Case is, and as it was before observed by
<hi>Heath,</hi> is void: for the award was, That the Infant should pay
five <hi>l.</hi> for quit-Rents and other small things, and it doth not
appear what those small things were; so that for any thing
that appeareth, it might be for such things for which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
by the Law was not chargeable, and therefore is void
for the incertainty; and void in part, void in all; and by the
same reason as the Arbitrators might award five pound, they
might award twenty pound or more. But he conceived that
if it had appeared in certain, that the things had been such,
for which the Infant is by the Law chargeable, perhaps it had
been good; but here it doth not appear what the things were,
and therefore it was not good. <hi>Trinit. 4 Car. Pickering</hi> and
<hi>Iacobs</hi> case, it was resolved that a Bond taken for necessaries
of an Infant was good, 8 <hi>E.</hi> 4. Arbitrators Award more
than the debt is, the same is naught; so here, for any thing that
appeareth to the contrary, the Award was to pay such things
as the Infant was not liable to pay; and therefore void. But
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64899:75"/>
note Reader, I conceive that an Infant cannot submit himself
to an Arbitrament for things for which by the Law he is
chargeable, for the reason given before, because the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
may charge him farther than by the Law he is liable;
which should be to his prejudice, and he hath not any remedy
for it. Judgment was given against the Plaintiff, <hi>Quod nihil

out of certain Lands, and limited the same to be paid
at a house, which was another place off the Land; and in the
grant was this clause, that if the rent were behind, and lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demanded at the house, that then it should be lawful for
the grantee to distrein: the Rent was afterward behind, and
the grantee distreined, and upon traverse taken upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
whether this distress upon the Land (which had been
good in Law if there had not been a special limitation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
at a place off the Land) be a good demand as this Case
is, was the point. <hi>Mallet</hi> Serjeant: the distress is a demand in it
self, and there needs not any other demand, although the rent
be to be paid off the Land as here. And it was adjudged in
this Court about 3 years past, that the distress was a sufficient
demand: but I confess that a Writ of Error is brought in the
Kings Bench, and they incline there to reverse it, and there is
no difference where the rent is payable upon the Land, where
not, and so it was adjudged, <hi>Trin. 3 Car. Rot.</hi> 1865 or 2865. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

and that he shall make that demand before he distrein;
for the same is neither repugnant nor impossible, nor against

note, that in that Case there was no time in certain limited:

point was reversed, <hi>Mich. 16 Car.</hi> in the Kings Bench upon
a Writ of Error brought for want of demand: wherefore I
conclude, that there ought to have been an actual demand at
the house according to the grant in our Case, and therefore
the Traverse in this Case taken by the grantor is well taken.
Note, that Justice <hi>Crawley</hi> said, that <hi>Lambes</hi> Case was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64899:76"/>
that there needed no demand, and he said, that there were
three Judgments accordingly in this Court: but <hi>Rolls</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
said, that <hi>Darbies</hi> Case was reversed in the Kings Bench
for want of a demand. But note, that <hi>Foster</hi> and <hi>Reeve</hi> Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
did incline that there should be a demand, and so <hi>Bankes</hi>
Chief Justice, for he said, that it is part of the contract, and
like a condition precedent; for as in a condition precedent, a
man ought to perform the condition before he can take any
thing by the grant, so in this Case the grantee ought to make
a demand to enable him to distrein, for before the demand he
is not by the manner of the grant (which ought to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
entitled to a distress: wherefore he give direction to the
Counsel that they would view the Records, and shew them
to the Court; and further he said to them, that where it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,
that the Rent was demandable upon the land, that
those cases were not to the purpose, and therefore wished that
they would not trouble the Court with them.</p>

               <p>249. <hi>LEvett</hi> brought debt against Sir <hi>Simon Fanshawe</hi> and

Sir <hi>Simon Fanshawe</hi> came in voluntarily in Court, and
prayed his Priviledge because he was an Officer of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer:
and whether he should have his priviledge in that case
or not, was the question, and that rests upon two things. First,
because he is sued, as this case is, meerly for conformity and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity-sake,
and in the right of another, <hi>viz.</hi> in the right of his

case also in the Exchequer, in both which cases he said hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and wife were sued in the right of the wife, and the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
had his priviledge. But he cited a Case which was nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
our Case, and that was <hi>Hill. 8. Iac.</hi> in the Exchequer,
<hi>Wats</hi> and <hi>Glovers</hi> case, where husband and wife were sued in
the right of the wife as Executrix; and he said, that it was
over-ruled that the husband should have his priviledge 22 <hi>H.
6.</hi> 38. and 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 20. in those Cases the husband and wife
were sued in the right of the wife, and yet the husband was
allowed his priviledge: But see Reader 34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 29. &amp; 35
<hi>H.</hi> 6. 3. against it: And note, that many of these cases come
to the second point, whether he may demand his priviledge
at the <hi>Exigent</hi> or not; but for that see 9 <hi>E. 4. 35. Br. Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
22.</hi> &amp; 10 <hi>E. 4. 4. Br. Priviledge 40. Rolls</hi> Serjeant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that the Defendant ought not to have his Priviledge;
and he said, that use, practise, and reason is against it; and he
took these differences. First, where the Defendants are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make their appearance, and are arrested, as in 22. <hi>H.
6.</hi> 20. and where they are sued in one Court, and the husband
demands his priviledge, because he is an Officer in another
Court, as in our Case. Secondly, where he is Defendant, and
where he is Plaintiff. And lastly, where he is sued in his own
right, and where in the right of another, as in our Case. For
in the first of these differences he shall have his priviledge, in
the latter not; and it is to ouste this Court of Jurisdiction, and
therefore shall be taken strictly. Besides, if in this Case the
Defendant should have his priviledge, we should be without
remedy; for we cannot have a Bill against the wife, and we
have no remedy to make the wife to appear; and therefore
it should be a great prejudice to us, if he should have his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.
Wherefore he prayed that the Defendant might not
have his priviledge. Note, that <hi>Bankes</hi> Chief Justice seemed
to agree the differences put by <hi>Rolls,</hi> and also he conceived
that point considerable, whether the Defendant had not sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
his time in this Case, because he demands his priviledge
at the <hi>Exigent,</hi> and not before. And note, the whole Court,
<hi>viz. Foller, Reeve, Crawley</hi> and <hi>Bankes</hi> Chief Justice seemed to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64899:77"/>
incline, that the Defendant should not have his priviledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that the Action was brought against him and his wife,

               <head>Moss and Brownes Case.</head>
               <p>220. <hi>MOsse</hi> exhibited a Bill in the Court of Requests
against <hi>Brown,</hi> and in his Bill set forth that
the Defendant was indebted unto him in the
sum of 400 pounds for wares delivered to
him: and further, he shewed how that the Defendant was
decayed in his estate, and was not able to pay him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was content to accept of an hundred pound for the
whole; and that the Defendant at the payment of the said
hundred pound, required the Plaintiff to give him a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
release, and then promised him in consideration that he
would make him a general release, that he would pay to him
the residue of his debt whensoever God should please to make
him able; and the defendant divers times afterwards did renew
his promise with the Plaintiff. Further, he shewed that now
a great estate to such a value is fallen to the Defendant, and
that now he is able to pay him, and notwithstanding refuseth
so to do; which is the effect of the Plaintiffs Bill. To that
the Defendant answered and pleaded the Statute of Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Actions: and the Court of Requests would not admit
this Plea. But note, the Defendant pleaded first the general
issue, that he made no such promise, upon which they were at
issue, and found against him; and afterwards he pleaded the
Statute of Limitation, and upon the whole matter Serjeant
<hi>Clarke</hi> moved for a Prohibition. First, because the Bill is in
the nature of an Action upon the Case at the Common Law,
and whether he promised or not promised is triable at Law.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64899:78"/>
Secondly, because the Court refused the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ea of the Statute

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ght not to do, because there is
no remedy in Equity against a Statute. Serjeant <hi>Whitfield</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that no Prohibition ought to be granted. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Plaintiff hath no other remedy but in Equity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that the <hi>Assumpsit</hi> made before the release is discharged
by the release, and the <hi>Assumpsit</hi> which was after, is void; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is no consideration, the debt being released before.
Secondly, our case is not within the Statute of Limitations, for
it is but a trust reposed in the Defendant that he would pay the
residue when God should make him able: and being a bare
trust, is not taken away by the Statute of Limitations. But he
agreed for any Action which is within the Statute, and is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perannuated,
that there is no remedy in Equity. But in answer
to that it was said by <hi>Clarke,</hi> that there is no trust expressed
in the Bill. But notwithstanding that, it was resolved by the
whole Court, <hi>viz. Foster, Reeve, Crawley</hi> Justices, and <hi>Bankes</hi>
Chief Justice, that no Prohibition ought to be granted, for the
reasons given before by <hi>Whitfield;</hi> and they said, that although
no trust be expressed, yet if it appeareth upon the whole Bill
that there is a trust, it is enough, and he needs not to express
it. And note, there was an order of the Court of Requests
produced by <hi>Clarke,</hi> by which it was ordered, That the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
should take issue only upon the subsequent promise, and
should not meddle with the first, which as the Court concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
made the Case a little worse; notwithstanding the Court
would not award a Prohibition; for they said, so long as they
order nothing against the Law, it is good, and they ought to
be Expositors of their own Orders: &amp; therefore if it appeareth
upon the merits of the Cause, and the body of the Bill, that
they have Jurisdiction of the Cause, and proceed as they
ought, be their Orders what they will, it is not material; and
therefore it was resolved by the whole Court that no Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition

said to him, <hi>Thou hast spent</hi> (so much a year) <hi>in drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
and Sentence was given for the Plaintiff, and now four
years after Sentence the Defendant prayed a Prohibition, and
the Court, <hi>viz. Foster, Reeve, Crawley</hi> Justices, and <hi>Bankes</hi> Chief
Justice, were against the Prohibition because the Defendant
came too late; but if he had come in due time, the three Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices
did incline that a Prohibition would have lien, because
that the words are words only of passion and anger, and
God forbid that all words spoken only in wrangling and
anger should bear Action: But the Chief Justice inclined that
the Defendant was punishable in the Ecclesiastical Court for
those words; for he said, that the suit there is <hi>pro salute animae
&amp; reformatione morum,</hi> and it was fit that his manners should
be reformed, who spake such words of a man in Orders and a
reverend Minister. And he said, that although that he held not
that where there is no remedy at Law, that there they might
sue in the Ecclesiastical Court; yet he said, that in many cases,
where there is no remedy at Law, yet there is remedy in the
Ecclesiastical Court, and so he conceived in this Case. But that
which made Justice <hi>Reeve</hi> to doubt whether a Prohibition
should issue as this Case was, or not, was for the incertainty of
their Sentence, which was for speaking of these words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Articles, <hi>aut eorum aliqua,</hi> which he said is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not good, for he said, that Judgments or Sentences ought
to have these two things, Veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y and Certainty, and if there

want any of these two, it is not good; and if it should be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it were a mischievous case, for by this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ick they might
hold Plea of words not within their Jurisdiction, and we
should not have power to prevent it; for if some of the words
should be actionable, some not, they might by this way hold
Plea as well of words which were not actionable or punisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by them as of those which were. To which <hi>Foster</hi> agreed;
but Justice <hi>Crawley</hi> and the Chief Justice conceived that no
Prohibition would lie notwithstanding that, for that might
be the course amongst them; and although it be incertain, yet
it may be allowed by them for Law: and <hi>Reeve</hi> was of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that a man might be indicted at the Assises before the
Commissioners of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> for speaking of such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famatory
words, and that he grounded upon the Commission
of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> which giveth them power to hold Plea
<hi>de prolationibus verborum,</hi> and he conceived that a man might
be fined for them. But the Chief Justice contrary, for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
giveth them power to hold Plea <hi>secundum legem &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudinem
Angliae:</hi> Now if the speaking of such words be not
punishable by the Law and Custome of <hi>England,</hi> then we
cannot hold Plea of them by way of indictment or otherwise
at the Assises for them.</p>
            <p>222. It was said by the whole Court, that a bare Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at the Bar is not sufficient to cause the Court to examine
any man upon Interrogatories; wherefore they ruled, that
the party should make an <hi>Affidavit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>223. Judgment was given against the principal, and after
a <hi>Scire facias</hi> was brought against the Bail, who appeared and
pleaded <hi>Nul tiel Record</hi> of the Judgment given against the
principal, upon which day was given to bring in the Record
in Court, at which day the principal tendred his body in
discharge of the Bail, and now it was prayed by <hi>Pheasant</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64899:79"/>
that it might be admitted; but <hi>Reeve, Foster</hi> and <hi>Bankes</hi>
Chief Justice inclined against it: True it is, that the condition
of the Bail is, that they render his body (indefinitely) withoue
limiting any time in certain when they shall do it, or pay
the condemnation: but yet they conceived, that if they appear
and plead such a dilatory Plea as this is, that thereby they
have waived the benefit of bringing in his body: and Justice
<hi>Foster</hi> said, that the same being general and uncertain, the
Law ought to determine a time certain when it shall be done,
for otherwise by the same reason that they may do it now, they
may do it twenty years after, which should be inconvenient
and against the meaning of the condition. And <hi>Reeve</hi> said,
that if this trick should be suffered, that the Bail might plead
such a dilatory Plea, and afterwards bring in the body of the
Principal, the Plaintiff should lose all his costs of suit which he
had expended in the suit against the Bail, which would be
mischievous. But Justice <hi>Crawley,</hi> that the usage hath always
been, that the Bail might bring in the body of the Principal
at any time before judgment given against them upon the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
facias,</hi> and there are many presidents in this Court to that
purpose. To that the Court seemed to agree, if they plead
not such a dilatory Plea, as in this case: Therefore the Court
awarded, that the Pronotharies should consider of it, and
should certifie the Court what the use hath been in such case.</p>
            <p>224. Serjeant <hi>Pheasant</hi> came to the Bar, and said to the
Court, that antiently (as appeareth by our old Books) the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
was, that the Serjeants in any difficult point of plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
did demand of the Court their advise concerning it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd
accordingly were used to be directed by the Court; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he humbly prayed of the Court to be resolved of this
doubt. A man was imprisoned for not submitting to Patentees
of a Monopoly, after seven or eight years past, and then he
brought an Action of false Imprisonment, and that is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Statute of Monopolies, 21 <hi>Iac. c.</hi> 3. whether in this
case the Defendant might plead the Statute of 21 <hi>Iac. c.</hi> 16. of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64899:80"/>
Limitations of Actions, or not, was the Question. But the
whole Court was against him, that they cannot be Judges and
Counsellors, and that they ought not to advise any man, for
by that means they should prevent their Judgment; and they
confessed that that was the use, when the Serjeants used to
count at the Bar, as appeareth in our Books. But they said,
you shall never find the same to be used since they counted
and declared before they came to the Bar, and these Counts
and Declarations are upon Record, wherefore the Court upon
these considerations would not advise him.</p>

by the whole Court, <hi>viz. Foster, Reeve, Crawley</hi> Justices, and
<hi>Bankes</hi> Chief Justice, <hi>nullo contradicente,</hi> that the Plaintiff
ought to have Judgment, and that upon these differences.
First, where the Defendant is to do a single Act only, and
where he hath election of two things to do. Secondly, the
second difference stood upon this, that no notice is to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or tender made of a thing which lieth not in the power
or proper conusance of the Plaintiff, so as the difference stands
where it is a thing which lies in the conusance of the Plaintiff,
and where not: and therefore where the award was that the
Defendant should pay to the Plaintiff eight pound, or three
pound and costs of suit, as should appear by a note under the
Attorneys hand of the Plaintiff, it was resolved in that Case,
that although the Attorney be in some respect as a servant to
his Master, yet to this purpose he is a meer stranger, and
therefore the Plaintiff was not bound to make any tender of
that note, but the Defendant ought to have gone to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs
Attorney, and required a note of him of the costs of suit,
so as he might have made his Election: But they all agreed,
that where it is a thing which lieth in the knowledge of the
Plaintiff, that there he ought to have made a tender, or given
notice, but in this Case it lieth not in the knowledge of the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64899:80"/>
Plaintiff, and he cannot compel the Attorney to make it,
wherefore it was resolved that the Plaintiff should have Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>226. A man libelled for Tithes in the Ecclesiastical Court,
&amp; in his libel he set forth, how that the Tythes were set forth,
but that the Defendant did stop and hinder the Plaintiff to
carry them away any other way than through the Defendants
Yard, and when he was carrying them that way, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
being an Officer did attach them for an Assessment to
the poor, and did convert them to his own use, upon which a
Prohibition was prayed, because that the Tythes being set forth
an Action of Trespass lieth at the Common Law: but Serjeant
<hi>Clarke</hi> was against the Prohibition, because that the Libel is
grounded upon the Statute of 2 <hi>E. 6. cap.</hi> 13. which is, That if
the Parson, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be stopt or let in carrying his Tythes, that
the party so stopping or letting should pay the double value,
to be recovered before the Ecclesiastical Judge. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that, it was resolved that a Prohibition should issue,
because he that will sue upon the Statute ought to mention
the Statute, or to make his demand <hi>secundum formam Statuti.</hi>
But here the Plaintiff doth not sue upon the Statute, for he
doth not mention it nor the double value as he ought; for
they all agreed, that he ought to ground his Action upon the
express clause of the Statute for the double value, wherefore
a Prohibition was granted.</p>
               <p>227. It was resolved upon the Certificate of the Prono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharies,
<hi>viz. Gulson, Cory,</hi> and <hi>Farmer,</hi> that the custom of
the Court was, That if a man sueth another for such a sum,
or thing for which the Plaintiff ought to have special Bail,
and doth not declare against him in three Terms, that the
Defendant being brought to the Bar by a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi>
ought to be discharged upon an ordinary appearance, and that
they said is the course and practice in the Kings Bench, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64899:81"/>
that was now resolved to be as a certain Rule from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth

the Plaintiff brought a <hi>Quare impedit</hi> against the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,

but the Question here is, as he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
Whether the Plaintiff be not stopped by this recovery
and Judgment yet remaining in force to say the contrary.
<hi>Bankes</hi> Chief Justice: It is true, that generally the Parson with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
shewing that he is <hi>persona impersonata,</hi> cannot plead to
the Title of the Patronage. But whether the Defendant can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
plead the Record and Judgment, yet in force against the
Plaintiff, without shewing that he is <hi>persona impersonata,</hi> that
is the Question here. Note, it was the first time it was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued.</p>

               <head>Harwel against Burwel in a Replevin in
the Kings Bench.</head>
               <p>230. THe Case was thus: A man acknowledged a Statute to
the Plaintiff, and afterwards granted a Rent-charge
to the Defendant, afterwards the Statute is extended and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64899:82"/>
and then the grantee of the Rent distreins. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he might distrein without bringing a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> was
the Question. And by Serjeant <hi>Rolls,</hi> he cannot distrein with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>Scire facias</hi> brought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he took it for a Rule, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Conusee came in by matter of Record, he ought not
to be put out or disturbed without matter of Record, for if
that should be suffered, it would be a great discouragement to
Debtees to take this manner of security for their debts: and
the Conusor cannot enter without bringing a <hi>Scire facias;</hi> and
if the Conusor himself cannot enter, it is a good argument <hi>à



fortiori</hi> that the grantee of a rent cannot distrein without a
<hi>Scire facias;</hi> and that the conusor himself cannot enter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
bringing a <hi>Scire facias, vid. 15 H. 7. 15. 4 Rep. 67. Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi>
case. And the grantee of the Rent is as well within the
ground and rule before put as the conusor himself, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he compared the case to the case in the 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 92. that he
who claims under another ought to shew the original convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
But he took a difference where the party comes in by
act of Law, and where by the act of the party; he who comes
in by act of Law, shall not be put to his <hi>Scire facias,</hi> for so he
should be without remedy, and if that should be permitted,
it should a be subtile way for the conusor to avoid the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the conusee, and then he himself to take benefit of it,
and that should be a fine way to defeat the Statute. Besides,
by this way if the Statute should be satisfied by casual profit,
or if the time should be expired and the Statute satisfied by
effluxion of time, if in that Case the grantee should be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to distrein the beasts of the conusee for a great Rent,
perhaps before that the Conusee by possibility might remove
from the Land, it would be a great disturbance to the Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see.
Besides, if a stranger enter upon the conusee, the conusee
upon his regress may hold over: but not so in this Case,
where the grantee of the Rent distreins, and that should be
also a great prejudice to the conusee. But it was objected that
the grantee of the rent could not have a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if he might not distrain, he should be without remedy;
To which he answered, that if it should be so, it is his own
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64899:82"/>
fault, for he might have provided for himself by way of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
But he conceived that he might have a <hi>Scire facias;</hi> for
he said, that it is a Judicial Writ issuing out of the Rolls,
which might be framed and made according to the case of any
man: and it is not enough to say, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> there was never such a

was ever denied: besides, it is not always necessary that he

that if any copyhold-tenant did suffer his messuage to be ruin'd
for want of repairing, or committed waste, &amp; that is presented
by the homage; that such tenant so offending should be amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and that the Lord had used time out of mind to distrein
the beasts as well of the tenant as of the under-tenant of such
custom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that Mannor, and made a Lease unto the Plaintiff for one
year, and that 15 <hi>Car.</hi> the homage did present that <hi>Greening</hi>
had suffered his Barn, parcel of the customary Tenements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,

as Bayly of the Lord <hi>Barckley</hi> did distrein the Plaintiffs cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
being under-tenant for the said amercement upon the
said customary tenement, and so he made conusance and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
the taking of the beasts as Bayly of the Lord <hi>Barckley:</hi>
The Plaintiff confessed that <hi>Greening</hi> was tenant, and that he
made a Lease to the Plaintiff for a year; and further he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
the want of repairing and presentment, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercement
upon it, but he denied that there is any such cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome:
upon which they were at issue, and the Jury found for
the Defendant that there was such a custom, and it was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in arrest of Judgment that the custom was not good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was unreasonable; for here the Tenant offended, and
the under-tenant is punished for it, which is against all reason
that one should offend and another should be punished for it.
Besides, the under-tenant here is a stranger, and the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
shall never extend to a stranger, and therefore the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
to punish a stranger who is not a Tenant of the Mannor
is a void custom. Further, it was said that the amercement
properly falls upon the person, and therefore being personal
it cannot be charged upon the under-tenant. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all these Objections, it was resolved by all the Justices
upon solemn debate, that the custom was good, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the avowant should have Judgment. Justice <hi>Mallet.</hi>

and if so, then the Plaintiff here cometh in by custom, and is
no stranger but a good customary tenant, and therefore the
custom may well extend to him: as there is <hi>Dominus pro tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi>
so there is <hi>tenens pro tempore,</hi> and such is the Plaintiff
here: and he held, that the wife that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ath her widows estate,
according to the custom of the Mannor, is a good customary
tenant. A woman Copyholder for life, where the custom is
that the husband shall be tenant by the curtesie, dieth, I hold
the husband in that case a good customary tenant. In <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
where this Land is, there is a custom that Executors shall
have the profits for a year, and I conceive them good custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
tenants. Besides, this under-tenant here is distrainable
by the Lord for the rents and services reserved by the Lord, or
otherwise by this way he might defeat the Lord of his servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
The custom was, That a woman should have her wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
estate; the Copy-tenant made a Lease for one year and
died, and adjudged that the woman should have her widows
estate as excrescent by Title Paramouns, the estate made for
one year: see <hi>Hab. Rep.</hi> And as these the estate of the wife
was derivative; so here: and although it be not the intire Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyhold

it, and is liable to every charge of the Lord, 6 <hi>Rep. Swaines</hi>

that the avowant ought to have Judgment. Justice <hi>Heath:</hi>

that the amercement is personal, and therefore cannot
extend to the Plaintiff; to that he answered, that it is not
meerly personal, but by custom (as aforesaid) is now made a
charge upon the Land, and therefore not meerly personal. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
if the custom in this case had been, that the Plaintiff
for waste should forfeit his Copyhold-tenement, it had been
reasonable <hi>à fortiori</hi> in this case that he shall be only amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced:
wherefore he concluded, that the custom is good, and
therefore that the avowant should have judgment. <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>
Chief Justice: that the custom is good, and that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be clear. First, he conceived that the custom is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
as to the Copy-tenant, for clearly by the Common
Law, if he suffer, or do waste, he shall forfeit his Copyhold,
and therefore this custom is in mitigation of the penalty;
and therefore is reasonable, and that is not denied; but the
only doubt here is, whether the custom to distrein the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-tenant
for an amercement layed upon the tenant be a
good custom or not: and he conceived it is, for the custom
which gives the distress knits it to the Land, and therefore
not meerly personal as it was objected. And if the custom had
not extended to the under-tenant, he might have distreined
him, for otherwise the Lord by such devise as there is, <hi>viz.</hi> by
the making of a Lease for one year by the Tenant should be
defeated of his services, 3 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 199. resolved, custom
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64899:84"/>
to seise the cattle of a stranger for a Heriot is not good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that thereby the property is altered. But custom that
he may distrein the cattle of a stranger for a Heriot is a good
custom, because the distress is only as a pledge and means to
gain the Heriot: and in our case the Land is charged with
the distress, and therefore the cattle of any one which come
under the charge may be distreined for it, and therefore he held
clearly that the custom was good, and that the avowant should
have Judgment. Justice <hi>Barckley</hi> at this time was impeached

demur in Law, and shewed for cause of demurrer, that the
Plaintiff had traversed a thing not traversable; and if it were
traversable, that it wanted form, and this Term this Case was
debated by all the Judges, and it was resolved by them all,
that the Traverse as it is taken, is not well taken. Justice <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
that the Traverse taken by the Plaintiff is not well taken
at the Common Law, the Lord was bound to avow upon a
person certain; but now by the Statute of 21 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 19. he
may avow upon the Land, and this avowry clearly is an avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
upon the Statute, for it is <hi>infra feodum &amp; dominium sua,
&amp;c.</hi> and so is the old Entries 565. then the Question here
is, whether the Plaintiff be privy or a stranger; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> he he a
stranger, then clearly at the Common Law he may plead
no plea, but out of his Fee, or a Plea which doth amount to
so much as appeareth by the Books, 2 <hi>H. 6. 1. 17 E. 3. 14, &amp;
15. 34 E.</hi> 3. Avowry 257. and many other Books as you may
find them cited in the 9 <hi>Rep.</hi> 20. in the case of Avowry, &amp; here
it doth not appear but that the Plaintiff is a stranger, and
therefore whether he be inabled by the Statute of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. to
take this traverse or not, is the Question: and I conceive that
he is: true it is, as it was objected, that this Statute was made
for the advantage of the Lord, but I conceive, as it shall ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Lord to avow upon the Land, so it shall enable the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to discharge his possession, as if the avowry were upon
the very tenant, and so is the Institutes 268 <hi>b.</hi> and so is <hi>Brown</hi>
and <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> case in <hi>Hobarts Rep.</hi> 129. adjudged in the
point, and the Plaintiff here who is a stranger is in the same
condition, as a stranger was at the Common Law, where the
Avowry was made upon the Land for a Rent-charge, in such
case he might have pleaded any discharge although he were
a meer stranger, and had nothing in the Land, so may he now
after the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Then admitting that the Plaintiff
might take this Traverse by the Statute; then the Question is
whether the Plaintiff hath taken a sufficient Traverse by the
Common Law or not: for the Statute saith, that the Plaintiff
in the Replevin or second deliverance shall have the like Pleas
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64899:86"/>
as at Common Law, and I conceive that this plea is not a good
plea at the Common Law. And now I will consider whether
if the Plaintiff had been a very Tenant, he might have pleaded
this plea or not; and I conceive that if this traverse had been
taken by a very tenant, it had not been good. I agree the 9 <hi>Rep.
35 Bucknels</hi> case, that <hi>Ne un<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> seisie</hi> of the services generally is
no good plea, but <hi>Ne un<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> scisie</hi> of part of the services is a good
plea; and so is 16 <hi>E. 4. 12. &amp; 22 H.</hi> 63. and the reason that
the first Plea is not good, is because that thereby no remedy
is left to the Lord, neither by avowry, nor by writ of customs
and services. And therefore the plea here is not good, because
it is a traverse of the services generally. Besides, here the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
is not good, because that the Plaintiff hath traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the seism, and hath not admitted the tenure: and it is a
rule in Law, that no man may traverse the seism of services,
without admitting a tenure; and therewith agreeth 7 <hi>E. 4. 28.
20 E. 4. 17. &amp; 9 Rep. Bucknells</hi> case; and then if the very te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
could not have taken this traverse, much less a stranger
here. Further, here the tenure was alledged to be by rent and
fealty, and the avowry was for the fealty, and the Plaintiff hath
traversed the seism as well of the rent which is not in demand,
as of the fealty, and therefore the traverse is not good. But it
was objected, that seism of rent is seism of fealty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of necessity both ought to be traversed. I agree, that sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sm
of rent is seism of fealty, but it is no actual seism of the
fealty in point of payment, or to maintain an assise for it, as is
44. <hi>E. 3. 11. &amp; 45 E.</hi> 3. 23. and the distress here is for actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
seism of fealty. Every traverse ought to be <hi>adidem,</hi> as 26 <hi>H.
8. 1. &amp; 9 Rep.</hi> 35. but here the traverse is of the Rent which
is not in question, &amp; therefore is not good in matter of form.
Wherefore he gave Judgment for the avowant. Justice <hi>Reeve:</hi>
the first thing here co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>siderable is, whether this be a conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance
at the Common Law, or upon the Statute; and I hold
clearly that it is within the Statute; and for that see new
<hi>Entries 597 &amp; 599<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 27 H.</hi> 8. 20. and it is clear that the
Lord hath Election either to avow upon the Statute, or at
the Common Law; and that is warranted by <hi>Institutes</hi> 268.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64899:86"/>
and 312. 9 <hi>Rep. 23. b. 36. a.</hi> &amp; 136. <hi>a.</hi> and then admitting, that
it be an avowry upon the Statute. The second point is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Plaintiff be inabled by the Statute to take this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
or not, for it is clear, that at the Common Law the
Plaintiff could not have this Plea, for a stranger could not
plead any thing, but <hi>hors d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>r favour, that
notwithstanding any thing that hath been said, that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
is not enabled by the Statute to take this traverse; and I
ground my Opinion upon the Reason at Common Law, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
upon the Stat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e; the first reason at the Common Law, I
ground upon the Rule in Law, <hi>res inter alios act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, alteri nocere
non debet,</hi> it is not reason that he who is a stranger shall take
upon himself to plead to the Title of the Tenure, with which
he hath nothing to do in prejudice of the very Tenant, and
this reason is given by the Books of 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6 &amp; 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 34. My
second reason is grounded upon the maxime in Law, which is,
That in pleading every man ought to plead that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
for him and his Case. And that's the reason that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
at the Common Law cannot plead to the right of
the Patronage wherein he hath nothing, but the Patrou shall
plead it, as appeareth by the 7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 26. and many other Books
there cited; and these are my reasons at the Common Law,
wherefore the Plaintiff being a stranger cannot plead this
Plea. Secondly, I ground my self upon the purvieu of the
Statute to prove that the Plaintiff cannot plead this plea, the
words of which are, <hi>That the Plaintiffs shall have such Pleas
and Aid-prayers as at the Common Law:</hi> and if the Plaintiff
could have pleaded this Plea by the Statute, the Statute would
not have enacted that there should be the like Aid-prayers as
at the Common Law, for if the Plaintiff might plead this plea,
then there need not any Aid-prayer; and as at the Common
Law no Aid-prayer was grantable of a stranger to the avowry,
so neither is it so now; and to prove that he cited 27 <hi>H. 8. 4.
19 Eliz.</hi> New <hi>Entries</hi> 598. &amp; 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 5. against the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64899:87"/>
312. a. Besides, the Statute gives the like pleas as at the
Common Law, and therefore no new pleas, and that caused me
to give those reasons before at the Common Law: and if this
should be suffered, every wrangler by putting in of his cattle,
should put the Lord to shew his title, which would be a great
prejudice to him. The Statute of 25 <hi>E. 3. c.</hi> 7. enables the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor
to plead to the title of the Patronage, and that it is not
till induction if it be against a Common person, which he
ought to shew, otherwise he is not inabled to plead to the title,
as it is in the 7 <hi>Rep. 26. a</hi> &amp; <hi>Dyer fol. 1. b.</hi> But note, there the
Statute enables him to plead to the title; which is not so in our
Case, the general words of the Statute of <hi>West.</hi> 2. have always
received construction at the Common Law, as appeareth by 18
<hi>E. 3. 3. 10. 22 E.</hi> 3. 2. &amp; 9 <hi>Rep. Bucknells</hi> case, and 11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 62, 63.
there you may see many Cases cited which have the like words
of reference to the Common Law, as the Statute in that Case,
and there always they have received construction by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law: the Authorities cited before against me, are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, for they say that the Plaintiff after this Statute may
have any answer which is sufficient, so clearly by these autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
the answer ought to be sufficient, and that is the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in our Case, Whether the answer be sufficient or no, which
as I have argued, it is not; because the Plaintiff is not enabled
to take this traverse by the Common Law; and the Statute
doth not give any other Plea than at the Common Law. 26 <hi>H.
8.</hi> 6. is express in the point, That the Plaintiff being a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
is not enabled by this Statute to meddle with the tenure;
wherefore I conceive that the Plaintiff is not a person suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
within the Statute to take this traverse without taking
some estate upon him, as in see for life or years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But for
the latter point, admitting that the Plaintiff were enabled
by the Statute to take this traverse; yet I hold clearly, that as
this case is, he hath not pursued the form of the common Law
in the taking of it: and I agree the rule that the Plantiff cannot
traverse the seism without admitting of a tenure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the traverse here is not good, because he takes all the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
by protestation. Besides, I agree that traverse of seism
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64899:87"/>
generally is not good, 9 <hi>Rep. Bucknells</hi> case; and I agree that
traverse of seism <hi>per manus</hi> is not good without confessing the
tenure for part: and here he takes all the tenure by protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore not good, 18 <hi>E. 2. Fitz. Avowry</hi> 217. is
express in the point that the traverse is not good. Wherefore
I conclude that Judgment ought to be given for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowant.
Justice <hi>Crawley,</hi> that Judgment ought to be given for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowant;
he held clearly that the avowry is within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and that being within the Statute the Plaintiff is enabled
to take this traverse, and that he grounded upon the Books of
34. <hi>H. 8. Br.</hi> Avowry 113. 24. <hi>H. 4. 20. 9 Rep.</hi> 36. and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barts
Rep. 129. Brown</hi> and <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> Case. Then he being
inabled by this Statute to take this plea as a very tenant, the
Question is, Whether the Traverse here <hi>per manus</hi> be good or
not, and he held not; but he ought to have traversed the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
as this Case is: that the traverse of the seism <hi>per manus</hi>
generally is not good, I ground me upon the 9 <hi>Rep. Bucknells</hi>
Case 35. <hi>a.</hi> and I agree the third rule there put, that <hi>Ne un<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan>
seisie per manus</hi> is a good plea, but that must be intended where
the Plaintiff confesseth part of the tenure, which he hath not
done in this Case, as it appeareth by the fourth rule there ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
which is an exception out of the precedent rule, upon
which I ground my opinion, and therefore the traverse here is
not good. Besides, Homage and Fealty are not within the
Statute of Limitations, and therefore not traversable: and if
it should be permitted, the rule in <hi>Bevills</hi> Case 4. <hi>Rep.</hi> 11, 12.
and <hi>Com. 93. Woodlands</hi> Case, which resolve that they are not
traversable, should be by this means quite defeated. Further,
in this Case the fealty only is in demand, and the Plaintiff
hath traversed the seism of the rent as well as of the fealty,
which is not good. I agree the Book in the 9 <hi>Rep. Bucknells</hi>
Case <hi>fol.</hi> 35. that seism is not traversable but only for that for
which the avowry is made, if not that seism be alledged of a
superior service (for which the avowry is not) which by the
Law is seism of the Inferiour service, with which agrees 26 <hi>H.
8.</hi> 1. &amp; 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 64. But in our Case seism is not alledged of
a superiour service, for which the avowry is not made but of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64899:88"/>
an inferiour, <hi>viz.</hi> of a rent which is inferiour to fealty (as the
Books are of 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 52. Avowry 115. and 19 <hi>E. 4. 224.)</hi>
and which of right ought to be so, unless a man esteem and
value his money above his conscience; and therefore the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
of the rent which is inferior service and not in demand,
is not good. Besides, you cannot traverse the seism of the feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
without the traverse of the seism of the rent, because the
seism of rent is the seism of fealty, and the rent is not here in
demand, and therefore not traversable, and therefore you ought
to have traversed the tenure; for although it be said, that rent
which is annual is inferiour to all other services, 4 <hi>Rep. 9. a.</hi> yet
it is resolved that the seism of rent is seism of all other servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
further, I conceive that if you avow for one thing, you
need not to alledge seism of other services. 24 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 17. &amp; 50.
seemeth to cross the other authorities before cited; but I believe
the latter authorities. Wherefore I conclude that Judgment
ought to be given for the avowant. <hi>Bankes</hi> Chief Justice: I
conceive that it is a plain avowry upon the Statute, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I need not to argue it; here are two Questions only. The
first, Whether this Plaintiff, who is a stranger, be enabled by the
Statute of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. to plead in Bar of this conusance or not.
Secondly, admitting that he be inabled by the Statute to plead
this plea, whether the traverse be here wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> taken or not. To
the first, I hold that he is inabled by the Statute to take this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse:
but for the second, I hold clearly, that the traverse is not
well taken: here the Plaintiff and Defendant are both strangers,
so as here is neither the very Lord nor the very Tenant. And
now I will consider what the Common Law was before the
Statute, it is clear that by the Common Law a stranger might
plead nothing in discharge of the Tenancie, nor could plead a
release, as the Books are 34 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Avowry 257. and 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3.
Avowry 61. he could not plead <hi>rien arrere,</hi> or levied by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
he could plead no Plea but <hi>hors de son fee,</hi> or a Plea
which did amount to so much. I confess that the Book of 5 <hi>E.
4. 2. b.</hi> is that the Tenant in a Replevin could not plead <hi>hors
de son fee,</hi> but the Book of 28 <hi>H</hi> 6. 12. is against it. True it is,
that in some special Case, as where there is Covin or Collusion
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64899:88"/>
in the avowant, there the Tenant shall set forth the special mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as it is in 9 <hi>Rep. 20. b.</hi> Now there are two Reasons given in
our Books; wherefore the Plaintiff in a Replevin being a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
could not plead in Bar of the Avowry. The first is, that the
Seignory being in question, it is matter of privity betwixt the
Lord and the Tenant. The second, that the Law doth allow
unto every man his proper plea, which is proper to his Case,
and that he ought to plead and no other, as appeareth by the
Books, 12 <hi>Ass.</hi> p. 2. 13 <hi>H. 8. 14. 2. H. 7. 14. 13 H. 7. 18. Lit.
116. 35 H.</hi> 6. 13. &amp; 45 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 24. Now seeing that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
being a stranger could not plead this Plea at the Common
Law, the Question now is, Whether he be inabled by the Statute
to take this Plea or not; the words of the Statute are, <hi>That
the Plaintiff and Defendant shall have the like Pleas and Aid-prayer
as at the Common Law;</hi> and therefore it was objected
that it doth not give any new Plea; true it is, that by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
words thereof that it gives not any new Plea, but yet I
conceive that any stranger is enabled to plead any plea in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of the Conusance by the equity of this Statute; at the
Common Law avowry was to be made upon the person, and
therefore there was no reason that the Plaintiff being a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
should plead any thing in Bar of the Avowry of Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance,
but now the Statute enables the Lord to avow upon the
Land, not naming any person certain, it is but justice and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
that the Plaintiff should be inabled to plead any thing
in discharge of it. I compare this Case to the Case in the 3
<hi>Rep. fol. 14. Harberts</hi> Case, where it is resolved that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ossce of a
Conusor of a Statute being only charged, may draw the other
in to be equally charged; and if execution be sued against him
only, that he may discharge himself by <hi>Audita querela</hi> for so
much. 8 <hi>E. 4. 23. a.</hi> there the Defendant avowed for a rent-charge,
the Plaintiff shewed how that one <hi>E.</hi> leased the Land
to him and prayed in aid of him, and resolved that he should
not have aid because the avowry is for Rent-charge, so as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Plaintiff might plead any plea that he would in disch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ge of
the land; now by the same reason, where the lands of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
were charged with a rent-charge, he might at the common
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64899:89"/>
Law have pleaded any thing in discharge of his land; by the
same reason where there is an avowry upon the Land accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Statute, the land being charged, the Plaintiff may
plead any thing in discharge thereof; and this is my first rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
My second reason is, that this Law hath been construed
be equity, for the benefit of the Lord, and therefore it shall be
construed by equity for the benefit of the Tenant also, <hi>Instit.
286. b.</hi> My third reason is, Although the Plaintiff be a
stranger and claimeth no interest in the Land, yet for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of his goods he may justifie this plea; I may plead an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
upon another who endeavoreth to take away my goods,
and I may justifie maintenance where it is in defence of my
interest, as it appeareth in 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 2. and 34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 30.
Fourthly and lastly, upon the authorities in Law after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of this Statute, I conceive that the Plaintiff may well
take the Plea, 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 4. The plaintiff prayed in aid of a
stranger and had it, which could not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Brown</hi> and <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> Case: wherefore I hold that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
may by the equity of the Statute plead this plea. But it
was objected by my brother <hi>Reeve,</hi> that by the Statute of 25
<hi>E 3. c.</hi> 7. It is enacted that the possessor shall plead in Bar, and
therefore the incumbent before induction cannot plead in Bar,
as it is resolved in 4 <hi>H. Dyer</hi> 8. 1. and 31 <hi>E. 3. Incumbt.</hi> 6. and
upon the same reason he conceived it should be hard in our
Case, that the Plaintiff who is but a stranger, not taking upon
him any estate, should be admitted to plead this plea; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Statute in this Case saying, that the Plaintiff shall have
the like pleas as at the Common Law: To that I answer, that
by the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. it is enacted that the possessor shall
plead in Bar, and therefore clearly there he ought to shew
that he is possessor: otherwise he cannot plead in Bar, and
therefore not like to our Case: and the Novel <hi>Entries 598,
599.</hi> doth not make against it, for there it was not upon the
Statute, and 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 6. is express that the Plaintiff being a
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64899:89"/>
stranger is enabled by the Statute of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. to take this
plea: Wherefore I conclude this point, that the Plaintiff is
inabled by the Statute to plead any thing in Bar of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry:
But for the second point, I hold clearly that the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
as it is here taken is not well taken, it is only an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
construction that the Plaintiff shall plead this plea, as I
have argued before, and therefore he ought to pursue the
form of the Common Law, in the form of his traverse,
which he hath not here done, and therefore the traverse is not
good, and where the seism is not material, there it is not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versable,
and in this Case the seisim of the fealty is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
for it is out of the Statute of Limitations, and therefore
not traversable: and so is it in the Case of a gift in tail, and
grant of a Rent-charge, it is not traversable, because that the
seism is not material, 7 <hi>E. 4. 29. Com. 94. 8. Rep. 64. Fosters</hi>
Case. Secondly, where the Seigniory is not in question, there
no traverse of seism, so it is in Case of Writ of Escheat, <hi>Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savit
Rescous,</hi> &amp;c. and therewith agree the Books of 22 <hi>H.
6. 37. 37. H.</hi> 6. 25. &amp; 4. <hi>Rep. 11. a. Bevills</hi> Case. Thirdly, where
the Lord and Tenant differ in the services, there no traverse
of the seism but of the tenure, but where they agree in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
there the seism may be traversed, and therewith agree
the Books of 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 64. &amp; 84. 20 <hi>E. 4. 17. 22 Ass. p.</hi> 68.
&amp; 9 <hi>Rep. 33. Bucknells</hi> Case; and therefore the traverse here is
not good. First, because it is a general traverse of the seism
<hi>per manus,</hi> the tenure not being admitted as it ought to be by
the fourth rule in <hi>Bucknells</hi> Case, and therewith agreeth 23
<hi>H.</hi> 6. Avowry 15. Besides, it is a Rule in Law, That a man shall
never traverse the seism of services, without admitting of a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,
and in this Case he took the tenure by protestation, and
therefore the traverse here is not good, and therewith agre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
15 <hi>E.</hi> 2. Avowry 214. Further, the traverse here is not good,
because he hath traversed a thing not in demand, which is the
rent, for he ought to have traversed the seism of the fealty on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for which the distress was taken, and not the rent as here
he hath done, and therewith agreeth 9 <hi>Rep. 35. a.</hi> and 26 <hi>H.
8.</hi> 1. But as this Case is, he could not traverse the feal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y only
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64899:90"/>
because that seism of rent is seism of fealty, and therewith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth

Bevills</hi> Case, and therefore he ought to traverse the tenure.
True it is, as it was objected by my Brother <hi>Foster,</hi> that sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sm
of Rent is not an actual seism of fealty as to have an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sise,
but is a sufficient seism as to avow. And we are here in
Case of an avowry, and therewith agreeth the 4 <hi>Rep. 9. a. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills</hi>
Case: wherefore I conclude that Judgment ought to be
given for the avowant. Here note, that it was resolved by all
the Judges of the Common Pleas, that a traverse of seism <hi>per
manus</hi> generally without admitting of a tenure is not good,
and therefore see 9 <hi>Rep. 34. b.</hi> &amp; 35. <hi>a.</hi> which seemeth to be

seised of a Mannor with an advowson appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
granted the next avoidance to <hi>I. S.</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
bargained and sold the Mannor with
the advowson to the Defendants <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>F.</hi> and a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and covenanted with them that the Land is free from all
incumbrances. Afterwards the third person released to the
Defendants, who brought a writ of Covenant in the Common
Pleas, and there Judgment was given that the Action would
lie. Whereupon <hi>Hayward</hi> brought a Writ of Error in this
Court. The point shortly is this, Whether the Writ of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
brought by the Defendants without the third person
who released were good or not; and that rests only upon
this, Whether this Action of covenant to which they were all
intitled before the release, might be transferred to the other
Defendants only by the release or not. And it was objected,
that it could not, because it is a thing in Action, and a thing
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64899:90"/>
vested which cannot be transferred over to the other two on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the release; but that all ought to joyn in the Action of
covenant notwithstanding. <hi>Rolls</hi> contrary, because that after
this release it is now all one as if the bargain and sale had
been made to those two only, and now in an Action brought
against them two, they may plead a seoffment made to them
only, without naming of the third who released, and so it is
resolved in 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 4, &amp; 5, &amp; 6 <hi>Rep. fol. 79. a.</hi> Besides this
covenant here is a real covenant, and shall go to assignees,
as it is resolved in 5 <hi>Rep. Spencers</hi> Case; and here is as violent
relation as if the seoffment had been made to them two on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
It was objected by Justice <hi>Heath,</hi> What if the other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
It was answered, perhaps it shall there survive, because
that it is an Act in Law, and the Law may transfer that
which the Act of the party cannot, because that <hi>Fortior est

<hi>Harris:</hi> that the surrender is void. Estates of Copyholds
ought to be directed by the rule of Law, as is said in 4 <hi>Rep. 22.
b. 9 Rep.</hi> 79. &amp; 4 <hi>Rep.</hi> 30. And as in a grant, a grant to one in

in <hi>Dyer 303. p.</hi> 50. so it hath been adjudged that the
surrender to the use of an Infant <hi>in ventre sa mier</hi> is void: and
as at Common Law a Freehold cannot begin in <hi>futuro,</hi> so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Copyhold, for so the surrenderer should have a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
estate in him without a donor or lessor, which by the rule
of Law cannot be: and he took a difference betwixt a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>vise
by Will, &amp; a Grant executed; in a devise it may be good, but
not in a grant executed: and here he took a difference where
the Grant is by one intire clause or sentence, and where it is
by several clauses, 32 <hi>E. 1. taile 21. Dyer 272. p. 30. Com. 520.
b. 3 Rep. 10. Dowties</hi> Case, and 2 <hi>Rep. Doddingtons</hi> case. For
instance, I will put only the Case in <hi>Dyer</hi> and the <hi>Comment.</hi>
A Termor grants his Term <hi>habendum</hi> after his death, there
the <hi>Habendum</hi> only is void, and the grant good; but if he
grant his Term after his death, there the whole grant is void,
because it is but one sentence: So I say in our Case, because it is
but one clause, the whole grant is void. Another difference
is, Where the distinct clause is repugnant and where not;
where it is repugnant there it is void and the grant good, <hi>quia
utile per inutile non vitiatur:</hi> But in our Case, as I have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is one intire sentence, <hi>M.</hi> 13. or 23 <hi>Iac.</hi> in this Court,
<hi>Rot. 679. Sympson</hi> and <hi>Southwells</hi> Case, the very Case with
our Case. There was a surrender of a Copy tenant to the use
of an Infant <hi>in ventre sa mier</hi> after the death of the surrende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and there it was resolved by all the Judges except <hi>Dodde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge</hi>
that the surrender was void, First, because it was to the
use of an Infant <hi>in ventre sa mier,</hi> and Secondly, because it was
to begin <hi>in futuro,</hi> which is contrary to the rule in Law; and
Copy-tenants as it was there said, ought to be guided by the
rules of Law: but <hi>Dodderidge</hi> doubted of it, and he agreed the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64899:91"/>
Case at Common Law, that a freehold could not commence
<hi>in futuro,</hi> but he doubted of a Copyhold; and he put the Case
of surrender to the use of a Will; But he said, that Judgment
was afterwards given by <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Justice in the name of all
the other Judges that the surrender was void, and therefore
<hi>Quod querens nihil capiat per billam,</hi> wherefore he concluded
that the surrender was void, and prayed the Judgment of the

to <hi>Newgate</hi> by the Court of Aldermen, upon
which he prayed a <hi>Habeas corpus,</hi> which was granted, upon
which return was mane, First, it is set forth by the return, that
<hi>London</hi> is an ancient City and Incorporate by the name of
Mayor, Comminalty and Citizens, and that every Freeman
of the City ought to be sworn, and that a Court of Record
had been held time out of mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the Mayor and
Aldermen. And that there is a custom, that if any Freeman
be elected Alderman; that he ought to take an Oath <hi>cujus te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
sequitur in haec verba, viz. You shall well serve the King
in such a Ward in the Office of Alderman of which you are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and you shall well intreat: the people to keep the Peace
and the Laws and Priviledges within and without the City: you
shall well observe and duly you shall come to the Court of Orphans
and Hustings if you be not hindred by Command of the King,
or any other lawful cause: you shall give good counsel to the
Mayor: you shall not sell Bread, Ale, Wine, or Fish by retail,
&amp;c.</hi> Then is set forth a custome, that if any person be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
Alderman, he shall be called to the Court, and the Oath
tendred to him; and if he refuse to take it, then he shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
until he take the Oath. Then is set forth, that by the
Statute of 7 <hi>R.</hi> 2. all the customs of the City of <hi>London</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.
And lastly, is set forth that the 11 of <hi>Ian. Langham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a freeman of <hi>London,</hi> and having taken the Oath of a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64899:92"/>
was <hi>debito modo electus</hi> Alderman of <hi>Portsoken-ward,</hi> and
being <hi>habilis &amp; idoneus</hi> was called the first of <hi>February</hi> to the
Court of Aldermen, and the Oath tendred to him, and that he
refused to be sworn <hi>in contemptum Curiae, &amp; contra confuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
&amp;c.</hi> wherefore according to the custom aforesaid, he was
committed by the Court of Aldermen to <hi>Newgate,</hi> until he
should take the Oath, <hi>&amp; haec fuit causa &amp;c.</hi> To this retorn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
exceptions were taken. <hi>Maynard:</hi> the retorn is insufficient
for matter and form; for form it is insufficient, for the <hi>debito
modo electus,</hi> without shewing by whom and how, is too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:
then it is insufficient for the matter, for he is imprisoned
generally, and not until he takes the Oath, which utterly takes
away the liberty of the subject, for by this means he may be
imprisoned for ever. Besides, here is no notice given to him that
he was chosen Alderman, but they elect him, and then tender
him the Oath, without telling him that he was chosen Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman,
and therefore the retorn not good, for it ought to be
certain to every intent. Further, the Oath is naught and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
for he ought to forswear his Trade, for if he sell
Bread, Ale, Wine, or Fish before, now he must swear that he
shall never sell them by retail after, which is hard and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
for perhaps he may be impoverished after, and so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated
to use his Trade, or otherwise perish; wherefore for
these reasons he conceived that the Retorn was insufficient.
<hi>Glynn</hi> upon the same side, that the Retorn is insufficient,
and he stood upon the same exceptions before, and he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that notice ought to be given to him that he was chosen
Alderman, for this reason, because of the penalty which he
incurs, which is imprisonment; and he compared it to the
Cases in the 5 <hi>Rep. 113. b.</hi> &amp; 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 92. That the feoff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64899:92"/>
exception to the Oath, because he is to swear, that he

                  </gap>rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
will not be lawful now; for some Customs which
were lawful in the time of <hi>R.</hi> 2. are now superstitious, and
therefore are not to be kept. Further, it is to keep all the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
within and without the City, which is impossible to
do. Wherefore for these reasons he conceived the Retorn
not to be good, and prayed that the prisoner might be dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
<hi>Saint-Iohn</hi> Sollicitor of the same side. The custom to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison
is not good. Besides, here the imprisonment is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
so that he may be imprisoned for ever, which is not good;
and the Statute confirms no customs but such as are good
customs: I agree that a custom for a Court of Record to fine,
and for want of payment to imprison may be good, because
the custom goes only to fine and not to imprisonment; the
Case of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. of the custom of <hi>London</hi> for a Constable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a house and arrest a Priest, and to imprison him for incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie
comes not to our Case, for that is for the keeping of
the peace, which concerns the Commonwealth, as it is said in
the Book, and therefore may be good: but it is not so in our
Case. A Corporation makes an ordinance, and injoyns the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
of it under pain of imprisonment, it hath been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
that the Ordinance is against the Statute of <hi>Magna
Charta,</hi> that <hi>Nullus liber homo imprisonetur, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore
naught: and that is the 5 <hi>Rep. 64 a. Clarkes</hi> Case, and therewith
agrees the case of the City of <hi>London, 8 Rep. 127. b. Mich.
14 &amp; 15 Eliz. Marshalls</hi> Case in <hi>Harpers Reports,</hi> there a <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas
corpus</hi> was directed to the Mayor of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who returned
a custom there that none but a freeman should set up a shop
there, and if any other did, that he should be imprisoned, and
it was adjudged no good custom, <hi>Mich. 21 E.</hi> 1. in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

<hi>Cambridge</hi> was retorned, which was that the Vice-chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
might imprison a Scholar taken in a suspicious place, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the same no good custom, but it is not resolved. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
I conceive the return here is insufficient, because that no
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64899:93"/>
notice was given to the party that he was chosen Alderman,
which I conceive ought to have been for the great penalty
which follows, wherefore he prayed that the prisoner might
be discharged. <hi>White</hi> of the same side; the retorn is not good
for want of notice; and he said, that it doth not appear
that he was present at the election, and no other notice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the Retorn; and he said, that the tender of the
Oath did not imply notice: further he said, that the Oath is
not good, because he is to abjure his Trade. Besides, it is said
in the Retorn that the custom is, That <hi>Si aliquis liber homo</hi> be
elected Alderman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and doth not say <hi>habilis &amp; idoneus,</hi>
as it ought to be, and therefore no good. True it is, that it is
averred in the Retorn that he was <hi>habilis &amp; idoneus,</hi> but it is
not alledged to be part of the custom, and therefore that
doth not help it, wherefore he prayed that the prisoner might
be discharged. <hi>Gardiner,</hi> Recorder for the City, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn
is sufficient; and first for the <hi>debito modo electus,</hi>
where it was objected that the same was too general; to that
he answered, that no traverse can be taken upon it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is sufficient, for there is not such certainty required in
a Retorn upon a <hi>Habeas corpus</hi> as in pleading, as it is resolved
in the Case of the City of <hi>London, 8 Rep. 127. b. 128. a.</hi> and
according to that it is resolved in 9 <hi>H. 6 44. a.</hi> where it is
said, that if the cause in it self be sufficient upon the Retorn,
it sufficeth although it be false; and although there be not so
precise certainty in it, and there it is resolved that the party
cannot take issue upon the Retorn, and yet there is no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
by it, for if it be false you may have a Writ of false impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,

that the same day that he was elected, he was called to

from the using of which no man can bind himself,
much less abjure against it: To that he answered, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that the Oath is lawful, and you forswear no
more than the Law doth prohibit you, for it doth not extend
to all Trades, but only to such as sell Bread, Ale, Wine and
Fish; and it is against Law and Reason, that he who hath the
Jurisdiction of Bread, Ale, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and may punish the misusage of
it, that he should exercise the same Trade himself; wherefore
he conceived that notwithstanding that exception the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn
is sufficient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the objection to the Oath that he ought
to swear that, he will keep all the priviledges of the City,
whereas in truth there are many Priviledges, which are now
unlawful, although that before they were lawful, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the same ought not to be kept; to that he answered,
that the Oath is good notwithstanding that Objection, for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
ought to be intended that he shall keep all priviledges and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
reasonable which agree with the times in which we
live, and not such as are superstitious and unreasonable. For
the Objection, that the custom is unreasonable, because it tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
much upon the liberty of the Subject, and against the
Statute of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> that the body of a Freeman should
be imprisoned, and the rather because here the imprisonment
is general, and he may be imprisoned for ever: to that it was
answered, that the City hath customs as unreasonable as in
this Case, as the custom in <hi>L. 5 E. 4. 30. 11 H.</hi> 6. 3. &amp; 2 <hi>H.
4.</hi> 12. That the Creditor may arrest the Debtor before the day
of payment to give better security, and that is altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Rule of Law. Besides they have a custom which you
shall find in 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. and 2 <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                  </hi> 4. 12. That a Constable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64899:94"/>
suspition of incontinencie may enter the house of a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and arrest the body of the offender and commit him to
prison, and that is a good custom, and yet it is against the
Law, &amp; trencheth also upon the liberty of the Subject. Besides,
they have a custom, that no person being not free of the City
shall keep shop there, and that is adjudged a good custom,
although it be to restrain trading, which is against the rule of
the Law also, 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 125. The Case of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
And for the objection that it is unreasonable, because that the
imprisonment is general: to that he said, it was a good ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
if it were true, but that is mistaken; for the retorn is
expresly that he shall be imprisoned until he hath taken the
Oath, which is not general, for if he take the Oath he shall be
discharged; and here he said that this Government by Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in this City is one of the most ancient Governments in
the Kingdom, beyond time of memory, and is a Government
which of necessity ought to he supported, or otherwise the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
would immediately be brought to ruine, for we cannot hold
a Court without thirteen Aldermen, which ought to have care
of the Orphans, and make Laws for the well government of
the City, and that is of great consequence to all the Kingdom,
and concerns the Government of it; and if this City be well
governed, the whole Kingdom will fare the better, and at this
time we want many Aldermen, and if these shall escape, by the
same reason others will do so, and so the Government utterly
should fail. And where it was objected that it is usual to
make them to take the Oath, and accept a fine of them after:
To that he said, that they would not do so now in this Case;
for he said, that the party chosen is an able man, and a man
whom they respect, and not his money: And therefore he said
that the custom to imprison him for refusing is more reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
than if the custom were to fine him; for he said, that
that Custom is the most reasonable custom, which is most
fit for the attaining of its end; and he said, that imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is most apt for the obtaining the end: for when
we accept a fine, there is no end of it, for he may be
chosen after; and how can the Government be supported
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64899:94"/>
which is the end of the election if all should be fined, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the custom to imprison is more reasonable, than if the
custom had been to fine; because it is more apt to attain the
end; which is to maintain the Government: it is said in
38 <hi>Ass. p. 22 Br.</hi> Imprisonment 100. That it was resolved
2 <hi>Ma.</hi> in Parliament, that imprisonment almost in all Cases
is but to detain him untill he makes a fine, and if he ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that to be discharged. To that he said, that the same
ought to be understood, where a fine is imposed, but we do
not intend to accept of a fine. Further he said, that there is
a Judgment in the point, and that is the Statute of 3 <hi>Iac. cap.
4.</hi> which injoyns an Oath for Recusants to take, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
that they shall be committed until, &amp;c. here he said
that an Act of Parliament hath done it in the like Case, and
therefore he conceived the custom reasonable: and then he
cited many presidents of commitment in this very Case. 2 <hi>H. 5.
Iohn Gidney</hi> was dealt with in the same manner, 8 <hi>E. 4. Charles
Faman</hi> was imprisoned, 36 <hi>H. 8. Thomas White, 1 Iac.</hi> Sir
<hi>Thomas Middleton,</hi> all which were imprisoned for refusing to
take the Oath. And lastly, he cited one 3 <hi>Iac.</hi> and that was
Sir <hi>William Bonds</hi> Case, who was imprisoned by the Court of
Aldermen for the same cause, and it came judicially in questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and he said, that upon solemn debate it was resolved,
that he should be remanded; wherefore he concluded that the
commitment being by a Court of Record, and that for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
against the Court, and that for not observing of the
customs of the City which is against the Oath of a freeman,
and which are confirmed by Act of Parliament, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment
is good and lawful, and therefore prayed that the
prisoner might be remanded. And now this Term it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
by the Judges upon solemn debate, that the retorn not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
any of the said exceptions was sufficient. Justice
<hi>Mallet:</hi> the Retorn is sufficient in matter and form, but for the
matter of it, I shall not ground my self upon the custom, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
part of the record, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is upon the contempt, for although
I agree that <hi>Consuetudo loci</hi> is of great regard, yet I conceive it
is not strong enough to take away the liberty of a freeman by
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64899:95"/>
imprisonment. Power to imprison the body of a freeman
cannot be gained by prescription or grant; and a grant is the
ground of a prescription, and therefore if it be not good in
a grant, not in a prescription: and I conceive that it is the
Common Law only, or consent to an Act of Parliament, that
shall subject the body of a freeman to imprisonment; and
it is resolved in the 5 <hi>Rep. 64. acc.</hi> in <hi>Clarkes</hi> Case, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
in 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 127. That a constitution cannot be made by
a Corporation, who have power to make by-Laws upon pain
of imprisonment; because it is against the Statute of <hi>Magna
Charta;</hi> wherefore I conceive the power to imprison the
body of a freeman cannot be gained by custom: but although
it cannot be gained by custom, yet <hi>Qui non transeunt per se,
transeunt per aliud,</hi> it will pass as a thing incident to a
Court of Record; and therefore although I hold that the
custom to imprison is not good, yet I hold that the
imprisonment here by a Court of Record for a contempt
made unto it, as appeareth by the Retorn here it was,
is good; for in the conclusion of the Retorn it saith, that
he refused <hi>in contemptum Curiae, &amp;c.</hi> And that it is incident
to a Court of Record to imprison, 8 <hi>Rep. 38. b.</hi> it is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
that for any contempt done to a Court of Record the
Judges may impose a fine; and 8 <hi>Rep. 59. b.</hi> It was resolved,
that to every fine, imprisonment is incident. Further, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that by the same reason that a Court of Record may
imprison for a fine, they may imprison for a contempt, and in
8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 60. it is said, that to imprison doth belong only to
Courts of Record: but which is in the point, it is resolved,
119. <hi>b.</hi> in Doctor <hi>Bonhams</hi> Case, that it is incident to every
Court of Record, to imprison for a contempt done to the Court:
and he said, that if a Court of Record should not have
such a coercive power, they should be in effect no Court.
Wherefore he conceived that the refusing to take the Oath
being a contempt, and that to a Court of Record, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by the Retorn, that they may lawfully commit him for
this contempt. For the objection that the <hi>debito modo electus,</hi>
without shewing how, is too general: To that he answered,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64899:95"/>
that it is only matter of inducement, and there is no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to shew all matter of inducement. For the objection that
he had not notice of the election: To that he answered, that
here is good notice, for by the Retorn it appeareth, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the custom after he was elected, he was called to
the Court, and the Oath tendred to him, and he refused, which
without doubt implies notice, <hi>&amp; quod constat clare non debet
verificare;</hi> &amp; as after appearance, all exceptions to process are
taken away, as the Books of 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 18. &amp; 12 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 17, &amp; 18. and
many other Books are, so I say in this Case, after appearance,
you shall never say that you had not notice, for by your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
you admit it and the process good. For the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Oath, that it is not good, because it makes a man
abjure his Trade, which is against Law and Reason: To that I
answer, that the Aldermen are intrusted with the assize of
Bread and Ale, and so with Wine and Fish, and therefore as it
is unreasonable, so it is against the Law, that during his Office
he should use the Trade of which he hath Jurisdiction and
power to regulate, and to punish the misdemeanors of it; and
therefore it is enacted by the Statute of 12 <hi>E. 2. cap.</hi> 6. That
no Officer of a City or Borough shall sell Wine or Victuals
during his Office. It is true, that this Statute is repealed by the
Statute of 3 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 8. but there is a Proviso in the Statute
that it extend not to <hi>London,</hi> so as the Statute of 12 <hi>E.</hi> 2. is
in force still as unto <hi>London.</hi> Then the Oath makes him to
abjure no more than the Law forbids him to do, and which
to do by him were unlawful, wherefore that exception is
not good. For the exception that the imprisonment is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
to that I answer, that it is mistaken, for it is only until
he take the Oath, and therefore the retorn is good notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that exception also: Now the end of imprisonment
being obedience, and the party here not obeying but refusing
to take the Oath, for which he is committed; for my part, I
conclude that he be remanded to prison. Justice <hi>Heath:</hi> that
the Retorn is good in matter and form; and I ground my
self upon the custom, for I conceive that it is a good cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
because that the ground of it is good and reasonable,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64899:96"/>
which is the Government of the City, for that totally depends
upon the custom; and I hold that the refusing to take the
Oath only is no sufficient cause of imprisonment; but as it is
an introduction to the support of Government, by keeping of
the customs and priviledges of the City, which every one by
the Oath of a freeman is bound to keep; and this custom is
not against the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta, 9 H. 3. cap.</hi> 29.
For that saith that no freeman shall be taken and imprisoned,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but <hi>per legem terrae:</hi> Now <hi>Consuetudo loci est lex terrae,</hi> for
in the Statute of 52 <hi>H. 3. cap.</hi> 3. There the Law and custom
of the Realm are joyned together as Synonyma, words of the
same intent. For the Objection, That the custom is not that
they who shall be chosen Aldermen, should be <hi>idonei &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles,</hi>
but it is only averred in the Retorn, that <hi>Langham</hi> here
chosen to be Alderman is <hi>idoneus &amp; habilis:</hi> to that I say, that
we are to judge upon the Retorn as it is before us, and if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the whole matter there appeareth sufficient matter for us
to adjudge the commitment lawful, be it true or false we
ought to judge according to it; and if the Retorn be false,
you have your remedy by way of Action upon the Case;
and in this Case it is expresly averred that the party cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
is <hi>idoneus &amp; habilis,</hi> and it lies not in your power or in
ours to gain say it, wherefore I conceive that exception
worth nothing. I agree that the Statute doth not confirm
ill and unreasonable customs, but here I say (as before) that this
custom hath a good and lawful foundation, and therefore it
may be well confirmed; and the Oath although it be in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Terms, yet it ought to be taken, that he do keep and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
such reasonable and lawful Priviledges and no other.
For the notice, I say, that it is manifest, that he had notice;
which he conceived would be good evidence to a Jury, and
that upon such evidence they would find for the Plaintiff;
and for the <hi>debito modo electus,</hi> he conceived it is good enough,
because that in the Retorn upon a <hi>Habeas corpús</hi> such precise
certainty is not required as in pleading: and for the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment
it is not in general, and so may happen to be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
as was objected; but it is until he take the Oath, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64899:96"/>
upon the whole matter I conceive the retorn is sufficient,
and that the prisoner ought to be remanded. <hi>Bramston</hi> Chief
Justice: the custom is good, and none of the exceptions to the
Retorn good, and therefore the prisoner ought to be reman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
The Question upon the custom is only whether this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
as it is here set forth by the retorn, to imprison the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of a freeman be good or not; and as I have said before, I
hold it to be a good custom, and that upon this difference, that
a custom generally to imprison the body of a freeman is not a
good custom. But a custom (as it is here) for a Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
to imprison the body of a man who is chosen a great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
for refusing to take the office upon him without which
the Government cannot subsist, is a good custom: Besides,
here being a contempt refusing to take the Oath, the Court
may imprison the body for it, without any custom to help
it, for it is incident to a Court of Record to imprison. I agree
the Case which was objected by Master <hi>Sollicitor</hi> of 21 <hi>E.</hi> 1.
where the custom of <hi>Cambridge</hi> is, that the Vice-chancellor
may imprison a Scholar taken in a suspitious place, that is no
good custom, for it no way concerns the supportation of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
or the Commonwealth, and they may punish him
another way, which may be good and as effectual as imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but not so in our Case, for if in this time in which
there are many Aldermen wanting, all should be fined, what
will become of the Government? Further, I agree that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
to imprison for forein buying and selling is no good
custom; upon the difference before taken: all great Officers
have a proper Oath belonging to them, which is very needful
for the greater ingagement of men in the due execution of
their Offices, which so much concerns the Publike; and if they
refuse to take it, they are punishable for it; and this place in
which Master <hi>Langham</hi> is chosen Alderman is the most
great place of Government in the Realm, and of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
consequence to the whole Kingdom, and therefore
if it should not be supplied with Aldermen, who is it
who doth not see the great inconvenience which would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?
and therefore I hold that the custom to imprison until
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64899:97"/>
he take the Oath, and so by consequence the Office upon him
(for refusing of the Oath is refusing of the Office) is a good
custom; now for the Oath, it is the usual Oath which hath
been taken time out of mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is reasonable and well
penned. For the Objection that it is unreasonable, because it
makes a man to abjure his Trade: To that I answer, that it is
reasonable, and makes him abjure no more than the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
him to do, for it is not reasonable that he who hath the
Jurisdiction of assise of Bread and Ale, Wine and Fish, that he
during his Office should sell those things by retail. Now
that the Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London</hi> have this Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
see the Statute of 31 <hi>E. cap.</hi> 3. 10. for Fish; the Statute
of 23 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 4. for Ale and Beer; and 28 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 14. for
Wine, where in these Cases power is given to all Head-Officers
of Cities, Burroughs and Towns-corporate to punish the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
against the rates and Assises of the things aforesaid: and
by the Statute of 12 <hi>E. 2. cap.</hi> 6. it is expresly ordained, that
no Officer of a City or Burrough should sell Wine or Victuals
during his Office. I confess this Statute is repealed by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 3 <hi>H.</hi> 8. but yet there is a Provision in that Statute that
it extend not to <hi>London:</hi> then the Law being that none of
those things shall be sold by any Officer by retail during
his Office; the Oath which makes a man to abjure that which
the Law forbids, of necessity ought to be taken as lawful: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
there is a Writ grounded upon the Statute of 12 <hi>E.</hi> 2.
which you shall find in the Register 184. <hi>a.</hi> &amp; <hi>Fitz. N. B. 173.
b.</hi> that the party grieved might have directed to the Justices
of assises, commanding them to send for the parties, and to do
right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore I hold the Oath good and lawful not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this Objection. For the point of notice, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it is not needful, and if it be, I ask who it is ought to
give notice in this Case, and I say that no person is tied to do
it, wherefore he ought to take notice of it at his peril. For
the <hi>debito modo electus,</hi> I say that it is good, being in a Retorn
upon a <hi>Habeas corpus,</hi> &amp; it is said, that it was <hi>secundum consue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem,</hi>
which includes all things needful for the objection.
That it is averred in the retorn that he was <hi>idoneus &amp; habilis,</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:64899:97"/>
but that it is no part of the custom that it should be so, for it is
only in general, <hi>Si aliquis liber homo,</hi> and doth not say <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
&amp; idoneus,</hi> and therefore the custom should not be good:
I answer, that it is averred in the Retorn, that it is so, that
he is elected, and that is sufficient for us to ground our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
but further, I conceive that the <hi>debito modo</hi> helps it,
wherefore upon the whole matter I conclude that the custom
is good, and the Retorn sufficient, and therefore that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
be remanded.</p>

this, That the Defendant should not keep a Mercers-shop
in the Town of <hi>Tewkesbury;</hi> and if he did, that then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
three moneths he should pay forty pound to the Plaintiff:
upon which the Defendant did demur in Law, and the point
is only whether the condition be good or not. Serjeant <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:</hi>
the condition is good, because it is no total restraint,
for it is a restraint here only to <hi>Tewkesbury,</hi> and not to any
other place, wherefore I conceive the condition good. I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
the Case in 11 <hi>Rep. 53. b.</hi> where a man binds himself not
to use his Trade for two years, or if a husbandman be bound
he shall not plough his Land, these are conditions against Law,
because where the restraint is total, although it be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
there the condition is not good; but the condition is
not totally restrictive in our Case: and he compared this Case
to the Case in 7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 43. feoffee with warranty; Proviso, that
the feoffee shall not vouch it is a good condition, because
not totally restrictive; for although that the feoffee cannot
vouch, yet he may rebut: so in this Case, although the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
cannot use his Trade in <hi>Tewkesbury,</hi> yet he may use it in
any other place. And the Condition is not against Law; for if
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64899:98"/>
it were such a condition, then I agree it would be naught; but
yet the Bond would stand good, for this is not a condition to
do an act w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is <hi>Malum in se,</hi> for there the condition is naught
&amp; the Bond also, as 2 <hi>E. 4. 2. b.</hi> by <hi>Cooke</hi> &amp; <hi>Instit. 206. b.</hi> But
although a man cannot make a feoffm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

that the feoffee shall not alien, yet the feoffee may bind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that he will not alien, and the Bond is good; and so I
say in our Case, and if the condition in this Case should not
be good, it would be very inconvenient; for it is a usual thing
in a Town in the Country, for a man to buy the shop of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man &amp; all his Wares in it, and if (the same being a small
town, where one of that profession would serve for the whole
Town) he who bought the shop and wares should not have
the power to restrain him (the same being the ground &amp; reason
of the contract) from using of that trade in that pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, it would
be very inconvenient, wherefore he conceived that the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was good, and prayed Judgment for the Plaintiff. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
<hi>Clarke</hi> for the Defendant, that the condition is not good,
for it is against the Law, and void, because it takes away the
livelihood of a man, &amp; that is one of the reasons against Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies,
11 <hi>Rep.</hi> 86, &amp; 87. And that I conceive is grounded
upon the Law of God, for in <hi>Deut. chap. 24. ver.</hi> 6. it is said,
that <hi>you shall not take in pledge the nether and upper milstone,
for that is his life.</hi> So that by the Law of God the restraining of
any man from his Trade which is his livelihood is not lawful.
And surely, our Law ought not to be against the Law of God;
and that is the reason, as I conceive, wherefore by our Law the
Utensils of a mans Profession cannot be distreined, because
by that means the means of his livelihood should be taken
away. And 2 <hi>H. 5. fol. 5. b.</hi> by <hi>Hull,</hi> the condition is against
Law, and yet the case there is the very Case with our case, for
there a man was bound, that he should not use his Art in <hi>D.</hi>
for two years; whereupon <hi>Hull</hi> swore by God, that if the
Obligee were present he should go to prison till he had paid
a fine to the King, because the Bond is against Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
agrees the 11 <hi>Rep. 53. b.</hi> &amp; 7 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 65. A Farmer cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
not to sow his land; the covenant is void: so as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64899:98"/>
that although the condition be restrictive only to one
place, or for a time, yet because it takes away the livelihood
of a man for the time, the condition is against Law, and void;
and he cited a Case in the point against <hi>Clegat</hi> and <hi>Batcheller,
Mich. 44 Eliz.</hi> in this Court, <hi>Rot.</hi> 3715. where the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Bond was, That he should not use his Trade in such

Law, and therefore the Bond void; and for these reasons he
prayed that Judgment might be entred, that the Plaintiff <hi>nihil
capiat per billam.</hi> Justice <hi>Reeve</hi> did produce some Presidents
in the point; and he said that the Law as it had been adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
stood upon this difference betwixt a contract, or <hi>Assumpfit,</hi>
and an Obligation: A man may contract or promise that he
will not use his Trade, but he cannot bind himself in a Bond
not to do it; for if he do so it is void. And for that he cited
<hi>Clegat</hi> and <hi>Batchellers</hi> Case before, that the obligation in such
Case is void; and he said, that the reason which was given
by one, why the Bond should be void, was grounded upon
the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta, cap.</hi> 29. which wills, That no
freeman should be ousted of his Liberties but <hi>per legem terrae;</hi>
and he said, that the word Liberties did extend to Trades;
and <hi>Reeve</hi> said, that by the same reason you may restrain a
man from using his Trade for a time, you may restrain him
for ever. And he said, that he was confident that you shall
never find one Report against the Opinion of <hi>Hull, 2 H.</hi> 5. For
the other part of the difference, he cited <hi>Hill. 17 Iac.</hi> in this
Court, <hi>Rot.</hi> 1265. and 19 <hi>Iac.</hi> in the Kings Bench <hi>Braggs</hi>
case; in which Cases he said, it was adjudged against the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon a Bond, but with the Action of the Case upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
that it would lie. But note, that all the Judges, <hi>viz. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
Reeve</hi> and <hi>Crawley (Bankes</hi> being absent) held clearly,
that if the condition be against the Law, that all is void, and
not the condition only as was objected by <hi>Evers,</hi> and it was
adjorned.</p>

and five years passed, and now another <hi>Scire facias</hi> is brought
to execute the first fine, to which the fine <hi>Sur conusance de

the fine with Proclamations shall bar the <hi>Scire facias</hi> or not.
Serjeant <hi>Gotbold</hi> for the Plaintiff, it shall not bar; and his
first reason was, because not executed, 1 <hi>Rep.</hi> 96, 97. and 8
<hi>Rep.</hi> 100. If a disseisor at the Common Law before the Statute
of Non-claim, had levied a fine, or suffered Judgment in a
Writ of Right until Execution sued, they were no bars, and
a fine at Common Law was of the same force as it is now, and
if in those Cases no bar at Common Law until Execution,
that proves that this interest by the fine upon grant and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is not such an interest as can bar another fine, before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.
Besides, this Judgment by the <hi>Scire facias</hi> is a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Statute, and Judgment cannot be voided but by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
or attaint. Further, a <hi>Scire facias</hi> is not an Action within
the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and therefore cannot be a bar, 41 <hi>E.
3.</hi> 13. &amp; 43 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 13. Execution upon <hi>Scire feci</hi> retorned
without another plea; and it is not like to a Judgment; for
there the party may enter, but not here. Besides, it shall be
no bar, because it is executory only, and <hi>in custodia legis,</hi>
and that which is committed to the custody of the Law, the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64899:99"/>
Law doth preserve it, as it is said in the 1 <hi>Rep. 134. b.</hi> and
he compared it to the Cases there put, and a fine cannot fix
upon a thing executory, and the estate ought to be turned to
a right to be bound by a fine, as it is resolved in the 10 <hi>Rep.
96. a. &amp; 9 Rep. 106. a. Com.</hi> 373. And the estate of him by
the first fine upon grant and render is not turned to a right by
the second fine. Lastly, the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. is a general
Law, and in the affirmative, and therefore shall not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Statute of <hi>West.</hi> 2. which gives the <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and in
proof of that he cited 39 <hi>H. 6. 3. 11 Rep. 63. &amp;</hi> 68. and 33 <hi>H.
8. Dyer</hi> 15. I agree the Case which hath been adjudged, that
a fine will bar a Writ of Error, but that is to reverse a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is executed, but here the Judgment is not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

of the Commissioners a new wall was built in the form
of a Horshooe; afterwards the Commissioners taxed every man
within the level towards the repaying of the sum disbursed,
one of which was the lessee for years, whom they also trusted
for the collecting of all the mony; and charge him totally for
his land, not levying any thing upon him in the reversion, and

years died, the lease being within a short time of expiration,
his executor enters, and they charge him with the whole; and
immediately after the years expired, &amp; the executors brought
this <hi>Certior are,</hi> upon which there was many questions. Justice
<hi>Mallet:</hi> I conceive that the proceedings of the Commissioners
are not lawfully removed into this Court, because as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no <hi>Certiorare</hi> lies to remove their proceedings at this
day, because that their proceedings are in English upon which
I cannot judge, for all our proceedings ought to be in Latine.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64899:100"/>
Besides, I cannot judge upon any Case if it be not before us by
special verdict, demurrer, or writ of Error, and it is not here
in this Case by any of those ways; and if it be here by <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiorare,</hi>
yet we are not enabled to judge as this Case is; for
the conclusion of the writ is, <hi>Quod faciamus quod de jure &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum

cannot judge upon English proceedings, and they have power
to proceed in English by the Statute of 23 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 5. by
which Statute they have a kind of Legislative power given,
for it doth not reserve any power to us, to redress their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
and as I conceive no writ of error lieth at this day
to correct their proceedings, because that they are in English;
and if they have Jurisdiction and proceed according to it, we
have no power to correct them; because that the Statute
leaves them at large to proceed according to their discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
But where they have no Jurisdictio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, there we may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
them. True it is, that before the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. there
are many Presidents of <hi>Certioraries</hi> to remove the proceedings
of the Commissioners of Sewers into this Court, for then
their proceedings were in Latin, but I do not find any since
the Statute: wherefore I conclude that no <hi>Certiorare</hi> will lie
in this Case, and then the proceedings not being lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
I cannot judge upon them, wherefore I speak nothing
to the matter in Law contained in the proceedings of the
Commissioners. <hi>Heath:</hi> I conceive notwithstanding any thing
alledged by my brother <hi>Mallet</hi> that this Court is well pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of the Cause, and may well determine it: the Question

I hold that the cause is well removed by the <hi>Certiorare;</hi> there
is no Court whatsoever but is to be corrected by this Court:
I agree that after the Statute no Writ of Error lieth upon
their proceedings, but that proves not that a <hi>Certiorare</hi> lies
not, they are enabled by the Statute to proceed according to
their discretions, &amp; therefore if they proceed <hi>secundum aequu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they have no Jurisdiction, or without Commission, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64899:101"/>
to their Commission, or not by Jury, then they are to be
corrected here: if a Court of Equity proceed where they ought
not, we grant a Prohibition. Without question in trespass or
Replevin their proceedings are examinable here; and I see
no reason but upon the same ground in a <hi>Certiorare</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make a decree of things meerly collateral, or concerning
other persons; here they have certified their Commission,
and that the assessment was by a Jury of twelve men, but
if they had certified that it was <hi>per sacrament. Iuratorum</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
without saying twelve men, it had not been good, as
it was by us lately adjudged, because that for any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to the contrary it might be by two or three only,
where it ought to be by twelve; and I conceived they have
well done here in laying all upon the lessee for years: by the
Law of Sewers, all which may be endamaged; or have benefit,
are chargeable, and it is in their discretion so to do. But in
this case they may charge the lessee or lessor (if not for the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
covenant of the lessee) at their discretions, for the Statute
saith <hi>owners</hi> or <hi>occupiers;</hi> &amp; I conceive that the covenant here
doth bind the lessee, for it is presumed that he hath considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
benefit for it, and the Commissioners may take notice of
it. But if the covenant doth not bind the lessee, yet I for my
part will not reverse their decree for that, because that where
they have Jurisdiction they may proceed according to their
discretions, and he covenanted to pay all taxes concerning the
premisses, and here it concerns the premisses although the wall
be in a new form: and it was objected, that it is now fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an executor, which is hard; which is not so because the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stator
was chargeable, and here the executor occupies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be but for a short time, and he was an occupier at
the time of the decree, and therefore it is reason that he should
be charged. But it was further objected that he hath not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets;
I answer, that was not alledged before the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
and if an Action be brought against executors at the
Common Law, and they plead, and take not advantage of not
having assets, it is their own fault, and therefore shall be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged:
so here. But it was further objected, that the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64899:101"/>
have not Jurisdiction of damages, <hi>viz.</hi> with the interest
of the mony. But I hold clearly otherwise, that they having
Jurisdiction of the principal, shall have Jurisdiction of the
damages; wherefore I conclude that the Commissioners have
well done, and that their decree is good. <hi>Bramston</hi> Chief
Justice: in this Case there are five points. First, whether the
covenant shall extend to this new wall or not. Secondly,
whether this collateral covenant be within their Jurisdiction
or not. Thirdly, whether their power do extend to an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
or not. Fourthly, whether they have Jurisdiction of
damages or not. And lastly, whether their proceedings be
lawfully removed by this <hi>Certiorare</hi> or not: for the latter I
hold that their proceedings are lawfully removed, and that
the <hi>Certiorare</hi> lieth at this day to remove their proceedings;
but I confess, if I had thought of it, I would not have granted
it so easily, but it was not made any scruple at the Bar, nor any
thing said to it, and hereafter I shall be very tender in gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them. True it is, before the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. they
were common, but there are few to be found after the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and we ought to judge here as they ought to judge there,
and we cannot determine any thing upon English proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and at first I put that doubt to the Clerks of the Court,
Whether if we confirm their decree, we ought to remand it,
or whether we ought to execute it by Estreat into the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
or not, and they could not resolve me, wherefore I much
doubted whether we might proceed to question their decree
upon this <hi>Certiorare</hi> or not. But because I was informed that the
parties by agreement have made this case as it is here before us
upon the <hi>Certiorare</hi> and have bound themselves voluntarily in
a recognisance to stand to the Judgment of the Court upon the
proceedings as they were removed upon the <hi>Certiorare</hi> by the
agreement of the parties, therefore I did not stick upon the,
<hi>Certiorare,</hi> because what was done was by consent, <hi>&amp; consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
tollit errorem,</hi> if any be. Now for the points as they arise
upon the proceedings of the Commissioners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for the first,
I hold that the covenant doth well extend to this new wall;
and the making of it in the form of a horshooe is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64899:102"/>
so as it be adjoyning to the land as it here was, for that
may be ordered according to their discretions: it is a rule in
Law, that the covenant of every man ought to be construed
very strong against himself; and although that in this Case
the new wall be not parcel of the premisses, as it was at the
time of the covenant; because that the wall then in <hi>esse</hi> and
to which the covenant did extend was a straight wall, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the words of the covenant, this tax is towards the
reparation of the premisses, and if it should not extend to this
new wall, the covenant should be idle and vain; and clearly,
the meaning of the parties was, that it should extend to all
new walls. For the second point, I hold the covenant, although
it be a collateral thing, within their Jurisdiction: true it is, as
it is said in 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. that contracts are as private Laws betwixt
party and party: but you ought to know that their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
gives them power to charge every man according to his
tenure, portion, and profit; and he who is bound by custom
or prescription to repair such walls is not within the words
of their Commission; yet it is resolved in the 10 <hi>Rep.</hi> 139, 140.
in <hi>Kighleys</hi> case that the Commissioners may take notice of it,
and charge him only for the reparations, where there is
default in him and the danger not inevitable; and by the
same reason you may exclude this covenant to be out of their
Jurisdiction, you may exclude prescription also. I agree that
where the covenant is meerly collateral, as if a man who is
a stranger covenants to pay charges for repairing of such a
wall, that that is not within their Jurisdiction, because he is a
meer stranger, and cannot be within their Commission; but in
our Case it is otherwise, for the covenantor is occupier of the
land, and it hath been adjudged, that if lands or chattels are
given for the reparation of a Sea-wall, that it is within their
Jurisdiction, and they may meddle with it, &amp; that is as collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
as the covenant in question, wherefore I hold that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is within their Jurisdiction. For the third point, I hold
that they may well charge the executor, for the executor here
hath the lease as executor: but it was objected, That the
term is now determined, and peradventure the executor hath
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:64899:102"/>
not assets; To that I answer, that it is admitted that he hath
assets, for the Commissioners cannot know whether he hath
assets or not, and therefore he ought to have alledged the
same before the Commissioners, and because he hath not done
it he hath lost that advantage, and it shall be intended that
he hath assets by not gain-saying of it. Fourthly, for the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
I first chiefly doubted of that, but now I hold that it
is within their Jurisdiction: Put case that one in extreme ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
as in this Case, disburse all the money for the reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or the wall, or Sea-bank, if the Case had gone no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
clearly, he shall be repaid by the tax and levy after; and
I conceive by the same reason they have power to allow him
damages and use for his mony; for if it should not be so, it
would be very inconvenient, for who would after disburse
all the money to help that imminent danger and necessity if
he should not be allowed use for his money? and the Lessee
here is only charged with the damages for the money colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
which he had in his hands, and converted to his own use,
and therefore it is reasonable that he should be charged with
all the damages. Besides, they having conusans of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
have conusans of the accessory as in this Case of the
damages, and he urged <hi>Fitz. 113. a.</hi> to prove that before the
Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. they had a Court, and were called Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
but he held as it was agreed before, That no Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
lieth after this Statute, but yet he said that the party grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
should be at no loss thereby; for he said, that where the
party cannot have a Writ of Error, nor <hi>Audita querela,</hi> there
he shall be admitted to plead, as in 11 <hi>H. 7. 10. a.</hi> Where
a Recognisance of debt passed for the King upon issue tried,
and afterwards the King pardons it, the party after Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may plead it, because <hi>Audita querela</hi> doth not lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King, and where a man is not party to a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there he cannot have a Writ of Error, but there he
may falsifie, so I conceive that he may in this Case, because he
cannot have a Writ of Error; and I conceive as it hath been
said before, that after the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
of Sewers have a mixt Jurisdiction of Law and equity.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64899:103"/>
For the <hi>Certiorare</hi> I will advise hereafter how I grant it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I conceive (as I have said before) that a <hi>Certiorare lies</hi>
after the Statute, and is not taken away by the Statute, and I
conceive in some clearness that it may be granted where any
fine is imposed upon any man by Commissioner, which they
have authority to do by their Commission; as appeareth by the
Statute to moderate it in Case that it be excessive. But as I
have said before, because that the parties by agreement volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
bound themselves by Recognisance to stand to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Court upon the proceedings as they are certified,
that made me at this time not to stand upon the <hi>Certiorare,</hi>
wherefore I do confirm the decree.</p>

                  <hi>Assumpsit,</hi> because by the release to one obligor the other is

consideration, and therefore the promise void, because it is

because that although by the release to one obligor,
the debt of the other be discharged <hi>sub modo, viz.</hi> if the other

and then clearly there can be no consideration in this Case.
Justice <hi>Reeve:</hi> every promise ought to have a consideration,

four defaults were made, and that <hi>I. S.</hi> did tender
caution for the re-delivery of the goods so attached and
condemned, if the debt were disproved within the year; and
that notwithstanding the said <hi>Heaman</hi> would not deliver the
goods, for which he was imprisoned by the Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty
until, <hi>&amp;c. Widdrington</hi> of Counsel with the prisoner,
took this exception to the Retorn, that it appeareth by the
Retorn that <hi>Kent</hi> who was the debtor was dead before the
attachment, and you shall never attach the goods of any
man as his goods after his death, because they are not his
goods, but the goods of the executor in the right of the testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
Besides, although the attachment be upon the goods, yet
the Action ought to be against the person, which cannot be
he being dead, wherefore he prayed that the prisoner might

be discharged. <hi>Hales;</hi> that the attachment is well made, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that the party was dead at the time of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for it is the custom of their Court so to proceed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that the party be dead. Besides, he said that although
that the party were dead, yet the goods are <hi>bona defuncti,</hi>
and to prove that he cited 10 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 1. the opinion of <hi>Danby</hi>
and <hi>Catesby.</hi> That the grant of <hi>Omnia bona &amp; catalla sua</hi> by
an executor will not pass the goods which he hath as execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,

was here said by <hi>Bramston</hi> Chief Justice, that it had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
divers times against the opinion aforesaid, that it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the goods which the executor hath as executor: and he
said, that if a man hath a judgment against an executor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
goods, the Judgment shall be that he recover <hi>bona defun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti.</hi>
To that the Court said, that the Judgment is not <hi>quod

to be against the person, which cannot be when he is dead, to
that <hi>Hales</hi> said, that in the Admiralty the Action is against the
goods, and therefore the death of the person is not material;
to that Justice <hi>Heath</hi> said, that it is the party who is charged,
the goods are only chargeable in respect of the person, and
you shall never charge the goods alone, but there ought to
be a party to answer. <hi>Hales:</hi> if they have Jurisdiction, they
may proceed according to their Law, and we cannot hinder

<hi>Bramston</hi> Chief Justice asked the Proctor of the Admiralty
then present this Question, Whether by their Law the death
of the party did not abate the action; and he said that it did;
then said the Chief Justice, it is clear that an attachment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be against the goods the party being dead; wherefore by

of the party is no good custom; and therefore they g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>246. THe Case was thus: <hi>Henry</hi> the 8 seised of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
in which are Copyholds, grants a Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
for life generally, and whether this be a
destroying of the Copyhold or not, was the Question. And
it was argued by <hi>Harris</hi> that the grant was utterly void, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the King was deceived in his grant, for he said, the King
had election to grant it by Copy, and therefore it shall not be
destroyed by a general grant without notice, and cited many
Cases to prove that where the King is deceived in the Law,
his Grant shall be void; but <hi>Bramston</hi> Chief Justice and the
Court said, that it never recited in any of the Grants of
the King what is Copyhold, and they were clear of Opinion
that the Grant was not void. But whether it destroy the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyhold
or not, so as the King hath not election to grant the
same after by Copy, that they agreed might be a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Serjeant <hi>Rolls</hi> at another day argued that the Copyhold
was destroyed by the Kings grant, but he agreed that it is not
reason that the Patent should be utterly void, for that he
said would overturn all the Kings grants, for there is not any
Patent that ever recited Copyhold, and therefore the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, whether the Copyhold be destroyed or not, and he argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that it is, because there needeth not auy recital of Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
<hi>Br. Pat.</hi> 93. It is agreed that where the King grants
Land which is in lease for term of years of one who was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64899:105"/>
or of an Abby or the like, that the grant is good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
recital of the lease of him who was attainted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For
he shall not recite any lease but leases of Record, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
agreeth 1 <hi>Rep. 45. a.</hi> and <hi>Dyer, fol. 233. pl.</hi> 10, &amp; 11.
Now he said there is no Record of these Copyholds, and
therefore there needs not any recital of them, and therefore
the King is not deceived. Further he said, that no man is
bounden to inform the King in this Case, and therefore the
King ought to take notice, and then the reason of the Case
of a common person comes to the Kings Case, because the
Copyhold was not demiseable for time as before, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the nature of a Copyhold, and therefore of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
is destroyed, and the Court as I said before, did conceive
the Case questionable.</p>

land is extended, the Statute is afterwards satisfied by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of time, and the grantee of the rent did distrain; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he might without bringing a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> was the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And the Case was several times debated at the Bar, and
now upon solemn debate by the Judges at the Bench, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
But first, there was an exception taken to the pleading,
which was, that the avowant saith, that the Plaintiff took
the profits from such a time to such a time, by which he was
satisfied, that was said to be a plea only by argument, and
not an express averment, and therefore was no good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  </gap>, <hi>ut, cum, tam, quam,</hi>
are good issues. Now for the point in Law, Justice <hi>Mallet</hi> was
for the Avowant, that the distress was lawful, the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64899:106"/>
of the Rent cannot have a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> because he is a
stranger, and a stranger cannot have a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> either to
account, or have the land back again. The Cases which were
objected by my Brother <hi>Rolls, viz. 32 E. 3. tit. Scire facias 101.
Br. Scire facias 84. &amp; Fitz. Scire facias</hi> 134. That the feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee
shall have a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> do not come to our Case, for
here the grantee of the Rent is a stranger not only to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
but to the Land, which the feoffee is not. Further, it was
objected, that the Grantee of the Rent claims under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nusor,
and therefore shall not be in a better condition than the
Conusor; there are divers Cases where grantee of a rent shall
be in better condition than the Conusor; the Lord <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes</hi>
Case: a man makes a lease for years rendring rent, and
afterwards acknowledgeth a Statute, and afterwards grants
over the rent, now it is not extendable. Besides, it was obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
that if this should be suffered it would weaken the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Statute and disturb it: I agree that may be, but
if there be not any fraud nor collusion, it is not material, and
then he being a stranger, if he cannot have a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> he
may distrain: it is a Rule in Law, <hi>Quod remedio distituitur ipsa
re valet, si culpa absit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 21 H.</hi> 7. 33. Where there is no Action
to avoid a Record, there it may be avoided by averment, <hi>&amp;c.

38. a.</hi> A man grants a rent, and afterwards suffers a recovery,
the grantee shall not falsifie the recovery because he is a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the recovery, but he may distrain, which is the same
Case in effect with our Case: for which cause I conceive that
the distress is good, and that the Replevin doth not lie. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<hi>Heath:</hi> the distress is unlawful, for he ought to have a
<hi>Scire facias,</hi> clearly the conusor ought to bring a <hi>Scire facias,</hi>
See the Statute of 13 <hi>E. 1. Fulwoods</hi> Case, 4 <hi>Rep. 2 R.</hi> 3. &amp; 15
<hi>H.</hi> 7. and the reason why a <hi>Scire facias</hi> is granted, is, because
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64899:106"/>
that when a possession is setled, it ought to be legally evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
Besides, it doth not appear in this Case when the time
expired: besides, costs are to be allowed in a Statute as <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods</hi>
Case is, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he same ought to be judged by the Court
and not by a Jury, which is a reason which sticks with me,
see the Statute of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 6. it is objected that the Grantee of
the rent cannot have a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> it will be agreed that the
conusor himself cannot enter without a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and I
conceive <hi>à fortiori</hi> not the Grantee of the Rent. I do not
say here there is fraud, but great inconvenience and mischief
if arrerages incurred for a great time (as in this Case it was)
shall be all levied upon the conusee, for any small disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as for a shilling, without any notice given to him by
<hi>Scire facias,</hi> and he should be so ousted and could not hold o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
I hold that of necessity there ought to be a <hi>Scire facias,</hi>
and he ought to provide with the Grantor to have a <hi>Scire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi>
in some fit time, but I hold that the Grantee here may
well have a <hi>Scire facias.</hi> I agree the Cases where it is to avoid
a Record, there ought to be privity, as the Books are, but here
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> doth not avoid the Record, but allows it, for the <hi>Scire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi>
ought to be only to account, 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. The second co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nusee
of a Statute shall have a <hi>Scire facias</hi> against the first
conusee, and I conceive that by the same reason the
Grantee of the rent here shall have it, and in that Case there is
no privity betwixt the first conusee and the second conusee;
for which cause he did conclude that the distress was unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and that the Reple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

have a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> but if he may have a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> yet
he may distrein without it. There is no authority in the
Law directly in the point in this Case: I agree that if there
be any prejudice to the conusee, there it is reason to have a
<hi>Scir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> facias.</hi> It was objected, that it is a constant course to have
a <hi>Scire facias</hi> in this Case. But I believe you will never find a
<hi>Scire facias</hi> brought by the Grantee of a rent, or other profit
apprender. Besides, the best way to judge this Case is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
what the <hi>Scire facias</hi> is which ought to be brought, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64899:107"/>
what the Judgment is which is given upon it, whether he
may recover the thing in demand or not, <hi>vid. 32 E. 3. Fitz.
Scire facias 101. &amp; 47 E.</hi> 3. 11. which are brought to have
account, and to shew cause wherefore he should not have the
land: see <hi>Fitz. Scire facias 43. v.</hi> The old Entries, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is given thereupon, and the demand there is <hi>quod
tenement. praed. redeliberatur,</hi> and may the grantee in this Case
have the land and thing in demand? certainly not; and that
gives sufficient answer to the Cases objected by my Brother
<hi>Heath,</hi> where the second conusee shall have a <hi>Scire facias</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the first. Besides, you shall never find in all our Books
that a man shall have an attaint or a writ of error, but he who
may be restored to the thing lost by the judgment or verdict,
2 <hi>R. 3. 21 Dyer. 89. 9 Rep.</hi> the Lord <hi>Sanchars</hi> Case; so in
debt and erroneous Judgment upon it, wherewith agreeth
Doctor <hi>Druries</hi> Case, 8 <hi>Rep.</hi> 12. &amp; 18 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 24. the feoffee
shall have a Writ of Error, because he shall have the land, and
see 32 <hi>E. 3. Scire facias</hi> 101. And the grantee shall not have
a Writ of Error in this Case upon erroneous Judgment, and
for the same reason he shall not have a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and the
grantee cannot have a <hi>Scire facias</hi> for want of privity, and
therefore I conclude that he cannot have a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> for if
he might, certainly it would have been brought before this
time, either for this cause, or for some other profit apprender.
It was objected that he shall not be in better condition than
the conusor, that is regularly true as to the right, but he may
have another remedy. It was objected that the reason why
that a Statute without a <hi>Scire fatias</hi> shall not be defeated is,
because he is in by Record, and therefore shall not be defeated
without Record, but that is not the true reason, but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because the conusee ought to have costs and damages,
besides his debt, as is <hi>Fullwoods</hi> Case 4 <hi>Rep</hi> and 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 16.
is, that the Chancellor shall judge of the costs and damages.

that they lie in averment. But here an inconvenience was
objected, that great arrerages should be put upon the conusee
for a little mistaking; to that he said, that of a small mistake the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:64899:107"/>
Court shall judge, and it shall not hurt him, but if he hold o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
being doubly satisfied, it is reason that he pay the ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

good. And here it was agreed, that to say that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is a Bawd, will not bear an Action; but to say, she keeps a
Bawdy-house, will. <hi>Porter,</hi> who was for the Action cited a
Case, which was thus. One said of the wife of another,
that she had bewitched all his beasts; and she and her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
joyned in an Action, and upon debate it was adjudged
good; and there the conclusion also of the plea was <hi>ad dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num

               <head>Rickebies Case.</head>
               <p>250. <hi>RIckebie</hi> was indicted in <hi>Durham</hi> for Murder, and
afterwards the Indictment was removed into the
Kings Bench, where he pleaded his Pardon; which Pardon had
these words in it, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Homicidium feloniam, felonicam inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionem,
necem, &amp;c. seu quocunque alio modo ad mortem deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerit.</hi>
And note, there was a <hi>Non obstante</hi> in the Pardon of any
Statute made to the contrary; and whether these words in
the Pardon were sufficient to pardon Murder or not, was the
Question. <hi>Hales</hi> for the Prisoner said, that the Pardon was
sufficient to pardon Murder, and in his argument first he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
whether Murder were pardonable by the King at the
Common Law or not, and he argued that it was; the King
is interessed in the suit, and by the same reason he may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
it. It is true, that it is <hi>Malum in se,</hi> and therefore will not
admit of dispensation, nor can an appeal of Murder which is
the suit of the Subject be discharged by the King but the King
may pardon Murder although he cannot dispense with it: see
<hi>Bracton lib. 3. cap.</hi> 14. And the Law of the J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ws differs from
our Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; so the constitution of other Realms; then the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is, Whether this Prerogative of the King to pardon mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
be taken away by any Statute or not; and first for the
Statute of 2 <hi>E. 3 cap.</hi> 2. upon which all the other Statutes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend:
that Statute made was only to prevent the frequencie
of Pardons, but not totally to take away the Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
for the words of the Statute are, <hi>That offenders were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
because that Charters of Pardon were so easily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in times past,</hi> &amp;c. And the Statute of 13 <hi>R. 2. cap.</hi> 2. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the Power and Prerogative of the King of pardoning
Murder notwithstanding the former Statute; for that Statute
prescribes the form only; and 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. in the Parliament-Roll,
<hi>Number</hi> 36. the King saith, <hi>Saving his Prerogative.</hi> The
next thing considerable here is, admitting Murder pardonable
by the King, Whether in this Pardon there be sufficient words
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:64899:109"/>
to pardon murder or not, and he argued that there was; and
first for the word <hi>(felony)</hi> and he said, that by the Common
Law pardon of felony is pardon of murder; the Statute of
18 <hi>E. 3. cap.</hi> 2. inables Justices of Peace to hear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
felonies; and in 5 <hi>E. 6. Dyer 69. a.</hi> it is holden clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that the Justices of Peace by virtue of that act have autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to inquire of murder, because it is felony; and in <hi>Instit.
391. a.</hi> By the Law at this day under the word <hi>(felony)</hi> in
Commissions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is included Petit Treason, Murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
murder being felony, the pardon of felony is the pardon
of murder. Further he said, that the pardon of manslaughter
is a good pardon of murder; for he said that murder and
manslaughter are all one in substance, and differ only in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance,
as the Book in <hi>Plowd. Comment. fol.</hi> 101. is, and if
they were divers offences, then the Jury could not find a
man indicted of murder guilty of manslaughter, as it was in
the Case before cited. The last words are, <hi>&amp; quocunque alio
modo ad mortem devenerit,</hi> which extends to all deaths what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever;
and if it should not be so, the Statute of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. should
be in vain. I agree the Books of 1 <hi>E. 3. 14 22 Ass.</hi> 49. &amp;
21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 24. objected on the other side, that the pardon of
felony doth not extend to treason, with which the <hi>Institutes
391</hi> agrees, they make not against me; see the Statute of 25
<hi>E. 3. cap.</hi> 2. and the Books of 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 26. by <hi>Billin.</hi> &amp; 8 <hi>H.
6.</hi> 20. by <hi>Strange,</hi> they are but bare opinions. It was objected
that an Indictment at the Common Law shall not extend to
murder unless the word <hi>(Murdravit)</hi> be in the Indictment: I
answer, that a pardon of felony may pardon robbery, and yet
here ought to be also <hi>Robberia</hi> in the Indictment. A pardon
need not nor can follow the form of Indictments, the offence
apparent, it sufficeth. Further, he argued that the King might
dispense with the Statute of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3. &amp; 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. by a <hi>Non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante.</hi>
It was objected, that the Kings grant with a <hi>Non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante</hi>
the Statute of 13 <hi>R. 2. cap.</hi> 5. of the Admiralty is not
good, and that so of a pardon o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> murder with a <hi>Non obstante:</hi>
to that he answered, and took this difference, Where the
subject hath an immediate interest in an Act of Parliament,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64899:109"/>
there the King cannot dispense with it, and such is the case
of the Admiralty; but where the King is intrusted with the
managing of it, and the subject only by way of consequence,
there he may: see 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. 12. &amp; 2 <hi>H</hi> 7. 6. It was objected,
that the King cannot dispense with the inquiry of the Court
upon the Statute of 13 <hi>R. 2. cap.</hi> 1. To that he answered,
that the inquiry is the Kings suit, and therefore he may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense
with it: See 5 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 29. It was objected further, that
the Pardon saith, <hi>Vnde indictatus est.</hi> To that he answered,
That if it be left out it is good without it, for the same is
only for information; See 36 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 25. And the words of
pardon are usual to say, <hi>Vnde indictatus vel non indictatus,
utlegat' vel non utlegat'</hi> and that would avoid all Pardons
before if it should be suffered, and for these causes he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
and prayed that the Pardon might be allowed. <hi>Shaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe</hi>
of <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> at another day argued for the King, that the
pardon was insufficient, and first he said, That the words of
the pardon were not sufficient to pardon murder. For the
words <hi>Homicidium</hi> and <hi>Feloni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>am interfectionem</hi> are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
words, and therefore shall not be taken in a strict and
strained sense. It is true, that killing is the <hi>Genus,</hi> but there
are several Species of it and several offences. Now for the
word <hi>(Felony)</hi> I conceive that the pardon of Felony will not
pardon murder, <hi>vide 33 H. 8. 50. fol. 4. Dyer.</hi> But yet I
conceive that felony in the general sense will extend to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
but not in a Pardon, for there ought to be precise and
express words, and so are the Books of 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 20. by
<hi>Strange,</hi> and 22 <hi>H. 7. Keilway 31 b.</hi> express in the point,
<hi>Hill. 2. Iac. Institut. 391. a.</hi> and <hi>Stamford</hi> Pleas of the
Crown, 114. <hi>a.</hi> If a man be indicted for an offence done
upon the Sea, it is not sufficient for the Indictment to say <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonicè,</hi>
but it ought also to say <hi>Pyraticè.</hi> And pardon of all
felonies is not a Pardon of all Pyracie; by the same reason,
here pardon of Felony is no pardon of Murder. For the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ast
words, <hi>Quocunque alto modo ad mortem pervenerit,</hi> these words
do not pardon Murder, because they are too general, <hi>vide</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:64899:110"/>
8 <hi>H. 4. 2. &amp; 29 Ass. Pl.</hi> 24. And clearly if there were but
these general words they would not pardon Murder. I was
objected that these words are as much as if murder had been
expressed in the pardon. To that he answered, that the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 13 <hi>R. 2. cap.</hi> 1. saith that the offence it self ought to
be expressed, and doth not say by words equipollent; and
the Title of the Statute is, that the offence committed ought
to be specified. In all Pardons the King ought to be truly
informed of the form, as also of the Indictment and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
upon it: See 6 <hi>Rep. fol.</hi> 13. and here is no recital in
the Pardon, 9 <hi>E. 4. 28. 8 H.</hi> 4. 2. Pardon of Attainder doth
not pardon the felony, and pardon of the felony doth not
pardon the Attainder. I agree that the King may pardon
his suit, but the same ought to be by apt words. The words
of <hi>Licet indictatus,</hi> or <hi>non indictatus,</hi> will not help it, it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the proceedings only, and not to the matter. Besides,
the Law presumes that the Patent or Pardon is at the sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
of the party; and therefore if the King be not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
informed of his Grant, he is deceived, and the Grant void;
and perhaps if the King had been informed that the fact done
was murder, he would not have pardoned it; and the words
<hi>Ex certa scientia</hi> shall not make the Grant good, where the
King is deceived by false suggession of the party: See <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonwoods</hi>
Case, 1 <hi>Rep. 46. a.</hi> &amp; 52. <hi>b. 9. E. 4. 26. b.</hi> is an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in the point: by <hi>Billing</hi> Charter of Pardon ought to
make express mention of murder, or otherwise it will not
pardon it; and 22 <hi>H. 7. 91. b. Keilway,</hi> Pardon of all fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies
will not pardon murder, <hi>Br. Charter de pardon</hi> 10.
there ought to be express words of murder in the pardon:
See the <hi>Old Entries 455. 2 H.</hi> 7. 6. by <hi>Ratcliffe</hi> objected,
that the King may pardon murder with a <hi>Non obstante,</hi> that
I agree, but if ought to be by express words: See <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
Pleas of the Crown, <hi>fol.</hi> 103, 104. and 19. <hi>a.</hi> Where it
is said, that a pardon of all felonies doth not extend to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Besides, I conceive that a <hi>Non obstante</hi> cannot dispense
with the Statute of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. I agree that where there is a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64899:110"/>
penalty only given by the Statute, there the King may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence
with it. I agree the Book of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. there it was a
penalty only. I agree also that the King may dispense with
the Statute of <hi>Quia emptores <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>errarum,</hi> as the Book is, <hi>N. B.
3. 211. f.</hi> But when a Statute is absolute and not <hi>Sub modo,</hi>
there he cannot dispense with it: See 18 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 352.
and 8 <hi>Rep. 29. Princes</hi> Case, <hi>Institut. 120 a.</hi> and <hi>Hobarts
Rep.</hi> 103. The King with a <hi>Non obstante</hi> cannot dispense
with the Statute of Simony, because it is a positive Law and
not <hi>Sub modo,</hi> and this Statute of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. is for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good. It was objected that the King may pardon mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by the Common Law, and that the Statute of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2.
takes away the inquiry only; further, it was objected, that
the Statute of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3. did allow that the King might pardon
murder, but not so easily; and the Statute of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. is sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ng
our Regality, by which was concluded that his Prerogative is
saved. <hi>Bracton fol. 133. a.</hi> saith, that the Kings pardoning of
murder was <hi>contra justitiam,</hi> and <hi>Register fol. 309. Se defenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
and <hi>per infortunium</hi> only are pardonable; and that well
expounds the Statute of 2 <hi>E. 3. cap.</hi> 2. which enacts that
Charters of Pardon shall be only granted where the King
may do it by his Oath; that is to say, where a man kills an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<hi>Se defendendo,</hi> or <hi>per infortunium.</hi> And for the saving
of the Regality, which is in the Statute of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. to that
I say, that the Judges ought to judge according to the body
of the Act, and that is express that the King cannot pardon
murder. 5 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 29. and <hi>Kelway</hi> 134. there it is disputed,
but yet it came not to our Case, for that is only of a pardon
of the Kings suit: and for these reasons he prayed that the
pardon might not be allowed. <hi>Keeling</hi> for the King, that the
pardon is not sufficient to pardon murder: The Kings par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
ought to be taken strictly, and so is the 5 <hi>Rep.</hi> The
Question here is not, whether the general words shall extend
to murder; but whether it ought to be precisely expressed
in the Pardon or not, and he held that it ought; and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> held
that the King cannot dispense with the Statute of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2.
by a <hi>Non obstante</hi> the Books of 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. &amp; 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. &amp; 11.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64899:111"/>
                  <hi>Rep.</hi> 88. That the King may dispense with a Penal Law he
agreed, but he said that this Act of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. binds the King
in point of Justice, and therefore the King cannot dispense
with it; and <hi>Institutes</hi> 234<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the King by a <hi>Non obstante</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
dispense with the buying and selling of Offices contrary
to the Statute, because it toucheth and concerneth Justice.
Wherefore he prayed that the Pardon might not be allowed.</p>
