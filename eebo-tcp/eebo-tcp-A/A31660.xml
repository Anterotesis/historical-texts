            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

READER.</head>
            <p>THE late <hi>happy U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
between Two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Parties among
us, is a fit Subject of <hi>Joy and
Thankfulness:</hi> That Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which have been managed
with too much heat for so many
Years, should now be so happily
composed, and the <hi>Contending
Parties</hi> should mutually condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
and concur together in <hi>so
fair an Agreement,</hi> is a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb facs="tcp:62872:3"/>
we have reason gratefully to
acknowledge; that the <hi>Country</hi>
should so readily and unanimously
agree with their Brethren in the
<hi>City</hi> on the same Terms, and
throughout the <hi>whole Nation</hi>
there should be such a willing
consent to lay aside those <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
Names</hi> and Terms
which have hitherto so miserably
divided us: These things afford
sufficient matter for <hi>praise,</hi> to
that God who rules the Hearts
of Men, and stills the ragings of
the People. I have long waited
that some Abler Pen should pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
express the Countries Sense
of this great Mercy; I said, <hi>Days
should speak, and Multitude
<pb facs="tcp:62872:3"/>
of Years should teach Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
But there is a Spirit
in Man, and the inspiration
of the Almighty giveth them
understanding,</hi> Iob 32. 7, 8.
Being invited by my Brethren to
Preach before them on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
I composed the following
<hi>Meditations,</hi> and have now
made them publick for more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
use. I hope the <hi>honesty</hi>
of the Intention will attone for
the weakness and unskilfulness
of the Manager. I am willing
to believe that <hi>Irenicums</hi> will
now be more acceptable than they
have hitherto been in this <hi>wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
divided</hi> Age, and the Sons
of Peace will be no longer liable
<pb facs="tcp:62872:4"/>
to Reproach and Scorn. O how
happy would it be if this <hi>Union
were more extensive,</hi> and an
end were put to that <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
War</hi> that hath infested
our Borders ever since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation!
<hi>God seems by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
to make way for such
a glorious work;</hi> he hath not
long since (by putting us in mind
of our common danger,) inclined
us to be more favourable one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
another: He hath by <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
Providences</hi> exalted to
the Throne a Prince of <hi>known
Piety and Moderation,</hi> who
hath placed such in the <hi>Episcopal
Chairs</hi> as are Men Famous for
their healing <hi>truly Christian
<pb facs="tcp:62872:4"/>
Spirits;</hi> happy endeavours have
been used for stopping that inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Wickedness and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaness,
which hath so wofully
overrun our Land. All these
are happy preparations for a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Union,</hi> and blessed presa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that God hath yet Designs
of Mercy towards us, and will
not suffer our Enemies to prevail
against us. Let us all therefore
help on so <hi>good a work</hi> by our
Hearty Prayers, Holy Lives,
and endeared Love: Let us main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
an unity in Love and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
though we arrive not at
<hi>Uniformity in Rituals,</hi> and
the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> parts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
In a word, to conclude all
<pb facs="tcp:62872:5"/>
with the Expressions of excellent
<hi>Bishop Hall,</hi> Let us be at Peace
with our selves, and at War
with none but Hell and <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That these Discourses may be
some way useful for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Love and Peace, is the
Hearty Earnest Prayer of a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of Peace and Truth,</p>

               <q>And be at Peace among your
selves.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>NOtwithstanding the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
commands of our
Lord to Love and Unity,
and the earnest Calls and Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of all his Apostles; yet how
apt we are to forget and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
them all, our unpeaceable
Strifes and censorious uncharitable
Contentions, are too sad a Witness.
Though our God be the God of
Love, and our Saviour the Prince
of Peace, and Love be the last
Legacy and earnest Request of our
dying Redeemer; yet he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds
the bitter malice and envy,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62872:6"/>
wrath and unchristian Jars of the
Professors of the same Faith, and
Followers of the same Blessed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
must needs think it his great
Duty to attempt the reviving that
Love which is very much decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that Charity which hath
almost forsaken the Earth: When
we see the Blood, and feel the
Smart, and hear the Noises of
Professed Christians, armed with
Malice and Spite against each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
'tis the duty of every Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
of Peace to sound a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
from this unnatural War, and
persuade the furious Combatants
to cease those Strifes, and forbear
those hot Contentions which do
so much dishonour God, disparage
Religion, grieve our Friends, and
make such ridiculous sport for our
Enemies. That therefore I may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to allay these unnatural
heats and disorders, I have chosen
the Words read; and if St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62872:6"/>
had any reason in those early A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of Christianity, (when Love
most flourished, and Christians
were most peacefully united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,)
to call upon them to be
at Peace among themselves; sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we have now far greater occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to do so, since Christianity is
broken into so many odious fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and by-names, and every
little difference is apt to provoke
our Anger, and cause our Passions
to boyl up to too excessive heights.
God hath indeed highly favoured
us by his Providence, by now
calming our Spirits, removing our
Jealousies and Mis-understandings
one of another, and reconciling
those Differences which have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
divided us many Years:
So that now we can strengthen
one anohers Hands in the work
of our Lord, and glory in the title
of United Brethren: We are now
come together solemnly to testify
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62872:7"/>
our Thankfulness to God for this
happy Union, which many of us
have long sighed, and prayed,
and waited, and laboured for in
vain. Suffer me therefore to shew
you the nature and excellencies
of Peace, and direct my self and
you to those Gospel methods
whereby our Happiness may be
continued and promoted; <hi>Be at
Peace among your selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the connexion of these
Words, we need look back no
further than <hi>ver.</hi> 12. where the
Apostle having persuaded the
<hi>Thessalonians</hi> to a due respect to
their Ministers and Spiritual Guides
for their Works sake, exhorts them
here as a means to this, <hi>to be at
Peace among themselves;</hi> as if he
should have said, unpeaceable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
will grieve your Ministers
hearts, detract from that just e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem,
which is due to their Office,
and render their labours often use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62872:7"/>
and unsuccessful; therefore be
at Peace among your selves.</p>
            <p>The Words are plain and easie
in themselves, and need rather an
hearty Meditation, and diligent
improvement, than any laborious
Explication.</p>
            <p>The Observation I shall raise from
the Words is this,</p>
            <p>That it is the duty and should
be the practice of Christian
Churches to be at Peace among
themselves.</p>
            <p>In handling whereof, I shall use
this Method.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Explain the nature of Peace.</item>
               <item>2. Shew the Advantages of
Peace in Christian Churches.</item>
               <item>3. Add some Directions for the
better maintaining and promoting
it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. The nature of Peace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Peace implies a command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62872:8"/>
irregular Passions; ungover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Lusts are the great
Makebates and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;<note place="margin">Iames 4. 1.</note>
he that hath not
attained a Government over his
Passions, is unprepared for Peace.
Selfishness and Pride, Covetousness
and Ambition, Envy and Malice
and Revenge are the bitter Fruits
that grow upon the stock of our
Ill Natures, and are the sad occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of all the disturbances in
Church and State, and have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Christendom a Field of
Blood. 'Till these Lusts are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
subdued, and we have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a victory within, outward
Peace is impossible; he that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
rule his own Spirit, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
long live at Peace with others.
<hi>An Angry Man will stir up Strife,</hi>
Prov. 29. 22. <hi>Be ye</hi> therefore <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
and Sin not,</hi> Eph. 4. 26. Let not
your Anger boyl up to any sinful
Excesses.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62872:8"/>
2. Peace implies hearty Love;
'tis very hard and difficult long to
maintain Peace with those we do
not heartily love, and utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to keep it up with those
we hate; Peace without Love is
is no better than politick Dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
and Peace with Hatred an
insidious cover of Enmity. Love
is the only sure and lasting Bond
of Peace, and Hatred the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Discord and Violence: If
we would therefore forbear and
forgive one another, and let the
Peace of God rule in our Hearts,
we must above all
things put on Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as a Rich Robe,<note place="margin">Col. 3. 12, 13, 14.</note>
our best Ornament,<note place="margin">Iohn 13. 36.</note>
and the proper Livery of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
This is indeed the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
badg of Christ's true
Disciples, whereas the Disciples of
the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were known by the
broadness of their Phylacteries,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62872:9"/>
and enlarging the Borders of their
Garments; and of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist's,
by their Leanness, contracted by
Austerities, much Fasting and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence:
Christ would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
known by their undissembled
Love, unfeigned Kindness, and
obliging Condescensions for each
others good.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Peace implies a diligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of all Offices of Justice
and Humanity; we must <hi>not love
in word and Tongue only, but in deed
and in truth,</hi> 1 John 3. 18. Justice
is the Guardian, and Humanity
the Nurse of Peace; the only So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Remedy to prevent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
and put an end to Strife.
Punctual observance of Contracts,
truth in our Words, and sincerity
in our Promises; injuring none in
their Estates by fraudulent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments,
or in their good
Names by slanderous Reports, is
a great conserver of Peace, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62872:9"/>
keeps off those Contentions which
otherwise will unavoidably arise.
A tender Compassion to those in
Want, and hearty readiness to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and assist, relieve
and comfort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
according to our
particular Exigencies
and Wants,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 10.</note> is also very necessary
in order to the advancing Peace
among Brethren.<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Peace implies courtesie and
respectfulness; this is not only an
argument of a generous Education
and good Reading, but also a great
ornament of Religion,
and required of every
Christian:<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 8.</note> Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
came into the World to
sweeten our Passions, calm our
Natures, abate the sourness, and
polish the roughness of our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.
A sour Look, sullen Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and scornful Carriage, is very
unbecoming a Christian, is the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62872:10"/>
indication of a Mind averse from
Peace, and provokes disdain in
others: But on the contrary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectful
Gestures, courteous Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
civil Salutations, and an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable
Behaviour, are accompanied
with such winning Charms as few
can resist: And <hi>when a Mans ways</hi>
thus <hi>please the Lord,</hi> they will please
men too, <hi>and our very Enemies will
be at Peace with us,</hi> Prov. 16. 7.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Peace implies candid and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Opinions; rash Censures,
uncharitable Surmises, severe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions,
and unkind Miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of our Neighbours Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
tend mightily to provoke
Wrath, and stir up Strife: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
equity in our Censures, mildness
in our Reproofs, putting the best
Construction upon, and making
the most favourable interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Neighbours Carriage
and Behaviour, is the surest way to
conciliate Peace and promote it.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62872:10"/>
Christianity indeed teacheth us to
be very severe in observing our
own Sins, but very favourable in
reflecting on the Miscarriages of
our Neighbours. Let others usurp
God's Prerogative that they may
do the Devils Work, turn Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Hearts, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Accusers of the Brethren.
The true Christian hath so much
to do at Home, that he hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little leisure to look abroad;
is so imployed in covering his own
Deformities, that he hath not time
to gaze on the nakedness of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
hides his Neighbours Faults
with the Mantle of Love, and
makes all possible allowances that
the nature of the action will bear;
will not conclude a Sin from an
inevident sign, as <hi>Eli</hi> from <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>'s
Fervency concluded her
Drunkenness. If our Neighbour
be overtaken with a Fault, the
Peaceable Christian will not from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62872:11"/>
one particular act conclude an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
nor call that a Mortal Plague,
which may be only
one of the Spots of
God's Children:<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 1.</note> Nor
will he pre-judge a
Scandalous Sinners future State,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 4.</note>
but pity and pray for him,<note place="margin">Iames 3. 1.</note> and seek
to win him to Repentance.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Peace implies restraint of
Pragmaticalness; if we would be
quiet and at Peace, we must <hi>mind
our own Business,</hi> 1 Thes. 4. 11.
Those that impertinently meddle
with things beyond their Sphere
of Activity, are <hi>disorderly Walkers,</hi>

            <p>The advantages of Peace in
Christian Churches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This renders the Church most
like to God; he is the God of
Peace, the Father of Mercies, and
not only full of Love, but <hi>love</hi> it
<hi>self, 1 Iohn</hi> 4. 16. He is all that is
good in the most eminent degree,
but he is love in a more especial
and peculiar manner; though all
his Attributes be infinite, yet his
Love and Goodness is peculiarly
Sovereign. The best description
we can frame of him in our Minds,
or whereby we can represent him
to others, is, that he is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
Alwise, Immutable Goodness;
under the old Testament, a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of Terror, when the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Divine Love were not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played,
yet even then he accounts
his Goodness as his greatest Glory,
and the most charming
Beauty of his Nature.<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 6, 7.</note>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62872:12"/>
And now what better way is
there for his Church to
be like him,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 1. 2.</note> than to be
at Peace and abound in

the Mind, how serene the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,

not much more delightful to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

than frowning with
Clouds, or big with Storms and

to hear Harmonious Sounds, than
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62872:13"/>
grating Janglings; and to dwell
in a well, Governed City, than in
a wild and savage Wilderness?
Peace is the way to the truest
Pleasure, and indeed is itself the
greatest Felicity: Hence the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in their holy Anthem, when
they wished the greatest Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to Men, knew not how bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to express their Sense, than by
saying, <hi>On Earth Peace, Good Will
to Men,</hi> Luke 2. 14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Peace is the Churches strength;
Peace is the sinew of Society, as
Mony is of War; the Cement
that holds the parts together, and
distinguishes the Congresses of
Men from Herds of Beasts, or
which is as bad, the tumultuous
Confusions of the Rabble. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Churches might be immortal,
did they not kill themselves by
Divisions; the deepest Wounds
have been given to Christianity
in the Houses of its pretended
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62872:13"/>
Friends, by Heresies and Schisms,
rending and tearing the unity of
the Body. He must be a great
Stranger in the History of the
Church, who knows not that it
flourished while it walk'd in love,
and injoyed Peace among its Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
but the adding to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
the Wood and Hay, and
Stubble of their own Inventions,
and dividing thereupon, gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to the rise of <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Pope,</hi>
and all the dismal consequences
thereof. Divisions stop'd the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
and cramp'd the
growth of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 26.</note>
and hath so of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Christianity
to this day:<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 15.</note> The most successful
policy of our Enemies whereby
they have done us the greatest
mischief of all, hath been by foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
incouraging and cursedly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
our intestine Feuds: We
have foolishly put Weapons into
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62872:14"/>
their Hands, or rather been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
our selves, while they have
look'd on with Scorn and Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Were we but peacefully uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among our selves, we should
quickly dishearten our Enemies,
and laugh at all the attempts of
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France</hi> and Hell for our
ruin and Destruction. Peace would
be a mighty Bulwark to defend us,
and would better prevent the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions
of our Foes, than all our
Wooden Walls on the Sea, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresses
and Castles by Land.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Peace tends to the comfort
of the Church; there can be no
comfortable communion of Saints,
no bearing each others burdens,
no communicating the experiences
of the workings of Gods Spirit in
one anothers Souls, of the answer
of our several Prayers, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
methods of God's dealings with
us in his different ways of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and Comfort, so long as we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62872:14"/>
are at variance among our selves.
When Souls groan under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of Sin and Guilt, never was
Drink so welcom to the Thirsty
Traveller, as the converse of truly
Spiritual Christians to restore such
in the Spirit of Meekness, and
speak Peace unto them from the
Scripture and their own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
But where Divisions are,
this cannot be had, or if it be in
some measure, is often confined to
an inconsiderable Party, and each
particular division wants the assis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the rest; so that the
breach of their Catholick Love
and Communion necessarily makes
a breach in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 1, 2.</note>
and hinders the
mutual sympathizing as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
and comforting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Peace tends to the increase
of the Church; when our Lord
repeated his Petitions for Unity,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62872:15"/>
he twice alledgeth one and the
same reason, <hi>that the World might
know that God had sent him;</hi> John
17. 21, 23: As if the union and
love of his Followers were the
strongest proof of the Divinity of
their Master, and the powerfullest
perswasive to Jews and Heathens
to acknowledge and receive him
for their Lord and Saviour; as
if his excellent Doctrin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> admirable
Precepts and extraordinary Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
would not do without it; and
indeed though Instruction be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and People perish for want
of Knowledge; yet Instruction
without Example will do little
good, and no Example is more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to observation than that of
Peace and Love, and the want
thereof in the Preachers of Truth
makes the best Doctrin in their
Mouths suspected, hardens the
Wicked in their sin, and tempts
many to Atheism: If you speak
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62872:15"/>
with disagreeing Tongues, Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
will say you are Mad, and
sit down in the Seat of the Scorner,
to allude to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Peace is a great means of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying
by the means of Grace:
The Apostle in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. speaks
of the close and intimate Union
of the Body of Christ, as a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
means to receiving increase from
Christ, and edifying it self in love;
and <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2. being knit together
in love, is laid down as a means to
the full assurance of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to the full practical perswasion
of the Truth, and excellency of
the Gospel; and the want of this
render'd the solemn Assemblies of
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> fruitless and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 17. St. <hi>Paul</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them with a sad miscarriage in
their Spiritual Traffick, growing
worse in the use of what should
have made them better, the Holy
Supper of the Lord; and the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62872:16"/>
reason is given <hi>Ver. 18. I hear there
be Divisions among you.</hi> Divisions
abate the fervency of our Prayers,
blunt the edge of our Devotions,
seize on the vitals of Christianity,
evaporate the life and power of
Religion in impertinent squabble;
and unless Almighty Grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
will quickly spread like a
Gangrene, so as to eat out the heart
thereof.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Peace in Christian Churches
is an Emblem of Heaven; the more
that part of the Church which is
Militant here below doth abound
in Love and Peace, the more it
resembles that part which is trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
above: This is indeed the
great difference between Angels
and Devils, Heaven and Hell; the
Devils have great degrees of
Power and Knowledge, perhaps
not much below what Angels
have; but Angels and Glorified
Saints abound in Love, Sweetness
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62872:16"/>
Benignity, and live in the joyful
uninterrupted exercise of mutual
Endearments; whereas a Spirit of
Malice and Envy, Hatred and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
is the very complexion of
Satan, and temper of Hell. But
O how happy will it be to dwell
in that Society, where there's no
Mistake or Envy, Ignorance or
Prejudice, or carnal Interest to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
the least Jar or Discord, but
all pure Peace, Seraphick Love
and perfect Harmony, as with God,
so also between themselves; where
the strange Fire of misguided Zeal
is extinguished by the more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Flames of Heavenly Love, and
the unhappy names of dividing
Sects are no more known; where
dark and deep Mysteries, little
doubtful Truths, and ambiguous
Words and Phrases no longer oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
any Brawls or Contentions;
where <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> and all
the Saints of God perfectly accord
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62872:17"/>
together, speak the same Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
join in the same Praises, and
pleasingly entertain and embrace
one another, with all the endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of intimate Friends and
Companions. And as we long for
this Blessed State, so 'tis our great
Duty, and will be our Happiness to
let down as much of Heaven on
Earth as we can, to anticipate our
future joys by an enlarged love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all Saints, and being at
Peace among our selves.</p>
            <p>III. General.</p>
            <p>Directions for the maintaining
and promoting of Peace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Remove the Causes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceableness;
the Effects will not
be taken away, except the Causes
cease. This Disease will prove
Mortal, and still Torment us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Fuel that feeds it be taken
away; except that Generation of
Vipers be slain, which hath for so
many Ages torn out the Bowels of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62872:17"/>
our Common Mother, the Church,
we must never expect our wide
breaches will be healed. I shall
therefore take a short view of those
Distempers, that have so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
infected us, that the discovery
may help to their Cure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the primitive healthful Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of Christianity; and while I
mention the <hi>Achans</hi> that have
sickned our Camp, and infected
our <hi>Israel,</hi> I beseech you, that you
would cast them out of your
Hearts, and have no fellowship
with these unfruitful Works of
Darkness. Be ashamed of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
for want of Peace, if you
wilfully cherish that poysonous
Brood, that will otherwise prove
your ruin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Unmortifyed Sin. Ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is the great Divider<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and till
we are partakers of the same sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Spirit, 'tis impossible we
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62872:18"/>
should love as Brethren.<note place="margin">Jam. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
'Tis as possible for the
Wolf to lie down with the Lamb,
as for Wicked Men to love the
truly Godly. While we will not
work in the same Vineyard, nor
walk in the same way, nor chuse
the same Imployment, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the same Spiritual Duties,
how can it be possible to agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?
'Tis a vain thing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
agreement in Articles of Faith,
while we will not lovingly agree
in practical Holiness.<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 3.</note> 'Tis
highly unreasonable for
wicked Wretches to rail against
Christians (like <hi>Ahab</hi> against <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>)
as Troublers of <hi>Israel,</hi> when
they themselves are the Grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries:
These Men, like <hi>Nero</hi> of
old, cast Firebrands into the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,
and then lay their guilt at
true Christians Doors: They hold
the most damnable Errors, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
Heresies, and thus render
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62872:18"/>
Union impossible: They pretend
pity to the Wounded Church, and
yet throw away the Salve and
Plaister that should cure it: They
complain that the Garment of
Christ is rent, and yet throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Needle that should sow
it up: They pretend to be grieved
to see the spiritual Building shak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet throw away the Lime and
Mortar, the Pins and the Nails
that should cement and join the
Parts together. Thus do they who
cry up Love and Unity, and yet
hate Holiness wherein Christian
Union consists: To hear an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Man, who is really of no
Religion at all, but against the
life and practice of all, cry out
of the many ways of Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Christians, is as if a Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor
should blame another for a
Spot in his Face, or a Murderer
rebuke a Man for an angry Word,
<hi>Follow Peace</hi> therefore <hi>with all Men,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62872:19"/>
and Holiness, without which no Man
shall see the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Pride: This we find already
arraigned by the wisest of Men as
the great Makebate and Troubler
of the World; <hi>Prov. 13. 10. Only
by Pride cometh Contention.</hi> As this
is true of Civil Strifes, so more
especially of Religious or rather
Irreligious Jars and Contentions;
Men are so Wise in their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
that they are angry with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one that is not of the same
level, and impatient of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
while many are very hot
in Exclamations against the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Antichrist, they observe not
this Antichristian Temper in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
they are justly offended at
others for usurping God's Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
sitting in his Throne, and
claiming a Title of Infallibility;
but do not these Fools envy the
Pope, and like <hi>Adam</hi> desire to be
God's that their Name may be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62872:19"/>
honour'd, and their Will be done
through the Earth? Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
entertain an humble suspicion
of our own Understandings, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
that an over confident
persuasion of our own Knowledge
is a certain sign of Ignorance, and
he that thinks he knows most, is
commonly most mistaken: 'Twas
not for nothing that the wisest of
Men doth so frequently give that
caution, <hi>Be not Wise in thy own
Conceit,</hi> Prov. 3. 3. 26. 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Censoriousness: The censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Backbiter is the Devils Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to Preach down Love, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
Charity, and exhort to the
hatred of the Brethren. Have not
our unnatural heats been owing
to this original? Are not we too
apt to censure those that agree not
with us in every punctilio, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
take up an evil Report a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them? Is not this contrary
to the lovely Grace of Charity,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62872:20"/>
which thinketh no Evil, miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strues
not the Actions and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of others, rejoyceth not in
Iniquity, but believeth all things,
and hopeth all things,<note place="margin">Cor. 13. 4, 5.</note>
is unapt to believe
ill without apparent
grounds,<note place="margin">Psal. 15. 3.</note> and hopes
as long as there is any reason for
hope?<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>4. Undue admiration of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Persons or Parties: This was
the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Error that divided
and miserably shattered that flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Church; one liked the
powerful plainness of <hi>Paul,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the eloquence of
<hi>Apollos,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 12. 3. 4.</note> and a third the
perspicuity of <hi>Peter,</hi> and
a fourth was above all
outward Ordinances, pretending
to the immediate Teachings of
Christ. Upon this, they vilified
all others, except those that they
had set up for an Oracle: We may
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62872:20"/>
suppose them disputing one with
another after this manner.</p>
            <p>One, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> did you
ne'er hear <hi>Paul</hi> Preach? how clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth he unfold the deep Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Salvation! how sweetly
doth he display the unsearchable
Riches of Christ! how convincingly
doth he argue, and how excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doth he direct in the way to
Salvation! As for <hi>Apollos,</hi> he guilds
over his Discourses with specious
Eloquence and gaudy Bravery;
but <hi>Paul</hi> shews the truth in the
plainest Dress, which best becomes
her; and as for <hi>Cephas,</hi> he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
fit to Catechize weak and
ignorant Christians, but he tells
me nothing but what I knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
they therefore shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Men of small Judgment, that
are for <hi>Apollos</hi> or <hi>Cephas;</hi> I am for
<hi>Paul.</hi> Another I am of <hi>Apollos:</hi>
Let who will be for <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi>
could I sit alway under <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:62872:21"/>
his Ministry, how happy
should I be? How movingly doth
he Preach, with what a happy flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
doth he insinuate himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Hearers, and by his Pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Eloquence almost constrain
attention! One while he cloaths
his Speech in a Silken Dialect, dips
each Word in a Tear, and steeps
each Phrase in Hony, that he may
win on his Auditors; another
while, he breaths out Flames and
Terrors, and causes the stoutest
Heart to quake and tremble. As
for <hi>Paul</hi> he is rude in Speech,
homely in his Expressions, and
hath no Majesty nor Presence in a
Pulpit: I admire therefore their
Ignorance that are for him; I am
for <hi>Apollos.</hi> A Third, I am for
<hi>Cephas:</hi> How doth he stoop to the
lowest and meanest capacity! doth
not Preach about such deep My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
as <hi>Paul,</hi> nor with such flaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Eloquence as <hi>Apollos,</hi> but feeds
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62872:21"/>
us with the sincere Milk of the
Word, and teaches so plainly that
the most Ignorant may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
him: I wonder therefore he
is no more followed, and that <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Apollos</hi> are preferred before
him: I am for <hi>Cephas.</hi> Thus we
may suppose the <hi>Corinthians</hi> might
jangle among themselves, for which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> so sharply reproves them;
and may not we take his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
to our selves? are not we
apt to heap up to our selves Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and have Mens Persons in
admiration, so to value some, as
unreasonably to scorn and slight
others, forgetting that they are all
the Servants of Christ, deputed
and sent by him, that in much Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Mercy hath given them
various Gifts for the Edification of
the Church; that as one is eminent
in some respects, so in others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap>

same Doctrin, and direct to the
same way to Salvation; and it is
more the fault of our own corrupt
Hearts, than of the Minister, if we
profit not by their Labours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be much in Contemplation
of the Love of God in Christ:
This will blow up a holy Flame
of Love to him and all his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
when we remember how
dearly and tenderly Christ loves
all his Saints, this will constrain us
to lay aside all Wrath and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and live in Peace; such a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
precedent must needs be a
cogent Argument, and can hardly
be resisted. Love and Peace is
the very Image of our Heavenly
Father, the Copy Christ hath set
us, and the Lesson he hath written
for our Learning in Lines
of his own Blood.<note place="margin">1 Iohn 4. 7, 8.</note> An
hearty Love to God will
engage us to be at peace with the
whole fraternity of Christians,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 1, 2.</note> and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62872:22"/>
love them without Dissimulation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Make the great design of
Religion yours, <hi>viz.</hi> the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Holiness, and recovery of
the Image of God in the Souls of
Men: Remember Religion is not
designed meerly to fill your Heads
with airy notions, to tip your
Tongues for Discourse, or enable
you to talk plausibly for the truth;
that it consists not in little Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Opinions, or Ceremonious
Trifles; but the great design of
it is to direct us in the government
of our Passions, subduing our Lusts,
and conquering the Impediments
that hinder our Recovery and
Salvation. In a word, Religion
consists in a penitent return to God
by Faith in Christ, and Obedience
to his Gospel; let us take this to
be our main business, then we shall
have so much work to do at home,
that we shall have little inclination to
pry into the Infirmities of others, or
quarrel with them. That Man would
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62872:23"/>
be esteemed by all as bereav'd of
his Wits, that should be picking
causless Quarrels with his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
about a Chip of Wood, or a
broken Hedge, when a Fire in his
House is consuming his Goods and
Children. We all stand on the
Borders of the Grave, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of Eternity; our great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is to quench the Flames of
Lust, which otherwise will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
us for Everlasting Burnings,
and therefore surely we should not
waste our precious Minutes in strife
and contention.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Avoid Extreams in disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Points. Every Truth lyes in
the middle between two Falshoods,
and he that goes far from one is
apt to slip into the other. After
all the confidence and boast of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters,
there will be uncertainty
in lesser Points, and when we tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
in uncertain Roads, 'tis best to
chuse the middle; here we may
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62872:23"/>
be sure to meet with Charity and
Peace, and very probably Truth
in their Company. The great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of our Differences hath been
that Men have look'd so much at
the evil of one Extream as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the Error on the other side;
like an ignorant Physician, who to
Cure a Man of a dead Palsie casts
him into a Phrenzy. I dare with
some confidence affirm, that most
of those Disputes, that are so hotly
agitated among Protestants, are in
the Extreams, and consist more in
words than things, because the
Curse of <hi>Babel</hi> has so confounded
our Languages, that though our
Sentiments are much the same, we
understand not one anothers mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
And if Men would but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to calm dispassionate Reason,
they might soon find out such heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Reconciling Principles, as
would quickly make us one among
our selves, and a terror to our Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62872:24"/>
Adversaries. Let the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Counsel be in this sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
obeyed, <hi>Phil. 4. 5. Let your
Moderation be known unto all Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Avoid unpeaceable Dividers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
those who make it their work to
soment Differences, and stir up
Strife, and sow Seeds of Discord
among Brethren,<note place="margin">Prov. 6. 16, 19.</note> are
said to be an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the Lord;
take upon them a very ill imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and carry on a design quite
contrary to the Gospel of Peace
and therefore are to be avoided
that they may be ashamed: I speak
not this of my self, but the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> is very earnest in the same
Advice, <hi>Rom. 16. 17, 18. Now I
beseech you Brethren, mark them
which cause Divisions and Offences
contrary to the Doctrin which ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
have learned, and avoid them; for
they that are such serve not our Lord
Iesus Christ, but their own Belly, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62872:24"/>
by good Words and fair Speeches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Hearts of the Simple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Frequently joyn together in
the same Exercises of Religious
Worship: When Christians come
together in the same Assemblies,
this naturally tends to abate their
strangeness, calm their Spirits, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
unreasonable Jealousies and
Suspicions, and inclines them to a
Cordial Endeared Love. This was
one great means of promoting that
hearty affection, which was among
the Members of the primitive
Church, <hi>They continu'd stedfastly in
the Apostles Doctrin and Fellowship,
and breaking of Bread and Prayer:
Acts</hi> 2. 42. And the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
would retrieve that love and
peace, the want of which hath
crumbl'd us into parties, and been
the unhappy occasion of so many
woful Effects. Did we but more
frequently resort to the House of
Prayer, more diligently hearken
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62872:25"/>
to, and more faithfully improve
Ministerial Instructions, more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
submit to Pastoral Discipline,
more carefully watch over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and more tenderly advise,
and reprove, and edifie one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
more solemnly pray with
and for one another, and more
constantly celebrate that uniting
Ordinance, the Lords Supper, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
we should soon see the
Blessed peaceful effects of so doing.
Did Neighbouring Churches coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
each other, and maintain mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
correspondences for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Love and Holiness,
occasionally communicate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when convenient, and look
upon themselves, not as divided
Bodies, or carrying on separate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
but all united under the
same Head, acting according to
the same Rule, and for the same
end, this would engage us to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
offices of peace, and we should
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62872:25"/>
readily comply with the Apostle's
Counsel, <hi>Eph. 4. 3. Keep the unity
of the Spirit in the Bond of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many more Directions might be
added, but these, if well practis'd,
would quickly extinguish those
Heats and Animosities, which have
made Earth so like to Hell; and
produce those Heavenly Fruits of
peace, which might create a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
here below, make the Church,
which in a very sad sense is now
Militant, nearly resemble the Church
Triumphant.</p>
            <p>And now Men and Brethren,
what remains, but that we put in
practice the Duties recommended?
Then might we hope our Land
would become a <hi>Goshen,</hi> not only
in respect of Spiritual Light, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of its freedom from those Locusts
and Caterpillars, dividing Lusts,
that have so long wasted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
us. Blessed be God that he
hath in so great a measure heal'd
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62872:26"/>
our Breaches, and thus far united
us together: May not we hope,
that this is but the beginning of what
God designs for us, like the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Morning in order to a
perfect day? May not we hope,
that those Glorious Times are hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
when <hi>the Lord shall be one,
and his Name one;</hi> Zach. 14. 9. and
that that Promise is near its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment,
<hi>Ier. 32. 39. I will give
them one Heart, and one way, that
they may fear me for ever, for the
good of them, and of their Children
after them?</hi> May not we hope,
that the Philadelphian state, which
some expect, now draws nigh, when
Brotherly Love shall flourish, and be
more enlarg'd. How happy would
it be, if this Union were yet more
extensive, if the Name of Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christian were only known,
and all those divided Names laid
aside, whereby we have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
distinguish'd! By Mutual
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62872:26"/>
Compliances and Condescentions
this is no impossible Task. And
who knows but this beginning may
issue in so happy a Conclusion?
This may well be the subject of
our Wishes, and earnest constant
Prayers.</p>

            <p>AMong all the advantages of
the Christian Religion,
wherein it exceeds the defective
Rules of Pagan Philosophy, and
obscure Institutions of <hi>Moses,</hi> there
is nothing wherein it more excels
than in the Doctrin of Love and
Charity; a Duty which is urg'd
in the plainest Words, and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the strongest Arguments,
and made not the high qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some eminent Saints, but
a necessary essential part of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62872:27"/>
new Creature: A Duty not only
necessary to some inferior uses,
but to all the great ends of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and not to be dispensed
with on any pretence: A Duty
that is made the Badg and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of Christ's Disciples, and
that which our dying Redeemer
strictly charged his Followers to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve;
as in the Text, <hi>A new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
I give unto you, that ye
love one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour knowing the time
of his Departure was near at hand,
in this Chapter gives his Disciples
an admirable instance of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending
Love in stooping to
that servile Office of washing their
Feet: And this he did on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that they should imitate him,
and not think the lowest Offices of
Charity for their
Brethrens good,<note place="margin">Ver. 13, 14, 15, 28.</note> too
mean and base for
them. Afterwards having given the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62872:28"/>
Sop to <hi>Iudas</hi> who went out with an
intention to betray him, he tells
his Disciples of his speedy Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from them; and lest they
should be too much cast down at
hearing of his Departure, he tells
them that he should be
Glorified,<note place="margin">Ver. 31, 32.</note> and God the
Father in him; <hi>i. e.</hi> that
he should give great discoveries of
his Deity, and God the Father
would discover the unsearchable
depths of his Wisdom, inconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
heights of his Love, and
infinite strictness of his Holiness
and Justice by his Death, and
advance him straightway to the
highest degrees of Glory: And
then being filled with an affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
love to them, he speaks as
an indulgent Father to the Sons
of his Love, <hi>Little Children, yet a
little while I am with you,</hi> ver. 33.
and as if he should have said, O
my Disciples whom I love with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62872:28"/>
no less ardent affection than a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth his darling and tender
Infant; there remains but a small
space wherein I shall make my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode
with you in the Flesh, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as I said to the Hardened
<hi>Iews, Whither I go, ye cannot yet
come:</hi> One Request and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
I your dying Lord leave
with you, Let my Love to you be
the rule and measure of your
Love to one another.</p>
            <p>A New Commandment I give unto
you.</p>
            <p>There is some difference among
Expositors concerning the Sense of
this Expression.</p>
            <p>Some render it this renewed
Commandment, this Command
that hath been almost obliterated
by the corrupting Doctrins of the
Pharisees, and false Glosses of the
Jewish Teachers, I now by my
Doctrin and Example renew unto
you. Some by New, understand
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62872:29"/>
most excellent: Thus we read of
a New Song,<note place="margin">Psal. 33. 3.</note> a most
excellent Song,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 29.</note> of
New Wine, of the
most delicious sort
and kind; <hi>q. d.</hi> Whatever Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
you neglect, be sure to
comply with this the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
of all. Subjects take care
to observe the New Commands of
their Princes; let your careful O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to this be as if it were
newly promulged: So others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it.</p>
            <p>A New Commandment, say o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
because we must be still
renewing it; <hi>Owe no Man any thing
but to love one another,</hi> Rom. 13 8.
Pay all your Debts, but this
Debt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Love you must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
paying and yet always ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>I rather think it is called a New
Commandment, because it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
after a New manner, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62872:29"/>
according to
a new Rule,<note place="margin">Bishop <hi>Tillot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s Sermon on this Text.</note> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in higher mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and degrees
than ever before; for though this
Duty was not wholly unknown
to Mankind before, yet never was
it so taught or encouraged; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was such an illustrious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
given of it, nor such weight

special Measures of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
proper to Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
times are vouchsafed to work
it in our Hearts. So that it is as
if our Saviour should have said,
<q>Whereas it hath been said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by
them of old time, thou shalt
love thy Neighbour as thy self,
I give you a new Rule, <hi>as I
have loved you, so love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
after a more indearing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
than the <hi>Iews,</hi> that the
World may see the excellency
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62872:30"/>
of my Doctrin above that of
<hi>Moses</hi> Love; bear an hearty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
one for another, and
imploy your selves in mutual
Offices of Kindness, as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
one another to be Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and Fellow Disciples.
<hi>As I have loved you;</hi> though
you cannot love one another to
such a degree, yet testify your
love by such instances, and to
such degrees as your nature is
capable of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the meaning of the Text;
Christ came into the World to
demonstrate and exercise his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Love and his own: Love he
came to kindle in the Souls of
Men, and therefore gives us this
excellent Commandment.</p>
            <p>The Words being thus explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Observation I shall raise
from them is this,</p>
            <p>That the last and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of our dying Saviour, is, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62872:30"/>
Christians should love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as Christ hath loved them.</p>
            <p>In Handling of which I shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this Method:
<list>
                  <item>1. I shall inquire who are the
Objects of this Love.</item>
                  <item>2. In what respects must we love
one another as Christ hath loved
us.</item>
                  <item>3. Make some Practical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of the whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Objects of this Love.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a common Love
due to Men as Men; all Men are
God's Workmanship, bearing his
natural Image, and capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
serviceable to his Glory:
Thus, <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour
as thy self;</hi> all Men are our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
as partakers of the same
Nature and capable of the same
Happiness. Special love to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62872:31"/>
doth not diminish, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
our common love to Men:
Wherever we see any part of Gods
Image, we must love it. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
when he beheld that rich
young Gentleman, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 21.
he loved him; he could not but
be well pleased with his Morality,
though he was displeased he went
no further. Thus all the footsteps
of Divine Goodness must be lov'd:
Vertue even in an Heathen is to
be admired: This will constrain
us to Pity, Pray for, and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lp all
in distress, according to our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
We must not be like the
unconcerned Priest and merciless
Levite in the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 30.
who passed by the wounded Man,
and would not relieve him, but
like the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> who
spoke comfortably to him, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
his Wants, and bound up
his Wounds.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:62872:31"/>
2. There is a Love due to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Other Mens Faults and Sins
against us, give us no dispensation
for the non-payment of this great
Debt of Natures Law, Loving all
of the same kind. Christ came to
mortifie all Inclinations to Rage
and Revenge, and commands Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and Words, and Actions
of Kindness and Benignity, to those
that have expressed the contrary
unto us: <hi>We must love our Enemies,
Mat.</hi> 5. 44. be cordially affected
towards them; wish them all the
good in the World; especially
when they most need, the good of
their Souls; Their Conviction, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
and Amendment. Other
Mens Enmity must not pervert or
blind our Judgments, or hinder us
from discerning what is amiable in
them; nor must it corrupt our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
or hinder us from loving
what is truly lovely. We must
<hi>bless them that curse us.</hi> Not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62872:32"/>
reviling for reviling, but give
them friendly courteous words,
though they rail against us. We
must <hi>do good to them,</hi> feed and cloth
them, if hungry or naked; rescue
them if in danger; comfort them if
in distress, and all without the least
Tincture of Malice or Revenge.
We must <hi>pray for them:</hi> Forgive
them our selves, and pray to God
to forgive them too. Thus did our
Saviour; in the midst of his dying
Agonies forgets not this Testimony
of his Love to his imbitter'd Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
and with a generosity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Example, pleads excuses for
their Sin, saying, <hi>Father forgive
them, for they know not what they
do,</hi> Luke 23. 34.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a special Love due to
all whom we charitably hope to be
true Christians. To this we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by the Text. Whoever
makes a seemingly serious professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Faith and Holiness, and doth
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62872:32"/>
not disprove it by a contrary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
is to be allow'd the Name
and special Love of a Christian.
'Tis Gods Prerogative to see the
Heart; 'Tis our Duty to observe
the Life; and he that makes a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Profession, and doth not live
in wilful Sin is charitably to be
esteemed as a Member of Christ.
Though he differ from us in many
Points, yet if he holds the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the Christian Faith, and
manifests the Grace of God in his
Life, 'tis uncharitable for us to
judge he is not the object of Gods
special Love, and therefore it is
unreasonable he should not be the
object of ours. Though he be
weak in Parts and Gifts, subject to
many Passions and Infirmities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with real Grace; though his
Profession reach not to that heigth
as to make him Eminent, and his
Conversation be not so exact as to
make you confident of his Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62872:33"/>
yet if he profess to be a true
Christian, and live not in any Sin,
which is the certain mark of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer,
he is to be lov'd as Christ
hath loved us. Gods Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is Guided by Infallibility, he
loves none with a special Affection
but sincere penitent Believers; but
our Love must be guided by our
own weak and fallible discerning.
Where we see the Fruits of Piety
in Mens Lives, we must judge of
the truth of their Graces according
to the probability which those
signs discover. Though all be not
so Eminent in Grace as <hi>Peter, Iames</hi>
and <hi>Iohn,</hi> yet as the weakest Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
it sincere are accepted by
God, so ought they to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
by us. Christ will not break
the bruised Reed, nor quench the
smoaking Flax. Nor ought we to
despise the Babes in Christ, but
love them as Members of the same
Body, and Heirs of the same Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:62872:33"/>
2. In what respects must we
love one another, as Christ hath
loved us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Not in all Respects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Christ
so loved us as to purchase Grace
and Glory for us. But we are not
capable of thus Loving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
We cannot pay down a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
satisfaction for our own
Sins, much less can we super-ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
or purchase pardon for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Our own Oyl must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fum'd
with the Incense of Christs
Merits, before it can make our
Faces shine before God; and we
have so little for our selves that we
have none to spare for our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
Christ alone paid down a
compleat satisfaction for them and
us; nor can we love our Brethren
with an equal degree of Love to
what Christ did. He had not the
Spirit by measure, but the fulness
of the Godhead dwelt in him; and
therefore he lov'd us without any
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62872:34"/>
sinful mixture or imperfection;
but our Love as well as other
Graces admit of very great defects.
The word (As) therefore doth
not denote equality in degree, but
likeness in kind. Our Love to one
another must bear some likeness
and resemblance of Christs Love
to us.</p>
            <p>1. In the Inward Properties of
it.</p>
            <p>2. In the outward Expressions
of it.</p>
            <p>1. In the inward Properties of
it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Love must be sincere and
unfeigned as Christ's was. Christ
did not Hypocritically pretend
Love, or Dissemblingly feign Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to us, but sincerely lov'd us.
His Protestations of Love were all
real and hearty; not in Word and
in Tongue only, but in Deed and
in Truth. Thus ought our Love to
be <hi>without Dissimulation, Rom.</hi> 2. 9.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62872:34"/>
A pretended Disciple indeed may
like <hi>Iudas</hi> kiss and betray, make
large Protestations of kindness to
the Saints, and under this pretext
of Affection hide a malicious heart,
and contrive their ruin. But the true
Christians Professions
of Love as well as Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to God proceed not
from feigned Lips.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Love to one another must
be fervent as Christ's was. 'Twas
Love incomprehensibly great and
ardent, that brought our Lord
from Heaven to Earth, carry'd
him through the difficulties of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
Reproach and Scorn, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him to bear the contradiction
of Sinners, and the pain and shame
of the Cross; herein Christ as well
as God the Father <hi>commended his
love towards us,</hi> Rom. 5. 8. ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
it great and admirable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all expression or parallel, <hi>In
that while we were yet Sinners Christ
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62872:35"/>
died for us.</hi> We must act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this pattern, <hi>Love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a pure heart fervently,</hi>
1 Pet. 1. 22. Our Love must not
be cold and indifferent, frozen or
congeal'd; but we must entertain
a fervent Affection one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>3. Our Love must be prevailing
as Christ's was. Christ lov'd us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Gold or Silver, or Earthly
Pomp and Greatness, above his
own Temporal Ease and Delight;
and was ready to wade through
Storms and Dangers, and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for our sakes. So must we love
our Brethren, above our Carnal
Interest, Honour, Wealth and
Pleasure. Thus <hi>Moses</hi> evidenc'd
his Love to the people of God by
forsaking the dazling Honours and
bewitching Pleasures
of <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 25, 26.</note>
and chusing Affliction
with them rather than Sin. Thus
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62872:35"/>
must we be willing to renounce
our own Ease and Liberty for their
sakes, when God and his Honour
calls. Nay we must Love them
better than the nearest ungodly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
Christ lov'd those that
were related to him in the Spirit,
far better than the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
ungodly Relations
according to the Flesh.<note place="margin">Mark 3. 35.</note>
There is indeed a natural sensitive
Love and Propension towards near
Relations, and we are ordinarily
bound in the first place to provide
for them, supply their wants, and
give them these outward effects of
our Love: But still we must have a
higher rational esteem of the godly
and value their Graces above the
most lovely natural perfections of
others; and the best must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
in point of Honour, though
others may be prefer'd in point of
Maintenance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our Love must be impartial
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62872:36"/>
and universal as Christ's was. He
did not confine it to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
the Jews, and die to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
Pardon, Grace and Glory for
them only, but for us Gentiles also,
while he was upon Earth: The Faith
of the Centurion, and importunity
of the Canaanitish Woman (tho'
Aliens from the Common-wealth
of <hi>Israel</hi>) attracted his Esteem and
Admiration; and where-ever he
beheld the Grace of God and Image
of Holiness, he lov'd it.</p>
            <p>'Tis very observable, he is more
sharp and severe in his Invectives
against the Pharisees than any other
Persons; because of their stingy
narrow Spirit, confining Religion
to their own particular Sect, and
scorning and despising all that
were not of their own Party; as if
all the rest of Mankind were in a
Reprobate Damnable State.</p>
            <p>Our Christian Love must thus
resemble our Saviours. It must be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62872:36"/>
enlarg'd to all Saints, to
the whole Fraternity of
Christians.<note place="margin">Philem. 9.</note> To be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
in our Love is a sign
'tis unsound;<note place="margin">Col. 1. 4.</note> to make our own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
the <hi>Shiboleth</hi> to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a true and counterfeit Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 17.</note>
is very unreasonable. Where
there is a Profession of the Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Covenant, the Essentials of the
Christian Faith, and a Life in some
measure answerable; we must love
such as Christians, not withstanding
their mistakes and erroneous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
in lesser points. We justly
condemn the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for
confining Salvation to themselves,
and Damning all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides:
Let us take heed how we
condemn our selves by contracting
the Church of God into a narrower
compass, lest we censoriously damn
those whom Christ will save, and
perhaps place on higher Seats of
Glory than our selves. We know
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62872:37"/>
who it was that said,
Lord,<note place="margin">Luke 18. 12.</note> I thank thee, I
am not as this Publican,
when he was really in a far worse
condition: Our Love to a Party
must not blind our Judgments, or
pervert our Affections as to all the
rest: Keep up therefore an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
universal Love to all professed.
Christians as such, and
hate a dividing Spirit.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 10.</note>
Take heed how you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
stigmatize those with the Name of
Hereticks, who shall stand at the
Right Hand of Christ; and take
not up the Devils accursed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
to become Accusers of
those that are really your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Our Love must be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
to the degrees of their Grace,
as Christ's was. Christ, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
knows who are most furnish'd
with Divine Grace, must needs love
these with an higher degree than
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62872:37"/>
others of a lower Form and Classis
in Christianity. St. <hi>Iohn</hi> who it
seems had the most ardent love
and Eminent degrees of Grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Apostles, was his peculiar
Favourite and Darling Disciple,
had the highect, place next his
Lord, lay in his Bosom, according
to the custom of those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eastern
Countreys, which was to lye and
not to sit at Meals, and is call'd <hi>the
Disciple whom Iesus loved,</hi> John
13. 23. Christs love was not a
fond unaccountable Passion, but
the result of his Reason and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Because he lov'd him best
we may therefore justly conclude
he was really above the rest in Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Thus must our love be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd:
Some are but weak
Christians, and we can have but
small and doubtful perswasions of
their sincerity: Others are stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and we may be more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
as to them. The one must
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62872:38"/>
be lov'd as Christians, but the other
with an higher degree, as bearing
more lively representations of the
holy God: We must not respect
the Persons of any, but their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and love those best that are
really so. This Property will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Hypocrisie of many, who
will bear with Holiness in a lower
degree, and speak well of those
who (though Godly in the main)
are too remiss and careless in their
Conversations, but swell with Rage
and Malice against those that are
most Eminent for Piety. What
doth this Temper shew but a
Graceless Heart? if we bear not the
highest Love to the best Christians
how dwelleth the Love of God in
us? Alas! can infinite perfect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
be lov'd by him, that loves
not the best Representations of it,
that this imperfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> state affords?
If the light of the Moon, which is
not without its spots, doth offend
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62872:38"/>
us; how can we bear the far more
resplendent brightness of the Sun
it self?</p>
            <p>How unmeet is he for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Angels and perfected
Spirits, that is not pleas'd; much
more that is offended with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
degrees of Holiness in this state
of Imperfection? The true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
having a prevailing Love to
God, will Love his Image where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he finds it; and where it is
more clear and unsullied, and
drawn out in more Beautiful Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
his Love will be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
greater and more affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Our Love must be compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate
and sympathizing. Christ
could not refrain from weeping
when he beheld <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke. 19. 41, 42.</note>
where was the
then visible Church of
God, and laments her foreseen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:
When <hi>Peter.</hi> deny'd him
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62872:39"/>
not once, but thrice, with Curses
and Imprecations: He did not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard
him, as he might justly do,
such a perfidious Servant; but
though he was unconcern'd for
himself, and silently bore the slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Witnesses; yet he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifests
his concern for <hi>Peter;</hi> by his
compassionate looks, testify'd his
sorrow for his Sin, and drew not
his Eyes away till he had look'd
him into Repentance. Nay, tho'
our Head be now in Heaven, yet
he hath a compassionate sense of
the Extremities of his Members, and
accounts all the Affronts, Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Reproaches offer'd to
them, as done to himself. Thus
when <hi>Saul</hi> (then a Persecutor)
breath'd out nothing but Blood
and Slaughter against the Churches,
He cries from Heaven, <hi>Saul, Saul,
why persecutest thou me,</hi> Acts 9. 4.
He is a merciful faithful High-Priest
that is touch'd with a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62872:39"/>
of our Infirmities, and bears a
compassionate Love to all his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in Misery: And the same mind
ought to be in us that was in him;
we ought to sympathize with our
Fellow Members in distress, and
remember the afflicted, as being
our selves in the Body, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 2.
liable to the same Tryals and Parts
of the same Mystical Body of Christ.
If any Member be in pain, all the
rest are discompos'd, and when
some of the Members of Christ are
discompos'd, 'tis natural for the rest
to sympathize with them, and be
compassionately sensible of their
trouble. Thus we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>to weep with them that weep,</hi>
Rom. 12. 15. <hi>To bear one anothers
Burdens, and so fulfil the Law of
Christ,</hi> Gal. 6. 2.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Our Love must be constant
and abiding as Christ's love was;
Christ's love to us was not for a
small space of time, but lasting
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62872:40"/>
and uninterrupted, <hi>He loved his
own, and he loved them to the end,</hi>
John 13. 1. And the nearer his end
appeared, the higher marks of his
Love did he give them; the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and miscarriages of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
did not remove his Love, or
cause him to withdraw his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
their ignorance and unbelief
after all his Teachings and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
their fiery unseasonable
Rage against the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> their
Pride and Ambition, Rashness and
Cowardise, and the base Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of <hi>Peter</hi> did not incline
him to lay aside his Thoughts of
Love, or leave the work of our
Redemption unfinished; but he
still loved them to the Death:
Thus must we love our Brethren,
overlook their Failings, pass by
their Infirmities, admire what is
lovely, and neglect what may cool
our Affections. This new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
must be every day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62872:40"/>
by us; this is a Lesson we
must be always Learning, and a
Duty we must be always imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our selves about. We must
still be abiding in our Love, till
we enter among that happy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
where all Sins and unlovely
Imperfections shall be done away,
and we shall always solace our
selves with pleasing views of the
Divine Purity and Holiness, and
the numerous Pictures and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
of it among Angels and
Glorified Saints.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our Love to one another must
resemble Christ's Love to us in the
outward Expressions of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the intimacies of our
Friendship and Familiarity one
with another; Christ so loves all
true Christians, as to enter into
the strictest bands of amity with
them; he is nearly united to them
as their Head and Husband, and
calls them his Friends and his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62872:41"/>
Spouse; he is the Head and they
are the Members; the
Vine,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 32.</note> and they are the
Branches;<note place="margin">Iohn 15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and they are the
Building;<note place="margin">Ioh. 14. 22.</note> the Root, and they are
the Fruit. The Communications
of his Grace, the quickening as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances
and influences of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
are imparted to them; he
writes his Law in their Hearts, and
causeth them to run in the way
of his Commandments; sanctifies
their Natures, pardons their Sins,
prevailingly intercedes for them,
and prepares them by Grace for
Glory: He hath communion with
them in his Ordinances, familiarly
converseth with them in his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and is continually sitting
them for that happy Fellowship
with Father Son and Holy Spirit
which glorified Saints injoy. While
he was on Earth, he selected some
few Persons, prepared them by
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62872:41"/>
Grace for his Society, and then
made them his familiar Friends.
To them he clearly revealed the
Mind and Will of God; to them
he unfolded the Mysteries of his
Love, and Commands of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
to them he explained what
was spoken to others in Parables;
these he blessed with his Heavenly
Discourses and Pious Instructions
with the special tokens of his Love,
and familiar Expressions of his
Friendship. Indeed he did enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
a <hi>Iudas</hi> in his Family, but
he made a strict Profession as well
as the other Disciples, and was
not known to be Hypocritical by
any but Christ himself; and had
not the wisdom of God designed
by his means to bring about the
great work of our Redemption,
no doubt but this Son of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would have been discarded
and disown'd. He did indeed eat
with Publicans and Sinners, but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62872:42"/>
though for this he was falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
as their Friend and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
yet he was not so; he eat
with them as their Physician, and
not as their Companion; did not
own them for his Friends, but
sought by his holy Discourse and
obliging Carriage to make them
so: And the same Mind ought to
be in us that was also in him.</p>
            <p>Though Christianity allows not
moroseness and incivility towards
others, yet all needless familiarity
with Wicked Men is forbidden:
Our Eyes (with <hi>Davids</hi>) ought
to be upon the <hi>Faithful in the
Land,</hi> Psal. 101. 6. To delight in
wicked Company may justly fill
us with doubts of our own since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
we may know <hi>we are passed
from Death to Life, if we love the
Brethren,</hi> 1 John 3. 14. And we
have just reason to fear we are
yet in a state of Death if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the Ungodly. Common
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62872:42"/>
civilities may be paid to Wicked
Men, but special friendship is to
be reserved only for those who
we hope are the Friends of God.
If we love God above all, surely
we shall associate most with them
that may warm our Hearts, and raise
our Affections, and provoke us
by their Example to an holy
imitation. We ought to imitate
the Royal Psalmist, <hi>who was a
Companion of all them that feared
God,</hi> Psal. 119. 63. The Poverty
and Meanness of such did not les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
his delight; he priz'd a Saint
in Rags, beyond a Wicked Man
though cloathed in Princely Robes,
or Imperial Purple. We ought to
have a friendly regard to all true
Christians; and though some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their eminency in Grace,
suitableness to our Temper, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
and the like reasons,
may be our more intimate Friends:
Yet must not we despise any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62872:43"/>
of their meanness, but as we
have opportunity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> give them the
special tokens of our Friendship
too. Vile Persons must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned,
and Scandalous
Professors must especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
be avoided;<note place="margin">Psal. 15. 4.</note> but
our intimate Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
ought to be the Servants of
God;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 11.</note> and the more Holy any are,
the more ambitious should we
be of their Friendship and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In our hearty Prayers one for
another. Christ was very earnest
in his Prayers for true Believers;
they were the peculiar objects of
his Love, and purchase of his
Death, and therefore he prays for
them in a peculiar manner: For <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
he prays for strengthening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
Grace, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 31. and
he put up a famous Prayer for his.
Disciples, and all that should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
on him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. that they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62872:43"/>
might persevere in the Faith, live
in Unity, increase in Grace, and at
last be translated to Heaven, and
abide with him in Glory. And
he hath laid a special Obligation
on us to do likewise. Hence in
that excellent Form and Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 9. he teaches
us to say, Our Father, intimating
that if we would gain acceptance
for our selves, we must come to
God as in union with Christ and
his universal Church. Our Prayers
must not be only for our selves,
but for the whole Church of God
throughout the World; we must
hold Communion with all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in Faith and Love, and an
holy Profession thereof; and while
absent in Body, must be as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with them in Spirit, and still
beg of God for them a freedom
from the same Spiritual Evils, and
enjoyment of the same Spiritual Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
we would desire for our
selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:62872:44"/>
If the Psalmist under the old
Law pray'd for the Peace of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
Psal. 122. 6. 137. 5, 6.
and makes such solemn Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
never to forget her; surely
it is our great duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now the
Church is surrounded with Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
so potent and numerous, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to forget Spiritual <hi>Zion,</hi> but
always be mindful of our <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
If the legal Priests and
Watchmen were bound to be
God's Remembrancers, and give
him no rest till he establish and
make <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a Praise in the
Earth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 62. 6, 7. Then surely it
is the duty of Spiritual Watchmen
under the Gospel, to put up their
Petitions with fervour for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
Christian Churches and
Servants of God. We ought with
the Apostle to <hi>give Thanks to God
always for all Saints, and make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them in our Prayers,</hi> Eph. 1. 16.
Be compassionately sensible of all
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62872:44"/>
their Troubles, and continually
bow our Knees before God, that
all his dealings may tend to their
good; that their Lives may be
a credit to their Profession; and
that their Faith and Love, and
Patience and Humility, and Self-denial,
may be effectual to convince
Unbelievers, enlarge the Kingdom
of Grace, and add new Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
to the Kingdom of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In forgiving one another.
Christ so loved us, as to forgive
all the injuries and affronts we
have offered to him; pardon of
Sin is the great purchase of his
Death. And though our Sins be
more numerous than the Hairs of
our Head, and exceed the Sands
of the Sea for Multitude, yet if
we sincerely repent of them, we
may be assured they shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.
And as Christ doth thus
testify his love to us, so must we
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62872:45"/>
testify our love to one another:
Have they wrong'd and injur'd us?
we must not bear a Spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
but freely forgive them:
God will not forgive us except we
forgive others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 11, 14, 15.
Where God pardons any, he gives
them a heart to forgive others.
That Servant in the Parable was
very disingenuous, who when his
Lord forgave him Ten Thousand
Talents, cast his Fellow Servant into
Goal, and would not forgive him
an Hundred Pence. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 23.
And are not we guilty of the same
disingenuity, who when we know
what numerous Talents God hath
forgiven us, cannot pass by a small
injury of our Brother against us?
This act of Christian Love you see
is strictly required, and a special
degree of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is due to true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
above all others. We are
bound indeed to forgive Enemies
while continuing and remaining
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62872:45"/>
such, so far as not to return Evil
for Evil, to entertain no revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Thoughts, and perform all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Offices of Justice and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
towards them. But a Friend
and true Christian that hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
us, and returns to his Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,
must be forgiven and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
treated and entrusted as a
Friend, if he gives sufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of his Sorrow and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for former Faults:
For is he the Friend of
God,<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 3.</note> and shall he be esteemed as
our Enemy? Is God reconciled to
him, and shall we still retain our
Enmity against him? Surely if
God be his reconciled Father, we
ought to be his reconciled Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
also: Account him no longer
an Enemy, but a <hi>Brother beloved,</hi>
Philem. 16.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In our Alms and Bounty to
the Necessitous. Christ though he
himself lived on the Charity of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62872:46"/>
others, and had not a sufficient
supply for himself and Disciples,
yet we find he did out of that
small pittance give something to
the Poor; for in this Chapter <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
who was the Steward of
Christ's Family, bore the Bag, and
was to disburse Mony for those
uses for which his Lord designed
it: When he went out after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Sop, the Disciples
thought he was gone either to
buy Provisions for the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Passover, or <hi>to give something
to the Poor,</hi> John 13. 29; thereby
implying it was our Saviour's
custom to give to the Poor. And
if he thus loved his poor Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
surely we ought to do so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
Those who have a fruitless
love to others, have but a fruitless
Faith to themselves:<note place="margin">Ium. 1. 27.</note>
They who pretend
love to their Brethren,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3. 17.</note>
and yet relieve them
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62872:46"/>
not according to their ability,
their Professions of Religion are
vain: We are bound indeed to
supply the Wants of all, even of
Strangers and Enemies, according
to our ability and opportunities.
But to true Christians, we are
bound to open our hands more
wide, and be more liberal and
bountiful: <hi>Do good to all, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Houshold of Faith,</hi> Gal. 6.
10. God hath made us but Stewards
of the Earthly Blessings we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
and given us our Stock of
Worldly Goods, that we might
lay them out on those whom Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
hath made the Objects of
our Charity; he interprets that
as done to himself, which is done
to his Servants and Christ's distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Members. Christ is resolved
at the day of Judgment to insist
on this Duty more than
on any other.<note place="margin">Mat. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 34.</note> The
true Christian is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62872:47"/>
devoted to God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will devote all he hath to
him; will honour him with his
Substance, and the first Fruits of
his Increase; expend the Blessings
received, to Cloath, Feed and
Supply the Naked, Hungry and
Distressed. If God hath intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with many Talents, he
will not be so unreasonable as to
think he hath therefore liberty
given to pamper his Lusts, or
gratify his Fleshly Appetite; but
like a Wise Steward will seek out
fit Objects for his Charity; and
seeing his Lord Redeemer out of
that little which he had, gave to
the Poor, will imitate his great
Example 3. and because much is
given, will be proportionably li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
and bountiful.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In our Counsels and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions:
Christ was very frequent
and earnest in his pious Counsels
and Instructions, he did not only
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62872:47"/>
heal the Diseases of Mens Bodies,
but the chief design of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was to free the Sons of Men
from all their Spiritual Maladies
and Distempers. Throughout his
whole Life he was still explaining
to Men the whole Will of God,
and to his Disciples more plainly
than to others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13 11. This
evidence of Brotherly Love we
ought to give also. 'Tis not only
the duty of Ministers, but of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
private Christian <hi>in his Station,</hi>
to counsel and instruct his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
to inform the Ignorant,
and seek their Conversion; tell
them their duty and danger, and
shew them how they may flee
from the wrath to come.</p>
            <p>And it will be their
wisdom and interest
thus to win Souls to
Christ,<note place="margin">Prov. 11. 30.</note> and save Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
from Death and Hell.<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 20.</note> This
must we do to the most vicious as
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62872:48"/>
we have opportunity: But as we
owe a special degree of Love to
Fellow Christians, so we are espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to counsel and admonish
them: To advise them in difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
explain what they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
endeavour to impart
our Light to them, to increase
their knowledge, make additions
to their Grace, and further their
Happiness. He that loves his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will seek to help his Ignorance,
rectifie his Mistakes, free him from
Error, and communicate his own
Experiences to preserve him from
Sin, encourage him in Duty, and
make his passage to Heaven more
pleasant and delighful.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In kind and friendly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs.
Christ frequently gave
this Testimony of his Love to his
Disciples, reproved the smallness of
their Faith, Pride
and Ambition,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 26. 18. 1.</note> and
unbecoming Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">Luke 9. 55, 56.</note>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:62872:48"/>
and the like Sins. Thus must
we also act: Smooth Flattery is an
Argument of Hatred, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
Reproofs when necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is a piece of negative Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery;
but a smart rebuke is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
a great Argument of
Love, <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it.</hi> 19. 17. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we see our Brother erring
from his way, we must seek by
moderate Reproofs to stir up his
dying Graces, and bring him back
to his Duty. Here indeed much
Christian Prudence and Discretion
is necessary: We are too apt to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
the failings of others, and
extenuate our own far greater of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.
Therefore let us be more
ready to behold our own stains,
than the lesser spots of others, and
first cover our own nakedness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we cast the Stones of Reproof
at our Brother. Neither must we
reprove upon bare Rumors and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62872:49"/>
Suspicions, without
certain knowledge of
our Brothers offence:<note place="margin">Bishop <hi>Hopkins</hi> Serm. on <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17.</note>
This is to shoot the
Arrow before we see the mark. If
we are not certainly assur'd either
from our own personal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or the undoubted Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of credible Witnesses, that our
Brother is guilty, our reproofs
will be but Slanders, and our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in offering the Cure will not be
half so great as our uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in believing the Disease. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must we reprove sharply for
small offences, for every unvolun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
slip and failing: To dip our
Reproofs in Gall and Satyr upon
every little miscarriage, is a piece
of impertinent officiousness, and
shews we are very much in Love
with the Office. Further, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
must be seasonable, <hi>Prov.</hi>
15. 23. When our Brother is most
calm and sedate, his Passions
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62872:49"/>
hush'd and still, and his reason Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seated
on the Throne, as Water
falling on a Red hot Iron only
causes a great deal of noise and
disturbance, so Reproofs just upon
the very act of Sin, when our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Passions are in disorder, will
only cause him to fume and fret
the more. Moreover our reproofs
must be given in gentle Language,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. Rebukes in reviling
words look like the upbraidings
of an Enemy, and not like the
kindness of a displeased Friend.
Nay, let not your Reproofs be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others, lest it alienate thy
Brothers Heart, and make him sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
'tis hatred and not love that
puts thee upon this ungrateful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
but let them be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and thee alone, with
all the secresie and privacy possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
That he may see 'tis thy love
that urgeth thee to this Office of
Kindness; and good Men will
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62872:50"/>
hearken and endeavour to amend
whatever is amiss, <hi>Psal. 141. 5.
Rebuke a Wise Man and he will love
thee,</hi> Prov. 9. 8.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In dying for one another.
The greatest Testimony of Christs
Love was his dying for us, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.
13. <hi>Rom. 5. 8. Hereby perceive we
the Love of God, in that he laid down
his Life for us, and we ought to lay
down our Lives for the Brethren,
1 Iohn</hi> 3. 16. If Christ who was so
much exalted above us in Glory
and Majesty, did lay down his
Life for us, much more ought we
to dye for our Brethren, who are
of the same mould by Nature, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the same precious Faith
by Grace, and heirs of the same
Inheritance in Glory. If Christ
dyed for Enemies and Strangers,
Slaves to Satan, and Rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Heaven, surely we ought
not to account it hard to dye for
Friends link'd to us by the nearest
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62872:50"/>
Bonds of Union, Members of the
same Body, and belonging to the
same Glorious Head; seeing Christ
did not account his Life too dear
for us, we ought not to account
this command an hard saying, or
burden too difficult to be born.</p>
            <p>But this Duty is only to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
when we are specially call'd
to it, and the publick good of
Christianity requires it; to lay
down our Lives without such a
Call is to become Murderers of our
selves, and may be to the wrong,
and not the benefit of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
For thereby we are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citated
from doing them any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
service in this World. The
great instance wherein we are to
lay down our Lives for our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
is, when we are call'd to seal
the Truth with our Blood. The
Glory of God and Spiritual Good
of our Brethren ought to be so dear
to us, that we ought willingly to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62872:51"/>
Sacrifice our Lives, rather than by
any base and sinful compliances
harden Unbelievers, unsettle weak
and wavering Christians, or grieve
the Hearts of confirm'd Saints.</p>
            <p>3. Some Practical Improvement.
I shall conclude all with a word
of Exhortation.</p>
            <p>1. To my Brethren in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.
I have taken upon me the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of putting you in remembrance
of your Duty.</p>
            <p>We all call our selves the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of Peace, and Ambassadors of
the God of Love, and are now
come together to testifie our Love
to one another. Let us now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take up an unanimous Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that we will live together as
united Brethren, and imitate the
great Example of our Lord Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
who hath given us our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
Let us not be strange or
shy, or suspicious one of another;
harbour any envy, ill-will or hard
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62872:51"/>
thoughts; Take up any evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
or hearken to the Tales of
Whisperers and Backbiters, who
make it their Business to sow Seeds
of Discord among Brethren: While
we all profess the same Holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
worship God after the same
manner, and pursue the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of winning Souls to Christ;
why should we be angry or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd,
if perhaps we have not the
same Sentiments in some lesser
Matters of difficulty; any more
than because we are not of the
same Age, Stature or Complexion?
Why should we envy one anothers
Parts, or Gifts, or Success; Or be
offended because perhaps the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
of others may be larger
than our own? It ought to be our
Joy if our Lord and Masters Work
be carried on by others better than
by our selves; and we ought to
embrace our Brethren for their
Piety, Warmth and Zeal, and be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62872:52"/>
highly pleas'd that God makes
them Glorious Instruments for the
Conversion of Souls.</p>
            <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> could say that
though some preached Christ out
of envy and strife, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 15, 18.
yet Christ was preached, and
therein he did rejoice; yea,
and would rejoice: We all
preach Christ, and I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
none of us with contentious
Spirits: Let us therefore rejoice in
one anothers success in the Work
of the Ministy; and make it our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to strengthen one anothers
Hands in the service of our Lord:
Let not our Love be Complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
and Ceremonious, but let it be
real and hearty, as becomes the
Ministers of Christ: Let it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
in all the instances fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
by the Intimacies of
our Friendship, by our earnest and
hearty Prayers; by a readiness to
forbear and forgive one another
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62872:52"/>
by our kind Counsels and Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
communicating to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that Light and Knowledge we
think we may have gain'd in the
Mysteries of Religion, by our
friendly and gentle Reproofs one
of another, if there be occasion;
by our hearty faithfulness in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
each other of our faults,
and directing how we may best
discharge the Work of the Ministry
committed to us. These, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
are the great Duties God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
from us; and the obligations
of Christianity forcibly engage us
to the performance of them. As
we have therefore begun to do
thus, let us hold on, that our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
together may be for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the Kingdom of
Christ, and enlargement of the
Gospel, and an earnest and happy
presage of a yet larger and more
extensive Union among all the
Faithful Ministers of Christ through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62872:53"/>
the Land, and (if it be Gods
will) throughout the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
World.</p>
            <p>2. To the people, and indeed
to us all in general. Let us all be
perswaded to the practice of this
Duty. The Plague of Uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
hath dangerously Infected
the generality of Christians, and
therefore it concerns every Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
of peace to cry aloud and
perswade Men to Love and Union.
This was the dying command of
our Lord and Saviour, and shall
we neglect it? How can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the Legacies and Benefits he
hath bequeath'd, if we omit the
commands he hath given? That
must be a very unnatural Son that
despises the last words and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of his Father pronounced
with his dying Breath; and are
not we very unnatural if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62872:53"/>
the dying Admonitions of our
Dear Redeemer? When Men are
just departing out of the World,
and (especially good Men) they
use not to spend their Breath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Trifles, but speak what they
apprehend of greatest moment, and
what they desire may be more
especially regarded. Our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
did not trifle with us when he
was leaving the World: And
therefore seeing this was one of
his last Commands, we may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
he laid great weight upon it,
and earnestly desired it might be
principally observed by his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.
Nay, he himself makes
it the distinguishing Character of
his Disciples whereby they may
be known from all the rest of the
World. <hi>By this shall all Men
know that ye are my Disciples if
ye have love one to another,</hi> John
13. 35. Do you therefore shew
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62872:54"/>
your respect to your Dying Lord,
and make it appear to the World
that you are his true Disciples
by a constant unintermitted Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of Love to one another.</p>
