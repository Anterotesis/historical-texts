         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Od hath layd the foundation among us
long agoe, and God be thanked we have
held it hitherto, though with much adoe,
and some hazard, for Pioners both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
us and without us have beene digging at it, but
could never undermine it, to blow it up (for thereby
wee have beene comely though blacke) and therefore
they have gone another way to worke, and built upon
it: to wit; wood, hay, stubble, so that though the power
of godlinesse hath preserved us, yet this combustible
matter hath kindled such fires amongst us, as have
almost ruined, us. For it's dangerous to separate
what God hath joyned together, though Power may
give as a subsistence, yet never a <hi>bene esse</hi> without
Purity, to which wee now hope wee draw neere by the
marriage of these two together amongst us, but then
they must have these properties of marriage, they
must not only joyne hands but hearts, and that for
ever for Cordiall unanimity, and constant perpetuity,
make up such a Reformation, as only will make us.</p>

how needfull it is for Ministers, to ioyne with Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
and to imploy the Word, as they the Sword
this way, that so it may not bee done by halves, but
throughly, and that not only in Action, but affection,

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ZEPHANIAH 1. 1.</bibl>
               <q>The word of the Lord which came unto Zephaniah
the sonne of Cushi, the sonne of Gedaliah, the sonne
of Amariah, the sonne of Hizkiah, in the dayes of
Iosiah the sonne of Amon King of Judah.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hree things there are exprest in
the Text; and a fourth implyed.
First, The authority of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.
Secondly, The Prophets
qualitie. Thirdly, The time of
his Prophecy; and fourthly,
The Argument, or substance of it; which is
the thing implyed in the Prophets text, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opened in his Sermons.</p>
            <p>1. The authority: <hi>The word of the Lord:</hi> And
therefore you are to take notice, I am not now
opening to you mens opinions, or reading a
Lecture to you out of a Philosopher, or an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian,
which you may like where you will,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94161:4"/>
and leave where you list, heare, or beleeve <hi>ab libitum;</hi>
But the word of the Lord, who must
be beleeved, when he speakes most above our
apprehensions, or crossest to our present
wills, and affections.</p>
            <p>2. The Quality of the Prophet; <hi>Which came
unto Zephaniah the sonne of Cushie,</hi> &amp;c. His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Grandfather, and great Grandfather
and great great Grandfather are named:
Whence it appeares, that <hi>Zephaniah</hi> was a man
of an honourable House, because his Ancestors
are mentioned to the fourth generation<note n="*" place="margin">Besides, the names of his Ancestours tell him to be honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> And
hence wee see, that Almighty God hath made
use of men of all degrees, to bee Ministers of
his Word. <hi>Isaiah</hi> came of the bloud Royall;
<hi>Jeremiah,</hi> of the stocke of <hi>Aaron; Daniel</hi> and
<hi>Zephaniah,</hi> of honourable Families. <hi>Amos,</hi> a
heardman; <hi>Elisha,</hi> a husbandman; and other
Prophets, as <hi>Malachi, Obadiah, Haggai,</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk,</hi>
whose naked names wee have without
their Pedegrees. And thus we see, that as the
Lord doth send his Word to all sorts of men,
so he sends it by all sorts of men. And hereby
the most true God does the more cleare his
Word from jelousie, and suspition. Here also
wee see, it is calling honourable enough, for
men that are most honourable by birth, to bee
Ministers of Gods Word. As <hi>Zephaniah</hi> a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
man by birth, was not undervalued, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
by his calling to be the Lords Minister.
A Ministers Calling is honour enough to him
without other accumulations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:94161:4"/>
3. The time of his prophesying: <hi>In the dayes
of Josiah King of Judah:</hi> and therefore one of
the last Prophets before the Captivity, and a
Contemporarie with <hi>Jeremiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. For the substance, and subject of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
we shall find; It is composed of very
reproving, and very threatning Sermons: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indeed against some others, but principally
against <hi>Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I, but what should such a Prophet,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Prophet, a threatning Prophet doe in <hi>Josi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah's</hi>
time, a time of great reformation, and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reforming Prince?</p>
            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> that though <hi>Josiah</hi> himselfe had a
right spirit in way of Reformation, yet the
spirits of the greatest part of the Nobles of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
and also of the Commons, inclined to their
old superstitions in worship, and corruptions in
government. The Idolatrous wayes of their
former corrupt Princes, were still in their
hearts; And however the King was sound, yet
the greatest part of the Subjects, both Rulers,
and People, were rotten-hearted towards <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah's</hi>
Reformation. Which appeares both by
some expresse places of Scripture, and by good
consequence from other.</p>
            <p>In the 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 17. and <hi>Chro.</hi> 34. 25. It
was absolutely charged, upon the Inhabitants
of <hi>Judah,</hi> that they burnt Incense to other
Gods; which charge was in <hi>Josiah's</hi> time: So
that notwithstanding the religious reformation,
hee had endeavoured amongst them, yet they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94161:5"/>
had their old haunts of superstion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
then censured, as well as charged.</p>
            <p>If it be put to Case, and objected, that this
charge might have relation to <hi>Iudah</hi>'s Idolatrie,
in <hi>Manasse</hi>'s time, as might seeme from that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. 26. Let this Question be put
upon this Objection: Why should such a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
be made, in that charge, and censure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Josiah,</hi> and his people, saving that he was
sound, and they still corrupt? I confesse it hath
reference to <hi>Manasse</hi>'s time; yet not only thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
for its plaine to <hi>Josiah</hi>'s also. And this
will be without scruple, upon the view of some
passages in the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 6. and 10. The
Lord also said unto me, saith <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> in the
dayes of <hi>Josiah</hi> the King. <hi>Judah</hi> hath not tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto me with her whole heart, but feigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or in falshood, saith the Lord. Though the
King, and happily some few of his Nobles, and
People were very Cordiall in reformation, yet
the major part both of Nobles and Commons,
had reformed faces, but not reformed hearts.</p>
            <p>Again, by consequence it is cleare. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Josiah,</hi> though young, was upright-hearted
himselfe, and likewise towards the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Kingdome; Why yet it seemes, it was
the twelfth yeare of his Raigne, before he could
get the Kingdome in any readinesse to a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
So it is recorded in 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 34. 3. That
in the twelfth yeare of his Raigne, he began to
purge <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from the high places,
and the Groves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94161:5"/>
Againe, after he set upon Reformation, wee
find it was six yeares, before he had purged the
Land, and the Temple, which was but a part of
his Reformation intended: for the repaires of
the Temple were still behind, <hi>vers.</hi> 8. And what
should be the Reason, that he should be twelve
yeares before hee began to reforme, being so
pure a Prince, and six yeares in one part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
the casting out of Corruptions? But
because he found it a mighty difficult matter,
to new mold the People from old wayes, and
to take the generality of them off from their
wonted superstitious customes.</p>
            <p>It is observable againe, that when the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were brought to an outward Conformity,
to the Reformation, yet their hearts still han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kered
another way, and so much as they durst,
for the Lawes, the Reformation had establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they declared their idolatrous spirits: as in
that 3. <hi>Jer. 10. Judah hath not turned to mee with
her whole heart, but feignedly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we are moreover to marke, that after
their outward Conformitie to Reformation,
came the threatning of their Captivity. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the 8. and 25. Verse, of the 34. Chap.
2 <hi>Chro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is still another thing more notable for
the case in hand, which is this; When upon the
Lords threatning <hi>Judah,</hi> for the superstitious
bent, and byas of their spirits still; <hi>Josiah</hi> to the
end he might make them as sure as he could for
God gathers them together, to enter into a sure
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94161:6"/>
Covenant with the Lord, to serve him only,
and to worship him truly; It is observable that
the king was forced, to force them to stand to
the Covenant, that he himselfe had entred into.
<hi>Verses</hi> 32. 33. They did not willingly, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enter into the Covenant with the King, but
it's said, <hi>Josiah</hi> caused, and made all that were
present, or that were found in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and
<hi>Benjamin</hi> to stand to it. Againe, neither did they
keepe this Covenant any longer then <hi>Josiah</hi>'s
life, as the last words of the Chapter, and the
Peoples practice in the beginning of the next
King doe manifest.</p>
            <p>Now if the commendations of the Passeover
in <hi>Josiah</hi>'s life, and the great lamentation of the
People at <hi>Josiah</hi>'s death, should bee an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to any for the integritie of <hi>Iudah</hi> in <hi>Iosiah</hi>'s
time; They must needs in serious, and secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thoughts, apprehend the carriage of the
people in the generality, but a Ceremony, and
no substantiall point of their soundnesse.</p>
            <p>Therefore upon all this that hath beene said,
I say in Answer to the Question; That there
was a necessitie of this sharpe, and threatning
Prophecy, even in <hi>Iosiah</hi>'s time, though a time
of Reformation: howbeit, not in respect of
Prince, yet of People for the major part. And
then this is the first Doctrine.</p>
            <p>That though the Prince,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> and some Rulers of
a Nation, be strict Reformers in Religion, yet
if the People generally continue corrupt, the
Nation is still in much danger. As we may take
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94161:6"/>
notice of it in Gods angry words against <hi>Iudah,</hi>
in <hi>Iosiah</hi>'s time, the purest of Reformers before
the Captivity; So also, as clearly in the pure
reformations after the Captivity, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
of the Reformers themselves: Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> their solemne Fasts,
to prevent sad things, which they feared might
befall their Nation, through the peoples cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<hi>Ezra</hi> 9. and <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Now when I say, when the people are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
in Religion, I meane not their open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
or confessed practice of superstitions,
and crosse-wayes, to the purity of Religion:
But even then, when the people have out-sides
to Reformation, yet still hearts and insides to
corruption. For this was the case of the <hi>Iewes</hi>
in <hi>Iosiah</hi>'s time. As the purest Elements now
are so impure as subject to change in part into
contrary Elements; such was the temper of
these Jewes, that as they went to <hi>Zoar,</hi> their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were towards <hi>Sodom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the danger of such a Nation,<note place="margin">Reas.</note> that hath
such a people appeares in this; Because such a
People, though they may bee conformers, to
godly reformation for the present, yet for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
it's against their wills to be for God, and so
soone as ever they have opportunity, they will
be for <hi>Baal.</hi> Just as your men that stay at shore
till wind serve, they keepe upon the Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot get upon the Sea; but so
soone as the winds turne to their opportunity,
fare well Land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:94161:7"/>
Thus we may conceive it was in that happy
Reformation of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. though unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in respect of his surviving Subjects. Who
in reason would have thought, that, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
should have had such a Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis,
and that so suddenly; yet the issue gave
in evidence that the generality were but meere
Formalists in that reformation, and did but
waite for a wind, to carry them to <hi>Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p>And as this hath beene the issue of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
so <hi>Vice versa;</hi> Sometimes with the Prince:
as in <hi>Joash</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> a good King not
from inward principles, but from outward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
Hee made true Religion the fashion
whilst <hi>Jehojada</hi> lived: For all the dayes of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jada</hi>
it's said, he walked in the godly paths of his
godly Predecessors, and maintained the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
made after <hi>Athalia</hi> deposed, and hee
crowned, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>But so soone as <hi>Jehojada</hi> was in his grave, the
Princes of <hi>Judah</hi> came, and made obeisance to
the King, and with flattering speeches motio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the King, the renewing of Baalitish
worship, and he hearkened unto them, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi>
24. 17.</p>
            <p>To make Application of the point for our
owne particular use.<note place="margin">Vse.</note> And hence wee gather
that there is as great necessitie to pray, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour,
that the hearts of the People of the
Land, may bee prepared for Reformation, as
that the Lord would prepare Reformers: That
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94161:7"/>
Prince, and Peoples spirits, may move in the
same orbe in this point, and that the people may
not be carryed on in Reformation, as the Sunne,
and starres are by the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> have a
violent motion from it, and another naturall
motion of their owne, quite contrary. For
certainly though the people of the Land move
after the motion of superiour Orbes, King, and
Rulers that doe reforme, yet keepe another
crosse inclination, and motion of their owne,
surely, I say, our hopes at most, can be but for
an Age, even the lives of Reformers; and so
soone as a <hi>Josiah</hi> is gone, so will his Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
too.</p>
            <p>It's true, for the age of Reformers, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
warrant us, Truth and Peace in their
dayes; Nay, and according to Scripture evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
an externall complying of the people
with Reformation, is a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to the Land
from Nationall iudgements. We find in <hi>Josi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
a Reformer, he must goe to his grave in
peace, and his people must bee secure till then
too. And so there must be peace and truth, all
<hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s raigne, being a reformer of Religion,
though we find many heavy prophesies against
<hi>Judah,</hi> even in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s time, as wee see in the
Prophets, <hi>Isaiah, Hosea,</hi> and <hi>Micah.</hi> And so <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoshaphat,</hi>
a maintainer of his fathers Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and something a mender of it, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
once he was affrighted with a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
yet saith the Scripture; The Realme of
<hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> was quiet, and God gave him, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94161:8"/>
his People rest in his Raigne, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>But then here is usually the <hi>non ultra</hi> of hopes,
of happinesse, when the peoples hearts move
not in the same Orbe after the Princes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming.
The Scripture is cleare in president
for it: That when in time of Reformation, the
peoples spirits are not prepared for puritie in
Divine worship, as the Governours are (thus
the case was with <hi>Iehoshaphats</hi> people, the hearts
of the people were not prepared, to the taking
away of the High-places, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20. 33.) then
the Land hath beene secured, and happie but
that Age. For wee find that when <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi>
slept with his Fathers, even that good Prince,
whose peoples hearts were not prepared, as his,
for perfect Reformation, the next King, was a
King after the corrupt peoples owne hearts:
A man that walked in the wayes of the Kings
of <hi>Israel,</hi> and house of <hi>Ahab, 2 Chro.</hi> 21. 6.</p>
            <p>And what became of the Kingdome then,
that was so secure and quiet, whilst <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi>
lived? Why, we find there, that first the Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,
they revolt from the Dominion of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
and set up a King of their owne; and <hi>Libna</hi>
also revolted from the government of <hi>Iudah.</hi>
And the reason of this change in the State, is
given in the tenth verse of the Chapter: Because
<hi>Iehoram</hi> had forsaken the Lord God of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> and <hi>Asa,</hi> both Reformers of
Church and State.</p>
            <p>It's true, we find in Scripture, that <hi>Asa</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
continued not only his, but his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94161:8"/>
time; But then wee find with all in
Scripture, that there is no such thing laid to the
peoples charge, as not being prepared for his
Reformation. And this I conceive to bee a
Reason of the succession of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
reformation through King <hi>Iames</hi> his Raigne,
and our gracious King <hi>Charles;</hi> namely, besides
the Integritie of their Royall spirits, the hearts
of the people were prepared for that Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religion. Which appeares to be so, in
this, That no <hi>Baalam's;</hi> though there have beene
many, could yet curse <hi>England</hi> so farre, as to
Adulterate a considerable part, either of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
or Commons, from the former Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
though from perfection in Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we have beene often stopped.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it's beyond all this observable
concerning <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Reformation; That
though he was very pure in it, and his peoples
hearts prepared for it, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29. 36. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were much taken with <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at first, and forwarded it with all expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
For the worke was done suddenly, saith
the Scripture. Why yet this lasted but <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>'s
life; Truth, and Peace only in his dayes:
for after he was gathered to his Fathers, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was more corrupted then ever by <hi>Manasses</hi>
his sonne, and the Kingdome never in greater
straits, and exigents. Now what should be the
reason of this? That he so pure a Reformer,
and his peoples hearts so prepared for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
yet the Kingdome happy herein, but
for his time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:94161:9"/>
I answer, That we shall find in the search of
Scripture in this case; That for all this forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the People in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s reformation,
yet alas, they were but for a spurt, their be stat
first, their courage soone cooled this way, and
they quickly weary of the life of Religion.
For this complaint the Lord made of <hi>Judah,</hi>
in the Prophet <hi>Hosea:</hi> who prophesied in <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>'s
time against <hi>Judah, Hos. 6. 4. O Judah,
what shall I doe unto thee? for your goodnesse is
as the morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth
away.</hi> And if haply this was spoken to <hi>Judah</hi>
in another Kings time, and not <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s, (for
<hi>Hosea</hi> prophesied in foure Kings raignes of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,
Uzziah, Jothan, Ahaz,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi>) yet
the very last thing in the Prophesie against <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
must in all reason bee in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s time,
<hi>Chap. 12. 2. I have a controversie also with Iudah,
and will punish Jacob according to his wayes.</hi> Nay,
and that which God spake in <hi>Iudah</hi>'s commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
compared with <hi>Ephraim, Chap.</hi> 11. 12.
intimates, as it were, that the Lord was jealous
of <hi>Iudah</hi>'s declining, and returning to Idols;
<hi>Ephraim compasseth mee about with lyes; but Iudah
yet ruleth with God.</hi> Yet, as if he did expect that
they would fall off at last.</p>
            <p>It's manifest againe by the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi>
who prophesied in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s dayes, that even
then there was a defection in the People, the
Magistrates become corrupt, and the Ministrie
too, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 9. and <hi>chap.</hi> last, and beginning of
it. Besides this, it's more then probable that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94161:9"/>
corruptions crept into <hi>Iudah,</hi> even in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s
dayes; because we find there was such a corrupt
Minister of State nigh to the King, and in the
Kings house, <hi>Shebna</hi> by name, both Treasurer,
and also over the Kings house, <hi>Isa.</hi> 22. 15. A
man of a mighty proud spirit for himselfe, as is
seene in the 16. verse, and a mighty dangerous
man to the State of <hi>Iudah,</hi> as appeares in his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
end, in the 17. 18. verse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To put on the use againe in conclusion of
these premisses. We see and cannot see; That
besides the stirring up of the spirit of <hi>Iehosha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi>
or <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> or <hi>Josiah,</hi> or <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> or <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi>
or <hi>Cirus,</hi> I say, besides the stirring up of
the spirits of Rulers to reforme, there are these
two things to be looked unto, if any continued
comfort be expected in Reformation.</p>
            <p>First, that the hearts of the people be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
for Reformation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the hearts of the people be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
settled, when they are prepared. First that the
hearts of the people be prepared for Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
that is, that their opinions, and affections
may bee quite taken off, of all wry wayes in
Gods worship, and byased with right Rules,
and principles in Religion. And hence wee see
the necessitie of the Ministers industry, as well
as the Magistrates, in reforming times. For
though it bee the power of the Sword which
must conforme the outside, yet it is the power
of the Word, which must reforme the inside of
the people. Though the Magistrate must cast
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94161:10"/>
all externall performances, yet the Ministery
properly casts the heart, and inclinations into a
reforming temper.</p>
            <p>And therefore Brethren now King,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of State are discharging their parts in
commanding, if Ministers of the Church doe
not discharge theirs in informing, and exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Surely, as it was said of the Priests to their
disparagement in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s reformation,
2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29. The Levites were more upright in
heart to sanctifie themselves than the Priests;
So will it doubtlesse bee charged on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
in ours; That the Magistrates were more
upright in heart to performe their parts in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
than the Ministers theirs.</p>
            <p>We see also what here is for private men to
worke upon in their prayers, <hi>viz.</hi> the hearts of
the people of the Land, as well as the heart of
the Prince of the Land in the day of refining.
Though the head be never so well, and in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
yet if there be an ill heart, or a corrupt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or ulcerated members in the body, a mans
life is still in hazard: So that if Christians do not
levell as well in their prayers, and humblings,
to the sincerity of the Subjects, as the puritie
of Prince, as well to the preparation of the
people, as the reformation of Rulers; the
Kingdome is not yet out of danger. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be a happinesse to a Kingdome, when
Rulers are willing to reforme, as to <hi>Iudah</hi> in
<hi>Iehoshaphat.</hi> Yet if the people be not prepared
for Reformation, marke, and it goes on with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94161:10"/>
much difficulty, and every motion of it pinches
much. As, this being the case of <hi>Iosiah</hi> six years
could scarcely get out rubbish from Church
and State, that they might come to repaires.
For it was the twelfth yeare before hee could
pull downe <hi>Baal,</hi> and the eighteenth before he
could build for God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there must be care had by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
in their sphere, and the Ministery in
theirs, and all the people of God in theirs too,
to get the hearts of the people setled, in the
rules of Reformation: that they bee not wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and of a changeable spirit, except Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
change any forgot, or unseene errors:
that their goodnesse may not bee as <hi>Iudah</hi>'s, as
the morning cloud, and early dew which passeth
away; that they may not bee for Antichrist a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
when an opportunity tempts them; but
religious when <hi>Iehojada</hi> is dead, and righteous
when <hi>Iosiah</hi> is fallen asleepe. In a word, that
they may be implanted into a Reformation, as
the Medes and Persians were into their Law,
which altered not. And if this bee not, then
this may be; nay, this will be the mischiefe, and
inconvenience, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the worke of Reformation goe on
apace for a time, as it is said of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> he bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God, that the hearts of the people were so
prepared, that the worke was done with speed.
I say, though the worke may goe on with speed
for a time, yet in time there may come a pause,
and long demurre: and this was their case in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94161:11"/>
building of the Temple, upon the weakning of
the hands of the people of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,
Ezr</hi> 4. The People were extraordinary busie,
and zealous at the foundation of the Temple,
but shortly after, by some wiles, and plots of
Ante-reformers, their hands were weakned,
their zeale abated, and the worke of building
the Temple, received intermission many yeares,
<hi>Ezr.</hi> 4 Compare the fourth verse with the
twenty fourth.</p>
            <p>Thus you have seene cleared, that when the
Magistrates of a Land are serious in separating
betwixt the pretious, and the vile, if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Land, I meane the considerable part
of them be peccant; the Land is still in danger,
especially for future. For if the hearts of the
people be not prepared for reformation, then it
comes on with much difficulty: If prepared,
and not settled, there may come in dangerous
delayes, and besides little hopes to last long.
As the Israelites at first comming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
in one quarter of a yeare they got as farre as to
the wildernesse of <hi>Zinai,</hi> the third part of their
way from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and count all their
Compasses in their journey: they staied not
there much above the yeare compleat, to take
their Lawes along with them, and yet after they
removed from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> they were nine and
thirtie yeares before any of them got to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>
Whereas had their progresse beene like
their beginning, they might have beene at the
Land of promise within fix moneths more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:94161:11"/>
You conceive our owne case without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
application; and you cannot but conceive
how much it concernes us all to see to it, to our
power, that the hearts of all be not only prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to reforme, but settled in their preparations.
And sure it lyes hard upon Gods people
(O that they would heartily take notice of it)
not to ebbe a jot in the course of Prayer, and
humiliation, or in the way of personall refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
or exercise of faith, and activenesse of
spirit every way, which is proper for the times,
and their conditions in them. So much for this
first Doctrine from the Argument of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Prophesie is also to threaten
them, that keepe corrupt, and rotten hearts,
in times of reformation. And hence this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>That Anti-reformers are sure of ruine.<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note>
There are sure judgements kept for them, that
keepe corrupt minds under times of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For why <hi>Iosiah</hi>'s people should be punished
for this temper, and any now escape, I can find
no reason; So that to such, ruine will come,
though haply, it may be a whole, or a peece
of an Age before: as it was with the multitude
of the Jewes in <hi>Iosiah</hi>'s dayes, his dayes they
were respited, but after ruined. And if in this
case the generality of the people bee thus tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the whole Nation is at stake, if but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
part Almighty God can fift out
the accursed thing, and I beleeve will cull out
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94161:12"/>
               <hi>Achans,</hi> and save Israel.</p>
            <p>My Brethren, when in times of reformation
and puritie, men will not leave their vanitie
and superstitions, what the Word cannot take
away, the Sword of the Magistrate must, or
Gods will. Men of spirits crossing reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are our Moabites, and Ammonites: We shall
observe that the Moabites, and Ammonites in
<hi>Israels</hi> time, were by Gods law, the most accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedst
men, of all men; the very Edomites and
Egyptians, were not so hatefull a people as
they, for the children of an Edomite, or an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian,
might enter into the Congregation of
the Lord in the third generation, but the Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite,
and the Ammonite might not come into the
Congregation of the Lord, to the tenth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
no not for ever. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 3. and 8.</p>
            <p>Now what was the nature and disposition of
the Ammonite and Moabite, that they above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
must bee thus accursed? Why, because
they hindered <hi>Israels</hi> passage to <hi>Canaan;</hi> thus
will it be with the men who hinder the Church
of God from the enjoyment of her promises
of Puritie and Peace, they are, or God will
make them the hatefull'st of men.</p>
            <p>And O that some in these times, would take
this into thought, who had rather in their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in Religion bee conformable to <hi>Rome</hi>
in the Popes time, then reduced to <hi>Rome</hi> in
Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time, and choose to imitate her in
her corruptions, rather then in her puritie.
<hi>Rome</hi> is sure to be ruinated, if the generalitie o<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:94161:12"/>
pure Divines in all ages since Antichrist knowne
to be there, doe not faile us; nay, and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
themselves, which wee are sure will not.
And if shee be sure, as sure are all they that
come not out from her, else what meanes that
place of Scripture, <hi>Rev. 18. 4. Come out of her my
people, that yee bee not partakers of her sinnes, and
that yee receive not of her plagues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, thirdly the Argument of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
is to shew to all Ages, what necessitie
there is, of fidelity, and throughnesse in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the reformation of States, and Churches,
for otherwise they are still indanger. Though
it be no error to take away some corruptions,
yet it is an error not to take away all.</p>
            <p>What hath beene the spring of the miseries
of some of Christs Churches (as in <hi>Germany</hi>)
since they were reformed, but their partiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations.
<hi>Gualther,</hi> and other judicious Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Divines were in this note whilst they
lived.</p>
            <p>There is no perfect peace in a State, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
full Puritie of the Church. The times of
laying downe weapons, of beating Swords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
plow-shares, and Speares into pruning
hookes, and of learning warre no more, and of
every mans sitting under his Vine, and under
his Figge-tree without feare, <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 3. 4. are
the purest times of the Gospell. The times
when the Gentiles shall be earnestly calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Jewes, that they may walke together in
the glorious light of the Gospell compare
that of <hi>Micah</hi> with 2 <hi>Isa.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:94161:13"/>
And againe, Churches are very subject to
relapses, when not throughly healed, and relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are dangerous; the last error is worse then
the first. New Idolaters after a reformation,
are more dangerous then former; Consider the
Idolatrous times of <hi>Judah</hi> after reformations,
and it is plaine, Idolaters were more dangerous
after <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s reformation then before, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<hi>Manasses</hi> time, and still more dangerous
after <hi>Josiah</hi>'s reformation then before, witnesse
the Captivity. And it is not in vaine to looke
upon the next Idolaters after King <hi>Edw.</hi> refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
And if wee be not blind, we may see
in our owne dayes, that popish spirits are more
deepe, and desperate then ever yet. But I am
not preaching to reformers, therefore to you
my Auditors I commend, and in the name of
God may command, these three things careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bee looked unto by you, even in these
times wherein the Lord doth dispose the spirits
of Prince and Governours to a Reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, to your utmost abilitie, the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the peoples hearts. For <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> tooke
not away the High places, because the people
as yet had not prepared their hearts to seeke the
Lord God of their fathers, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 20. 33. And
your primest way for this is powerfull prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the strengthening of your owne,
and their hands, whose hearts are prepared; the
holding up, and out of your, and their courage,
and zeale for reformation. For the weakening
of the hands of the people of <hi>Judah,</hi> was a lon<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:94161:13"/>
stop to the perfecting of the Temple, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 4. 4.
And lastly, And the surest way for this is to
enter into a sure Covenant, the way is lead
for us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it must be your speciall care, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
you neither Idolize the Instruments of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
nor under-value them, or bring up an
ill report of them. For the first branch; Wee
our selves know, the Churches of <hi>Germany</hi> have
had a sore checke from God, for too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in man<note n="*" place="margin">I have heard and read, that the Renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King of <hi>Sweden</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem'd so much unto them before his death.</note>. When, whilst wee lay our
pipes directly upon the Fountaine for derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we are sure to have our pipes full, if once
we set the Cisterne in the Springs place, we are
sure to find emptie vessels. This may bee an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
But that which certainly is the error, is an
undervaluing of the Instruments of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It is likely there are many <hi>Belials</hi> that mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
against Reformers now, as <hi>Sheba</hi> did of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
a Reformer of <hi>Israel, 2 Sam. 20. Wee have
no part in David, neither have wee inheritance in
the sonne of Jesse, every man to his Tents, O Israel.</hi>
Some such base spirits no question wee have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, whose hearts rise against Reformers
of Church and State, and had rather every
man, should walke by will in both, then by
rule in either.</p>
            <p>We shall observe it usually in Reformations
in Scripture, the Devill hath stirred up Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformers,
whose designes have bin to contrive
the disgrace, and basest esteeme of the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Reformation. Thus <hi>Korah</hi> and his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94161:14"/>
company plotted amongst the people, to cast
an aspersion upon <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> that they
tooke too much upon them, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> reformation <hi>Rehum</hi> the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,
and <hi>Shimshai</hi> the Scribe, insinuated to
the people; That <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Jeshua</hi> in their
reformation, and restoring the Temple, wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the King, and Countrey, and signified as
much to the King also by politique, but lying
Letters, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4. And in <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s reformation
<hi>Sanballet,</hi> and <hi>Tobia,</hi> enemies of the same spirit.
When our Saviour was in reforming the state
of the Church in his time, and preached against
the errors, and superstitions of the Jewes, and
their Church, then the high Priests and Scribes
<hi>Et cetera,</hi> insinuated to the people, that Christ
was but a Wine-bibbet, a companion of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans,
and though he did strange things, yet the
cast out Divels, by <hi>Beelzebub</hi> prince of Divels.</p>
            <p>Beloved, as the case is with us, your cure
must be great against carnall reason. For carnall
reason might have disputed against <hi>Josiah</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
he was but a Child, and medled also
with the very rooting out of things, that his
godly Ancestours left standing, both in state
and Church. So carnall reason might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
more in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s reformation; That he
did not only pull downe the High places, set up
by men, but the Brazen Serpent, formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponted
by God. And thus it may bee some
men, if they conferre with carnall reason, may
cavill at our present Reformers, As that they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94161:14"/>
make themselves wiser then their Fathers, and
remove things out of Church, and State, which
their Predecessors found no fault with. And had
they beene men of such spirits as these, so might
the people have stumbled at <hi>Asa</hi>'s taking away
some things in his latter reformation, which he
left in being in his former fifteene yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>My Brethren, I conclude with this Paralell,
in this point, and I beseech you take it to heart.
As those Israelites, that brought up an ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whither <hi>Israel</hi> was
going, were not only barr'd from comming
thither, but dyed of the Plague in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 14. So let those Cavellors against
the <hi>Canaan,</hi> whither this Church of Christ is
going, expect assuredly, that they shall never
enjoy the sweetnesse of it.</p>
            <p>And for a farewell word; If any feare, lest
the enemy should hope, to strengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by seeing here, where our strength lyes.
I must tell them, they feare where no feare is.
For the mysteries of the Kingdome of Heaven,
made knowne to us, are made Parables to them.
And be confident in it; That God does never
discover duty to us, to ensnare us, but
to keepe us out of snares that
are laid for us.</p>
