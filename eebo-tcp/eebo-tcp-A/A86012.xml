            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the underſtanding Reader.</head>
            <p>As a teſtimony of the Affections and good will I we to the Land of my Nativity, I have here adventured to publiſh the true intention and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of the Heavens toward the ſame; having with a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable portion of pains and care obſerved them, as they weren poſited at the time of his Sacred Majeſties proclaiming, May 8. 1660. in the Palace-yard at Weſtminſter. There are two things that have principally prevailed upon me for the compoſing and printing this Diſcourſe:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Quiet and Peace of theſe Nations, and ſatisfaction of the people thereof.</item>
               <item>2. The neglect of other Aſtrologers in forwarding ſo neceſſary a work.</item>
            </list>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Expectations of the people generally are mounted (as it were) upon Eagles wings, earneſtly deſiring; and ſeriouſly wiſhing to know, whether Peace and Quietude be like to be continued to us, in theſe (of late) diſtracted and bleeding Nations. whoſe wiſhes and D<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſires, I hope, I have fully and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily anſwered, in the following Tract; wherein I have written nothing but <hi>ſecundum Artem,</hi> according to the true meaning of the Heavens. I have not, with gay Flouriſhes, guiled over any thing; but taken a juſt Cognizance of the very worſt, as well as of the beſt of things.—<hi>Flatery and ſyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantick Practiſes, ought as well to flee the face of a Princely Science, as it ſhould the Sanctuary of a Prince's Preſence.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The neglect and backwardneſs of Artiſts in ſo neceſſary a work, may ſeem to perſwade with many, that things are not likely to ſucceed ſo happily and well as they may expect. But this is onely a ſullen ſilence in ſome of them, becauſe they ſee no probable hopes of a reward to follow ſuch an undertaking; and Dull Jades never go well without a ſpur. In our late times of confuſion it was a hard matter to hold them from ſhewing themſelves Incendiaries to purpoſe; then they could make Art ſpeak any thing. But now, although here be a far better ground to preſage <hi>Englands</hi> happineſs from, under the Government of his ſacred Majeſty, this is hardly worth the conſidering with them; they will rather, then take notice hereof, hang down their heads like Bull-ruſhes, and obliviate their Art. This hath been a ſecond Argument to Prevail with me for the publiſhing this Diſcourſe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>What I have here written, and publiſhed, I have done with an upright in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; not to ſow ſedition, but cement differences; not to ſet mens brains a madding, but to ſeaſon and compoſe them: Not to render any opinion odious, but to rectifie thoſe that are over-run with Errours and Miſtakes. I am not conſcious to my ſelf of commiting any ſin herein, either againſt the Art I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, or the honour of the Nation. I may (I preſume) be as bold to write truth in the defence of <hi>Englands</hi> peace, and be protected for ſo doing, as others are to write falſities and untruths, and publiſh them to its prejudice. I may justly expect as good quarter for publiſhing a fair and ſober peice of Art, as thoſe that print Lyes, Forgeries and Libels. I have no deſigne at all, unleſs it be to preſerve ſuch that would deſtroy themſelves; and to render the Art of Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie
<pb facs="tcp:130714:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(as it ought to be)amiable. I would not be miſunderſtood; when I plead for <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> and the <hi>honeſt Aſtrologers, I deſire not the propagation of Incantations, witchcrafts, and sorceries, Gaeodemologic, dealing with Angels or spirits, Theurgic, calling up Dic-mie in a Chriſtal; with other to be abhorted Devices, and helliſh cheats: nor yet the tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Conjurers, Witches, Magicians, sorcerers, Divinators,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that under pretence of Aſtrologie have ſet whole Nations on fire, with their black skill and cunning. Nor ſhall I plead for any that have can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the downfal of kings, Nations, Laws and Miniſtry, Lawyears, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>from Pictures and Prphecies, which are the highest sorceries that can used; and against which there are very particular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deſire and plead for the toleration of Aſtrologie no further then it is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable for mankind. As, by the <hi>Decubital</hi> and <hi>Critical</hi> parts thereof, <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians</hi> are befriended; by the <hi>Agricultural</hi> part, the <hi>Husbandman</hi>; by the <hi>Nautical</hi> parts, the <hi>Seaman</hi> and <hi>Navigator</hi>; the <hi>Genethliacal part aſſiſts each particular perſon</hi> with the good and adverſe times of his whole life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him (by gods permiſſion) when he may with thankfulneſs receive a benifit, and when with pious prudence, reverbirate, or at leaft mitigate a miſchief. theſe (with many others too long to mention here) I do d fend; there being a Demonſtration of the uſe, worth and excellency of them; as <hi>Bellan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Cardan,</hi> and sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon,</hi> have largely proved; unto whoſe works I refer the Readers. But for the beforementioned Villanies, and the Pract ſers thereof, they cannot be too ſeverely dealt with; the Ruine of thouſands cries aloud againſt them; and every honest Aſtrologer abominates them.</p>
            <p>Of my <hi>Anſwer to Mr. Jeffey,</hi> the reaſonleſs and falſeneſs of moſt of the things by him Puliſhed, and his partial Applications thereof, were the main inducements, no diſreſpect to his perſon at all. I deſire to live peaceably and quietly under the Government established; and hold is not a ſin, but duty, to proy for Kings. I earneſtly wiſh <hi>Englands</hi> welfare. I envy no ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world, yet am not of every opinion. If Epiſcopacy be held the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt way for the churches ſettlment, and a means to mike <hi>England</hi> happy, I shall not grieve to see it eſtabliſhed. I eſteem full as well of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer-Book, as others do of their precatory Enthuſiaſmi. <hi>God preſerve his Majeſty, and the Royal Progeny, and continue the (happily begun) Peace of theſe Kingdoms</hi>!

But beſides his being located in a fixed Signe, and the chief Angle of Heaven, he is in partile Sextile of <hi>Mars,</hi> the Patron of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and Conqueſt, who is poſited in the eleventh Houſe; which is an eminent Argument, and moſt clear Teſtimony, That his Majeſty cannot want aſſiſtance and ſupport (ſhould he (which I dare be confident he never will) ſtand in need) even from the very beſt of men: (<hi>i. e.</hi>) from thoſe that are moſt active, powerful and skilful in Arms.

and <hi>Mars,</hi> yet the injury his ſingle poſition portends, is alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated by the benign preſence of <hi>Venus</hi> in the ſame houſe, ſhe being in perfect Amity with the Moon: for it is a known Rule among Aſtrologers, <hi>Quicquid ligat Mars, Solvit ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>: Whatſoever <hi>Mars</hi> by his ill influence, harms; <hi>Venus</hi> by her benevolent Rays, helps.

Yet I will not deny, but the Platique Squares of the Moon and <hi>Mereury,</hi> and of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> alſo, may ſo far operate upon the over-heated brains of ſome, and thoſe ſomewhat religious too, (is not <hi>Mars</hi> Lord of the ninth?) that their Actions may render them moſt unfit to be either truſted, or connived at: yet I aver, thoſe that are the moſt deſitous, and moſt powerful to do or act anything a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this moſt happy, and (to <hi>England</hi>) natural Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment eſtabliſhed, will in their Actions &amp; Doings be moſt ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly diſcovered, let them in the management thereof weare what kind of Vizards they pleaſe.

I ſhould think that the enemies to his ſacred Majeſty (were they not blind) might read their inevitable Ruine in the concurrent Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the People at his Majeſties proclaiming, and Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Who ever either ſaw, read, or heard of a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Unanimity and conſent of Hearts and Judgements of all forts of people, then there was at the proclaiming and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in of our dread Soveraign? If <hi>Vox Populi,</hi> be <hi>Vox Dei;</hi> if the Voice of the People upon be the Voice of Gods, how dare any ſort of people, upon the Cynical Cinceits or Humours, turn Separatiſts and cant the downfal of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and bleſſed Edifice: which is built nor onely upon the

Suffrages of the major part of the People, but of Heaven it ſelf? The Learned <hi>Strafford</hi> by experience found, (and it was his dying expreſſion) That the breath of the People were the Organs of Deſtiny. And certainly, that which hath power to abate of the Majesty and Greatneſs of the one, hath Potency alſo to make another Mighty.</p>
            <p>Let me add yet a little further, (for I preſume I may, and that rationally too, while I have Authority for my ſupport.) The Arabians in theſe manner of Judgements, did make uſe of ſeveral parts, as the parts of Fortune; Victory and Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which (you may ſee) are all placed in the foregoing Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, <hi>Aſpice ad partem fortunae, &amp; ad partem Nobilitatis, quae accipitur in die a gradu Solis in gradum ipſius Exaltatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis — &amp; projicitur ab Aſcendente. Aſpice etiam partem Regni &amp; victoria, quae accipitur in die &amp; nocte a gradu Solis in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi> Lunae, <hi>&amp; projicitur a gradu Medii Caeli. (Id eſt)</hi> In the Figure of the proclaiming of a King, you ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Part of Fortune, and to the part of Nobility, which by day is gained by ſubſtracting the Degree of the Suns place, from the Degree of his Exalation, and projecting it from the Aſcendent. Behold alſo the part of the Kingdom, and of Victory, which both day and night you muſt take from the Degree of the Sun, to the degree of the Moon, and then project it from the Degree of the Mid-heaven. Then for the uſe of thoſe Parts, examining the ſame learned Author, he tells us — <hi>Si quando he paries venerint in bonis locis &amp; fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natis,&amp; cum fortunis, ſignificat magnam nobilitatem &amp; hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem illi domino,</hi> &amp;c. (i. e.) If when any or all of theſe Parts happen to be placed fortunately in the Figure, and with the Fortunes alſo, they portend great Nobility and Honour to that Prince then proclaimed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — Here you ſee theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Princely parts are poſited in the chief places of the Figure, and the Part of Nobility near the body of <hi>Venus</hi>: beſide, they are all near eminent fixed Stars, <hi>viz.</hi> the part of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune near <hi>Cor Scorpit</hi> in the fourth Houſe; and the part of Victory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> near <hi>Cor Leonis,</hi> in the Aſcendent or firſt houſe; and the part of Nobility in <hi>Cancer,</hi> nearly in Conjunction of <hi>Ras-Algenſe,</hi> a ſplendid, ſhiming, fixed Stat in the eleventh
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:130714:7"/>
houſe: therefore I pronounce the Aphoriſm to take full effect It is no mean Argument of laſting honour and happineſs, in which the fixed ſtars are ſo eminently concerned: For, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ptolomy, Stella fix a mirabiles &amp; ultra rationem faelicitates tribuunt</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>The Reader muſt pardon my repetition, for I cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it here; beſides, I have a warrant from <hi>Cardan</hi> for ſo doing, <hi>Seg.</hi>4. <hi>Aphor.</hi> 85. <hi>Repetitio neocſſaria eſt, in hac ſcientia, vel ob difficultatem, vel ob neceſſitatem, velob utilitatem ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, vel obcontradictionem.</hi> Repetition is neceſſary in this Science, either by reaſon of difficulty, neceſſity, exceeding benefit, or elſe to avoid contradiction. I muſt therefore (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I ſhould rob thoſe weighty Arguments of their Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are drawn from thoſe parts before mentioned) here again affirm, That hence alſo is portended a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation, and convenient duration of his Majeſties reign, and the Government of theſe Nations, maugre the moſt malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and ſubtile Deſignes of the moſt inveterate Oppoſers thereof.</p>
            <p>Now, as we have ſpoken of (and we have ſatisfactorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated) the glory and happineſs, and the happy continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Heaven-favouring Return of our gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, and Monarchical Government into theſe (of late) confuſed Iſlands; ſo give me leave to add a word or two concerning all thoſe that ſhall ſet themſelves againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty by reaſon of his happy Reſtauration; or againſt the Government of theſe Nations as it is now eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>The Enemies of his Majeſty, and of <hi>Englands</hi> peace, are ſignified by <hi>Saturn: Ergo,</hi> they are envious, malitious, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, jealous, timorous, ſuſpitious, ſluggiſh, ſordid and miſtruſtful. This is the true Character of the inclinations and diſpoſitions of thoſe perſons ſignified by <hi>Saturn</hi> When he is ill dignified, as now in this Figure. <hi>Origanus de effecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, fol.</hi>590. when <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> both are concerned (as here they are) in the deſcriptions of any kind of Perſons,

And a little, further the ſame Author tells us, That if thoſe Planets be ill beholding, (as in our Figure) then they ſignifie perſons that are—<hi>Raptores, graſſatores, maleficos, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelioſos, inſidiatores, furaces, ſacrilegos, ſepulchrorum viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores &amp; ſpeliatores, per juros, omris humanitatis violatores, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>races,</hi> &amp;c, Iſhall not Engliſh theſe words, becauſe I would not have the world be any more commonly acquainted with ſuch a Generation of Miſcreants, or that there are ſuch Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures any where, ſave in Hell. We in <hi>England</hi> have had our ſhare of the Company of ſuch a Race, for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; many Ages will not weare out the memory of their Actions: They have made greater Impreſſions upon the Happineſs and Peace of <hi>Englands</hi> flouriſhing Kingdom, then ever the ſurious Planet <hi>Mars</hi> by his being Promittor in a fiery Signe, could make by that loathſome Diſeaſe termed <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>The Learned <hi>Haly</hi> in this manner of Judgements, ſeems to decipher the Enemies of a King, and their conditions alſo, by the Infortunes at large, as appears by this Aphoriſm of his: <hi>Siquando infortumium fuerit cadens &amp;:c ſub terra maxime, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificat debilitatem, inimieqrum; &amp; depreſſionem, &amp; vilem, eorum eſtimationem, &amp;c.</hi> which ſonnds to this purpoſe in Engliſh: If when the.

It is common for the major part of the world, whoſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are unſeaſoned, to be taken with pretended Flourtiſhes of skill, whether they be certain and true, or not. <q>I have heard of a Muſtian who (with his Youth) was pſaying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it great number of perſons; and the Youth having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a little ſuperficial skill, did with the ſame ſo enchaunt the Ears of the Auditors, that they brake forth into a great Commendation of his rare skill: His Maſter obſerving this their applauſe, came near to the Youth, and ſtruck him on the Ear, ſaying, Sirrah, If you had been true to your Notes, thoſe misjudging-Ears could never have commended you.</q> So, if that grand Abuſer of Aſtrologie have been commmend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all things he hath written, it hath been by unſeaſoned Judgments, Perſons that were not acquainced with his Wiless and lgnorance. Yet for his ſake alone, hath Aſtrologie been hardly cenſured, yea, plainly abuſed, neglected, ſcorn'd and condemned.</p>
            <p>It is not Aſtrologie, but Sycophancy, and arch-Villany, to turn tide &amp; tale with every, intereſt. An houeſt Aſtrologer ſcorns to fawn, ftatter, and write for and againſt a Parliament for.200 and l. 100.l. <hi>per anuum.</hi> Is he an able Astrologer that ſhall trapan the King-of <hi>Sweden</hi> to his ruine, and yet receive from him both money and a Goid Chain? Is he not a Villain rather?.

Is he not a Mercenary Killain rather, that for a handful of earth ſhall aſſaſſinate the moſt ſplendid reputations in the world? Nor dare I esteem him other then a rancorous hearted Wretch that ſhall aggravate a difference between his own Prince and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or that ſhall abuſe his Royal Majesties Friends by name, as the before mentioned <hi>Merlin's</hi> Brat hath ihe Earl of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> calling him arch-Rebel, and indiſcreet Earl, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him with inglorious death; and Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> whom he

            <p>Aſtrologie is too Princely a Science to be thus a buſed! but by the ſoile and black Actions of this Proditorious Fellow, the Diamond, Luſtre and Beauty of the Art, is the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſhadowed and ſet off. I abominate to threaten or terrifie any ſort of men in the world with falſe fears, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed with any at all! Howbeit, I ſhall endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade all thoſe that are wilfully precipitating themſelves into the Gulph of Miſery, Ruine and Deſtruction, to avoid run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Road that leads neceſſarily thereunto: If the cauſe be taken away, the effect of courſe ceaſeth.</p>
            <p>And that I may uſe a pertinent and proper Argument to perſwade with them, I ſhall acquaint them, and the world at large, That Aſtrologie is not ſo vain, ſo empty, or ſo idle a ſtudy, as the ignorance and villany of the beforementioned Perſon hath ſeemed to render it. There is more Worth, Truth, and certainty therein, then the weak &amp; yeilding Brains of Men are generally able to conceive or comprehend: And that may moſt probably be the ground of the Right Honorable the Lord Chancellour's Caution in his Learned and Elegant Speech to the Parliament, — <hi>That we ſhould not too much deſpiſe the influence of the Stars.</hi> 
               <q>We do not (faith the Learned Dr. <hi>Brown</hi>) reject or condemn a ſober and regulated Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie; we hold there is more truth therein, then in Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; in ſome more, then many allow; yet in none ſo much as ſome pretend. We deny not the influences of the Stars, but often ſuſpect the due Application thereof: <hi>Pſeud. Epidem.

Shall we through a conceited or zealous ignorance, confound the good uſe of the Art with the abuſe thereof, for the knaviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a known Impoſtor therein? Are there no Grapes ripe, or fit to be eaten, but thoſe that are within our reach? Shall we wilfully damn and deſtroy all things we are not able to underſtand? This were ridiculous, and moſt unworthy

the Reaſon of men! Is there no ſober Diſtinction to be made between the good Wine and the Dregs? between the skill of an honeſt Artiſt and the practiſe of a Sycophantique Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender? That it is unjuſt for any to blend or mingle the true uſe, with the abuſe of an Art, I ſhall endeavour to ſatisfie the world, by remembring them of ſome few, but admirable examples, in which the true worth and certainty of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Science hath to the great credit thereof, been veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>

               <p>HAving been of late moſt unworthily taxed by that known.

Which to correct with the Soveraign Antidote of Truth, I hold it requiſite to acquaint the world, how I came firſt to ſtudy Aſtrologie, and unto whoſe memory I owe my knowledge therein. Which make as followeth.—</p>
               <p>In the year 1652. going into <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi> in the way of a grateful Viſit to my honoured Grandfather Sir.<hi>J.Curſon,</hi> who out of his Nobleneſs was at the charge of my Education; I took with me ſome Pamphets as, The Copies of the Times Humours, to preſent him with. And among the reſt, Mr. <hi>Wharton's Hemeroſc.</hi> for that year: upon fight of which, he was very well pleaſed, and began to enter into a Diſcourſe with me touching Aſtrologie. And (although my knowledge then was but mean therein) I anſwered his Demands accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:130714:18"/>
to the beſt of my skill. In brief, he was ſo well pleaſed with my mean Returns, that he not onely commended my poor industry, but gave me ſomewhat to encourage me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and withal, expreſſed a greater reſpect and affection to the Art, then Gentlemen in this Age commonly do; And adviſed me (for attaining perfection therein) to the Study of Aſtronomy; acquainting me, that (which I ſince found as true as the Oracle) he who was ignorant of the Motions of the Stars, muſt be ſo alſo in their effects.</p>
               <p>Finding my ſelf ſo well entertained for that mean mite of knowledge, I was reſolved then to make a further progreſs therein, and (if poſſible) underſtand the moſt abſtruſe parts thereof. And this my inclination wanted not an ample ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification in my Nativity from the Heavens. For I had then operating <hi>M.C. ad</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:trine">△</g> ♂, and this in ♍, the greateſt Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ☿, the true Patron of Arts and Sciences. And upon the Effects thereof, I acquainted my ſelf with that eminently Learned Mathematician and Aſtrologer, Dr. <hi>N. Fiske</hi>; who, in little time, had ſo far inſtructed me in the whole Art of Aſtrologie, and a competent part of Aſtronomy alſo, that in 1655. I was able to preſent my honoured Grandfather with an Almanack in Manuſcript, which was afterwards printed, and hath ſince been annually continued. And in that year alſo, I, together with my Uncle Mr. <hi>T.G.</hi> began to reduce the places of all the fixed Stars in the Heavens, as an Emendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Learned <hi>Hartgil</hi>'s Tables. And theſe were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and publiſhed 1656. And in the ſame year I published my <hi>Coelestial Ambaſſador.</hi> In the year 1658. I emitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world my <hi>Doctrine of Nativities.</hi> In the year 1658 I publiſhed the King of <hi>Swedes</hi> Nativity, and <hi>Nuncius Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicus</hi> alſo. And in the year 1660. I publiſhed my Treatiſe of Prodigies.</p>
               <p>In all which works, my Enemles themſelves can't ſay, I have done Aſtrologie the leaſt diſhonour, or caſt one blot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Divine Beanty of the fair <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rania.</hi> Howbeit, I muſt ingenuouſly acknowledge, that all theſe Rivulets are ſprung from the ſource of that great Seminary of the Mathematicks, Dr. <hi>Fisk.</hi> beforementioned: for to him, and to him alone,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:130714:18"/>
next unto Divine Aſſiſtance do I owe all my knowledge in Art; and can boldly aver, I never learnt the meaning of an Aphoriſm from any other man in the world.</p>
               <p>I have been acquainted with the beſt and worſt knowing in this Science in <hi>England</hi>; and muſt acknowledge, there are more ingenious perſons ſtudy if privately, then any that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it publickiy. I cannot diſcover either more Art or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty in our higheſt Pretenders, then in the mear vulgar A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologer. Nor am I able to diſcern any material Difference between a fam'd Mountebanks pair of Dials, with a <hi>Non Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt,</hi> and the poor Bill-Poſters <hi>Astra non neceſſitant,</hi>&amp;c. one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, The one hath quacked under an eſpecial Protection from the State, for a bribe of <hi>100 l.</hi> and ſometimes <hi>200 l. per annum</hi>; and the other perhaps better deſerving, for want of Clyents; is compelled to the courſe he otherwiſe hates and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominates. I honour Aſtrologie honeſtly conſidered, but hate the Sycophantick Pretender thereunto. I was more confident when I ſcarcely knew a ⚹ from a <g ref="char:trine">△</g>, then now I dare to be after nine years ſtudy. I have written more of Art, then any man of this latter Age: yet have not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Kingdoms or Families, or abuſed Kings, Princes. or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Perſons, under pretence. thereof. I have carefully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to eſcape <hi>Tacitus</hi> his Cenſure, who reſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Aſtrologers —<hi>Genus Hominus infiduns Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piuſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have had the happineſs to read Aſtrological (and ſtill do) to many ingenious perſons, and that ſatisfactorily, as many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well know: By which mean, I have much embettered my own underſtanding: For, <hi>Decendo diſcimus,</hi> by teaching we learn our ſelves.</p>
               <p>And whereas perſon, as inſolently, as unjuſtly, rearm me ungrateful, either to <hi>Litty</hi> or any other, I ſhall deſire them, Firſt <hi>Arguere,</hi> then <hi>Readarguers</hi> firſt, to prove the Crime they object againſt me; then, reprove me for it. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge readily, that Ingratitude is the greateſt of Crimes a man can be guilty of. And it is a thing ſo contrary to my nature, that I deſire no longer to live, then to be grateful. And if I eſteemed my ſelf a drachm behiad hand with any man
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:130714:19"/>
in this, I would return him a pound in ſatisfaction. Nay; the beforementioned perſon that hath objected Ingratitude to me, upon my demanding his Reaſon, did before Mr. <hi>E.Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> pronounce me (to him) the moſt grateful man in the world. And I am confident he cannot, neither dares he ſay, (unleſs it it be boaſtingly behind my back) that I ever learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Line in Aſtrologie or Aſtronomy from him. The later of which I dare, and do here publickly maintain, he knoweth nothing of; no, not to the Calculation of one Stars place, either fixed or Erratique; both which I was ſufficintly able to perform before ever my ill Fortune directed me to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: and how he ſhould then prove my Tutor, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in reaſon ſee. Nay, I proteſt freely, (and this without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny boaſting, or ambitious lifting up my ſelf, for I know my knowledge is but mean) I underſtood more Art before ever I was acquainted with <hi>Lilly,</hi> then he was ever capable of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his life; notwithſtanding his great Fame for (doing nothing elſe in truth but) deluding the world. I mention not this by reaſon of the Difference between him and my ſelf; for in matter of Truth I ſo far deveſt my ſelf from Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Reaſon might reign as King. Nor would I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hereby think, that Labhor to learn of an Adverſary; for I have always made that Adage my Companion, whicn ſays<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <hi>Etemin</hi> fasest, <hi>&amp; abhoſte doceri</hi>; It is both juſt and lawful for a man to learn of his Enemy. And I ſhould not refuſe so learn of him who hath as arrogantly as falſly ſtiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf my Tutor, and hath taught others to cant ſo, if I conld perceive in him any thing by which my underſtanding might be bettered.</p>
               <p>But although I ſhall ſo far ſubmit my ſelf to the truth; as to bow the knee of my Reaſon to any, and ſhall not refuſe to ſtoop to the foot of a Shepherd, if Ingenuity and Reaſon keep Court in ſuch a Cottage; yet I hold it the higheſt ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in the world for any man that is <hi>diſcipulus ratiouis,</hi> to ſubjugate his Reaſon ſo far, as — <hi>Jurare in verba</hi> Lillii. I am too Maſculine to believe the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhall be greater then <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, becauſe Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> rantingly ſays ſo; except he give me a better Reaſon, then ipſe

dixit; and Authority, then the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> and Mother <hi>Shipton.</hi> Or that we ſhall have no more Kings in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe he Sycophantiquely, and for baſe Bribes, (laying aſide his Art) writ ſo. I am too great a Diſciple of Art, to betray my Reaſon and Knowledge therein, to the by<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſſed Intereſt of every confident Pretender. And if to defend the honour of Art, and detect and diſcover the Treaſons and Chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms practiſed under it, and lay the Perſons open to the World, that thus notoriouſly abuſe it, be to be ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; <hi>Sine Apologia,</hi> I deſire to be ungrateful ſtill.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>Lilly</hi> hath printed it — <hi>That lay it in my power, I would ſwallow his Body, and ſpit his Soul into the Stygian Lake,</hi> I muſt tell him, The Fear is as ſcandalous as the Conceit idle and fooliſh: For, it muſt be a Grave of far larger Dimenſions that muſt ſwallow his Body, had he not eſpouſed himſelf to Villanies that ſwell him ſo much bigger then he naturally is. But if he mean by this Charge to ſet off my Hatred to him by a Sarcaſm, or Hyperbole, I muſt return him as egregionſly miſtaken in this, as he prov'd himſelf in the Swediſh Victory, or <hi>R. Cromwel's</hi> continuance: For, I proteſt freely to the World, my heart is furniſhed with no ſuch polluted ſtuff. Nay, I dare be bold to affirm, That were there an occaſion offered me to try my Hatred toward him to purpoſe, I ſhould prove as great a Friend to him, as he is a man, as any of his <hi>Hicks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> Jury did in 1654. when he was indicted there for a Cheat.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>Lilly</hi> is troubled that I have at any time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him a Taylor, I here again tell the world, I do therein but call a Spade a Spade. And he knows I have not onely his own Confeſſion, and Witneſſes yet living to prove it, but good,ſufficient and uncontradicted Authority in Print for ſo reporting him.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> have ought elſe to urge againſt me, I ſhall,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:130714:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God willing, as ſoon as I hear thereof, return him a moſt ſeaſonable, and civil Reply. This therefore ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent me for the preſent to return in anſwer to ſome of his scurrilities.</p>
