         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Courteous, Gentle,</hi> or the
like, suspecting the major part
may prove of a contrary hew; and
therefore you are to believe, this
tract is not written to please many;
for which I expect no other reward,
than what is in my power to bestow
on my self, namely a satisfaction,
flowing from a sincere design of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
Physicians and Chyrurgions,
in the exercise of their Profession,
by setting before their Eyes the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
Frauds, and <hi>male</hi> practice of
some Physick Doctors of <hi>Paris,</hi> and
those also <hi>sub tectonomine,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:62337:5"/>
wholly forreign to my intention,
to detract from the reputation of any
Man, though living at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
And whereas gross aberra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
adequate to those within men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
may happen at <hi>Amsterdam,
Hamborough,</hi> or a greater City,
whence probably from the conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their guilt some may imagine
themselves levell'd at (and so may
those at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> if they
conclude the Presidents recited in this
Treatise may be adapted to any <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian</hi>)
I do protest, and call Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to witness, I did never declare
to any Man, nor ever shall, that by
<hi>Paris</hi> Physicians and Chyrurgions
within named, I mean'd any other,
than those living in the <hi>Metropolis</hi>
of <hi>France.</hi> This I conjecture will
be termed a <hi>Jesuitical</hi> Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:62337:5"/>
by some malicious Infidels, who
will believe none <hi>Protestants,</hi> but
those that wear little Bands, and
cropp'd Hair. An hungry Guest is
impatient to know what he is to have
for his Entertainment, and so may
you possibly; and therefore I will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
acquaint you with your Bill
of Fare. Here is variety of Butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
Meat, fetcht from the Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of <hi>Paris</hi> Physicians, though
plainly dressed after the old <hi>English</hi>
Mode, without interlarding with
<hi>French</hi> Rhetorick. You have some
pleasant <hi>Entremets,</hi> that will help
to digest t' other. After this, for
a <hi>Desert,</hi> you are presented with
a Discourse on the <hi>Jesuits Bark,</hi>
relating what it is, and what it is not;
how it is to be us'd, and how to be
abused. Before I take my <hi>Congé,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62337:6"/>
I must give you some account of the
<hi>Conclave of Physicians</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in this little Volume <hi>Sans Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,</hi>
as in the Title Page, and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
and there if (you please) you
are to apprehend it to be the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave</hi>
of <hi>Physicians</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi>
and <hi>Conclave Physicians,</hi> to be
<hi>Venetians.</hi> Know then this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Conclave</hi> is the eldest <hi>Quack
Synagogue,</hi> consisting of a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
Pope</hi> or <hi>Patriarch,</hi> and a
Competent number of <hi>Medicinal
Cardinals,</hi> who being grown Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
Covetous, and through forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
Ignorant, are to govern the
rest, and whenever they are consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
they are to impose upon the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors
their pretended long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
which they are to imbrace
with the same implicite faith, the
<pb facs="tcp:62337:6"/>
               <hi>Turks</hi> do their <hi>Alcoran.</hi> But if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory,
they are to be convened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Il Consiglio picolo,</hi> which is
their <hi>Purgatory,</hi> whence they may be
received again into the bosome of the
<hi>Conclave;</hi> but if afterwards they
prove incorrigible, then the <hi>Consig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio
Grande,</hi> or the whole <hi>Conclave</hi>
sits upon them (which is their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition</hi>)
and there they are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and utterly expelled without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.
Thus in my time I have
known several poor Wretches dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
going about Streets like Dogs
without Tails. It is in the Power of
the <hi>Consiglio Picolo</hi> to grant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences
to <hi>Nurses, Midwives,
Tinkers,</hi> and <hi>Coblers</hi> to practice
Physick, <hi>modo poss. prod. in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas.</hi>
The Prerogative of granting
Bulls of Absolution for Poysoning a
<pb facs="tcp:62337:7"/>
man, or Dispensations for <hi>male</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
is invested in most of the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi>
but especially in the <hi>Patriarch,</hi>
and the method of procuring them is
casie, <hi>viz.</hi> by sending for one of
them, (which in their <hi>Gibrish</hi> is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<hi>calling one in</hi>) and operating
with the Patient or his Relations,
to present him with three or four
<hi>Hongari</hi>'s or <hi>Chequeens,</hi> which
procures a plenary Absolution. The
foresaid <hi>Patriarch,</hi> to keep up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the <hi>Conclave,</hi> is by
them reputed <hi>Infallible,</hi> carrying
the Keys of Life and Death about
his Girdle, namely, an <hi>Inkhorn</hi> and
an <hi>Escroul,</hi> on which setting his
mark, all mankind is implicitely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
the Patient either died impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
cureable, or recovered his health
at the hands of the Learned: So ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
<pb facs="tcp:62337:7"/>
is Custom in rendring the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<hi>Fourbery</hi> and act of Vertue and
Honesty. In their <hi>Religio Medico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
they also acknowledge Saints;
as, <hi>San Riverio, San Villisio, San
Tabore;</hi> likewise adore Reliques;
as, <hi>Peruvian</hi>-Chips, <hi>Opium, Steel,</hi>
&amp;c. Against those that refuse being
admitted into their <hi>Conclave,</hi> and
will not conform, they send forth
their Bulls and <hi>Anathema</hi>'s, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them <hi>Mountebanks, Quacks,
Chymists, Barbers, Ignorants,</hi>
&amp;c. and if such should at any time
have a Patient die under their Hands
of an incurable Disease, they thunder
it out, he killed the Patient, poisoned
him, applyed wrong Medicines, and the
like. According to the exinanition of
their Treasury, once in eight or ten
years they proclaim a <hi>Jubilee,</hi> setting
<pb facs="tcp:62337:8"/>
open their doors to <hi>Physicians, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
Apothecaries,</hi> and <hi>Renegade
Priests,</hi> who upon the payment of
a certain sum of <hi>Chequeens,</hi> are
Honoured with a Fop Character, and
received into the Church-Porch of
<hi>Aesculapius,</hi> being forbidden to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any further during the time it is
occupied by the whole <hi>Conclave</hi> or
the <hi>Consiglio Picolo,</hi> though at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Seasons they have tolerations to
peep in, or take a turn or two.</p>
            <p>Their immolations are celebrated
chiefly in the <hi>Winter</hi> upon Dogs and
Cats by the yonger fry, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
upon Humane Bodies, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the Hangman, their subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
Officer, which being conveyed
to their <hi>Chauncel,</hi> the <hi>Cardinals</hi> in
their turn fall hewing and slaying
these Carkasses like <hi>Cannibals,</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:62337:8"/>
the intent all Spectators (to whom at
such <hi>Festivals</hi> free egress and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
is granted) may behold them
sitting in their <hi>Pontificalibus,</hi> and
making a pretended narrower search
into the parts of Mans Body, insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
thereby to these Gazers their
incomparable Skill and Learning,
not without a plain <hi>Innuendo,</hi> that
they should send for them in time of
<hi>Sickness:</hi> This is their joynt plot,
wherein each pretends a share, and
it is looked upon to be of such great
prevalence, that some Companies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
any of their Members to hold
private <hi>Anatomies,</hi> lest thereby he
should draw too great a share of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
which ought to be in common;
of so great a value is esteemed this

crafty design of the <hi>Venetian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave,</hi>
I wonder they do not print all
their Names together in a sheet of
Paper with their Dwelling-places,
and the name of the Street where
they may be spoken with, from eight
of the Clock to twelve, and from
two to six, and then cause these ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertising
sheets to be hung up in every
<hi>Apothecaries</hi> Shop, and <hi>Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers
Bulk:</hi> but after all I doubt
that would sound too much like the
noise of Ducks. And what new Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
have they made in <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
these twenty years? Certainly
none, and I dare presume to say, I
my self have divulged more new <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomical</hi>
Observations, which are
of greater use, than all of 'em in a
bundle; and yet I must confess, had I
imployed those <hi>Anatomical</hi> hours in
<pb facs="tcp:62337:10"/>
the study of other parts of <hi>Physick,</hi>
I should have made a far better <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician;</hi>
however as I am, I should be
loth to stain my Education (which
as you may read in my <hi>Casus Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co-Chyrurgicus,</hi>
is beyond any
<hi>Conclave Physician</hi>) in having my
Name and Abode Printed in a Cato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,

under pretence of being visited
by my Iuniors, or distinguish'd from
Illiterate <hi>Mountebanks,</hi> when in
effect it's as much, as if they writ over
their door, here lives a <hi>Wyer-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
Moreover, he that is so far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd
in his senses as to be admitted
into any <hi>Conclave</hi> of <hi>Physicians,</hi>

in the Conclusion I am only to tell you
what it is not; and therefore know, it
is not to set up a <hi>Beacon</hi> to light Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients

upon me than upon the least covetous

               <p>§ 1. THe spacious extent of
the Art of Physick is
by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in this
aphorism asserted, to
exceed the narrow comprehension or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62337:15"/>
capacity of the physical man, in that
short interval he commonly abides in
this Atmosphere; So that, unless the
endeavours and studies of several
ages be link'd together, it is not to
be hoped, that any considerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
will be made therein, specially,
when it must be observed, that the
path we now adays wander in, is
the old trodden way, and the new
one we sometimes light into, (as
that of curing <hi>Feavors,</hi> and <hi>Agues,</hi>
with the <hi>Iesuitical</hi> or <hi>Devils-Bark</hi>)
is oft attended with a success so diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from our expectation. Give me
leave therefore, judicious Reader,
to pay my Duty to that Profession
I have from my younger years been
train'd up in, by making remarks
on some eminent cases in Physick,
that within few years have presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
with a sort of modesty and
impartiality, that those who are
the most Malevolent, and the sole
<hi>Incorporators of Ph<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62337:15"/>
World, I have us'd them rudely or
maliciously.</p>
               <p>§ 2. <hi>Solomon,</hi> the greatest in
wisdom, which implies him in all
Natural and Supernatural subjects
the most knowing, gives us this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
(<hi>Eccles.</hi> 2. 3.) <hi>There is a time
to kill, and a time to heal;</hi> which my
Mother-wit interprets, <hi>That a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
at sometimes he kills, and at
sometimes he cures.</hi> Now, if this Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
doth still continue to square
with vulgar <hi>Parisian</hi> Physicians,
(whose education was but mean,
though by <hi>Association</hi> are rendred
very significant) I may infer, that
the Art of Physick hath not received
the least improvement in the <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
part,</hi> since the age of that wise
King; for even in these days <hi>there
is a time to kill, and a time to heal;</hi>
and for this reason suffer me once
more to tell you, that (according to
my <hi>Hippocratical</hi> Text, <hi>Life is short,
but the Art is long</hi>) it highly concerns
the duty of every honest and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62337:16"/>
Physician, to contribute to
his Faculty what may tend to the
promoting and advancement of it;
which, in my judgment, can best
be performed, by making practical
Observations, to the end the <hi>time of
killing</hi> may be avoided. Furthermore,
observe, that as <hi>Solomon</hi> sets down,
that there is a <hi>time to kill</hi> before
the <hi>time to heal:</hi> so generally, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
(especially of pretended
Societies) <hi>kill</hi> more than they
<hi>cure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 3. It is not with every trivial
matter I must trouble your reading,
but with what is most remarkable
and eminent. Such is the case of
Sr.—(<hi>Eschevin</hi> and Citizen of <hi>Paris</hi>)
a person whose conversation, in his
life-time, was so qualified with Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
as render'd his actions glorious,
especially those that tended so tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendently
to Charity and Piety,
the marks whereof must survive him
in many poor Widows and Orphans.
This worthy Citizen was the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62337:16"/>
which in <hi>English</hi> signifies
Sufferer. His Physicians were many,
and those of the first Magnitude;
who being all united into one <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult,</hi>
we may well admire (if great
Learning, vast Skill, Gravity, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality,
conceited Caps, Volpony
Gowns, Anatomical Theatre, <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation</hi>
Library, Coach and Horses,
avail any thing) that there should
any Disease be so great, or indeed
so little, that should not be blown
off with such Charms as are mark'd
in their <hi>Recipe</hi>-scrowls. But you
must suspend your curiosity of view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Closet of their <hi>Arcana</hi>'s, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
you are acquainted with the state
of the <hi>Sufferer</hi>'s Distemper, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
Age, and other circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which you shall read by and by.</p>
               <p>§ 5. In most Countreys, a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
who is to be put to the Rack,
or any ways executed, is usually,
from his suffering, called the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi>
or <hi>Sufferer;</hi> and so is the sick
man, that is to subject himself to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62337:17"/>
rigid sentence of some of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined
Physicians; which renders
the word <hi>Patient</hi> or <hi>Sufferer</hi> truly
synonymous to both; For, if it be
well considered, a diseased <hi>Sufferer,</hi>
whose quality being conspicuous,
must in course be tryed by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult,
or Jury of Physicians: the
<hi>Quorum</hi> whereof consisting of three
at least, the first called performs
the Office of an <hi>Attorney-General;</hi>
He, in making of his Process, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits
his Charge against the <hi>Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer:</hi>
declaring, that he hath been
very intemperate in eating or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or hath been negligent of his
health, in exposing himself to the
incertainty of the Air, by leaving
off some Cloaths, (as, a pair of
Garters, Cuff-strings) or by some
violent motion, passion, or other
extravagancy; or hath extremely
injur'd himself, by over-waking, or
over-sleeping, or by this, that, or
t'other senseless <hi>occasional cause,</hi> (as he
in his wonted dialect doth term it)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62337:17"/>
whereby the <hi>Sufferer</hi> hath now cast
himself into a <hi>Feaver, Dropsie,
Consumption,</hi> or what other Disease
he is (ignorantly enough) pleased
to call it; and so, as they would
make the world believe, is become
<hi>felo de se,</hi> which is his capital Crime.
Upon little or no examination of
the Evidence, by this puny <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siglio
di sanita,</hi> (wherein an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical
killing Idol, a <hi>Tom Tattle,</hi>
a School-master turn'd Physician, a
<hi>Western Bumkin,</hi> that pretends to
<hi>Limbo</hi> Children in the Small-Pox by
a new method, or, more especially, a
Sir <hi>Formal Flegmatick,</hi> must be
<hi>Chair-man,</hi>) He is falsly convicted of
this, or that Felony on himself;
and, most commonly if his Crime
or Disease be great, is sentenc'd
to die, and to be executed by tying a
Halter about his Arm, and afterward
to be stabb'd in it with a Lancet,
to draw off so much Bloud, until he
be Herring-dead. Another way of
execution they use, is to impale the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62337:18"/>
                  <hi>Sufferer</hi> with a Machine of Box or
Ivory, being in nothing different
from a Clyster-pipe; and this to be
used so oft, until it comes out at
his mouth: or, if this fails, to order
such <hi>la Voisine</hi> Drenches to be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down his throat, which may do
them the good service to stifle the
<hi>Sufferer</hi>'s (<hi>aura Vitalis</hi>) vital flame
in a few days. The <hi>Sufferer,</hi> since
it is for Treason he hath committed
against himself, after he is dead,
(it's well, if, to make sure work,
it is not done before) is to be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
(which in their phrase, is
called <hi>opening the Body,</hi>) and his
Bowels taken out, under pretence of
making inspection what Disease the
<hi>Sufferer</hi> dyed of; but, in truth, it's
more oft to be satisfied in the effects
of their bleedings, and deleterious
Draughts, and which of the Noble
Parts were most injured. But, lest
you should suspect this Paragraph a
Burlesque of Partiality, which <hi>re
vera</hi> is the greatest Truth, it shall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62337:18"/>
be made plain to you from their
undue way of Education, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
Ignorance, thus imposing
upon the Vulgar, by the strength
of a pretended Priviledge, and their
mutual combination to defraud the
unwary of their Lives. I shall leave
this subject a while, and proceed on
the fore-mentioned <hi>Sufferer</hi>'s Case.</p>
               <p>§ 5. He was surprized on <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
(preceding the Bills) upon
drinking a large draught of <hi>bottl'd-Ale,</hi>
to quench his droughth,
(which his walking into a sweat in
a very hot day had much augmented)
with a coldness and shivering, sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
at his Stomach, pain in his
Head, and weariness all over his
Body, which in some few hours
turn'd into a smart or violent heat,
whereunto, upon some interval of
time, a moderate Sweat was subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.
His Urin did not exceed the
colour of Amber, and the Sediment
thin and scattered; His Respiration
answered his Pulse, which was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62337:19"/>
some what swift, large and high,
and not very unequal in motion;
His Age was some few years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Forty, which, together with
the soundness of his Entrails, his
carnous, plethorick, hail and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
Constitution, seem'd strong
enough to have struggl'd with a far
greater Disease, than this ordinary
Autumnal Distemper.</p>
               <p>It was named by his men of Physick,
<hi>the new Disease:</hi> a name of ignorance,
or their accustomed <hi>Asylum ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi>
to which they take their refuge,
when they know not what the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease
is, or what to call it. One time
they shall tell you, it is an <hi>Ague;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it is a <hi>Feavor;</hi> a third, it's an
<hi>Ague and Feavor;</hi> a fourth, it's <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
and Ague;</hi> a fifth, it's <hi>the new
Disease:</hi> a denomination so idle,
that every Novice in Physick might
well suspect they had never read
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> or <hi>Galen;</hi> specially, upon
observing, that every Autumnal
or Epidemick Distemper is by them
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62337:19"/>
termed <hi>new:</hi> whereas, the gentle
<hi>Pox</hi> excepted, there is not any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all those they have nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>new Diseases,</hi> but what is amply
described in many ancient Authors.</p>
               <p>§ 6. The consequence of mistakes
in Diseases is so obvious, even to
the most obtuse judgments, that
it's received for a mathematical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
<hi>If the Doctor hath mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
my Distemper, I am a dead
man, or in danger of being so,</hi> And
rather than the Doctor will espouse
his errour in that point, or permit
another (of more sense or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience)
to be called in upon him,
whereby his Reputation may in the
least punctilio be shock'd, or his
Fees abated, Thou, and a Thousand
more, shall be posted away to the
Subterranean Mansions, where all
things shall be forgotten, and thy
evidence against the said Physician
wholly cancell'd. Such is the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Avarice, and Barbarian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of some Physicians, whom
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62337:20"/>
Authority and Law do shelter from
all manner of Accusations, Scandal,
or Reproach.</p>
               <p>The matter of this Paragraph is
not so intricate, but you may easily
be induced to believe, that where so
many Thousands do yield their last
Breath to Diseases, in themselves
not mortal, it must be imputed to
errour in judgment of your Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian;
which, how frequent that
is, an instance or two of some vogued
Physicians will render a satisfaction
more ample. It was Dr. <hi>B.</hi> Pr. of <hi>C</hi>—(a
person sufficiently known) who
gave me the recital of this following
Case, at the house of Mr. <hi>I. M.</hi>
Surg—. A Gentleman, mov'd
through care for the recovery of his
(neither sick nor well) Daughter,
was l'aps'd into that stupidity of
sense, as to believe it was in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Dr.—to restore her: Upon
notice given him, he appears at the
Bed-side of the Sufferer, where
feeling her Pulse large and quick,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62337:20"/>
and discerning her Skin sprinkl'd
with a numerous train of red Spots
and Blotches, very gravely pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
his immature deliberation;
<hi>(viz.) That the Sufferer</hi>'s <hi>Life
was in more than ordinary danger,
through the</hi> almost Pestilential <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
that her great Feavor mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
by those red Tokens:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
time was to be taken by the
fore-top, and she immediately to
take her recourse to strong Cordials,
a great many Bed-cloaths, and a
warm Room, to expel the malignity.
So imminent a Danger, such great
Remedies, offer'd by so eminent a
Physician, (<hi>oibo!</hi>) could not but
be recompenced by a great Fee.
The prevalence of these Physick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulls
acquired no other repute, than
maintaining the Distemper in the
same tone and tenour, or rather,
adding to it what they most feared:
which gave occasion to the sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Parent of the tender Matron,
upon a fortuitous meeting of Dr. <hi>B.</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62337:21"/>
(the Relator of these) to exhibit
his complaint of the rudeness of
the Distemper, and the inefficacy
of Medicines. The Doctor, upon a
full hearing of the circumstances,
found he had no cause for condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
but rather congratulating him,
in the secure estate his Daughter was
in; insinuating, that the hazard
of the Disease was much less, than
of the Remedies prescribed by the
dictates of a deceived opinion in
the first Doctor, of the Disease,
and its malignity; the Distemper
proving no other than a <hi>diaria plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium
dierum,</hi> or a <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bris Synocha
imputris,</hi> (commonly so called
among practical Authors) occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the ebullition of a plethorick
mass of humours, which being by
frequent rapid motions and pulsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
too much rarified and subtilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
overflowed the banks of its
Vessels, and being diffused into the
minute creeks of the ambient <hi>Cutis,</hi>
(or Skin) appeared in the shap<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62337:21"/>
of the recited Spots and Blotches;
deserving no other name than meer
efflorescencies of the Skin. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of this Theory, the practick
was easily chalk'd out; (<hi>viz.</hi>) That
the kindling and inflaming Cordial-Spirits
were to be abandoned, the
great burthen of Coverlets taken
off, and the temperature of the Air
in the Room moderated; the success
whereof was manifested in a sudden
recovery of her former health, to the
great disappointment of so contrary
course as was ordered by the other.</p>
               <p>§ 7. It is from hence I can be
easily persuaded, that, how great an
Idol soever a Fellow is set up by the
Vulgar, from the false suggestion of
Dog-fleying, he shall never arrive
to a sagacity of distinguishing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
unless he hath <hi>from the
beginning</hi> been train'd up to it, by
the conduct of able Professors at
home and abroad, and frequently
visited Hospitals in several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys.
Moreover, as in the Art of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62337:22"/>
Writing, Painting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Engraving,
the well forming of the first Letters,
Lin<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ments or Figures, prepares an
apt disposition in the young Scholar
to receive the just impressions of the
Habit or Art, whence he shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
be stiled a good Writer,
Painter, or Engraver: So, unless
the intended young Physician shall
be endued with an apt disposition;
1. To attain the Languages, that
render the recorded Rules and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems
of the ancient and modern
Physicians intelligible unto him;
2. To be gradually instructed in
Philosophy, as well <hi>Machanick</hi> as
<hi>Peripatetick;</hi> also, in the several
parts of Theoretick Physick; as, in
the Nature and Constitution of the
Body of Man, where true Anatomy
bears so great a part; in the signs,
whereby to distinguish the natural
and counternatural state of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and to presage the event and issue
of the latter; to know the faculties
of all sorts of Food, Flesh, Fish,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62337:22"/>
Herbs, Air, Water, Drinks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
3. To have discover'd to him the
means whereby Diseases, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
and external, may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and to that purpose, to be
acquainted with the faces of Herbs,
Drugs, Minerals, Animals, or,
summarily, the whole <hi>materia Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica;</hi>
their Choice, Prices, Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
likewise, all Chyrurgical
Instruments, and their uses; in fine,
it's necessary be should be a perfect
Theoretick and Practick Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Chymist, and Chyrurgeon:
And because he should not want
that which puts almost the last hand
to render him a Physician, (all
others, tho' they have clamber'd
up to a Degree, are little different
from Mountebanks, or Man-slayers)
he is to be very well grounded in
the true method of Physick, or order
of applying proper Remedies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
and external, to Diseases, in
their just time and <hi>Doses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 8. And now, after all this <hi>appara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62337:23"/>
we will suppose our Infant-Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
so compleatly dress'd up with
these fore-noted School and Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick
Ornaments, and his mind so
gaudily painted and daub'd with the
ancient, uncertain, and some new tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling
notions in Medicine, that you
may hear the clapper of his Tongue
eccho from the East to the West-gate
of your Town; Yet, introduce him
to a Patient, and grant that he, by
appuising or resting his Velvet-Body
on his <hi>Iapan</hi> Crutch, and fixing his
Intellect, by drawing the broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brimm'd
Beaver over his eyes, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to mimick a decrepid Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and by that to weigh himself
down to the bottom of your Belly,
to rummage for the Disease; when
he wakes (for he has only been in's
dumps) out of this brown study,
he shall no more know the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or the cause of it, (though
he hath read it in Authors twenty
times) than the Skipper that never
was toss'd on the Ocean before, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62337:23"/>
to find out <hi>Bermudas</hi> by his
<hi>Waggenaer;</hi> Nevertheless doth he
adventure to call for Paper and Ink,
to figure down a Remedy he never
saw before, being only acquainted
with the bare Name of it. This
you are to swallow, and to render
your Body the subject, whereout he
is to dig his experience, at the cost of
your Health, Life, and Estate. When
by his Book-applications he shall thus
have brought your crazy Tenement
(and, probably, of Hundreds more,) to
the ground, the World that consists
chiefly of the Vulgar, will then,
from the calculation of his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
experience, (though never
so unfortunate) entitle him <hi>a most
skilful Doctor,</hi> and in flocks volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
surrender their Bodies to his
torture. Likewise the Rich and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
who take the measures of their
sentiments of the Physicians capacity
from the crowd of his business, (that
profession being wholly out of the
horizon of their judgment) shall
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62337:24"/>
accost him with the same temerity.
If unto this you shall add, that he
is a great Anatomist (which perhaps
appears no other than a Dog-fleyer,
or a Calfs-head-Dissector) and that
he hath scribl'd a Treatise of the
Heart, Lungs, Brains, Womb, or
some<note n="*" place="margin">I mean Treatise.</note> other Entrail,
(though of no use) that
he is Member of a Herd of learned
Q—ks, Renegado-Divines, School-masters,
Apothecaries, and Barbers,
(a rare hodge-potch of Physicians!)
or that he is drawn about streets in
his own Coach: these suggestions
shall prove a far more alluring bait
for the unwary sick people to be
caught by.</p>
               <p>§ 9 In conclusion, the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
School and Academick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes
(though absolutly necessary)
without which none can arrive to the
name of a Dogmatick or Rational
Physician; yet thereby is little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
beyond the Verge of a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
man, and so notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62337:24"/>
must and doth fill Church-yards
the best part of his life-time. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that which is the Soul of a
Physician, and animates those prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Dispositions, (for Theory is
no other) is <hi>Sagacity</hi> and <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The former is in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
Natural, though improved by
Art, and whereby a Physician doth
with great facility discover a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
its Causes, and proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.
<hi>Observation</hi> is that, which
confirms him in such discoveries, and
the election of Method and Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and particularly in his Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticks.
Now, upon application
of this Discourse to two or three
hundred Physicians, you shall scarce
find six, that can justly pretend to the
Title of a good Physician, or whose
Education doth hardly qualify them
to be rendred such. Besides all this,
suppose a Physician to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht
in all the parts of his Art, if
he be covetous, negligent, disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
or uncharitable, he is more
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62337:25"/>
capable of defrauding you of your
Health, Life, and Money, without
danger of being discovered, than
one that is ignorant, and un-expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced.
These considerations do
move a pity and compassion
towards such, that being Persons
of integrity and honesty do fall
under the hands of covetous, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent,
dishonest, or uncharitable
Physitians; and adding thereunto,
that they are insufficiently Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
ignorant, in-sagacious, and
in-expert (as most are) in what
a desperate case are their Patients?
But the matter is not much; the
greater part of humanity (I should
say inhumanity) not deserving a
good Medicine, Method, or Care
of a good Physician.</p>

               <p>§ 1. OBservation speaks this
truth; He that dwelleth
a long time upon any particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory
part of Physick, seldom
or never arrives to a considerable
proficiency in his Art; so that He
that shall (beyond the necessary and
competent knowledge in Anatomy,
Botany, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Trifle away that
season, wherein a young Students
intellectuals are in their prime and
vigour, upon mangling of Piggs,
Cats, Dogs, and Plucks; or upon
gazing and muzling seven years
upon a Hedge, Ditch, or Banks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
to enquire for new Faces of
Plants and Herbs, which the petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy
of the Earth doth thrust forth,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62337:26"/>
to consume its excrementitious moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,

thereout form such Herbs, which
Nature never intended for the
health of man, but probably for
Garniture of the Fields, or to poison
Worms, Moles, Flyes, and other
Insects, that destroy Corn, Roots,
Herbs and such Vegetables, which
God hath provided for humane use.
I say, that neither out of such an
Anatomist, or such a Botanist,
seldom or never grew a good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian;
no otherwise than one who
has amused himself with the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
of Colours, Lights, Opticks,
Pensils, and Brushes, to an excessive
waste of his time, and applyeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to drawing of Figures, and
afterwards to Painting; this Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stique
must necessarily miss his aim
of ever being a Painter, or Limner;
because the time, wherein his parts
were most capable of improvement,
was neglected, and diverted by a
curiosity of attaining a knowledge,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62337:26"/>
beyond what was necessary for his
Art.</p>
               <p>§ 2. But to speak in terms more
plain; the necessary point of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy
consists chiefly in the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament,
Figure, Situation, connexion,
action, and use of the parts; and
not in superfluous, incertain, and
probably false, and indemonstrable
niceties, practised by those, that
flea Dogs and Cats, dry, roast,
bake, parboil, steep in Vinegar,
Lime-water, or <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> Livers,
Lungs, Kidneys, Calves brains, or
any other entrail, and afterwards
gaze on little particles of them
through a Microscope, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
false appearances are glanced
into their eyes, these to obtrude to
the World in Print, to no other
end, than to beget a belief in people,
that they who have so profoundly
dived into the bottomless pores of
the parts, must undeniably be skilled
in curing their distempers: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
those pretended Anatomical Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62337:27"/>
who have so belabour'd, and
tortur'd the particular parts, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
the least knowing in the
whole body of Anatomy; and the
Situation, Connexion, and Action of
the parts. On the other hand, there
is scarce any Physician, who hath had
a due education beyond Sea, but is
abundantly more knowing (even
beyond what is necessary) in the
<hi>Anatomy</hi> of all the parts of the body
of man, than any of these particular
pretenders.</p>
               <p>§ 3. I would enquire, what doth
it signify to assert, that all Muscles
have two bellies, or are biventered?
Which is false, and the erroneous
appearance proceeded, either from
over-boyling the Dogs Muscles (and
then many more Bellies might have
appeared) or was occasioned by disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
an old withered Curr, whose
Muscles are generally full of wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckles,
which might have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for so many <hi>venters</hi> of Muscles
by such an Anatomist.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62337:27"/>
And what doth it import, to lay
claim to the invention of Transfusion
of Sheeps bloud into the Veins of
a Man (though discovered long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
or to measure what propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of bloud passed the Heart in a

must likewise prove false, in

                  </gap>n blood much more than others.</p>
               <p>My opinion is, that the Studying
the Anatomy of all the parts of the
body, as much as is necessary, the
being well grounded in the Institutes
of Physick, Surgery, Pharmacy, and
Chymistry, and the frequenting
Hospitals abroad under the conduct
of experienced Professors, to manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
him as it were into Practice;
this I say, would have been a way
much more honest, and ingenuous,
than by a specious pretence in Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy,
(being very deficient in the
other parts of Physick) to insnare
and decoy the unwary vulgar, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62337:28"/>
others, to defraud them of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and too oft through unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to ruine their Health, destroy
their bodies, and at last whirl'em
out of their lives. And yet to my
great amazement, with satisfaction
to their Friends and Visiters, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that their death was inevitable,
since the Anatomical Doctor was
here concerned, (though) if at the
same time, a real accomplisht Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
had procured their Recovery,
it would have been judged a Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
easily curable; so that you may
hereby discern, some Physicians get
a greater reputation by killing, than
others by curing. But this shall be
evidently proved to you, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress

Situation of the Entrails, and the
ramifications of the Nerves, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
and Veins, so that now he is
advanced to be the Bell-weather, I
should have said, carries the Bell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the Fraternity; among
whom a man must look with a
Candle and Lanthorn to find one
more ignorant and less skilful; for
sure I am, there is not a Hangman
in Foreign parts, but knows the
structure of the Joints as perfectly
as the Gallows; there is scarce a
Butcher that deals in Hogs-flesh, but
is most exquisite in the Situation of
the Entrails; and for the Figure and
position of the Muscles, and the
dissemination of the Veins and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
Painters are excellently skill'd
in; now must it needs follow among
these three Anatomists, that the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62337:29"/>
Hangman is the best Bone-setter,
the Butcher the best Wound-healer,
and the Painter the best bleeder,
and opener of Imposthumes?</p>
               <p>§ 2. But since the Parisian vulgar
from such erroneous premisses draws
so false a conclusion, I do pretend to
conduct them into a better sort of
reasoning, thereby to divert them
from following a Bell-weather Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
to his Slaughter house.</p>
               <p>Anatomy is no further necessary
to a Surgeon, than the knowledge
of the nature of wood to a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or of Stone to a Stone-cutter;
Therefore the Situation and Figure
of the Bowels, the ramification of
the Vessels, and the position of
the Muscules, being well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by a Surgeon, is of absolute
necessity, and what further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
he is pleased to make in that
science, as it is to him ornamental
only, so it cuts off from that time,
which ought to be imploy'd; 1. In
knowing the Nature, Kinds, Causes
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62337:30"/>
and Signs of Wounds, Ulcers, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
Imposthumes, Fractures, Dislo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And 2. In reading the
Practical Observations of the most
Famed Surgeons, as those of <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
Hildanus, Felix Wurtz, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetus,</hi>
and many others. 3. In knowing
all or most Chyrurgical Instruments,
and their uses, the numerous sorts
of Bandages, Oyls, Unguents,
Plasters, Cataplasms, the various
dressings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. And chiefly, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituating
himself to a dexterity in
making use of all the most necessary
Chyrurgical Instruments, in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of all external Medicines,
Bandages, and Dressings, and in the
reposing of Fractures, and Disloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and from this Fourth parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
(intimating all the kinds of
Manual Operations in reference to
the external Diseases of Man) it is
the name of a Chyrurgion (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
or manual operation) is
properly derived, being the very
summary of Chyrurgery, and whence
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62337:30"/>
he doth principally intitle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to his profession. To this last he
is to arrive, by the instruction and
example of his own, and several
other good Masters; by serving in
several Hospitals at home and
abroad, where the rarest of cases
may occur; and by his own practice
in Armies, or Fleets at Sea. And
after all, this cannot be attained
without a natural Sagacity in his
mind, and an aptness and natural dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in his Hands. How few
good Surgeons there are to be found,
may easily be judged by what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised;
yet it is very probable,
there are more in <hi>England,</hi> than else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <p>§ 3. I have here laid down a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
by which we may soon fathom
this <hi>Bell-weather,</hi> and where in the
conclusion he will scarce appear to
be so much as the half quarter of a
Surgeon; so that this Anatomical
device can be termed nothing but
decoy, Fraud, or cheat upon the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62337:31"/>
                  <hi>deceptile vulgus:</hi> Who possibly may
reply, <hi>Volenti non fit injuria;</hi>
whereunto must be re-joyn'd, <hi>deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatur
ergo vulgus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 4. He that could never arrive
to so much dexterity of hand, to
manage a Lancet, or to a proportion
of Judgment to direct him, how
deep and how long the Orifice is to
be in the opening a Vein, can never
by men of sence be determined fit
to use the Knife in cutting the Stone,
amputating of Members, opening
Impost humes in difficult places, and
in performing many other subtiler
operations; certainly such a one,
who hath so often failed in a piece
of the little Surgery, as Phlebotomy,
practised with success by every Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
Boy, and Surgery-woman,
cannot pretend so much to the name
of a Manual Operator, as a Farrier, a
Cowleech, or a Sow-gelder.</p>
               <p>§ 5. To say such a man is a very
good Surgeon, but he cannot bleed
well, is as much nonsence, as to tell
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62337:31"/>
me, such a one is a very good Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
but draws his stroaks crooked;
and indeed there be many crooked
arms to be seen at this day, that
were occasion'd by an ill stroak of this
Bell-weathers Lancet; among the
rest that were husht and stifled, two
instances could not be kept from the
ears and eyes of the publick; the one
was a largely Tumefied Arm of a
Gentleman of the Law, accompanied
with inexpressible pain, Feaver,
upon this several Imposthumations,
a Gangrene, and Putrid sordid Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
which required deep Scarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
Cutting, Slashing, besides a
vast expence of money distributed
among those, that were called in as
Assistants: the torture endured for
three or four months, and a serious
debate at last about cutting off his
Arm; and all this occasion'd by the
unskilful puncturing the Median
Vein, together with the Tendon of
the <hi>Biceps Muscul</hi> near it; which
error he would not have escaped,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62337:32"/>
had he used the ridiculous blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided
Lancet of an Anatomical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
unless the point had been
blunt likewise; and then how it is
to be used, I know not. <hi>Sit ut sit;</hi>
The Ulcers were incarn'd, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catriz'd
at last, but not without
leaving so ill an impression, and so
great weakness on the Bowels, by
gleets suck'd into the circulating
mass, that in some time after they
were incapable of resisting a small
Feaver, that gave him a traverse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the other Hemisphere; but it was
after a year and a day. However
that expression might very well
have been forborn, since there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
no premeditated malice in
the Surgeon, unless you will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
malice in prae-designing getting
of money, by the cure of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
or in another case, by a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
persuasion of a Patient to be
cut of the Stone, on purpose for the
gaining of twenty Pistols or Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.
The Operation was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62337:32"/>
upon the Staff, (that is, with
the <hi>Apparatus major</hi>) the Knife
forced into the membranous part of
the Bladder, too high by an inch,
the lower part, (which is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
with carnous Fibres, being
the proper place;) but no Stone
was to be found in this Quarry;
however a Gangrene survenes upon
the wound, and the party was
bubbl'd out of his Life. The Carcass
being open'd, a Callosity was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
near the <hi>Sphincter,</hi> where the
<hi>Catheter</hi> commonly stopped, which
was one imaginary sign of the
Stone, and the other a difficulty,
and a partial suppression of Urin
upon a violent Cold, throwing Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
to the Bladder, too much
weakned by frequent hurts, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from being Probed by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theter,</hi>
whence also the callosity
proceeded. This Narrative to me
savours of ignorance in the Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative,
unskilfulness in the Practick,
and Avarice in the Mind, (<hi>viz.</hi>)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62337:33"/>
of adding twenty Pistols to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony;
which is <hi>Vivitur Ingenio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 6. It was not a mischance,
which is meerly fortuitous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
but a continuation of
his unskilfulness, that attended the
dismal and barbarous <hi>Lithotomy,</hi> or
cutting the Stone on a Child of the
Steward belonging to the Duke of—
who within few days with misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
out-cries and tortures left this
World, without leaving any visible
cause in his Bladder, for which he
was thus mangled; however here
was another addition of twenty
Pistols more. Abundance of these
examples can be produced; but
what is this to the stabbing the
Knife into the <hi>Perinaeon,</hi> and wholly
missing the Bladder, and then by
repeating his stroak once or twice,
to cause a mortal wound?</p>
               <p>§ 7. Can it be termed any thing
but the most Butcherly unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to cut a young Nobleman,
and that (if I am not misinformed,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62337:33"/>
therefore will not be positive) upon
the gripe too, and leave an Ulcer,
that turn'd into a <hi>Fistuld,</hi> whence
to this hour a constant dribbling
doth follow him?</p>
               <p>§ 8. Another part of this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is the extracting the Stone,
wherein his errour is as obvious,
breaking the Stone in the Bladder,
lacerating those tender membranous
parts in the extraction, and leaving
pieces behind, whence the pains have
afterwards accrew'd greater than
before, the Stone being become an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
and in a short interval aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
to its former bigness.</p>
               <p>The total is, that I cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
but four in five do miscarry,
and sometimes the whole number.</p>
               <p>§ 9. The Venereal practice is
another considerable branch of his
Chyrurgical exercise, where if we
track him, we shall find a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Gentlemen, bestowing curses
upon him, for running them into
the <hi>Pox,</hi> from very insignificant
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62337:34"/>
                  <hi>Gonorrhea's, Buboes,</hi> and <hi>Shankers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 10. The most manifest errour
in the least of these accidents
(though the consequence is no
less than a tedious long Cure, a
<hi>Fistula, Pox,</hi> or too oft loss of
life) is committed in his opening a
Veneral <hi>Bubo,</hi> when the one part
is scarce soft, and suppurated, and
the other hard and in digested;
the reason is obious, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in this Maxime, <hi>Pus ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat
Pus, Matter begets Matter.</hi>
Like unto an Apple, that's partly
rotten, where, if the rotten is
suffered to continue, in a short time
converts the whole Apple into a
rotten substance; but being sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
the remainder is much longer
rotting: And by the same reason,
or maxime above mentioned, it
appears, that a Cataplasme of rotten
Apples mixt with boil'd Onions, is
a very excellent suppurative.</p>
               <p>§ 11. This is not all, the Orifice
he made so large, that it extended
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62337:34"/>
from one side of the <hi>Bubo,</hi> to the
other, giving the Taylors reason for
it, that he loved to see his work
before him. But what follows?
The cold nitrous Air entring, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the remaining immaturated
part like to a Stone, putrefieth the
soft moist substance of the Glanduls
underneath, besides their being the
Sink of the Bowels, and consequently
subject to receive the putrid noxious
humours, that are thrown down
from them, no part of the body
being more tender, and apt to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefy
than Glanduls. Of necessity
this Ulcer was to be kept open,
until the fore-mentioned hardness
was converted into Matter, whilst
in the <hi>interim,</hi> Cataracts of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
were thrown down, by which
turning into a corrupt matter, and
<hi>Sordes,</hi> all the tender flesh was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd,
the little white Vessels of
the Glanduls corroded, and the
great Veins expos'd to view; which
must prove very dangerous. In fine,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62337:35"/>
in spight of all Purges, Vomits, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livations,
and other Revulsions, three
quarters of a year scarce accomplisht
a cicatrization, without leaving a
<hi>Fistula,</hi> and a continual gleet. This
and many more which I have seen,
might in four days, or somewhat
longer, after a compleat suppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
have been brought to a safe
and sound cicatrize. But then our
Anatomical Spark would have failed
an opportunity, of amplifying his
Stock with Thirty or Forty Pistols
or Guineys.</p>
               <p>§ 12. The Objection is futil, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
in the case fore-mentioned,
that where Matter is lockt up, it
makes Caverns, <hi>Sinus,</hi> and <hi>Fistula</hi>'s;
For as Nature is most potent inwards,
so likewise is intent upon her own
Preservation, the thicker part of
the Matter being better digested,
consequently milder, less corosive,
and glutinous or slymy, she converts
into a membranous substance, by the
heat which is most vigorous within
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62337:35"/>
next the flesh, to defend it; and
the thinner part that is corroding,
a crimonious and ichorous, she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudes
towards the ambient skin,
where through its putrid acid Salts
it gradually corrodes, and perforates
the skin. Hence you may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
your self with the true reason,
why most external Tumours, when
turn'd into Imposthumes, most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
break outwardly, and not
one in a Million inwardly.</p>
               <p>§ 13. To give you a further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Natures self preservation.
Suppose some excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
(almost homogeneous) col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
in the breast, in a short time
by its heat dryeth the circumference
of those humours, into a <hi>Coat, or Tunic,</hi>
(which among Surgeons is called a
<hi>Cystis</hi>) to preserve other parts from
further annoyance. Now the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
humours cannot be converted
into Matter, because they are in a
manner homogenous, and so Nature
secures them from doing any further
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62337:36"/>
hurt, by locking them up in a <hi>Cystis:</hi>
Thus a <hi>Steatoma, Meliceris,</hi> and
<hi>Atheroma,</hi> are engendred.</p>
               <p>§ 14. True it is, where the Air
entring in at the Orifice of an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthume,
or hollow Ulcer, shall have
putrefy'd or corrupted the appelling
humours in the most remote part
of the said Ulcer, or Imposthume,
into an acrimonious and corroding
<hi>Pus,</hi> by keeping it open too long,
or by applying Medicines, that are
ineffectual, contrary, or putrefying
and unctuous, or by negligence in
dressing, or by unskilfulness in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
and bandage, there it's
absolutely requisite, the Orifice
should be enlarged, or another made,
that's near the cavern, where Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
may lurk, to the end that the
said Matter may be deterged, and
the vitiated temperament of that
part corrected; unless he is skill'd
in Injections, that are proper, or
other Medicines, whose steem may
reach, and penetrate to the most
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62337:36"/>
retired and abscond cunicle of an
Ulcer; for such Medicines there
are.</p>
               <p>Another Observation of great
importance is, that all Ulcers near
Glanduls, by being kept open too
long, turn Cancerous, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
incurable.</p>
               <p>Tumors collected in a cold part,
as suppose about the Tonsils, or any
other Glanduls, and tending to
suppuration, if opened never so
little too early, though they seem
sufficiently absterged, and afterwards
consolidated, yet they are very apt
to be recollected, and appear again
about the same season the year
following, and this for several
years successively; because there
was some small part of the humour
left indigested, and hardned (by
the nitrous Air entring at the Orifice)
which afterwards doth become a
Seminary, or Ferment (as others
will have it) by length of time
converting the appelling humours
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62337:37"/>
into its own Nature, whereby at
last a new Tumour is ingendred:
Therefore except some great urgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
(as suffocation) doth indicate
apertion by puncture, or incision,
it's much more advisable, to give
Nature her own time in breaking
the said Imposthume, there being
no fear, that by such delay any
<hi>Cuniculi</hi> or caverns will be made,
the reason whereof I have already
given you in the foregoing Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs.</p>
               <p>§ 15. As I ushered in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with an animadversion of an
errour in the little Surgery, <hi>viz.</hi>
Phlebotomy, so I shall conclude it
with another of the same kind,
acted by the <hi>Idem</hi> Operator, who
being sent for to a Gentleman of
Quality, of the T— to
open a Vein, pierced his Tool so
deep, that the Neighbouring Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
received a considerable pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
which caused it immediately
to contract it self into the hardness
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62337:37"/>
and unevenness of a Cord, attended
with a most unquiet jactitating
<hi>Fever,</hi> and a pain almost impatible.
I being called to advise, what was
to be done in this Tragical case, was
not of opinion, that as the Wound
made by a <hi>Scorpion</hi> was to be remedied
by applying the same <hi>Scorpion</hi> to it,
so the same Surgeon ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to heal his own Wounds; But
another whose knowledge and skill
were sufficiently known to me, was
to be imployed, to whom I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
what external Medicines his
Pledgets were to be armed with,
and what Emplaster to be super-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
leaving the application and
Bandage to himself, by which
means the Patients Arm was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured in Six or Eight days.</p>
               <p>§ 16. The occasion of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward
bleeding, was the distor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Vein by the Bandage
towards the Tendon, so that they
lay as it were Perpendicular; whereas
had the Vein here by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62337:38"/>
been drawn a little from the
Tendon, a Blind man could not
have acted the least mischief. Now I
hope you are convinced, that a
pretence to <hi>Anatomy</hi> is a meer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coy,
Trap, Delusion, and Imposture,
I shall supersede that Argument, and
before I return to the place where
I deviated, I will only take off the
amaze, why I should fetch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<hi>Anatomical</hi> Surgeon from
<hi>Paris</hi> hither, and thus descant upon
him, to whose Face and Speech I
am wholly a Stranger, though not to
his ill success, and <hi>male Practice;</hi>
all which I do franckly tell you,
proceeds only from an innate prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of discovering Falacies and
Deceits put upon the vulgar, that
have no rule or measure to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
a Meteor in Physick or Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgery
from such, that without
mutuating from others, are indu'd
with all the necessary accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Learning and Experience,
that are required in an Artist.</p>

<hi>Cracks,</hi> have insinuated this <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymeme</hi>

to imbibe such knotty My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
it's not improbable, they
might much easier suck up the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence

this Category belonged that famed
Doctor of <hi>Norw.</hi> who being Posted
away from his House with a Coach
and Four to a Sick Gentleman in
the Countrey, an unhappy gawdy
<hi>Butterfly</hi> thwarted the Coach, upon
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62337:39"/>
which a halt was made, and the
Doctor with the assistance of the
Coach-driver, hunted so long, until
they had him under the broad
brimm'd Beaver. Here an <hi>harangue</hi>
was to be made to his conducting
Auditor upon the admirable Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
Shape, Organs, and colours
of the <hi>Butterfly,</hi> particularly upon the
transparent yellow, of which colour
a Cap would better have fitted him
than the black Velvet one. The But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-fly
being cag'd up in a Box, and
reserv'd to a further consideration,
the Journey was pursu'd, at the end
whereof the Doctor found the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

               <p>§ 2. But the industrious Craft most
in use among the Pedantry of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
is the sending forth of
Emissaries, that are in acquaintance
with any of Note, whose misfortune
it is to lie under a main course
prescribed by others. To these is
to be intimated that such a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
(meaning him from whom
they have their Credentials) hath
in a very short interval cur'd such
and such of the same Distemper; and
<hi>argumentum ad hominem</hi> to the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
who thereupon with much
impatience expects the new Doctor,
by whom several slie <hi>Items</hi> are given
of mistakes committed by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Physick-man. Now the new
Broom is to sweep clean those chinks
and corners, which the other never
took notice of; and therefore, upon
revolving in mind, what hath been
hitherto exhibited by his Predecessor
without effect, concludes, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62337:40"/>
contrary to the former must
necessarily operate some alteration or
other, and that sometimes with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.
A sort of argumentation that

nothing remaining but the charming

§ 3. An authentick Copy of a
transaction of this nature we had
four or five years since, in the
sickness of a chief Magistrate of
<hi>Paris,</hi> languishing under a slow Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
(<hi>Febris lenta</hi>) arising from a
Scorbutick Dyscrasy of the Bloud,
and hypochondriack Obstructions,
whence proceeded his frequent sowr
Belchings and Vomitings. Fewer
than four or five first rate Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
could not be thought propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
to answer the quality of his
Person, or the danger of his Disease.
In this Consult the <hi>Senior</hi> was the
Demiculverin, that made most noise,
and according to whose prick'd
Song the rest were to tune their
Fiddles, that being no other than
the common Method of consultion.
<hi>Aqua Epidemica, Poeoniae Composita,
Spir. Cornu Cervi,</hi> and <hi>Salis Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniaci,</hi>
being some-what allay'd
with <hi>Simple Waters,</hi> and sweetned
with <hi>Syrup of Gillyflowers,</hi> were in
this Council determined Salutife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62337:41"/>
and to be repeated for two
months, sometimes interjecting a
Milk-Clyster, and a <hi>Diascordium Bolus,</hi>
not forgetting the Pearl-Cordial. The
Sufferer they found gave good Milk,
and therefore these <hi>Heroes</hi> fail'd not
coming for their Cream morning
and evening. The Patient now grown
dubious to what shoar his <hi>Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nautae</hi>
designed him, did readily
bend his ear to a she-visiter, that
display'd the colours most admirably
in favour of a <hi>Quidam Doctor,</hi> that
cured most desperate Diseases by
method and Remedies contrary to
the opinion of all others. <hi>Dictum
factum,</hi> a Coach brings him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
who (by the confederacy
of the Female Legate) could, upon
examining his Urine and Pulse, at
sight give him a scheme of all his
Pains, Symptoms, and Distempers,
even to the surprise of the wealthy
Seignior. The Remedies which were
too much in vogue among the Gang
of Physicians, he knew full well,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62337:41"/>
could be no other than hot burning
Cordials, such as plague-Water,
Spirit of <hi>Harts-Horn,</hi> and that
choaking, stinking Spirit of Piss.
These had inflamed and sharpned
his Bloud, tumbled and ruffled his
Spirits, and nourisht his Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
But be assured Sir, I will cure
you in as short a time, as I did
Mr. such, and such, who had been
ill handled in the same Distemper;
Therefore draw back your Curtains,
throw off the Blanckets, and set
open the Windows, you want
Air, you are stifled; clear the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all those Viols and Galley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots;
your Bloud needs Ventila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Contemperation, and Dulcifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
your Spirits must be quieted,
smoothed, and allayed. Here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
the course is steered dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically
contrary, heating Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
are to be changed for coolers,
<hi>Alcalies</hi> for <hi>Acides,</hi> and exalters of
the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the Bloud for <hi>Narcoticks</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Instead of those fiery Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62337:42"/>
I do recommend <hi>Pippin</hi> or a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Posset,</hi>
and a delicious Tincture
of <hi>Roses;</hi> take sometimes a draught
of the one, and sometimes of the
other; every second night drink
two or three Spoonfuls of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing
Cordial upon going to Bed,
it will compose you to rest, and
allay the tumult of your Spirits. The
issue proved successful. His Vomiting
was repelled, his drought extinguisht,
appetite restored, and strength
so recovered, that in a Fortnight
the dying <hi>Testator</hi> was congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Streets by those, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidently
met him, of his wonderful
retrieve out of the Jaws of <hi>Orcus.</hi>
But it's to be remarqued, that this
course was first intimated by one
Major <hi>W.</hi> and privately carried
to the Dr. who did not want craft
to make it his own, and by some
sly alteration wholly appropriate it
to his particular invention, which
occasioned the old Gentleman to
deify him in his Calender, and not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62337:42"/>
only forced him upon all his sick
acquaintance, but would send some
one or other of his Domesticks to
any afflicted with Distempers, where
he conceived the Authority of
his name might prevail, though
too many never survived the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
minute, to render his Worship
their due acknowledgement for his
over-officious care. So that it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the rule of contraries
in his case was only fortuitous and
empirical to his <hi>Medico,</hi> which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all peradventure to a good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
would have been of choise and
rational election; though such a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
as it is rarely to be used, so a
more than ordinary caution and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is to be observed by such, that
shall have occasion to imitate it.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Those, who shall have listed
themselves in the service of the
great God, and by assuming Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
distinguish themselves from
the Laity, exercising that most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Function, by Praying,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62337:43"/>
Preaching, and their exemplary
Life, and Conversation, to the
glory of their great Master, and the
saving of Souls from perdition; Those
I say, that shall do this only for
a time, until they have subdud the
Hearts and Inclinations of all, or
most of their Parishioners to their
own Service and Devotion then out
of I know not what pretended scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
of Conscience, shall out of ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
prove Renegadoes (<hi>Scelus hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendum!</hi>)
from the Divine Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
to the exercise of Physick, in
expectation of having all their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
to be their Patients, are of
all mankind to be abominated, as
being wholy incapable to arrive to
the least competency in that Art,
where so long Study and Experience
are required. And certainly those that
make use of such a <hi>Renegado</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
upon a sentiment, that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
will give a peculiar Blessing
to the endeavours of his <hi>quondam</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
who in reality appears to be a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62337:43"/>
meer Atheist, make a false conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
since Divine Justice cannot be
supposed, to return any other than
malediction, and confusion upon the
undertakings of all such, that shall
exchange his Eternal Celestial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for a Transitory Worldly Salary.</p>
               <p>§ 5. If you look for a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of the preceding Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph,
behold here is one out
of many. A <hi>Renegade</hi> Physician in
the Patrowl of his officious Visits,
drops into the House of a noted
<hi>Painter,</hi> who upon the usual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of, <hi>how does your Husband?</hi>
was thankfully answered by the
Wife, he had been attacked by an
<hi>Ague,</hi> but at present his Fits were so
much abated by the benefit of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
(a gentle looseness of three
or four Stools a day, carrying off
the humour as she thought,) that
they were scarce perceptible. Here
in the declination of the Disease,
thought the <hi>Renegade,</hi> was an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of getting Reputation,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62337:44"/>
and therefore in imitation of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
tertia Genesis,</hi> seduces the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
into the opinion, that the
<hi>Ague</hi>-fits would soon re-assume their
former vigour, unless some proper
Remedy was taken, wholly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
them, and that such a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
he was Master of, which in the
time of a <hi>Hixius Doxius,</hi> did infallibly
cure all intermittent <hi>Fevers.</hi> These
words falling with such a zeal from
the counterfeit holyman, induced the
woman (on whom as on all others,
the <hi>Imperative Mood</hi> doth devolve,
during the <hi>Inter-regnum</hi> of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
sickness) to use her coercive
power upon her sick Painter, who
must and should take, whatever he
prescribed. Six Doses of the <hi>Iesuits
Powder</hi> formed into Pills, were
mark'd down to be swallowed, Eight
Pellets every four hours. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
exhibition dammed up his
Looseness, and consequently the
Fits were raised to a higher pitch
than ever. Notwithstanding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62337:44"/>
Doses were advised with a
<hi>continuando,</hi> which stopping all the
avenues of Nature, and forcing
those excrementitious humours, that
Nature before had separated, and
thrown to the Guts, into the great
Vessels, the intermittent was now
turned into a continual <hi>Feaver,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with a great drought, black
Tongue, <hi>delirium,</hi> low Pulse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
This boistrous Hurricane threatning
nothing but Shipwrack of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents
life, and the Reputation
of the <hi>Revolted Divine:</hi> to save
the latter, he calls in the great
Warden of the Faculty, who to
recompence the courtesie the <hi>Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade</hi>
had done him, in giving him
the occasion of getting a <hi>Pistol-Fee,</hi>
could do no less, then on the spot
immediately to naturalize his spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Practice into Legitimate, by
declaring, that what had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by that worthy Physician,
nothing could be better, nothing
more proper. Now the Physick
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62337:45"/>
Doctor having received Pardon and
Absolution from the <hi>Papa Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicorum,</hi>
both agree in a consult to
give the Patient the last Unction by
their joynt-prescription of Cordials,
and the <hi>Diasinapios</hi> gargle; (by this
you know who was Pope) to disim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogue
his Throat, that was cram'd
up with tough viscous humours,
forced up by the <hi>Panacaean</hi> Bark;
though with a <hi>non obstante,</hi> in two or
three days the sufferer bids 'em both
<hi>Buenas noches.</hi> This was a Scene so
Tragical, that the poor Painter
never yet had expressed upon Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vas,
and less dream'd, he should
have been the principal Actor on
the Physicians <hi>Theatre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 6. Can it be imagined, that one
who had for several years moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Pulpit, should to increase
his Fame in Physick, be guilty of
so palpable an Imposture, as to
assert publickly, that by giving six
grains of <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Amber,</hi> he had
caused a Dropsical Patient to piss
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62337:45"/>
the measure of a Kilderkin? In short,
<hi>libera nos</hi> from those, that practise
Physick <hi>in Nomine Domini.</hi>

               <p>§ 1. THe Answer <hi>Capivac</hi> made
to his <hi>Polonian</hi> Scholar,
demanding his secrets in Physick,
that he should read his Method, and
then he would have his secrets, is by
many a Drone drawn into such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
that he conceives himself
abundantly Doctorated, when he
shall have muzzled some few months
in the Institutes of Physick, wherein
the <hi>Methodus Medendi</hi> is that part,
which puffs him up, and makes his
fingers itch to be doing with the
unfortunate Sick, that shall become
his first Patients. As then, so ever
after he is strongly opinionated, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62337:46"/>
the Method of applying those incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
stumps of Medicines and
Remedies, decipher'd in his <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi>
or <hi>Sennertus,</hi> is the Crown
of the work, which must, and
will advance him to be the <hi>Archia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of the Town. It is in this, that
one Fool doth value himself above
the other, because his Method is
different, and consequently in his
opiniatreness better. Hereof I will
give you a tast, that must necessarily

received Method of courting continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
putrid Feavers, which pleads an
antiquity of above two thousand
years, was not long since not so
little scorned by a Physician of the
faculty, as his newly invented one
much extolled, and the imitation
recommended to all others, though
by me no less admired, for not kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

Ger.</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> Next day after his
Devotion at <hi>Mass,</hi> upon his visit
finding him worse, interpreted by
him to happen, because he was not

caused him to swallow the same
Potion with an addition; Still worse
and worse, notwithstanding repeats
the same Purgative six or eight Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
successively; All his Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
persisted in the same tenure
of Malignity, until the Dr. had
given over Purging, and then much
ado abated, and at last the <hi>Sufferer</hi>
recovered.</p>
               <p>§ 2. The Moral this Methodist ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracts
from the preceding manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was, that Quotidian Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are <hi>adequate</hi> Remedies of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
continual <hi>Feavers;</hi> though
by me contrarywise constructed,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62337:47"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> That those daily evacuations
raised the ebullition of the Bloud,
hindred the digestion of humours,
prevented the transpiration of the
fuliginous malignant <hi>Salts</hi> through
the Pores, enraged the vital and
animal Spirits, and were the sole
cause that obstructed the Cure: a
tendency whereunto did not appear
before the <hi>Alexandrian Garthartick</hi>
was omitted. This young man had
more than <hi>Hercules</hi> in his Nature,
that could at once thus struggle
with two enemies, the <hi>Feaver,</hi> and
those Purges; and if any thing is
properly termed a Physicians trying
of Skill, Experiments, tricks, or
<hi>Impune ludere de corio humano,</hi> this
was. And if this be <hi>Methodus meden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi>
I desire to know of Mr. Dr. what
is the <hi>Methodus occidendi?</hi> However
not to rob him of the honour of the
first Inventor, I must do him Justice,
in Recording, that it was he, who
was first Author of exhibiting <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi>
in the Morning, and <hi>Diacodium</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:62337:47"/>
at Night against Hysterick vapours;
which Method did more than answer
his expectation, by raising a Saliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
several days after.</p>
               <p>§ 3. But I would have this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Doctor not be so arrogant, as
to engross all new Methods to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
since there are others of his
Brethren of the faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi>
who make much more noise than
himself, particularly the <hi>Doctor of
Contraries,</hi> who with <hi>Opium</hi> and
<hi>Iesuits-Powder</hi> shall make more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
sorts of passes at Diseases,
than ever any <hi>Roman</hi> Gladiator with
his Weapon; and these shall be
hits, and do execution. As for
instance, if the Doctor is applyed
unto, for his assistance against a
continual <hi>Feaver,</hi> according to his
last good or ill success in the like
case, gives his direction for blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
or omits it; then with an
unparalell'd assurance makes at the
Distemper with an ample Dose
of the <hi>Iesuits-Powder,</hi> pursuing
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62337:48"/>
this fierce onset with a fresh sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of the same Bark every fourth
hour; And finding the fiery adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
provoked, produces his other
Champion (<hi>Opium</hi>) to encounter
him: so between these two <hi>Bravo's,</hi>
frail Nature doth too oft lie down,
and yield, and the Patient is
brought to his <hi>ultimum vale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 4. The <hi>Small Pox,</hi> (a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
so unaccountable to most
Physicians, and therefore Empiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
treated, whence Nurses do
equally vie with their Worships in
the Cure) is by this <hi>Generalissimo</hi>
(contrary to all sence and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience)
countermined with Spirit
of <hi>Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Opium,</hi> by which
beyond all others he is infallible in
procuring an <hi>Euthanasia.</hi> Good God,
how the Universities do rob the
Plough! But <hi>a propos,</hi> let me
make an offer to this grand Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Medicine, if his humour
holds of making purchases upon the
lives of his Patients, I will <hi>bona fide</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:62337:48"/>
for one years purchase, sell him
Annuities upon the lives of all (or
none; for some Natures are so
robust, that nothing can subdue,
and therefore some few may escape)
he shall treat with the Bark and
<hi>Opium</hi> in continual <hi>Feavers,</hi> and
with <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
liquidum</hi> in the <hi>Small Pox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 5. Ships cannot be steered so
many various and contrary courses
by one Wind, as Physicians tumble
and toss the same Diseases by this
single part of Medicine, called <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</hi>
So here we have another of a
bouncing Fame, that ordered coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Juleps for a young Lady his
very near Neighbour, until the
<hi>Small Pox</hi> budded forth, then
bleeds her the day before she expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and commands to be given 60
drops of Spirits of <hi>Harts-horn,</hi> one
hour, and sixty drops of Spirits of
<hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> the other hour, and
so <hi>de hora in horam</hi> to be continued
in a few spoonfuls of a very brisk
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62337:49"/>
Cordial. This Method was persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in, until she died with some of
the Cordial in her Mouth. In case
of this Nature, I should prefer the
counsel of <hi>Celsus, That it is better
to let a Patient die, than to kill
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 6. The attendant that exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
the Drops, gave me this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and probably to make the
number of Drops seem more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious,
might express ten or
twelve Drops in a Dose more than
what was given; however, it was
a vast quantity. And the <hi>Catholick</hi>
Apothecary, to hush the matter,
kept the Receipts so close, that a
view could not be purchased at any
rate. The bleeding I presume was
advised to stop the <hi>Haemorrhage</hi> at
the Nose, and so two Taps set run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at once, must soon exhaust
the tender Cask.</p>
               <p>§ 7. It was an undaunted boldness
of Method, that lately inspired
another Physick Doctor, to give
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62337:49"/>
his Patient three or four Gobbets a
day, each mixt with Sixty, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
Seventy, sometimes Eighty,
and sometimes Ninety Grains of
<hi>Mercury Sublimate dulcis,</hi> and these
reiterated, until eight or nine Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Mercury</hi> was swallowed. It's
remarkable, that here was an half
ounce, five, and six Drams, that
is three hundred and sixty Grains of
<hi>Mercury Sublimate Dulcifyed,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<hi>Quick-silver,</hi> taken each four
and twenty hours.</p>
               <p>But I believe, your ears itch to
hear, for what it was the <hi>Sufferer</hi>
was condemned to this Penance, and
what became of him, being thus
tortured by the Physick <hi>Inquisition.</hi>
His crime was getting a small <hi>Shan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
which a Surgeons Boy had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully
cicatrized, without Purging
him more than once or twice. Four
or five months were scarce elaps'd,
but the malignity is mounted up
Stairs, and daubs his eye-brows, and
hairy scalp with crusty Scabs, being
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62337:50"/>
coverlids to little Ulcers underneath
them; a while after the sinful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
takes a carreer downwards,
and there on the lower part of the
<hi>tibia,</hi> intrenches within a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation
less than a Crown-piece,
mining into the Bone night and day,
and causing a most exquisite pain, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
nocturnal; then a Coach-keeping
Apothecary takes him to
task, and with Pill and Diet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
for a month or six weeks, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
all but the shin-pain, where
I should have told you, a <hi>Node</hi> was
risen. After this, the Coach-keeper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
the Patient up into the hands of
the fore mentioned <hi>Dottissimo &amp; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertissimo
medico delli incurabili,</hi> who
leads him a dance of <hi>Mercury.</hi> What
new steps and Coupees the Doctor
made in this Courant <hi>laverole,</hi> I
have already given you a Breviate.
Nothing remains, but to acquaint
you with the intended burden of the
Song, and that was by raising a
Salivation, to cast out the <hi>Beelz-bub.</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:62337:50"/>
Know therefore, that the <hi>Mercury</hi>

some days had none; neither did
the Patient salivate. If you enquire

the Doctor tells you, it made its

as I said before, no <hi>Lymph,</hi> either

Bloud was forced out of his Throat,
and his Jaws. The Surgeon who

and in my opinion may deservedly
be rank'd among the most expert

himself a Mediator between the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
and Patient, and by undeniable
arguments reduces the Doctor to
reason, and thereby to a Truce; of
which the chief Article was, that
for the space of a month or six
weeks he would desist all acts of
hostility, and for that time leave
off his <hi>Mercurial</hi> Bombs. In the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim,</hi>
the <hi>Sufferer</hi> was to gather
his forces out of a nourishing Dyet,
and then by mutual agreement the
War was to commence again;
But so it happened, that I was
consulted before the expiration of
the term limited, and upon a full
rehearsal of all transactions, I found
that the Coac-hkeeper had pusht
on the point so far, that here was
no Salivation necessary; which had
it been continued <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> could
never have scaled or scraped the
Shinbone, and therefore a Caustick
was agreed to be applyed, to arrive
to the intention just before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and a Compound <hi>Sarsa</hi> Drink

me, not to tell you, how this
Salivation, (had it been requisite)
was to have been managed with less,
than the twentieth part of <hi>Dulcis.</hi>
This is not all, here is a <hi>sceleton</hi>
indeed survived the <hi>Mercurial</hi> Wars,
and I must allow, that so great an
impression and weakness is left upon
his Bowels, that their tone and
strength will not be recovered, until
the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> By this advice I
am almost assured, I have <hi>Clenched</hi>
the Nail on the other side. But the
quantity of the <hi>Mercury</hi> given in a
Venereal case, bears no proportion
to those vast Doses of <hi>Iesuits-Powder,</hi>

is to be blooded six or eight
times; or if by a plenary Purge
he should happen to eradicate the
Disease and abounding humours,
together with the Life and Soul
of the Patient, the Physician is
obliged to swallow down double
the quantity of the Purge, which
if he survives, he expiates his
crime, and justifies his practice at
the cost of his own Body. I hope

in any wise awed a Physician of

more care and caution have ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the force of his Purge, with

the strength of the Patient. A

ordain for him, and whom I had
twice recovered out of the hands
of three of his Elder Physick Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
beyond the purport of their
<hi>Prognosticks,</hi> or expectation of his
Visiters. So it was, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartick
fore-hinted operated by
Vomit, and Stool, beyond the
number of a hundred, and being no
longer able to sustain the combat,
sitting on the Bed-pan, yields his
Ghost to him that gave it. Upon my
return from the Country, where
the concern of my own health had
detained me a considerable time, I
expostulated the matter with the
Apothecary (that in my absence had
preferred the Physician to this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy)
why he had not shewn my
Bills, prescribed in a former fit of

Sickness, to his <hi>Excellency,</hi> whence
he might have taken just measures
of the <hi>Idiosincrasia,</hi> and strength of
the Sick person? He readily told me,
he had so done, but the Doctor
took little notice of them, replying
by a particular Method he had done
greater feats in <hi>Agues,</hi> than this
seemed to require. However the
case being irrevocable, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
few words might be made of
it, and therefore as you see, I
have not made many. But did the

in the space of a year he

               <head type="sub">Concerning the Description of the
true Method of Physick, whereby a
Physician is distinguish'd from a
Quack.</head>
               <p>§ 1. BY matter of fact it's made
appear, what great deeds
are pretended by <hi>Method;</hi> Next let's
put to the scrutiny, what wonderful
thing this is, and what may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from it. The Method of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
is a rational order of Remedies
to be applyed to the body of man,
to cure Internal and External Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases;
which consists, first in the
knowledge of the Distemper, and
cause thereof, the Election or
Choice of proper sufficient Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and then reasoning within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which Remedy ought to be
applyed first, when, and how,
which Second, and Third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:62337:54"/>
How long each is to be continued,
and when the First, Second, or
Third is to be changed. So that here
you see the <hi>Method of Physick</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
naturally two particulars; First,
the knowing of the Distemper and
Cause; Secondly, adequate Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that shall remove those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers,
and their Causes. Hence
are made these deductions. <hi>1st.</hi> That
Distempers and Remedies are <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
in reference to the <hi>Method</hi> of
Physick, the Disease being the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum,</hi>
and the Remedy its <hi>Correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.
2ly.</hi> Since in Logick it is a trite
axiome, that <hi>Relata</hi> do mutually
constitute and abolish each other
(<hi>Relata sese mutuo ponunt &amp; tollunt</hi>)
there can be no Method of Physick,
where at the same time there is not
a Disease, and a proper adequate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
to cure that Disease; and
therefore in respect of the <hi>Methodus</hi>
are inseparable. <hi>3dly.</hi> There is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
(according to what my des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription
of <hi>Methodaus</hi> doth express)
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62337:55"/>
a Ratiocination in the Physician
within himself, the result whereof
makes a practical <hi>Indication,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion:
Thus, This Distemper is
hot, therefore the Remedy must be
cooling; it is caused by a Plethory,
therefore Bleeding is the Remedy;
or a Cacochymy, therefore purging
is to be advised. So that the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
part is nothing else, but the
apprehending rightly the nature of
the Disease, and collecting thence,
what Remedy it naturally doth
point at, shew, or indicate; and
therefore the Disease, Cause, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Symptoms, and strength of
the Patient, are properly called <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancia,</hi>
or pointers at Remedies; the
Remedies pointed at are termed <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicata;</hi>
and the collecting, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
or summing them both up is
named the <hi>Indication. 4ly.</hi> As then
the <hi>Methodus Medendi</hi> doth imply
the knowledge of all Diseases, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Symptoms, and what parts they
are inherent in, and likewise the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62337:55"/>
knowledge and experience of all
Remedies, so it doth consequently
comprehend the sum, and substance,
or total of the whole Art of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
and is the end and the ultimate
point, whereto all the parts of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
do tend, and therein concenter;
so that only he, that is Master and
Doctor in the Method of Physick,
doth alone deserve the Name and
Title of a Real Physician; all others
that pretend to Physick, being Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricks,
Quacks, or Mountebanks.</p>
               <p>§. 2. Having briefly and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
thus described the true measure
of distinguishing real from preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Physicians, let us also descend
to some Particular. I am not only of
opinion, but possibly certain, that
notwithstanding all the delusions of
Anatomy, great Scholarship, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
parts, Vaunting and Boasting,
the seat and causes of most Diseases
are unknown and mistaken by the
Commonalty of Physicians, as I
shall make evident in another place
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62337:56"/>
of this Treatise. Wherefore those,
which I have Entitled <hi>Methodists,</hi>
are no other than, <hi>Pseudo-methodici,</hi>
as neither understanding Diseases
nor Remedies, and consequently
neither the <hi>Indicantia, Indicata,</hi> nor
<hi>Indication.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">Of False Methods, and Methodists.</head>
               <p>§ 1. THey are those False Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodists,
who boast, that
with <hi>Opium, and Iesuits Powder,</hi>
they can cure all Diseases, though
instead thereof they either Palliate
for a time, or too oft send their
Patients to their Ancestors. Neither
are they advanced to much higher
form, that imagine ordinary Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensatories
are sufficiently stock'd
with Medicines adequate to the
Cure of all Diseases, whereas they
contain few others, than such as
may serve for Vehicles for greater
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62337:56"/>
Medicines, or are only virtuated to
remove slight superficial Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.
Whence I may justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
among a hundred Physicians
you shall find Ninery five Learned
Mountebanks, and possibly five
Real Physicians; which confirms that
distinction to be truly Logical, that
there are two sorts of Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks,
the Learned, (though God
knows, too many of them are very
defective even in the School-Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline)
and the other Illiterated,
who make their shew on their Banks
or Stages they mount (whence
issues their Name) or on the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of Streets on Posts, obtruding
a thousand Falsities to the Vulgar,
to defraud them; whereas the <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Quacks</hi> appear on their Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Theatre, or Coaches, and
privately in the Patients Houses
Quack their Abilities, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
they find the sufferer is
afflicted with, they have frequently
met with in such and such, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62337:57"/>
do not question to cure him as well
as others; though probably never
saw the like before, and do as little
perform their Promise in recovering
him, as the others they hinted.
Moreover, if one of these Learned
Empiricks shall with a lump of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
be dismist, leaving him to
another of the same Association,
who shall be a most confident un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker
also, and at the same time
blame and cast dirt on his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
(a Brotherly kindness) pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Patients Pocket dextrously,
and to prevent a third shall not be
called upon, to succeed him, from
whom he is conscious to be served,
as he did the other, puts all to
the push, by either Killing or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
Now pray what is all this,
but down right Mountebanking in
a Learned way? Is their any of
them, who doth not pretend, either
a secret in his Method, or in the
Remedies? which I have already
Illustrated; is <hi>Non-sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for there
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62337:57"/>
is no Method without Remedies, nor
proper Remedies without Method. It
is no other than Mountebanking, to
advise Syrup of Steel to all Chronical
Patients, and soput their whole stress
upon one Medicine, making that
his <hi>Panacaea, fac totum, Panchreston,</hi>
and universal Remedy: what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of Method here, whence a
Practitioner is stiled <hi>Medicus Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis,</hi>
in opposition to an Empirick,
that relies wholly upon Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and Secrets, whence some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he cures, but very oft kills,
and that for applying his Remedies
without Reason or Method.</p>
               <p>§. 2. The courses and Remedies
used by most of the <hi>Conclave of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians</hi>
of <hi>P.</hi> are chiefly these. 1.
In acute Distempers, the Jesuits
Bark, and <hi>Opium.</hi> 2. In Chronical
Diseases, either the Milk Diet. 3.
Or the Steal Course, or Purging
Mineral, and Mineral Steel Waters.
4. Or Bath Waters. As for Purging,
Glystering, Blistering, and Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62337:58"/>
they are fortuitously directed
according to Mr. Doctors <hi>Capritio.</hi>
5. The Cordial course; to this <hi>Classis</hi>
belongs the Spirit of <hi>Harts-horn,</hi>
and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Piss</hi> succinated. It
is confessed, they do somewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<hi>les Medecins de trois S. (son,
seign &amp; sena.)</hi> in their number
of courses, but not a jot in their
Methods. Now for Physicians who
pretend to be <hi>Medici legales dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tici,
rationales,</hi> and <hi>Veri Methodici,</hi>
to tye their Hands and Pen to only
five Spurious Remedies, because
they are applyed by them without
Method, as you shall read hereafter,
is as much Mountebanking in their
Coaches, as the vending <hi>Orvietan</hi>
on a Stage.</p>

there is no sort of men I

you may find it in a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave</hi>

of which his <hi>Apothecary</hi> is to raise
him, by knocking at half Sermon

post to a dying Patient; by which
means he draws the Eyes of the
whole Congregation after him; but
instead of going to the pretended

several Dominical days, until
it hath made an impression of the
People, that he is a man of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
and of great Physick-business.</p>
               <p>Thus I remember two Physicians at
<hi>Paris,</hi> grew famous; the one being
called <hi>Le Sier de Tattle,</hi> had by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting
the Convents of all Sects,
made a vast inroad into the good
opinion of the Zealots, and by that
means halled in Shoals of Patients,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62337:60"/>
whereof three fourths within his
fourty years practice are not to be
spoken with on this side the Moon.
The other was the <hi>Sieur Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,</hi>
known better to most men by
that Name than any other; In his
younger years the du<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ness of his
Apprehension, the imperfection of
his Memory, and the natural slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardness
of his Mind, (all contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to a very slender proficiency
in his <hi>Latin Grammar</hi>) made a
Diagnostick to his Parents, that he
was gifted with too little Sense and
Eloquence for a Lawyer, too
shallow a Memory for a Preacher,
and therefore what should they
make of him but a Physician, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
that his heavy dulness would
grow up into Gravity, his minute
Apprehension would be over-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to understand a Disease, and
his curtailed Memory would serve
well enough to remember a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.
Into a Doctor by length of
standing he was dubbed, and now
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62337:60"/>
to force a Trade of Pulse feeling
and Piss-gazing, he lays his Plot
in the Church, where his constant
appearance with a broad-brim'd
Hat, the little Band, an austere
Gravity, and dull Countenance,
soon gained him the Title of an
Honest Conscientious knowing Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
which Character happily
commends him to an Hospital, the
reputation whereof, how undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
soever, brings any man into
vogue, as it did also him, whom
succession of time at least creates
Father of the Family of Physicians,
still indeavouring to mimick the
part of an Honest Conscientious man,
and how far in that he acted the
Hypocrite, this subsequent narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of his uncharitableness will
attest, <hi>viz.</hi> a poor woman acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
him with an Urinal of her
sick Husbands water, and lest that

particularly all the grievances, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
and symptoms of the poor
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62337:61"/>
labourer, that in his condition was
obliged to receive Alms from the
Parish, being indeed incapable of
getting his Bread by his Sickness.
The Doctor having given the round
thoss to the Urinal, instead of the
courteous smile due to the Rich for
their Fees, frowns on the poor
Creature, and asks her, <hi>Whether her
Husband had fourty Pound to spend

higher degree, than now they do,
in being imposed upon by <hi>Amethodici</hi>

                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:62337:62"/>
as <hi>Montaigne</hi> in his <hi>Essayes</hi>
well observes <hi>fol.</hi> 780. Of a Sick
man being asked by his Physician,
what operation he found from the
Medicines he had given him, he
answered, <hi>He Sweated Violently.
That is well,</hi> quoth the Physician:
At another time he asks him again,
how he had done since? he said, <hi>He
had felt an extream Coldness, and a
great shaking: That is well,</hi> saith
the Physician. The third time? he
asketh him again, <hi>How he did,</hi> he
answers, <hi>I find my self to swell
and ready to burst, as if I had the
Dropsie; That is well again,</hi> cryes
the Physician. Upon this it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
one of his Domesticks came
to inquire of him, how he did:
<hi>Indeed my Friend</hi> (saith he) <hi>by
being well I die.</hi> This recital doth
resemble another, that happened in
the next Climate, where an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary
conducting a Dropsical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
to a Physician, he advises to
empty him. The Apothecary ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62337:62"/>
given him a Dose of <hi>Ialap,</hi> and
not finding the Dropsicalls Belly
lessened, returns to the Physician,
who directs to empty him more,
which he did; but soon after the
Doctor meeting the Apothecary, asks
how his Patient did; the other told
him, <hi>He was dead,</hi> then saith the
Doctor, <hi>You have emtied him too
much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This trite Aporism (<hi>viz.</hi> that
there is nothing so hurtful or Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous,
be it Spider or Toad, but
hath its use) cannot be universal,
unless it may comprehend the use
of pretended Anatomical Physicians,
which indeed is great and necessary
in a populous Country, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Famine, Pestilence, or War
have had any footing for many years.
In this Case men would devour one
another, the place not being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive
enough to feed all, were it
not, that Physicians by their <hi>male</hi>
practice prevented the Plethory of
Inhabitants. Moreover, they help
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62337:63"/>
off with a great quantity of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture
of the Nation, as Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Cloath,
Sack and Claret,
Crape, Hannen, Drugs and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Commodities more; and imploy
thousands of hands, as Coffin and
Grave-makers, Clerk, Sexton, Tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
Shoo-makers, and what not.</p>
               <p>To put a conclusion to this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
I shall only add; three fourth
parts of the World spin the thread
of their Lives to a greater length,
without the help of these imposing
Physicians, meerly by observation
of Remedies their Country affords,
and applying them according to
their natural sense, therein exceeding
all other <hi>European</hi> pretenders, the
proof whereof <hi>India</hi> manifestly gives,
in their not only Curing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to a Miracle, but also others,
that came out of <hi>Europe,</hi> who oft
when Physicians have left off, are
recovered by the <hi>Indians</hi> in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Passion</hi> being there
an Epidemick Disease, but much
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62337:63"/>
fiercer, and infinitely more painful,
than what it is here, when a Patient
hath been Clyster'd, and Drench'd
by a <hi>Batavia</hi> Physician for several
days to no purpose, his last refuge
is to some Skilful <hi>Indian,</hi> who makes
no more ado, but scrapes some
of the Pitch of the <hi>Ceco-nut</hi> in water,
boils it an hour or two, which is
no sooner swallowed by the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant,
but his pains are removed,
as if with a Charm, and taking it
once or twice more, Cures him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly,</p>
               <p>So likewise in a continual Fevour,
where Bleeding, Clystering, and
Juleping have been ineffectual, the
scorch'd Patient sends for an <hi>Indian,</hi>
who by besmearing him with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Ointment, (made of some of
their Juices, and a sort of fat Clay)
puts him immediately into a great
Sweat, which is no sooner off, but
the man feels himself perfectly well.
By this, and many other instances,
I would press my former argument
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62337:64"/>
over again, that without good effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Remedies, Method signifieth
not a straw. And what concerns
their five Courses, mentioned <hi>fol.</hi>
105. I dare undertake in a weeks
time, to inform the most Illiterate
capacity, having only a memory
equal to the <hi>Sieur Phlegmatick,</hi> how
to mannage those five Courses with
a better method, and far greater
success, than any of these Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Pretenders ever were fortuned
with. And since the faculty, as it is
used, savours so much of Cheats,
Frauds, and Chance slaughters, I
can easily make it appear, that it is
possible, to comprehend as many
plain and necessary Instructions,
Rules, and Remedies in one single
Sheet, that by observing of them,
any man without other advice may
in most cases Cure himself, with
far greater safety, speed, and success,
then the best of the pretenders to
<hi>Anatomy</hi> could ever yet challenge,
or lay claim unto; by which means
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62337:64"/>
a man would live out his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
time, which otherwise by

                  </hi> Practice is dockt, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
The Tryal of this last pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
is feasible by assigning two
Towns (suppose in the Hundreds of

respect of unhealthy Air, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases;
now if the Town following
the Rules and Instructions set down
in the Sheet fore-mentioned, shall by
three fourths out live the other, that
shall make use of pretended Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,

will, then it must necessarily appear

to the Lady: <q>Madam,
the great hopes we gave you three
days since, would ere now have
had the happy effect of your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
recovery, had the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of his Nurss in giving him
that draught of small beer with a
Toast in it been forborn, and the
putting on a clean Night-cap;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62337:69"/>
which together with the keeping
his hands out of Bed, have brought
so great a mischief upon him, by
stopping all the pores of his body,
that it is not in the power of our
Art to make him sweat, spit, make
water, or go to Stool, such are
the dangerous effects of taking
cold, and in this case not retriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
It is a great satisfaction to me,
(and the same I hope it is to you)
to see three of the greatest Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
of <hi>France</hi> met here, and
concurring with me in the opinion
of this Distemper, Method, and
Remedies, that have been applied.
We have left no Stone unturn'd,
had he been my nearest Relation,
more could not have been done.
But the days of Man are numbered,
and the appointed time no Man can
pass. The publick will have a great
loss, and in that I bear a share,
which makes me truly condole
with you, whose loss is infinitely
greater, of so dear and tender a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62337:69"/>
Husband. But let this be your
comfort, he is going to a place of
Rest and Happiness; and therefore
we must submit to Providence.
Madam, if at any time I can serve
your Ladyship, either by day, or
by night, or any of your Family,
I will come, go, or run.</q> The Lady
being corroborated with this strong
Cordial of words, received the sad
message, with sutable moderation,
and in Testimony of the good senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
she had of them, desired they
would be pleased to continue their
attendance, to see the event. With
all their hearts you may be assured,

becoming the Learning of a Doctor

some small <hi>Idea</hi> of this, and
the like Distempers, yet not being
found among the Records of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,
Trallianus, Actuarius, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
Cornelius Celsus, Avicen,</hi> and
the rest of those Ancient Physicians,
who in knowledge and distinction
of Diseases exceeded us <hi>cent per cent,</hi>
it is either their ignorance of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
or sloathful observation of its
Symptoms, that wrested this Name
from them. We must therefore
search for another <hi>Nomenclature</hi>
among those Ancients, who of all
Diseases were the most knowing in
the whole Theory of Feavers, their
Causes only excepted, wherein they
were extreamly mistaken. Now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
that this Distemper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
with a Lassitude, a Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Shivering, and Shaking, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
by a scorching Heat, insatiable

Drought; and Sweats at the close
of the Paroxysm, with an abatement
of heat, that still continued vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

the next day towards the Afternoon
was attended with another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxysm.
In the night towards Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and the third day another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxysm

detect this was a <hi>Semitertia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
being a continual Fevor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated

you are to apprehend, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of a <hi>continent</hi> Fevor with
an intermittent <hi>Tertian</hi> is also to be
called an <hi>hemitritaeus,</hi> the <hi>Etymology</hi>

this as to the other. This is that sort
of Fevor, which some ignorants call

and at that season has done no great
mischief to the <hi>continent</hi> Fevor being
going off, and likewise has preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

that occasion'd the Patient to
be Hot and Cold, or sometimes a

Hot, then Cold again, presently
Hot again, and so he had several Fits
in a day; this Distemper was also
by them called a remitting Fevor,

               <p>WHereas the distinction of

purpose of serving an ingrateful

their Patients, take the Pains of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating
this matter. That many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen,

this popular FEVOR, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with the <hi>Iesuits Powder,</hi> have

by their Physicians, needs
no confirmation, which error in
practice sourceth from this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62337:73"/>
Because the <hi>Iesuits

more of a <hi>Remitting Fevor</hi> (igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly

               <p>§. 3. Of these, instances shall be

<hi>Eschevin</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>Sieur P. W.</hi>
whose Paroxysms being stopt by the

<hi>febris lenta</hi> was left, which detained
him under a great weakness and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing,
not without immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Thirst, want of Appetite, and
a preternatural heat though not
pungent; a while after the <hi>Tertian</hi>
returns, and it was judged necessary
by the Physicians, he should take
the Bitter Drink purging, and that
to be repeated once or twice, and
upon that the <hi>Iesuit</hi> should enter
him in the form of a black lump,
every fourth hour, and this <hi>Bolus</hi>
without a <hi>Superbibendo</hi> to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
some considerable time after
the Fits were dammed up. But still
the <hi>febris lenta</hi> persevering, though
invisible to some of them. Another
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62337:74"/>
Doctor must be called in, to open
the Windows, draw the Curtains,
and help him out of Bed to give
him Air to Breathe; but this show
lasted not many hours, before they
were posting him to Bed with all
speed, so the opportunity was lost in
taking of a Lease. Then the old Lesson
of <hi>Decoctum amarum cum sena, sine

Powder, <hi>alias,</hi> Jesuits Bark given
with a liberal hand, had the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
to Cloister up his Fits so, that

strength and vigour of his Youth
bearing the commencement of the
mild putrid continual Fevor, that
was left, with almost a countenance
of one, that is in a state of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valescence,
which for that time
beguiled an Anatomical Doctor of
the glory he thought his due for
so speedy a Cure upon a person of
his high Birth and Quality. But the
Fevor advancing in its increment,
soon reduced this young Nobleman
to his Decumbiture, to whom the
Jesuit being again recommended
from joynt advices of the Anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and other Doctors, by rendring
this continual Fevor Malignant, (as
it never fails to do otherwise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) soon
machinates the death of this great
man, whose life, as it would one
day have answered the hopes the
World had of his great endowments,
so must certainly have prevented a

life expressed a true Portrait of the
Valour of the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> and

By as much as the <hi>Chinchina</hi> abated
the Paroxysms of his <hi>Tertian,</hi> in an

at last by its frequent exhibition Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suited

                     </gap>ra,</hi> at

found his remissions and exacerba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
converted into a constant te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of violent heart, and other
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62337:76"/>
Symptoms, that express a Fevor
Malignant, and therefore an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical
Doctor was to be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the other: But these
two <hi>Saturnine</hi> Planets being seated
in the sixth House, pointing directly
towards the eighth (<hi>Domus Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>)
could not do otherwise, than
advise the Jesuits Powder to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the quantity of a Dram, every
two hours, which in 24. amounts
to twelve Drams, or an Ounce and
half, and in six days to nine Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
so that it may be presum'd
throughout the course a whole
Pound was ram'd down, which
about the eighth or ninth day ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd
the prediction. It would very
well have countervailed the pains,
to have opened his Body, and scoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out the Jesuits Powder, which
at a Crown an Ounce, comes to
four Pound, and probably having
been thus digested in <hi>simo humano,</hi>
might perform miracles. In fine,
that the Jesuits Powder is pernicious,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62337:76"/>
and killing in all continual Fevers,
if any thing smart and Putrid, I could
demonstrate by matter of Fact out
of a hundred examples more, with
the same clearness the <hi>Sun</hi> appears
at noon day, did I imagine those
already produced not convincing,
and therefore superseding that, it's
necessary we should make a <hi>Transit</hi>

resting satisfied, like Empiricks, in
experiment only.</p>

               <p>§. 1. THat none hath yet gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
himself the trouble
of inquiry further, whence this
Drug is sent us, than from <hi>Peru</hi> in
the <hi>Spanish West-Indies,</hi> and by
whom, but the Fathers Jesuits,
whose name therefore is put upon
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62337:77"/>
the Parcel, is strange, most Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
contenting themselves with an
Empirical use thereof, without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining,
what Tree or Shrub it's
excoriated from, what Fruit or
Flower it bears; whether it be
transmitted to us Natural, as it
appears, or Artificially prepared by
imbibing it with some other bitter
Juyces, or Decoctions, specially
since several pieces in the best of the
Parcels differ from one another in
Colour, Taste, Weight, Resin, and
Grain, and much more doth one
Parcel disagree with the other, some
containing twenty sorts of Barks,
all by Imbibition, or Decoction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
the same in Taste, though
in several degrees of more or less
Bitterness, by which Sophistication
the men of Art have been frustrated
in their Cure of Agues.</p>
               <p>Many will have this celebrated
Drug the rind of dwarf bitter Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond-like-tree,
twice a year putting
forth Yellow Flowers of very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62337:77"/>
                  <hi>Gusto.</hi> Others will fancy it
scraps of the trunk of a <hi>Bastard-Indian-Berbery-Tree;</hi>
others of an
<hi>Ash-tree.</hi> The Flowers and the Nuts
are reputed Vomitive. That this
Tree is kept undiscovered by the
foresaid Fathers from the Merchants,
to whom they negotiate it, is upon
no other account, than to entail
the Commodity upon their Society,
who make great profit by it. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is only growing in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Peru,</hi> and no where else,
is not commonly known; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that every year a Cargo
comes thence to <hi>Calis</hi> in the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Galeons. Neither <hi>Ioseph Acosta,
Linshot,</hi> nor <hi>Delaet</hi> make any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Bark, that I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
               <p>§. 2. However I am of opinion,
the foresaid Drug is Artificially pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
and that none of it (though
the best) arrives to us in its <hi>puris
naturalibus,</hi> the Tree spoken of, or
some other like it, affording no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62337:78"/>
but the Wood, into which
the bitter Tast is immitted, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerating
it a convenient time in the
Juyce of a certain <hi>Indian</hi> Plant, to
which that penetrating bitterness is
peculiar. This having sufficiently
insinuated into the pores of the
Bark; it is exposed to the Sun, which
knits it together into a solider tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Hence it is, that the Bark
being reduced to Powder, and stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in any Liquor, doth so easily
part with its bitterness, as being
adventitious to it, and not connate
to its essential Principles.</p>
               <p>But a further confirmation of this
I could make by undeniable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
had I not determined to
forbear putting more sense into my
Friends of <hi>Paris,</hi> than Nature, or
their School Learning hath planted
into them. After all, I could wish
these Fathers had kept their <hi>Indian
Bark</hi> to themselves, and sure I
am, hundreds would be on this side
the Grave, whose Bones are now
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62337:78"/>
turned into their first Element.</p>
               <p>§. 3. But the great thing to be
inquired into, is its qualities, effects,
and virtues, and this will afford us
matter enough for debate. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
whether it be hot or cold, is
entring into the <hi>Chicane</hi> of the
Schools, to prevent which, we had
best state the question, whether
doth it heat or cool us primarily and
<hi>per se.</hi> The Decoction, or Infusion
of the Bark doth manifestly heat any
that shall take it in the state of
Health; moreover all bitter things
(<hi>quatenus</hi> bitter) are hot; bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
being occasioned by adustion, or
by igneous Particles, or <hi>igniculi</hi>
congregated in a terrestrial sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
thus by destillation being
too long continued is brought over
a bitter substance, being nothing
but the <hi>faeces</hi> and terrestrial part,
adust, or burnt in the bottom of the
Still by a violent heat, that brings
it over: But I would not have you
disprove me by tasting a red hot
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62337:79"/>
Iron, where those <hi>Igniculi</hi> are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
congregated in a terrestrious
body; Though if you please to
burn Leather, Bread, or almost any
thing else, that contains a gross <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi>
(to which the <hi>igniculi</hi> may
adhere,) in its terrestrial part,
and it will prove manifestly bitter.
Now if any thing be burn'd so long,
until this gross <hi>Sulphur</hi> is consumed,
then you will not meet with a bitter,
but a lixivial taste, as appears when
a body is burnt to ashes.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Whether the <hi>Chinchina</hi>
Bark be drying or moistning, is easily
resolved by the premisses; so great
bitterness derived from adustion, or
<hi>Empyreum,</hi> chacing all moisture,
must necessarily be advanced to the
highest degree of drying <hi>per se,</hi> as
all those that have taken it, can
sufficiently attest, ensuing imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after its admission into their
Stomachs; though by allaying of
ebullitions in the first region of the
body, or by precipitating of hot
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62337:79"/>
drying humours, it may <hi>per accidens</hi>
expel Agues, and Droughts atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them, provided the taking
thereof be not continued to too long
a time; for then it will not only
dry, and shrink the body and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
but at last reduce it into a
perfect <hi>Marcor,</hi> or total withering,
wasting, and Consumption, by
causing an incurable Hectick Fevor,
which in this particular exceeds all
other Hecticks, in that it impels the
Patient with far greater speed into
extinction. Many I could instance
about this Town, that by protra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the use of the Jesuits Powder
too long, have been thrown into
Hectick Fevors and Consumptions.</p>
               <p>§. 5. My self not many weeks since
was called to a Patient lying sick
of an intermittent Tertian, whom
I found almost totally macerated
through frequent Doses of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
Powder, directed by a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
of Note, who being unwilling
to appear <hi>coram,</hi> after a days delay
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62337:80"/>
I threw off his course, and advised
another, by which the Patient
amending; upon the news thereof
the Physician of Note thrusts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in again, and two more Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
of his Cabal. There being now
four of us to sit in Judgment, I was
to bandy with three, whom finding
very refractory out of respect to
their good old Cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Coll.</hi> and telling them positively, I
would meet them no more, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
my self to the Patient and
Relations in these terms. <hi>Madam,</hi>
You are now in a hopeful way, I
live at a great distance, there are
three Physicians besides, and you
are at a great Charge, I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
desire to be excused from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
attendance. Upon this the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and all her Relations did most
earnestly importune me to continue;
but the <hi>Shagrin,</hi> the Doctor of
Note, by some little indignities (by
me not thought fit to be resented
on the Bench of consultation) put
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62337:80"/>
me in, rendred me inflexible, and
so took leave. At the expiration of
three weeks, I heard she Ghosted,
and then one of the Physicians did
confess, I was guided by a right
sentiment, which if I would have
waved, and (what most others
do,) subscribed to him, that leads
the major part in Consults by the
Nose, I should have got very well by
it; but it is not a thousand Fees, that
ought to prevail with any man to
act against the tenures of Honesty
and Conscience, as by some it hath
several times appeared in consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and other occasions; <hi>Haec
obiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those that are pleased to observe
these few rules following, shall
have reason to think well of me,
for preventing them falling into
worse Diseases than their present
Agues, or preserving them from
Consumptions, and Hectick Fevors.</p>
               <p>1. If possible, and that your
Strength and Disease will admit of it,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62337:81"/>
Bleed and Purge more than once, or
Vomit, before you submit to your Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
advice of the <hi>Iesuits Bark:</hi> Or
in case evacuations are counterindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by too short intervals between
the Paroxysins, want of strength, or
other circumstances, exhibit proper
Antifebril Medicines that upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
experience do oppugne the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria
Febrilis,</hi> which being partly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
and partly spent or diminish'd
by a few Fits, namely, as many as
nature can very well bear without
manifest danger, then probably you
may choak up the remainder with
good success by the Bark. This Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
may be of use also in a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertian,
provided that the Bark be
not given before the continual Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
comes to a declination, and then
it ought to be seconded also with
proper <hi>Antifebrils.</hi> But if you offer
the Bark in the beginning, augment,
or state, you certainly kill the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.
Let me present you here with
another observation; of late years
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62337:81"/>
there have been several simple ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
whose fits were short, and
intervals long, and so manifest, that
the Pulse has beaten much slower
than usual; their Urine well dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
with a laudable white sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
To these tertianarians, the
Bark has been advised with all the
necessary premisses, the Fits have
been stop'd, and notwithstanding
the Patients have died. What was
the cause? a Malignant continual
Fevor, complicated with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent;
for you are to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
that a quick uneven Pulse,
and a high Urine, are not necessary
or Pathognomonick Signs of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor.</p>
               <p>2. Do not throw down great
Doses at once, but small, though
the oftner; yet not too often.</p>
               <p>3. Refuse to take it above a day
or two longer, than the stopping
of your Fits.</p>
               <p>4. About three weeks after your
Fits have been stop'd, cleanse by a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62337:82"/>
Purge, and for two days after, take
a few small Doses of the Jesuit
again.</p>
               <p>5. About six Weeks after that,
repeat Purging, and the next day
after, take a Dose or two of the
Bark.</p>
               <p>6. If you shall meet with a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
that can safely, and not
over speedily Cure you, without
giving the Jesuits Powder, never
meddle with the Jesuit, with whom
the less a man has to do either sick
or well, it's the better.</p>
               <p>7. At the change of the Season of
the year, enter into some small
Purgative, Aperitive, or De-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struent
course; but by no manner
of perswasion be misled into a Steel
course, for that will certainly prove
more fatal to you, than the Jesuit
well managed. For the present I
crave but your belief, these are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
from experience, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact, hereafter you shall be
satisfi'd with the reasoning part of
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:62337:82"/>
8. If the Jesuit will not stay with
you, but runs through at the bung,
it's frequently a sign, your Body
was not swept clean enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
his Worship.</p>
               <p>9. Where the Body is fluid, the
most Learned Physick-Doctors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<hi>Opium,</hi> or <hi>Laudanum Opiatum,</hi>
or <hi>Liquidum,</hi> mix'd with Jesuits
Powder, to detain it from leaking
through; this to me seems joyning
a puller to, with a thruster from;
but that is Empirical, and therefore,
if they design putting a stop to the
loosness, before they exhibit the
Jesuit, they ought rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the cause of the Looseness,
which is either Thin, Acrimonious,
Stimulating Humours Boiling, and
afterwards precipitated downwards;
or thick Viscous Salin humours,
adhering to the tunicks of the Guts,
irritating the excretive faculty: In
these Cases either gentle Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
or detergents, the one, or the
other, or both, mixt with <hi>Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62337:83"/>
Opiatum,</hi> or without <hi>Laudamus
Opium,</hi> is most proper; but which of
them ought to be used, is to be left
to the discretion of your Physician.</p>
               <p>10. Though this Jesuits Powder
is not a Medicine nowly found, (the
vertues for stopping of <hi>quartan</hi>
Agues, having been experienced
above a hundred years since) but
revived by a debauch'd Apothecaries
Apprentice of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to all intermittent Fevors,
and he in this empirical practice
most diligently imitated by our most
famous Physick-Doctors, as their <hi>Aes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culapius,</hi>
and first master (a hopeful
tribe in the mean time, that shall
leave their Sense, reason and <hi>Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata,</hi>
to follow a Quack or Empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick)
yet I have more than once
observ'd it as little effectual, as a
Chip in some <hi>Quartains,</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
which I have in a very short
interval put a more secure and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
stop unto by other applications.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of the second qualities of the Jesuits
Bark.</head>
               <p>§. 1. FOr the present we will
supersede these prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Rules, and proceed
upon a further inquiry into the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62337:85"/>
qualities of the <hi>Chinchina</hi> Bark,
which are chiesly controverted, <hi>viz.</hi>
whether it be condensing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crassating,
or rarefying and attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
detergent or emplastick; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing
or adstringent; deobstruent
and aperitive, or obstructing and
stopping. The Ducklings of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of <hi>Paris</hi> have declared it, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating,
Detergent, De-obstruent
and Aperitive; because Bitterness
(which this Drug contains in the
highest degree) is a necessary cause,
source, or spring, whence these
qualities and effects do flow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive.
The implication then is, that
it is not Styptick, adstringent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densing
and incrassating. But <hi>Aloes,
Colocynthis, Rhubarb, Wormwood,
Semina Santonici, Soot,</hi> &amp;c. may
contend with it in Bitterness, and
consequently in attenuating, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
and de obstructing, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of giving a check or stop to
Ague Fits, they incense and increase
them; whence then issues this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62337:85"/>
of stopping of Ague Fits? To
this Query they stand with their
finger in their Mouths; though at
last (not daring to own it to be
binding and obstructing; for they
are jealous, very pernicious effects
would ensue upon three weeks or a
months use thereof,) they tell
you, it is the most wonderful, and
strangest Medicine nature ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
for in some it occasions a
loosness, in others a costiveness; in
many it stops Ague Fits after the
taking frequent Doses; in a few it
doth its work immediately. Some it
raises their Appetite, to others,
dejects it; many it Nauseates, some
few it Vomits. On great numbers it
Engenders Hypochondriack va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
Scurvy, Obstructions, and
tumours of the Spleen and Liver,
ill habits of Body, Dropsies, Swelled
Legs, Head aches, suppression of
<hi>Menstrua</hi> in Women, difficulties of
breathing, Phtysicks, Palsies, and
other great Distempers of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62337:86"/>
Brain, which possibly are never
afterwards to be removed: But most
of these I confess are oft occasioned
by <hi>Male</hi> application of the Bark.
Notwithstanding some Physick
Ducklings are so fond of this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Powder, that they prescribe
it <hi>Panacaea</hi> like in all Diseases, mixing
it even with Glysters, and Syrups.
A certain Physick-Doctor lately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
it to a Gentlewoman trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with an Inflammation, and Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
in her Throat, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
rendred worse by a Guaiacum
Decoction premised by him; whom
I afterwards Cured in somewhat
longer than a Fortnight. Another I
knew directed it to an Infant bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
its Teeth. In fine, the effects
appear so miraculous to many of
'em, that they imagine the Jesuits
by Imprecations, Exorcisms, and
Charms on their <hi>Bark,</hi> have made
use of their Cloven-footed Master.
But to take off that aspersion from
these poor Holy Fathers, I am of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62337:86"/>
opinion, it is stupidity and ignorance
in School-learning, Philosophy,
and the true Art of Physick, that
impels these pretended Doctors to
take their refuge to such occult
causes, which to men of more
serene capacity may be rendred
sufficiently manifest; wherefore in
Answer to the Query before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
I assert, 1. That bitter things
(<hi>amara quatenus amara</hi>) as far as
they are bitter, are in some measure
to be allowed: deobstruent and ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritive
<hi>per se.</hi> 2. That many bitter
Medicines are Emplastick, and others
Adstringent; such is <hi>Aloes</hi> outwardly
applyed, and therefore <hi>Galen</hi> makes
it a principal Ingredient of his <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
Adstringens,</hi> so much decanted
in Ancient and Modern times; for
dissolving it in Water, or any
other Liquor, and dipping your
finger therein, you shall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
perceive it to be sticking,
glewy, and somewhat contracting,
Emplastick and Balsamic, for which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62337:87"/>
reason also its a frequent <hi>Basis</hi> of
external Balsams; though internally
taken, its effects prove quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
by raising a smart ebullition
in the Blood; which doth not only
give it a quick motion, but a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
so extream, that its very apt
to penetrate through the Pores, and
Mouths of the Veins, and Arteries
Red Roses, Galls, torrefyed Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb,
and many more, are Bitte<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and Adstringent. 3. Medicines that
are Bitter and Astringent are most
potently Styptick; the reason is
obvious; the Bitterness insinuating,
and piercing into the most retired
Pores of the Humours, and Fibers
of the Bowels, doth thereby make
way, and crowd along with it the
Adstringent Particles to the deepest
<hi>cellulae,</hi> or Pores of the <hi>Partes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinentes
&amp; contentae,</hi> so that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
no Medicine can be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
in a Styptick quality to that,
which hath a Bitterness united to
the Adstringent; whereas other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62337:87"/>
that are only Astringent,
the Particles upon their first appulse
to the surface of the Parts they are
to exercise adstrinction or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon, do shut up the external
superficial Pores, and by so doing
they lock or shut up themselves in
the surface, and do as it were <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludere
sibi viam;</hi> so that they cannot
in any proportion be accounted so
potently Styptick, as Bitter Adstrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</p>
               <p>§. 2. The manner of Adstriction
may be thus explained, <hi>viz.</hi> You
must suppose the Minimal particles
of an Adstringent simple to obtain
a long slender figure, most subtilly
pointed at both ends, which renders
them capable of insinuating into the
Pores of that Part, or Body, which
they are to operate upon. The slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Minimal particles being at one
end fixed in a Pore, by the Heat of
the body, or part, wherein they
are fix'd, are bent or turned round
like unto a Staple, (not unlike
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62337:88"/>
the heat of fire bending Pipe-staves,
for to fit them for making cask) by
which means the other pointed end
happens to be fixed into another
Pore, and the heat still continuing
to bend, both these points must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
then contract and draw the
two Pores, wherein they are fixed
nearer together, which causes that
pursing or contracting sense we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
when we tast any thing that
is Adstringent; and so long as these
hooked Particles continue bent, so
long the sense of Adstriction lasteth,
and no longer; for upon their slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that disappears. Likewise the
asperity and ruggedness, which ever
concomitates the part that is thus
adstricted, is nothing but those
minute Elevations or <hi>Monticuli,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by the contracting the Pores
nearer towards one another. But in
regard Adstringents do not operate
all after one manner, some do it by
stifning the Pores, and rendring
them rigid, and possibly upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62337:88"/>
of the part Adstricted, by
reaction may also be incurvated and
bent. Thus most Adstringent Salts
and Salin Bodies, as <hi>Allom, Vitriol,</hi>
&amp;c. do perform their Action, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their acuated thin slender rigid
Particles, fixing themselves into the
Pores like so many stiffe minute
stakes, crowd and run them up
together, and continue so long in
that posture, until the heat of the
part shall have relaxed, or softned
them, and then nature doth easily
thrust them out again. Moreover it
may so happen, that these rigid
Particles do not only enter the Pores
in a descending strait figure, and so
stake themselves, but may also lye
transverse and oblique, by which
means the Adstriction must ensue
more violent, and be of a longer du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Hence it may easily be made
out, how our Ambient Skin hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to be Adstricted, and rendred
rugged, in Cold Frosty Weather,
<hi>viz.</hi> By the slender acuated nitrous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62337:89"/>
Particles in the Air, staking or fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in our Pores, and crowding
themselves on another; and here it
is to be observed, that these nitrous
Particles continue their Adstriction
(perceived by us in Cold Frosty
Weather, more or less, according
to the number of these rigid nitrous
Particles, precipitated down upon
us) until our heat within, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
warmth of Fire shall have
slackned and expelled them. It is
those rigid Frosty Minims filling the
Pores of the water, and expelling
the Air thence, that cause Ice. We
must then suppose, that in Warm
Weather the foresaid nitrous corpus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
floating in the Air are slack,
and swim, or Iye parallel with the
surface of the Earth; but then as
soon as the Moon by her motion shall
have turned their Figure down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and by defect of the Warmth
of the Air (occasioned by Sulphurous
Effluvia's exhaled out of the Earth,
and actuated by the motion of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62337:89"/>
Sun, whence the Warmth of the
Air arises) assuming their natural
rigid structure, they are precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
downward in great Showres, at
the return of the Frost. Though I
have here indeavoured to accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
this sort of Mechanick Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy
to the present occasion, I must
tell you, that to me some other
Phylosophical Principles Printed
<hi>Anno</hi> 63. renders the thing much
more evident, and therefore where
I am to satisfy my self in subjects of
that nature, I do chuse to take my
recourse to them; however the
other being most in Vogue, I shall
spare the pains of obtruding mine.</p>
               <p>§. 3. The application of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Discourse to the <hi>Iesuits Bark,</hi>
is our next affair. 1. That it is
Bitter, Sense convinces us. 2. That
it is Resinous, the Eye manifests in
breaking it. 3. That it is Restrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
the Tast doth attest by the
perception of Contraction, and
roughness upon the Tongue, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62337:90"/>
in the simple Powder, after
the Bitterness is extracted by mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
or decoction in any Liquor.</p>
               <p>§. 4. The <hi>Bark</hi> being extreamly
Bitter, Resinous, Viscous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
Emplastick, and Adstrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
declares it a most potent
Styptick; for by its extraordinary
Bitterness the minute slender acua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Particles (being partly Nitrosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
and partly others) are readily
and deeply fixed, into the remotest
Pores, and thereunto are fast ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by its Emplastick Viscous
resin. And in regard all these qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,
figures, positions, and
principles do so rarely concur in one
body, it's no wonder not many Barks
besides it, are found so effectual
for stopping Ague fits.</p>
               <p>§. 5. Before we inquire further
into the manner of its activity in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittent
Fevors; we will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
that the <hi>Chinchina</hi> Bark is
neither Purgative, nor Laxative
<hi>per se.</hi> The former appears, in that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62337:90"/>
in most bodies it doth not raise any
Ebullition; the latter, in that all
do agree, it is not moistning, nor
much stimulating, unless taken in
too great a Dose, or where the
Stomach is charged with a mass of
Humours. Neither is it Diuretick
or Diaphoretick <hi>per se,</hi> which
needs no other proof, than the
general attestation of all those, that
have experienced it on the occasion
of their Distempers. Wherefore since
<hi>per se</hi> it neither operates by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
Stool, Urin, or Sweat, being
the usual way of carrying off the
Causes of Agues, which properly
ought to be termed Curing, I judge
we may safely conclude, its chief
Energy consists only in stopping of
Ague fits; for in as much as one,
that is troubled with a virulent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhee,
cannot be said to be Cured
by stopping it up with Adstringents,
the malignity together with the
putrefied Humours being dam'd up
within the Body, and therefore is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62337:91"/>
so apt to return, and be converted
into a worse Disease, the Pox, unless
Cured by removing the cause, <hi>viz.</hi>
by extinguishing the malignity, and
carrying off the Putrid Humours by
detersives or Purgatives; so Agues
can no otherwise be termed Cured
by the <hi>Iesuits Bark,</hi> but only stop'd,
and the vitious Humours retained
and mured up, whereby either the
Fits upon some short interval do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
or through failure thereof,
worse Diseases are engendred (by
the vitious Humours so retained
and bound up) as Dropsies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions,
Scurvy, or twenty
other Distempers, that either render
the Party his whole life-time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
Crasie, or kill him out-right.
Your objection I can as soon answer
as conjecture, <hi>viz.</hi> A <hi>Diarrhaea</hi> or
loosness is oft cured by Adstringents;
but the nature throws off the cause
by frequent Stools, which in a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norhaea,</hi>
though it be possible to
run off, and so afterwards remedied
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62337:91"/>
by Adstringents, it is rarely obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
unless in those that are very
mild and little malignant, though
even in those, and in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>Diarrhaeaes,</hi> its far the safer
way to carry off the cause. In like
manner, where slight Agues by
Symptomatick Vomits before the
Fit, and Sweats at the termination
of them, have lessened the Cause,
the <hi>Iesuits Bark</hi> may sometimes put
the last hand to the suppressing of
the Distemper, and yet I should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
choose to be cured another way.</p>
               <p>§. 6. That in some the Bark
proves Purgative, in others Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
is only <hi>per accidens,</hi> by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring
with floating bilious, or
corrupt Pituitous humors about the
Stomach, Guts, precipitating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and giving a shock to the
latter; so that according to what
I observed in my ninth Rule, where
it chances to operate by Vomit or
Purge, it indicates necessity of
exhibiting a Purgative, or Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62337:92"/>
Therefore in many cases I
esteem it <hi>male</hi> practice to mix opiates
with the <hi>Iesuits Powder,</hi> to keep in
or stay it in the body, unless the
Patient be reduced to a very low
ebb of strength, and even then, it
ought not to be continued long,
except some other urgent Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
should co-indicate it.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Now we are advanced to
the chief point and knot of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
(the untying of which will
manifestly detect the killing errors,
committed not only in intermittent,
but principally in continual Fevors)
How, in what manner, and by
what means the <hi>Iesuits Bark</hi> doth
stop Ague Fits. Wherefore let us
proceed by method, first assert the
theory of Agues, and afterwards by
way of <hi>Indication</hi> describe, how
the <hi>Bark</hi> by being so potently and
peculiarly Adstringent and Styptick,
as I have before illustrated (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
its sole faculty and energy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists)
doth answer our <hi>Intention.</hi>

observation abstracted his Novels, a
happier success would have attended
his practice, than which nothing
ever proved more pernicious and
fatal to most of those Patients, that
subjected themselves to his, and the
followers of him, Their debauch'd
advice, which the Bills of Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his time, and since, did
amply testify. His <hi>Caprices</hi> being
ever formed before experimental ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
he was obliged to strain
the latter, to render them agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the former, which was the
cause of that great number of Caytifs
failing under his management;
whereas had he made experience
the foundation of his Inventions, a
rule that swayed with the Ancients,
his endeavours might have been in
some measures serviceable. His judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was most palpably depraved,
in concluding excrementious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
could be lodged no where,
but in the common receptacles, as
the Gall-Bladder, Guts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62337:93"/>
being according to his assertion no
other visible repositories; as if the
Pores of the <hi>Parenchyma</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
through a <hi>Microscope</hi>) of
the Entrails, Musculs, Glanduls,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> were not sufficiently nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
to contain a centuple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of humours, more than
those cavities he mentions, for the
proof of which, you need only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
in what places the humours
are contained in an <hi>Anasarca, Asci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
pedes aedematosi,</hi> all internal
tumours of the Bowels, and those
of the external parts. But he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
these not to be Excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
as the <hi>bilis in cysti fellea, &amp;
stercora in intestinis,</hi> allowing them
only to be <hi>humores crudi,</hi> that may
be concocted, wherein his error is
discovered, by misapprehending
the intendment of the Ancients in
the word <hi>Excrementitius,</hi> signifying
<hi>omne id quod excerni debet,</hi> and
therefore crude blood that has stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
a considerable time in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62337:94"/>
Pores, having thereby acquired a
preternatural crasis, disposition, or
quality, is as much excrementitious,
as the Urine, or <hi>alvi faeces,</hi> and
thence being incapable of assimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the universal Mass, must
be substracted by Bleeding, Purging,
Transpiration, Urine, Expectoration,
Sputation, Vomit, Excretion at
the Nose, Eyes, Ears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For
certainly none can deny, but that
Snot, Humours running at the
Ears in Infants, Fleam expectorated
by Cough, or Spit up from the
Glanduls of the Throat, are Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious
Humours, contained in
no visible Cavities, or Cells. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth the conceding (as he
urges) of stagnation of Excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
humours in the Pores ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
or impede the circulation of
the Mass in any other part, than
where the stagnation is, and finding
a resistance or exclusion, the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
Blood doth preter-flow to the
next passages, that are patent. The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62337:94"/>
Argument most inforcing his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
is grounded upon the trite
maxime of Physick, <hi>viz.</hi> That
humours <hi>extra vasa</hi> Putrefy. This
is granted, but how, and when?
<hi>Post long am moram,</hi> not immediately,
as appears in most AEdematous,
Skirrous, or Aqueous Tumours, and
many <hi>Ecchymoses</hi> not tending to
Putrefaction before a long interval
of time; though in some Cases,
where the external and internal
Pores are quite stop'd and choak'd
up and the Bood consisting of Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous
Particles, is Sulphurous,
and full of Spirits, a Putrefaction
doth ensue immediately <hi>extra vasa,</hi>
and so it may <hi>intra vasa,</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
in Putrid Continual Fevors.
Moreover conceding this Physick
Romancers position, that the Blood,
or excrementitious Humours, cannot
stagnate <hi>extra vasa,</hi> the whole
structure of the Art of Physick, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the sedulous observation and
experience of so many Agues, is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62337:95"/>
thrown to the ground at once; for
then obstructions of the Bowels, all
internal Tumours, Dropsies, Infarcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Stomach, and Lungs, with
many other evident distempers, must
all be expunged, Purging set aside,
Bleeding rendred useless, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Remedies continue in force, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
Alteratives, Diaphoreticks, and
Diureticks. A fine sort of Emperical
and destructive practice, whereunto
the man being glued by such like

you; whence, and from the
course he directed her Mother,
both decumbent of an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Fevor, he abstracted his The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orems
of Agues. To the former
he had exhibited such a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Mercurius Dulcis,</hi> as raised
a Salivation so plentiful, that it
had almost Embark'd her in <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi>

               <p>The ground-work of the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>That the Chyle for being well

that Vomitives Cure an Ague no
otherwise, than by throwing up
Choler (how he is forced to strain

himself) is false, since I have oft
observed intermittent <hi>Tertians</hi> era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated,
where the Emetick hath
cast up an heap of Putrid slime,
without the admixture of a grain
of Choler. On the other hand I
have seen Bleedings, and such Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives,
or Laxatives, which he
so highly commends, only to make
his marks to bear, a hundred times
continued in use, and repeated in
eight, ten, or twelve interval days,
and exhibited before the Fit, with
no more success than commonly
attended his first practice at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
which I particularly took notice of
(being my self then a Student in
<hi>Exeter</hi> Colledge) was so inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
that he was forced to block
at his Pen, and so by forging of
Novelties, thereby removing the
bushel from over his Candle, allured
a number of poor Country Patients,
though at that time very raw in
all manner of experience, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in the least in practical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62337:98"/>
so that at last <hi>Iustice</hi> for
his having so long impunitely injur'd
mankind, made him his own Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner,
dying under the same mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applications,
so many hundreds
had miscarried by. Though after he
had thus practised many years, I
have met with him in consultation,
then whom I never observed a man
less Sagacious in finding out a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
and therefore he would ever
submit to any that should disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it, being wholly unfurnish'd
with the Diagnostick part, whereby
he might oppose or approve ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
judgment. Indeed it were to
be wished most of my Friends of
<hi>Paris</hi> would return to their <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi>
and perfect themselves in the
<hi>Semeiotica;</hi> for they are so apt to
mistake Diseases, that in five, four
are commonly misnamed by them,
and not long since an Anatomical
<hi>Belweather,</hi> (a Doctor) managed
a person of considerable Quality,
living within two Miles of <hi>Paris,</hi> for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62337:98"/>
a Gout, who being Dissected, was
found to die of an Ulcerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
his Lungs appearing in a
great measure putrefied; but what
do I mention this single example,
when I could produce a hundred,
whom Syrup of Steel (his general
quack Medicine) had brought to
the ground, upon applying it to
Diseases by him mistaken.</p>
               <p>That which induced this <hi>Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
to state the <hi>Focus, Sedes,</hi> and
<hi>Fomes</hi> of intermittent Fevors in
the Vessels, was the observing, that
many Autumnal and Epidemick
<hi>Tertians</hi> attack'd Bodies of all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments,
Ages, and Sexes, (in
some of whom no foul Stomach,
or ill feeding could be discovered
by him) likewise such as should
live in Foggy marshy places, as the
hundreds of <hi>Essex,</hi> and lower <hi>Kent.</hi>
Unto this instance, carrying the
force of an Objection, I must make
a repartie of those sporadick Agues,
that appear plainly engendred by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62337:99"/>
irregular Diet, where the Air can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
in the least be suspected to bear
a part in a most healthful season, and
the best of Climats, on which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
the Stomach by the original
and immediate symptoms, doth
shew it self principally and primarily
affected, and other parts only <hi>per
deuteropatheiam;</hi> as also it doth even
in those intermittent Feavorish Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
of the Autumn, and of
Marshy places, where though the
Nitropyretick Particles of the Air
do seem to introduce a dyscrasie in
the Blood, through the Pores and
inspiration; yet this cannot happen,
unless soon after the Stomach doth
receive the same ill impression from
the Spirits of the Arterial Liquor,
and <hi>Lympha,</hi> considering that
through heat of the former, and
Salin particles of the latter, it doth
in a great measure perform the first
concoction, or Chylification, whence
afterwards through infarctions of its
own, and circumjacent parts, by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62337:99"/>
putrid slymy variegated humours,
variously constituted, and boiling
up, those several sorts of Agues
receive their production. Should I
charge my self with the trouble of

and continual Fevors, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
from experience and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental

to inform the Vulgar, that following
the Dictates of their own sense, and

Jesuits Bark doth stop Ague Fits.</head>
               <p>TO avoid <hi>Chicaneries,</hi> &amp; School-wranglings,
we will only
suppose Ague Fits to be occasioned
by an high ebullition, <hi>Orgasmus,</hi> or
fermentation (as others choose to
call it) of contrary humours, and
Juices about the Stomach, their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
being rarefied, attenuated, and
of various figures, do vibrate, and
shock one another impetuously, and
by their violent local motion against
each other, a great heat is at length
raised and an high ebullition, whence
Effluvia's being gradually dispersed,
and impelled into the Mass, do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62337:100"/>
to their number and quality
excite a greater or lesser, longer or
shorter, milder or malignant heat
and ebullition, depending also upon
the disposition, and susceptibility of
the Blood. The indication drawn
hence concludes, that a Medicine,
which is drying, condensing, incras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sating,
and Adstringent, so as to be
penetrating also, must be singularly
energick, and effectual (though not
always proper to be used) to allay
the Febril ebullition before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
by interposing its minute slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
acuated corpuscles between the
combattant Particles, and as it were
parting them, by staking themselves
like so many Pallisadoes between
them, and so by crowding them up
close, fetter and imprison them,
whence consequently the ebullition
must necessarily cease, and a truce
put to the combat for so long time,
as the interposing corpuscles shall
there continue, which being worn
out, or by long repulsion of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62337:101"/>
particles expelled, the battle
commences anew, and the fits
return, which then are to be stop'd
again by the same Medicine.</p>
               <p>That this indication is answered
in all its particulars by the <hi>Iesuits
Bark,</hi> the frequent and common
experiment, together with the
reason thereof, given in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
dissection of its parts, and
explication of its qualities, and effects
before recited, do clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate:
For consisting of such staking
or pallisading particles, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a penetrating bitterness ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictive,
and emplastick qualities,
it obtains a specifick vertue to stop

as Allom, Tormentil,
Berbery Bark, and such like are not
equally Febrifugues with the <hi>Chin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>china,</hi>
is because they are not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

not consisting of particles, whose

of the rules, set down <hi>fol.</hi> 160.
In the first Bleeding, Vomiting, or
Purging are directed: The first to
diminish the <hi>Plethora ad vires,</hi> or
<hi>ad vasa,</hi> to make room for the
Spirits to move, the Bood to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate,
cool and ventilate the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
open Obstructions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the constipation of the Pores:
The second, to evacuate the whole
Body, and Bowels; but particularly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62337:102"/>
to averruncate those Viscous Putrid
Humours about the Stomach, where
the <hi>focus,</hi> and <hi>minera mali</hi> lyes
absconded: The third, in case
Vomiting is counter-indicated by
weakness, tenderness of Sex or Age,
indisposition of Parts, or mildness
of the Distemper, not requiring a
Medicine of that efficacy. These
depletions and evacuations being in
sufficient measure and proportion
premised, the Relique of putrid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
ought to be precipitated to
the Guts, or Bladder, or the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(as they term it,) bound
up by a specifick styptick, as the
<hi>Iesuits Bark,</hi> and several others;
which done, the Spirits return to
their several functions, and the
Concoctions are restored to their
Vigour, whereby new humours and
juices are engendred, which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
diluting and qualifying the
foremention'd remaining ferment,
the Ague is totally cured without
danger of relapse. But in case the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62337:102"/>
                  <hi>Iesuits Bark</hi> shall be exhibited im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
before the body is deple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and evacuated, as of late years
hath been the practice, the Febril
ferment is by longer detention aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
and much deteriorated,
or rather those putrid Ebullititious
humours do not only receive an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in quantity, but quality,
which sometimes amounts to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity.
This is not all, obstructions
are inveterated, the Bowels ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
weakned, and subverted
in their temperament, whence more
dangerous and obstinate Diseases are
to be expected, than the Ague it
self. So that when ever the Fits shall
return again, they shall appear at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with far worse symptoms
than formerly, and continue much
longer, and oft times be converted
to double <hi>tertians</hi> and <hi>quartans,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only single before. I have more
than once known, that a single
<hi>tertian,</hi> by applying the <hi>Bark</hi> too
early, before proportionable eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62337:103"/>
or depletions, hath been
forced into a continual mortal Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the violent styptick Medicine
having impell'd the ferment, or
those Putrid febril humours into the
great vessels. Neither will the purge
<hi>Willis</hi> mentions <hi>fol.</hi> 142. the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

it must be a Cathartick of another
nature, and greater energy, among
which I could discover one to the
Physicians of <hi>P.</hi> that at once or
twice purges off those Viscous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid
humours in a great part, the
other it precipitates to the Bladder,
and the remainder it fixes, which
three properties ought to concur in
any Medicine, that deserves to be
named a <hi>Febrifugue,</hi> or specifick
<hi>Antipyretick;</hi> but that would be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Pearls to Sw.</p>
               <p>In the second precept great doses
of the <hi>Iesuits Powder</hi> are forbidden,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62337:103"/>
lest by too sudden a cohibition
you crowd the ferment into the
great Vessels, or by too great a
dose, or weight, it precipitate it self
downwards into the Guts, and
purge, and so carry it self off, not
unlike <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> given in a
Dose to raise a Salivation, instead
whereof, by its weight and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative
quality, as they call it,
it purges, whereas by small Doses
it answers the intention; though I
am not ignorant, that sometimes
small Doses may by its adstriction
precipitate, and detrude loose floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
humours downwards, and so
become <hi>per accidens</hi> laxative, (as
medlers are said laxative, <hi>prima
mensa comesta</hi>) and by that it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the body requires a purgative.</p>
               <p>The fourth Cannon enjoyns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Purge after some interval, to
attempt the carrying off some part
of the humours, that have been
bound up, (before the ebullition
revives, the vertue of the <hi>Iesuit</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:62337:104"/>
being almost worn out) and to
cement the remninder by a few
Doses of the <hi>Bark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If upon conjectural computation
the relique of morbifique matter
shall be deemed considerable, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Cathartique must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed
after six weeks, to which
duration the adstriction of the <hi>Bark</hi>
may well extend, since after several
previous subductions of humours,
the styptick is suppos'd to continue
its prerogative over a small heap, to
a longer interval, which being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
reinforced, doth abide in
prevalence, until the last small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of febril matter is by the
strength of nature dispersed.</p>
               <p>The occasion of the sixth injunction
is this; though many have been
brought off from their Agues by
the method predict, yet conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the nauseous doses of the <hi>Iesuit,</hi>
the long protracted regimen of
Diet, frequent danger of relapses,
which in some hath happened twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62337:104"/>
times in the time of a year or two,
and after all there has been a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
into an incurable Disease;
in my opinion, other methods
ought to be preferr'd, where the
case can bear it. And grant the <hi>Bark</hi>
is used with all the caution, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
imaginable, still Experience
awards necessity of an aperitive or
deobstruent course at the next sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or at least the subsequent
spring, to delete the vestiges of the
<hi>Bark,</hi> and the ultimate impressions
of the Febril lees, or sediment; but
a <hi>caveat</hi> is put in against Chalybeats,
they in point of adstriction being
Sisters to the <hi>Iesuit,</hi> as hereafter
shall be more plainly made out, <hi>viz.</hi>
That all Chalybeat preparations, and
particularly such as are called erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neously
Aperitive, are highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stringent,
styptick, obstructive, and
binding <hi>per se.</hi> Also that most of
those preparations of Steel, which
are termed adstringent, are rather,
<hi>Epulotick</hi> and <hi>Emplastick.</hi> In my
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62337:105"/>
Treatise of the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> I have partly
proved the assertion, and given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
how extreamly dangerous
the use of <hi>Steel</hi> is, if misapplyed,
hundreds, I may say thousands,
owing the irrecoverable loss of their
Health to it, and not a few the loss
of their lives: Yet notwithstanding
these convincing proofs, not only
<hi>Steel,</hi> but the <hi>Iesuits Powder,</hi> and
<hi>Laudanum,</hi> are become the three
<hi>Quack-Medicines</hi> of this Age.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Steel</hi> is the bane of the
Lungs, doth not only appear by
its suppressing expectoration, but
also by crowding and forcing gross
Phlegmatique and Salin humours
up to the Lungs, whence inevitably
Consumptions and Hectick Fevers
do ensue, whereof I have seen
frequent instances in young and old:
And notwithstanding it is so highly
cryed up for opening obstructions,
I have more then once observed
some Women, that have made use
of <hi>Crocus Martis Aperitivus</hi> (falsly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62337:105"/>
so called) for the procuring their
<hi>Menstrua,</hi> have fallen into an incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
suppression. <hi>Per accidens</hi> it doth
sometime prove de-obstruent, by
crowding Humours and Spirits up
into a heap, until at last they burst
through, and then by Explosion,
violence of motion, and a forcible
stream, they carry all before them,
and so become aperitive, not unlike
to a rivulet, that is dammed up
with a bank of mud, which stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the water until it is swelled,
and gathered into a great heap,
is at length thereby burst through,
which happening, moves impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously,
scours and clears all before
it. Moreover, the material princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Steel being Vitriol, which
is allowed adstringent, and obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
in the highest degree, doth
strongly confirm what before is
asserted.</p>

               <p>§. 1. MY affairs preventing me,
I must suspend my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of discoursing particularly
upon the five courses formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
and therefore shall only
set down a few Animadversions upon
the grand course of Physick prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to the <hi>Sieur,</hi> &amp;c. which you
have already read in <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. The
first Medicine set down by the Sieur
<hi>Phlegm.</hi> he knew not what to make
of it, and therefore at the close
writes only <hi>M.</hi> for <hi>Misce,</hi> it being
neither Apozem, because it wants
Syrup, nor Julep, because it is a
Decoction. By the <hi>Scorzonere</hi> and
Liquorish he designs to smooth the
Blood, but then by the Spirit of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62337:106"/>
Sulphur, that is likewise added, he
renders it rough again. The Claret-Wine,
(which he ignorantly calls
<hi>Vinum Claretum,</hi> signifying spiced
Wine, and rendred clear, by passing
it through an Hyppocras bag) is
poured to it, because the Patient
having been a Claret drinker, is not
to be taken suddenly from the use
of it, for fear through want thereof
his Stomach should be palled; the
Cinamon water is to keep up his
Spirits: The whole is the most idle
prescription I ever yet beheld, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of contrary Ingredients, and
consequently Heterogeneous, which
necessarily must ferment in his body,
and therefore instead of allaying the
Febril fermentation (erroneously so
termed) he doth considerably aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it; whereupon the Patient
growing worse, he thought it not
safe to trust himself to him alone,
though a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> but must have
another joyn'd with him, to render
the case worse, who agree in the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62337:107"/>
next prescription, which is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
of bitter, and sweet, <hi>viz.</hi>
Liquorish, Gentian, Jesuits Bark,
Centaury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Medicine as idle,
but more pernicious than the former,
being wholly Empirical without
sense or reason. I perceive these
two Gentlemen ascrib'd the chief
energy of the <hi>Ies.</hi> Bark in suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of preternatural fermentations,
to the bitterness of it, and therefore
to exalt the virtue thereof, the
other bitter Simples are added; if
so, why is Liquorish put to it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> It is universally observed,
that all things that do (<hi>movere
alvum</hi>) cause Stools, not only
infringe, but destroy the Virtue of
the Jesuits Bark: Wherefore it is
very senseless, to add Centaury,
Carduus, and Gentian, which by
a smart stimulation and potent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersion
do all occasion Stools, and
consequently precipitate and throw
off the Jesuit in a great measure.
The manifest truth hereof you shall
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62337:107"/>
find by giving the Jesuits Bark to
two Ague Patients, whose Diseases
are indifferently equal in their
Symptoms: He that takes the Bark
without the bitter Decoction, shall
be rescued from his Fits six or eight
days before the other. Furthermore,
I have known the aforesaid Bark
given in substance three weeks suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively
with a <hi>superbibendo</hi> of the
<hi>Decoctum amarum,</hi> without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
effect; but on the other hand,
after the same Patient had swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
down three Bolusses of the
Peruvian Bark upon the omission of
the <hi>Decoct. Amar.</hi> his Fits were
stop'd immediately. So by this you
are to understand, <hi>amara</hi> are not all
of the same nature, witness Aloes,
Colochynth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> These <hi>Signiors</hi> were very
addle-headed, in directing a Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Bark, which only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
the bitter from the adstrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
particules, which being Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial,
were left in the bottom of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62337:108"/>
the Pipkin, whereby the Medicine
is partly destroy'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> Considering, that most
continual Fevers after digestion, and
the aequation of the Heterogenous
humours are carried off by Sweat,
Urine, or Stool, can any thing be
more contrary and Lethiferous, than
the Jesuits Bark, that stops all the
<hi>Avenues</hi> of the Body, crowds and
forces up humours out of the lower
venter into the middle, and supream
venters, as appears by their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the <hi>24th.</hi> where Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
are advised to relieve his diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of breathing, caused by the
Jesuits Bark; for this Symptom did
not attend his Disease at first, but
was an <hi>Epiginomenon.</hi> And now his
humours are thus thrown up to his
Lungs and Throat, the Vital Spirits
must needs be extremely oppressed,
and stifled; to whose relief a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of insipid faint musty Cordials
are prescribed. These sages obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
instead of having done little
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62337:108"/>
good, they had done a great deal
of hurt by an unknown Medicine,
they push on by trying one experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon another, to whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
they were much more
Strangers, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Goa</hi> Stone; to
little purpose. But still the difficulty
of Breathing increased, of which he
complained so vehemently, as if a
house had stood upon his breast;
thus the poor Gentleman was
night-mared by the Jesuits Bark; to
remove which, here is a lick-pot
(prescribed on the <hi>18th.</hi>) of nasty
Linseed Oyl, taught them by the
Boars of <hi>Germany;</hi> which though
very moistening and relaxing, could
not abate the adstriction the Bark
had caused. Hitherto they have
continued the use of Acids; now
Empirick-like they pass over to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
quite opposite, <hi>viz. Volatile
Alcalies,</hi> and therefore they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
Spirit of Sal Armoniack to be
taken in every draught of drink
and broath, instead of Spirit of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62337:109"/>
likewise he is oft to gorge
down Spirit of Harts-horn in Briony-water.
By these prescripts, I find
they are receded from their former
opinion, importing the difficulty
of Breathing depended on a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
of humours to his Lungs, as
beyond all peradventure it did: And
now they humbly conceive, it was
occasioned by Hypochondriack va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours.
But since those Volatile Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calies
caused no abatement of that
Symptom, they e'en turn to their
old deserted opinion, of a translation
of humours to the Lungs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
on the <hi>29th.</hi> they endeavour
to purge them off by a violent Purge,
the strongest that ever was pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
to the strongest man, and in
the greatest dose, <hi>viz.</hi> Twenty
grains of <hi>Pil è duobus,</hi> consisting
of <hi>colocynthis,</hi> and <hi>scammany.</hi> This
was an error unpardonable, for these
reasons; first for directing the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Purge, in the greatest dose,
to the weakest man that lay dying.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62337:109"/>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> For ordering a valiant Purge,
when a continaul Fever (not
without suspition of malignity)
was near the state, whereas it is
accounted a great èrrour to advise a
gentle purge in the beginning and
augment of a mild continual Fever.
Now, had any other that was not
of their <hi>Conclave,</hi> been guilty of
an errour a thousand parts less, they
would in that Country have prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
him not for <hi>male</hi> practice only,
but Murder. At last the sufferer fell
into Ratling in his Throat (the
nearest Symptom to death) which
they ignorantly believed, was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd
by the humours mounting,
and therefore they appoint him a
Mustard gargle, which stifles him
immediately, instead of halling
Flame out of his Throat by roaps.
In conclusion, may I never be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of so much Knavery, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
as to become a <hi>Conclave</hi>
Physician.</p>

you find him varying, diffident, and
most incertain in his method, a plain
evidence his Theory appear'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
dubious and false, which impels
him so oft into various different cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
For a considerable time continual
Fevers were endeavoured to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
by bleedings, and acid Juleps,
but many more dying than recov'r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
put the Physick Doctors upon
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62337:110"/>
a contrary method; namely, upon
the use of Volatil Alcalies, as
Spirit of Harts-horn, Spirituous
<hi>Sudorific</hi>-waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> throwing off
Treacle-water, because consisting
of one or two acid Ingredients a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many alcalies. This manner
of cure prevailing less than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
they fall into an Empirical
course, as exhibiting <hi>Iesuits Bark</hi>
against all continual and intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Fevers, which now by all men
is judged to be more fatal then any
of the former. Whither they will
apply next, who knows? tho' some
already have cast off the <hi>Bark,</hi> and

sentiments less lethiferous. By these
contrary courses a <hi>Conclave-Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
betrays his Ignorance in

After all, I must tell you,

Drunkenness.</p>
               <p>2. But besides these <hi>Savii,</hi> there
is another sort of Doctors, that live

and who are of the true Race of the
great Prophet above-mentioned, and
consequently by descent are gifted
with the knowledge of discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good from evil Bark; they
know how to bruise, pouder, and
sift it, infuse, extract, impast it into
an Electuary, or Pills, and weigh it
into Doses, of all which the <hi>Pen

are incapable of curing one single

Doctor, for a Licence for the

Knight of the Pestil, who also
for his Commodity and Attendance,
expects in the end, by reason of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Repetaturs,</hi> to be trebly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
what is this, but purchasing
Health at the second hand? So that
generally throughout all <hi>Paris,</hi> the
Apothecaries having 50 or a 100
Patients to the Physicians one, it's
an infallible Conclusion, that the
Company of Apothecaries get 50
or a 100 times more than the Band
of Physicians; for an Apothecary is
continued to the end of the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
the Physician oft-times makes
but one Visit or two, and then is
dismissed: besides the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
oft have hundreds of Patients,
whom the Physicians are never cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
unto, either because they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
and oft really do cure them as
well as the Doctors, or because the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62337:113"/>
Patients are unwilling to be at a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
charge. Hence you may easily
extract the Reason, why five sixths
of the Physicians go with their hands
in their Pockets all day, the greatest
part of Business passing only through
few mens hands, (though some of
'em are much more ignorant than
the others) whereas there is scarce
any little Apothecary, but one time
or other in the day, there is Life
perceived in his Mortar. Now this
scarceness of Business being by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
(who probably wish all the
World sick at once) imputed to too
great a share one hath before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
(though falsly, for it's equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough divided amongst most of
'em, some few only excepted)
makes them growl and snarl at one
another, like so many barking Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
at a Bone in the Water, they
can't come at; whereas all this
while, were the number of Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ten times greater than it is, there
would be too much Business for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62337:113"/>
them, had they not imparted their
Knowledge, Skill, Method, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
to these inferior Doctors, at
whose discretion it is now, whether
any Physician shall partake with
them in their Employ, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they do, it is oft-times to the
Physicians own Disadvantage, as I
shall make appear to you.</p>
               <p>3. If the superior Doctors will
bid high for the Stock, the inferior
do not want confidence to out-bid
them, as the subsequent Test will
plainly decide. Suppose a good ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<hi>Parisian,</hi> of an indifferent For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,

will have a care not to be so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse,

at least) a Fee upon the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Doctor,</hi> but sends to the next
<hi>Pestle</hi> and <hi>Mortar,</hi> who has skill
enough to discover by his Pulse, he
has a Fever, and upon the instant
(if the Patient wants one) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
a <hi>Lavement,</hi> or Glyster to
him, and within a few hours after
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62337:114"/>
to cause him to be blooded; he is
not ignorant, that he ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
him a cooling Julep, a Cordial,
Diaphoretick Powders, and in a few
days to clap on his blistering Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:
now what could the <hi>Master
Doctor</hi> have done more? However,
if the impatience of his Relations,
suspecting danger by the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
Countenance, will needs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a Physician upon him, who
may make a better Figure in case of
miscarriage, he doth with all his
heart accept of one, provided he be
of his own choosing; or if he must
be the <hi>Belweather,</hi> the Apothecary
stands upon his Guard, having possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
left him room to crowd in <hi>Spir.
corn. cerv.</hi> or a <hi>Pearl Cordial,</hi> and
possibly not. But if the Apothecary
should happen to prove dishonest,
in preferring his Reputation before
the Life of the Patient, whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Physician shall not cure,
whereby he may acquire a Fame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
him; for prescribe what he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62337:114"/>
will or can, it is in the Apothecaries
power to make up the Medicine as
he pleases; and suppose a few grains
of <hi>Cer.</hi> should be added to your <hi>Pearl
Cordial,</hi> not unlike it in colour and
mixture, this shall so oppress and
stifle the Patients Spirits, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least sign of being poisoned,
he shall certainly die, without the
least danger of being discovered for
his foul play.</p>
               <p>4. Allow a Physician commits to
the preparation of the Apothecary a
long Bill, perhaps a purgative Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zem
of half a Sheet, containing an
hundred or more of alterative Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
besides the Purgatives, can
any man be so idle, as to believe, he
will send to all the Herb-women,
Physick-gardens, and Druggists,
possibly at ten a Clock at night,
when the Prescription arrived at his
Shop? No, he is wiser; and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Doctor intends only to
exercise his Patient for two or three
days on the Close-stool, laughs at
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62337:115"/>
the Vanity of the man, and puts in
only three or four Roots or Herbs, a
few Seeds, and the same Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
dosing it according to his
own Estimate, and conveys it next
morning early to the Patient. You
may believe, it's not one Bill in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is exactly made up according to
the Doctor's Order; neither is it
fitting it should; for oft his Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are so idle and incongruous,
did not the Experience of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary
correct, alter, and substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
what he pleases, there would
be mad work in the sick man's Guts.
Or imagine the Bill is prescribed as
it ought, the Apothecary may not
be pleased, the Patient should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to his Health in too short a
time; or at least is pleas'd that the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
shall miss of his Reputation in
curing of him. Therefore grant the
Doctor prescribes over-night a sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifick
Cordial Julep; the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
it, with the addition of a few
grains of Resin of <hi>Gialap,</hi> or <hi>Scammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:62337:115"/>
without the least hazard of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery;
the next morning the Sick
gives an account, that instead of
sweating, he was on the Pot all
night. The Doctor, less jealous,
good man, of the Apothecary, than
of his own Wife, tells the Patient,
this is a critical Evacuation, occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Nature's being strengthned
by the Cordial, and consequently
proves better than he intended; and
so shams it off; and if the Party di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
lays the blame on the malignity
of the Distemper, without the least
mistrust of his man Doctor, who
privately having much more the Ear
of the Patient, throws all on the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
expecting hereafter he alone
shall be made use of in the Family.
Another Knack he is dexterous in;
if the Doctor do not stand well in
his Books, he impeaches the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
secretly of erroneous Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and tacitly turns off the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi>
introducing another that will
serve his purpose, and submit to him
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62337:116"/>
in all things. In fine, there are a
hundred Tricks, by which he eludes
the Physician, do what he can; and
why not? It is to his advantage so
to do, knowing to cure Diseases as
well as the other, and sometimes
better, having been intrusted with
the Method and Bills of many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.
As to my particular opinion,
I do verily believe, the Apothecary
is rather fitter for Practice than the
other; for where the latter cures
one Disease, the former cures twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and where there dies one under
an Apothecaries Hand, there die
twenty under the Physician.</p>
               <p>5. Cannot the Apothecary advise
a <hi>Diascord. bolus cum Rhab.</hi> the white
Decoction, <hi>Laudanum liquid.</hi> and <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne</hi>
Glysters in a Looseness? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
he make up Syrups in a Cough,
Consumption, and Ptysick; purge
in any Fulness of the Stomach, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriack
Crudities, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
slight Cacochymy, with <hi>Pil. stom.
c. g.</hi> or prepare Chalybeates in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62337:116"/>
Womens Obstructions, or in fine,
mimick his Masters in almost every
Distemper? And will they or can
they hinder Apothecaries, who have
so diligently learn'd their skill of
them, from practising among their
poor Neighbours, who besides pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Physick, (which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
is dear enough) are not able
to bestow Fees on Physicians? Well,
but suppose these <hi>inferior Doctors</hi>
grow sullen, and leave their <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi>
the Field, what will they do
with their Patients? Can they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
Medicines? Are they skilful in
practical Pharmacy, or Chymistry?
If not, what will become of the Sick?
Neither is that part of the Art, <hi>viz.</hi>
Pharmacy, so soon attained. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they will pick a Quarrel with
the Surgeons too, for practising Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick;
whose Art doth entitle them
to Bleeding, opening Imposthumes,
reducing of Fractures and Dislocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Amputations, Trepanations, and
dressing of Ulcers and Wounds, that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62337:117"/>
oft cannot be performed without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
internal Medicines; which Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge,
if the Physicians deny them,
can they perform all those Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Operations themselves? If not,
who shall do it? So that it's plain,
the <hi>Man-Doctor</hi> ought to practise,
because the <hi>Master-Doctor</hi> is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and insufficiently educated.
Wherefore I say, he doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Title of <hi>Doctor of Physick,</hi>
that is not very well versed in Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
Chymistry, and Surgery.</p>
               <p>6. I confess, I have not always
been of this opinion, touching the
equal capacity of practising Physick,
between the <hi>Master</hi> and <hi>Man-Doctors</hi>
of <hi>Paris,</hi> because it was some years
afterwards, before I was thorowly
informed of the Insufficiency of the
former; though I must likewise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that I know some Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of Physick, that have only
some honourable Relation to their
Society, who by their due Education
are arrived to as high a point of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62337:117"/>
Learning and Skill, as any in the
whole Universe.</p>
               <p>7. Moreover in regard many slight
Distempers are carried off by purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it is found, that many <hi>Medicine-mongers</hi>
do vend a vast proportion of
Purgatives under several Forms, at a
very low rate, and to a great relief of
the Poor, and benefit to the Rich: so
that computing these, the Practice
of Apothecaries, Surgeons, Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives,
Nurses, and skilful Women,
the hundredth part of the Practice
of Physick is not left to Physicians;
wherefore they ought not thus to
envy, backbite, slander, and hate one
another, since it is not they that
take the Practice from one another,
but their receiving into Copartner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
all those fore-mentioned Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
through their own ill manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Faculty of Physick,
which notwithstanding all this, I
could without much difficulty, put
them into a way of retrieving their
Rights and Priviledges; but my best
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62337:118"/>
way is to let it alone. Before I go
further; since the distributing of
the first Impression of this Treatise,
I perceive many will not be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of my right meaning of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
mentioned in the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of this Tract; and therefore I
do once again expresly affirm to you,
I never declared to any, nor ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to declare otherwise, than my
meaning to be only the Physicians of
<hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>Metropolis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. And now with great grief I
cannot but condole the fatal Stroke,
that's given to the Reputation of
the Faculty, by the Life and Death
of a main Pillar of a certain <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissime,</hi>
and topping Society of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians;
also by the reproachful
withdrawing of another great prop
from their laudable Company. A
man of Letters was <hi>Don Diego,</hi> and
wonderfully versed in the Waters,
but much more in Wine, insomuch
that Hats temper'd with the Liquor
leaking from his Tub, did exceed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62337:118"/>
the best Codebecks. The splendid
mode of his Living was supported by
the great mortgage of the <hi>Athene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
made to his most intimate Friend,
for repayment of whom, he drew
on his Death-bed a Bill of Exchange
payable by Pope <hi>Ioan;</hi> but the Bill
(I should have said his Testament)
was protested, the Corps seized, and
put into a Deal Box, slightly nail'd
up, without so much as a penny
Cord about it, and was tumbled into
a Hole close by, for it was not packt
up for a longer Journey: thus turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this blazing Light into a Snuff.
The other was also a main piece of
Timber, suddenly crackt by the great
weight of his hypocrisie &amp; knavery:
strange! a new house built but t'other
day, to have so many pieces of rotten
timber in it. Let hence his sober credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
as they call themselves, draw this
Moral, There is no Trust to be put
in <hi>Religio Medici,</hi> many of whom,
I verily dare affirm, believe, there
is neither God, Heaven, Devil nor
Hell.</p>
               <p>

9. If some for a Fee take a Pot or
two of Ale, or a Bottle of Wine,
(which possibly is all day evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
through their <hi>Pericranium</hi>) or a
quarter of a hundred of red Herrings,
a Sundays Dinner, a pair of Shoos,
Stockings, a Campane Coat, a
shoulder of Mutton, or the like; I
think this can be no Reflection on
the whole Society: however, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liora
speramus; crescit sub pondere vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
I hope to live the Time, to see
every society-Physician again in his
Velvet Jacket, which the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
and Surgeons, yea the very
Mountebanks, have so unjustly pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
over their Heads, and put on their
own Shoulders. Is this the Year
that <hi>Nostredame</hi> prognosticated Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
should flourish, and be Dame
Paramount over all the Arts and
Sciences? <hi>O Tempora, O Mores!</hi> The
Man is turn'd Master, and the Master
the Man; the Apothecary if he has
too much Business, or has a Chesnut
to pull out of the Fire, the Patient
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62337:119"/>
being in danger of dying, he sends
his Man, the Physician, (which he
must take for a Favour too) to the
poor Patient, who dying next day,
the Apothecary privately to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
layeth all the blame upon his
Man, the Physician, for prescribing
so impertinently, by which he secures
the future Practice of that Family to
himself. This is true Politicks, <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctica
est multiplex;</hi> it's no wonder if
half the Physicians cannot get so
much, as will buy Water to wash
their Hands; and glad is the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
if he can but get his <hi>quondam</hi>
Man the Apothecary's Daughter into
Matrimony, tho' her Lips be smeared
with <hi>Pomatum,</hi> and her Stink-Pot
with Verdigrease. Thus much of

               <p>1. I Have told you, who are the
Betrayers of the Liberties of
Physick; for provided the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
will but call upon them, when
their Chesnuts are ready to be pull'd
out of the Fire, they care not a Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
if the whole Faculty be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the rest of their junior Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates
beat their Heels against the
Ground: even as it is in some <hi>Hogen
Mogen</hi> Commonwealths, where a
few growing rich by Treachery,
they value not if all their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Commonalty become Slaves
to <hi>le grand Seigneur.</hi> However this
toucheth not my Copyhold, never
intending to herd with any Society
of Physicians, unless there should
happen a wonderful Reformation;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62337:120"/>
though I cannot deny, but I have
formerly been a Fellow of a Colledge
of Physicians, where they always
spoke Latin, and consulted in Latin,
(observe well) but I sufficiently
spied the Inconvenience of colleguing
of it: I know very well, their Bulls
in no Place goes beyond seven miles,
therefore a Remove so far, or at
least assuming to be Man-Doctor and
Master-Doctor in one, eludes all:
but it's time enough to think of that
at my return to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. To leave all this Ribauldry, I
pass over to the discovery of a new
Principle, or rather Theorem in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
the use whereof is infinitely
greater, than any thing yet discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of by Anatomical Fops, namely,
whence such plain and advantagious
Indications for bleeding, purging,
alterative, sudorifick, diuretick, and
corroborative Remedies may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
as shall with much more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
cure Diseases, whereas hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
they have been handled by
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62337:121"/>
conjectural means, and most of 'em
not without imminent danger.</p>
               <p>3. It hath been observed, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors
for estimable Novelties have
most oft with great facility, discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in the very surface of their
enquiry, to the reproach of those
who apprehend, that nothing of
moment or rarity is attainable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
long and diligent search be made
in the most abstruse and profound
Corners. Children would have
puzzled <hi>Archimedes,</hi> in their easie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of setting an Egg upright.
The Mines of <hi>Potozzi</hi> were discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Silver, found on the surface
among the Shrubs, though by their
digging to a great depth in many
Places, they got nothing but their
labour for their pains. The Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
observing, that the Sea out of
the Ocean did always flow through
the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> into the
<hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and so it did out of
the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> yet without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
Intumescence, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62337:121"/>
the Water had no passage
to be disimbogued, soon concluded,
that it must run out again under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
as fast as it run in atop, which
by their Plummet they found to be
true. That this unpolisht sort of
People without any Philosophy,
should so easily detect so considerable
a Truth, is no great wonder; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Chain of Physicians, linkt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for so many Ages, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by all their Philosophy, Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Study, and their pretended ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical
Industry, discover the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Blood, until lately; a
thing much more easie, than the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the Sea in the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean:</hi>
for had they like the Sea-men
only reasoned thus; the Heart
through the Arteries doth constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
throw Blood into the Extreams,
and so did also the Veins, according
to the Dictates of all Physicians,
from the beginning of the World,
until forty or fifty years last past.
Were this true, in less than an hours
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62337:122"/>
time all the Blood of the Body must
be thrown into the Extremities;
and then what monstrously swell'd,
red, bloody Hands and Fingers, Feet
and Toes, Nose, Lips, or in short,
Face and Head, must a man have
had? For according to their Maxims,
it is most absurd, that two contrary
Motions should be granted to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
flowing in the Vessels; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it possible, for the Heart by
Pulsation doth always throw from
it, and what must then become of
all that Blood? Here the very Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
would have told you, the Blood
must take up some other course, and
return through other Channels; and
what could these be, but the Veins,
that throughout the whole Body do
for that purpose accompany the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
through which the Blood is
conveyed again into the Heart: and
this is the Circulation, which any
man would have thought might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
have been defected, than the
setting an Egg upright, or the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62337:122"/>
of the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> Here
you may see, what a dull stupid sort
of People Physicians have ever been,
as if their hard studying and poring
on the Elements, Temperaments,
Humours, Faculties, and such like
Trifles, had benumm'd their Brains,
which makes 'em look with their
Eyes fixt and immoveable, their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
stiff, like automatick Statues
walking up and down. Had the
Apothecaries, who have their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Tongues voluble enough, (if
not too much) applied themselves
to the Invention of the Circulation,
they would have found it out with
less labour and time, than the making
up of a Composition of Mithridate,
or Treacle. For all this, though
the Invention did not partake half
the subtilty it seemed, yet such was
the Envy and Detraction of Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
they rather chose to ascribe it
to <hi>Varandaeus, Caesalpinus, Padre Paulo
Sarpa,</hi> and others, than to the real
Author; and <hi>Lindanus,</hi> the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62337:123"/>
of <hi>Leyden,</hi> (under whom I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
my Course of Physick) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to prove the Circulation out
of sacred Writ. And now it is set
on broach, <hi>Cui bono</hi> is it beyond Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
or what use or advantage
do they make of it in curing Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
or desuming curative Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which if any where, should be
most apparent in Fevers? Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
the same sensless Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
and frustraneous Remedies, are
still continued, without any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Alterations, the poor broil'd
Patient by their confident and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
Insinuations gull'd of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and Life in the Bargain; for in
no Distemper doth the false Art of
Physick adduce less Benefit, and
greater Detriment, than in this;
and since the first Impression of this
<hi>Conclave,</hi> they are generally so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convinced of their killing Errors,
in giving the <hi>Iesuits Bark</hi> in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and remitting Fevers, as they term
them, that the same men do now
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62337:123"/>
openly assert it to be destructive in
all such Fevers; but who shall expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
their past Crimes, in murthering
so many Persons of all Ranks and
Qualities by it? Let's also put their
other Methods to the Test, where
commonly the first great Remedy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
is Bleeding, which they say is
to abate Plenitude, (<hi>Plethora ad vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>
at least) but what Plenitude can
there be supposed a day or two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Patient dies, at which time
I have known 'em to prescribe Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy,
even on the same day the
Sick expired? Others affirm, they
bleed to cool the Body, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
dispute it doth, but how, they
know not; though <hi>Riolan,</hi> with the
rest of his <hi>French</hi> Physicians, asserts
Bleeding to refrigerate in Fevers, by
quickning the Circulation, which
running ofter about, doth expel
those hot Steems and Evaporations
in greater abundance; but then this
being too frequently repeated, drives
out the vital Spirits, drawing Death
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62337:124"/>
at their heels, especially in Cases of
Malignity; whence it appears, though
moderate Bleeding is very proper
and advantagious, yet they have not
sense enough to tell you how. The
next Design is to prescribe Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Juleps, <hi>Bolus's,</hi> Drops, and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to expel the Cause of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
by Sweat. How pernicious this
is, you shall understand by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel.
Observe then, that Nature
seldom throws off any morbifique
Matter by beneficial (or critical)
Sweats, unless it be first digested or
subdued, and afterwards separated,
at which time Sweats are proper, and
Nature being debilitated, requires
assistance from suitable Sudorificks;
on the other hand, while Humors
are in an high Ebullition and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion,
to exhibit hot inflaming
Sudorificks, (which go under the
Name of Cordials) is to make an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to the Inflammation, absorb
that little mositure that's mixt with
the Blood, and augment all the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bril
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62337:124"/>
Symptoms; for it's more easie
to force Water out of a Flint, than
to promote Sweat in some burning
feverish Patients; and if you should,
it must be with vast detriment, for
no febril Matter (as I hinted before)
is carried off before Digestion and
Separation. Thus you may behold
the Ignorance of Physicians. The
last Remedy is <hi>Blistering,</hi> by which
is intended the attracting the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to the Circumference, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
doth seldom succeed, unless the
Ebullition be somewhat abated, and
that is usually towards the latter end;
so that if applied in the beginning,
as I have known some have done, it
doth occasion the same Mischiefs, the
fore mentioned Sudorificks caused.
Among a multitude, I will give you
one Instance of a Person of Quality,
labouring under a mild sort of <hi>remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
Fever, against which I advised
bleeding in the Arm, an antifebril
Decoction for ordinary Drink, and
specifick Draughts against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxysms.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62337:125"/>
These answered expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in reducing the Distemper to a
considerable abatement, insomuch
that on the third or fourth day, the
Lady was about her Chamber, and
had her <hi>Menstrua</hi> come down upon
her, flowing after their usual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
all very good Signs: but it
hapned, that a Person of Honour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to the Patient, out of care and
tenderness towards her, was desirous
her own Physician should be sent for
next morning early, who appearing
there, thought it necessary to do
something, and therefore caused <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pispastick</hi>
or blistering Plaisters to be
applied to the Arms and Neck; I
coming two hours after, found the
Plaisters on, and was told, I must
meet in the evening to consult with
the other Doctor, in vogue a very
great Physician I assure you; but I
replied, The Consultation ought to
have been before the Application of
the Blisterers, and therefore it was
too late, for they had already given
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62337:125"/>
the fatal Blow, for which Reason I
desired to be excused, leaving withal
a very ill Prognostick. By night her
<hi>Menses</hi> were totally suppressed, and
a <hi>Metastasis humorum</hi> was occasioned
to the Brain, whence a very enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Delirium,</hi> or Raving, was
caused; for the <hi>Cantharides</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the figure of the particles of
the Blood, whereby the motion of
Nature was inverted. Next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I was sent for again very early,
but then I positively refused coming.
In the afternoon, to retrieve the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
she was ordered to bleed out of
the Foot, but to little purpose; for
Nature once become irregular in
Motion, is not easily reduced. The
Medicines prescribed by the Doctor
above-mentioned, were these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

               <p>3. The cordial Powder, Julep,
and Emulsion, prescribed by me,
were on <hi>Aug.</hi> 2. thought fit by the
Doctor to be continued, though the
day before I had countermanded the
use of them, and advised only the
continuation of my first Apozem,
and the Draughts, to which I
imputed the chief part of my
success. But then I had a cramp
Question put to me; <hi>What, will you
let her die for want of a Cordial?</hi> To
which was replied, There was no
occasion for one, and where Nature
was imployed in any beneficial Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation,
(as in our case of Menstrua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
she was not to be molested by
multiplicity of Medicines, lest she
might be irritated, or impeded by
something in them, which might be
contrary, and cannot always be
discerned by a Physician; for in all
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62337:128"/>
Persons there is an <hi>Idiosynorasia.</hi> But
as I said before, the great mischief
was perpetrated by the Blisters, in
which they were signally seconded
by the two Hypnoticks, taken the
same night, and the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for it's a Maxim, That Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks
do suppress all Evacuations,
excepting Sweating, which throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out through the Pores, doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
make a revulsion of the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strua,
as it doth the Urine; for he
that sweats much, makes little Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aug.</hi> 3. A purgative Glyster must
needs be forced upon the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Patient, which I should have
most strenuously opposed, nothing
adding more to a febril Ebullition
than a Purgative, raking up a Mud
also, which otherwise might have
continued dormant. <hi>Monsieur le
Medecin.</hi> finding no great Feats by
his acid spirit of Salt, imitates the
Doctor of Contraries, in experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the stinking alcalious Spirits of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62337:128"/>
Harts-horn, with no better success.
Therefore perceiving, that Nature
was grown sullen, and would not be
pulled or halled, neither one way
nor other, concluded it to be high
time, to provide for his Reputation,
and call in one of his own choosing,
that should hide his errors, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
he had done reciprocally for
t'other. Now let's see, how both
pull at the Bell-rope. The Vesica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
are commanded to be applied,
which operated no more, than if
they had been stuck to one of the
Bed-posts, for the Reasons I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
given you before; so that
consequently by them the Ebullition
was raised yet higher; and now the
grim Gentleman with his Sythe doth
begin to appear at the Door, for
there was a very great oppression of
Respiration, and the Breath fetcht
thick and panting, (an infallible sign
of Death in Fevers) which symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
is endeavour'd to be resisted by
the <hi>Spir. salis armoniac.</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tihysterick
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62337:129"/>
Julep, supposing the
cause to be uterin Vapours, that in
their erroneous opinion was judged
not only to infest the Lungs, but the
Brain also, whence proceeded that
vacillation of Mind, little Cramps
all over, and (which is a <hi>species</hi> also
of Convulsion) a <hi>subsultus tendinum.</hi>
Wherefore in respect of the <hi>affectus
Cerebri &amp; totius generis Nervosi,</hi>
there was <hi>Aq. Poeon. comp.</hi> and <hi>Tinct.
Succini</hi> added to the Julep; and to
second this great Work, the Hair
was to be cut off, to give vent to
those uterin Evaporations; also an
attractive Cataplasm to draw 'em
out by force. Notwithstanding all
this Clutter, those symptoms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
which spurr'd on our two
associated Physicians in applying
Cupping glasses, hoping to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Vapours, and to pull 'em
out by the middle, before they
mounted up higher. That which
encouraged 'em to this hair-brain'd
Advice, was, that the assistant Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62337:129"/>
had oft been present with me,
where I advised the application of
Cupping-glasses to a Person of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
who being sometimes surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with stifling, syncopal and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive
Fits, as if he had been upon
the moment of Departure, was ever
instantly relieved, as if by Miracle,
through the use of Cupping-glasses;
but then it's to be conceived, these
Fits were certainly occasioned, by
venomous Steems flying up; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the Case fore-mentioned, those
symptoms were erroneously appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
only for symptoms of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,
which in effect were also
symptoms of Death, occasioned by
Blood copiously thrown into the
Lungs, and now beginning to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and stagnate. Moreoever, to
apply Cupping-glasses to the region
of the Diaphragm, which is the
chief Instrument of Respiration,
what was this, but wholly to put a
stop to its motion, and stifle the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
upon the Spot? And how could
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62337:130"/>
these Cups have been applied to the
Navil and Thighs of a Lady, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the greatest breach of Modesty.
Certainly most Physicians as they
are meer Brutes, so they are the most
ignorant of Mankind. Lastly, To
give the Patient <hi>Le coup de grace,</hi>
they cause a smart irritating Glyster
to be infused into her Guts, and
what's most sensless, mixing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>Tincture of Amber;</hi> as if the
Fundament with a Medicine applied
to it, were a proper place to cure the
Brain; or the Forehead, to cure
Corns of the Toes. And since a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
is at the last gasp, and on the
point expiring, were it not better to
suffer her to depart quietly, than to
kill her? But that too oft happens
through want of judgement to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
whether the symptoms be
symptoms of the Disease, or symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
of Death.</p>

               <p>1. IT has been hitherto the opinion
of Physicians, that a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Heat dispersed throughout the
whole Body, and continued to some
space of time, is a Fever, and the
cause of all the Symptoms attending;
as quick Pulse, high Urine, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Thirst, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thence their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
Indication is cooling by Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
cooling Juleps, Purging, and
Diaphoreticks, and these very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
answering expectation. Now
let us but change, or transfer the
Notion, and State, that violent Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
is the cause (mediate or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate)
of all Symptoms, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
a Fever, we shall soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
many Truths, and be capable
to give a clear Resolve of the great
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62337:131"/>
number of Doubts and Difficulties,
that arise in Fevers; also be furnisht
with curative Indications, whence
greater success may be expected, than
commonly attends the vain Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of <hi>Conclave Associates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. To pass by all profounder Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
than Sense, let us only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
violent local Motion is the
cause of Heat and Burning, witness
the rubbing of two hard Sticks one
against another, so long until they
take Fire, as the <hi>Indians</hi> do for want
of a Tinder-box, when they intend
to make a Roast; likewise a Wheel
by its violent motion about the Axel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,
doth easily take Fire, unless
prevented by greasing.</p>
               <p>The Heart then being stimulated
by heterogeneous Particles, and acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leous
Salts of various Figures, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to quicker and more forcible
Motion or Pulsation, whereby the
Blood being wheeled quicker and
stronger round than naturally, doth
soon beget a greater proportion of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62337:131"/>
Heat, which by continuation, and
a stronger motion, is suddenly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to a higher degree of heat, that
inflaming the bituminous and sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
parts of the Blood, doth easily
kindle them into violent Flames,
which then is to be called a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>3. That which advances the Blood
and Spirits to a higher degree of Heat,
is the sluggish or slow motion of the
Blood in the Veins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> caused by too
great a plenitude, whereby the Veins
being crammed up, must necessarily
impede it in its motion. Now the
Heart upon those smart Irritations
moves faster and violenter, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the arterial Blood with a fuller
stream into the Veins, than they can
possibly carry it back to the Heart,
which causeth the Heart and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
to beat stronger, or rather vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenter
than before; because it meets
with resistance, namely, the cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Blood, that will not, or cannot
move so easily forward as formerly,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62337:132"/>
from which violenter local motion,
the Heat must necessarily be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
intended, like unto a Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
that striking on a Nail, or any
thing that's hard enough to make
resistance, grows hot upon a few
strokes, whereas striking a twelve-month
together on a Feather-bed,
shall not contract the least warmth.
Whence observe, that the thumping
or strong Pulsations sick People per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in their Heads in Fevers, are
only occasioned by the carotidal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
raised to a higher and more
forcible Pulsation, by the resistance
it finds in striking forward the Blood,
that is thrown into the <hi>Sinus's</hi> of the
<hi>Dura mater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Besides the plenitude, or cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
up of the Veins with Blood,
there is another cause of the retarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and unaptness for motion in the
Blood, which is its separation into
grosser and thinner, heavier and
lighter, bituminous and salin-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial
parts, occasioned by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62337:132"/>
quick and violent motion of
the Blood, in manner not unlike
Milk, separating into Butter and
thin Milk, by being violently moved
in a Chairn. Hence it is, that Blood
let out by Phlebotomy in a Fever,
appears of various Colours and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistencies,
which heretofore and still
is by most Physicians called putrefied
Blood.</p>
               <p>5. The Blood being thus separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into various parts, the bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Particles being very inflamable,
become a Fewel to the febril Fire,
and the salin-mercurial parts turn
acid, which in passing the Heart,
do yet more forcibly stimulate it to
violent motion. Besides this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
motion caused by the pulsati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Heart, there is another in
the Blood it self, which may very
aptly be termed an Ebullition, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Orgasmus,</hi> caused by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
of its alcalious and acid Salts; for
none but a Mad-man would call this
a <hi>Fermentation:</hi> neither are you to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62337:133"/>
judge two motions improper to the
Blood, since the one is as it were <hi>ab
extra,</hi> the other <hi>ab intra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. As the Circulation of the Blood
was the most easie to be found out,
so might the manner and ways of it,
which notwithstanding hitherto
have layn asleep, though this could
scarce have happen'd, unless among
such, as are greater Blockheads than
common Sea-men.</p>
               <p>7. How have they strained to
make their Marks to bear, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that the Blood passeth out of the
Arteries into the Veins, by their <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastomosis,</hi>
or Inosculation into each
other, which is impossible; for were
it so, the constant pulsation of the
Arteries would by the continual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
motion so widen the mouths of
the Veins, whereinto they are inos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated,
that they would either burst,
or cause a <hi>Varix.</hi> Moreover, where
they have pretended an Inosculation,
from the nearness of the Arteries to
the Vein, upon a narrower search
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62337:133"/>
and enquiry, they have been found
divisible. And if an <hi>Anastomosis</hi> were
allowable, they must be found in all
parts of the Body, where the Blood
circulates. Besides, in the <hi>Dura
mater,</hi> where there is so great a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
there ought to be <hi>Anasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moses</hi>
beyond any other parts, and
yet there is not a Vein to be seen near
the <hi>Sinus's,</hi> but at some considerable
distance.</p>
               <p>8. Since this manner of passage
could not well be squared, to answer
all Objections, they take their refuge
to the Pores, which are insensible
passages, that are supposed to be
throughout the whole Body. This
indeed is explaining the Circulation
<hi>per coecos ductus,</hi> and <hi>qualitates conul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi>
their old <hi>asylus ignor antiae.</hi> But
that being granted, the Blood being
<hi>extra vasa,</hi> why doth it not putrefie,
according to the Dictates of <hi>Galen?</hi>
Here they seem to boggle and stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
being willing to pass over the
Matter in silence.</p>

9. Not to detain you longer with
these Impertinencies, you may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Musculs, Veins, Arteries,
Nerves, Membranes, the <hi>Cutis</hi> (which
is no other than a Membrane) Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
Glanduls, and most, if not all the
parts of the Body, to be fibrous, or
to be made up, and consist wholly of a
complication of Fibers, of various fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,
and variously disposed or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
whence the whole Body may
well be termed a Texture. These
fore-mentioned parts being dried in
the Sun, upon laceration, or other
separation of them, or being inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
through a Microscope, their Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres
do plainly appear, which by the
Eye are also manifestly perceived,
like the Hairs of the Head, to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and perforated with a Trunk
in the middle, whence minute bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are dispersed to the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
So that it is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but the Blood circulates, and
passes out of Arteries, through those
small Trunks of the Fibres, to the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62337:134"/>
Veins, having a capillar Artery and
Vein inserted, or rather inosculated
into them, the Trunks being desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for transmission of the Blood,
and the minute Branches for convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nutriment to their minimal Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.
All Tumours, Pustles, and
Discolorations, are occasioned by
Blood, stagnating in the hollow of
the Fibres, which being become gross
and thick, is uncapable of passing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the capillar Veins, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the pulsation of the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
propelling it forward, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
then elevate the Blood stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
in the Fibres into a Tumour,
Pustle, or Discoloration, according
to the proportion of what doth stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
The Heat that accompanieth
some Tumours before, and in Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
is caused by violent pulsati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Arteries, meeting with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
as I have already told you.
The external Pores of the Skin are
the terminations of the Fibres of the
<hi>Cutis,</hi> through which the vertue of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62337:135"/>
Medicines externally applied pass in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the capillar Veins, and so into the
Body; for as I have instanced before,
there is a communication between
all the Fibres, Veins, and Arteries.</p>
               <p>10, Though from these Notions I
could desume Matter enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate
into a large Volume, (by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving
thence the various kinds of
continual and intermittent Fevers)
I judge it at present unnecessary, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the further Search to those ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
lazy Drones that are called
<hi>Conclave-Physicians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The practical use of these Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems
is such, that the greatest Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in Physick may be thereby ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
resolved, which hitherto have
only been controverted without any
satisfactory Decision. As first;
Whether Phlebotomy (or Bleeding)
in continual, and in some intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Fevers, ought to be celebrated?
The whole Herd of <hi>Conclave-Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
unanimously declare, it is the
great Remedy for Cooling, and no
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62337:135"/>
doubt it is; for being oft repeated,
it will infallibly render the Patient
as cold as Marble, as I can testifie by
several of their unhappy Practices;
but how? certainly by tapping off
he Spirits together with the Blood,
which are the efficient cause of
Heat: consequently bleed a man too
oft or too much, and you will kill
him. It's replied, In Fevers there
is a preternatural Heat, occasioned
by the too great abundance of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Spirits, or at least by the great
fury they are in, and therefore they
are to be tamed and diminisht. I
answer, The same Reason will hold,
to indicate Bleeding, until the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
be dead; for being always in a
feverish Heat, until he expires, you
should by the same standard bleed,
until the last hour: but the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
is false; for no man ought
to be murthered by Bleeding; <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
Another false Position encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
these Ideots to Bleeding, <hi>viz.</hi>
That in all Fevers there is a <hi>Plethora
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62337:136"/>
ad vires,</hi> that is to say, there are
more Humours than Nature can ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
insomuch that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a burthen, wherof she ought
to be alleviated by Bleeding. This
Argument resembles the other; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
almost in all Diseases there are
more Humours than Nature can ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
even in pulmonick Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and at the moment of death
in Fevers; for a pound weight of
Skin is too much for a dying Patient
to bear, and would you therefore
flea him?</p>
               <p>11. Being a Physician to a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that had laboured two months
under a chronical Distemper, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
complicated with a symptoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Fever, that would continue a
day or two; another Physician of
great Note was by a Stranger impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon me, to consult with. He
had no sooner examined the Patient,
and felt his Pulse, but comes to me
with a Question in his mouth, Why
did I not bleed my Lord? I answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62337:136"/>
in the beginning of the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
I had caused him to be blooded
several times; but at present his
Lordship having by a thin spare Diet
been kept very low for several weeks,
I saw no occasion there was for it.
He cryed out again, Bleed him, bleed
him; I demanded, for what? T' other
replied, To take off his Fever, it
will cool him; but being askt how,
it gravell'd him. In short, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with an hypothetick Assent,
If you please to kill the Patient, you
may bleed him, and I will leave him
to you. After him several other
Physicians were introduced, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
publickly, the Patient would
die; and some, that he was dead:
yet after all this, the Noble-man
was cured by me, and continues in a
good state of Health. By the way
you are to understand, this happened
at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you see, what Measures
<hi>Conclave-Physicians</hi> take for Bleeding,
whereas an <hi>Empirick,</hi> that doth not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62337:137"/>
pretend to rational Indications, would
have given me much better satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>12. To return to my Theam:
We are not to call that a <hi>Plethora ad
vires,</hi> where a Patient hath been
blooded once or twice, and has ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
from all Food, but thin Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat;
certainly it would be a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to say, a macerated Carcass
has too much Blood in his Veins,
that are fallen flat, and scarce to be
seen; neither can they always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Revulsion, or Derivation, where
there is no urgent Symptom.</p>
               <p>13. It is in Fevers, and in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Distempers where Bleeding is
necessary, you may be safely directed
and guided by the Theorems I have
proposed to you: for supposing a
man at<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ked by a continual Fever,
(which being an universal Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
whereby more are brought to
their untimely end, than by any other
Disease, I do the rather make choice
of for an Instance) the Blood mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62337:137"/>
too slow in the Veins in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
occasions a violent pulsation in the
Arteries, whence arises a preternatural
Heat; here Bleeding is necessarily indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
upon which immediately follows
a more free Circulation, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
an abatement of the preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Heat, and other Symptoms;
also a freer Transpiration, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion
of the Fibres. But in some
space of time, the Pulsation being
spurred on again, by the motion of
the Blood <hi>ab intra,</hi> (as I have said
before) the violent Heat and other
Symptoms return, and therefore in
many a second Bleedieg is indicated,
and sometimes a third, though in
most once or twice opening a Vein
doth suffice in cold Climats, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the fulness of the Vessels.
Having answered the first Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
taken from the violent motion
<hi>ab extra,</hi> the next is to be desumed
from the preternatural motion of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi>
which is to be quieted, by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
the foreign and heterogeneous
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62337:138"/>
Salts in the Blood; but not by a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensical
<hi>Aqua epidemica,</hi> or a stinking
<hi>Spiritus cornu cervi,</hi> or earthly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
as Crabs eyes, Bezoar, Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> among all which Muscle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells
challenge the pre-eminence.
Some little good they may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute;
but towards the curing of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
or malignant Fever, they bear
no more proportion, than a Mouse
towards the removing a Mountain:
and if a man doth sometimes conquer
such a violent Distemper, impute
the Victory rather to the strength of
Nature in the Patient, than such
feeble Medicines. I know your Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
will demand, what Remedies
they are, that are virtuated with a
power to effect so great a Work. I
answer, That the <hi>Materia medica,</hi>
whereout they are to be prepared;
you see one sort every day, if you
look but a little beyond your Nose,
you need not grub for it in the depth;
another you tread upon; and a third
is as common in your Mouth, as the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62337:138"/>
Bread you eat: what they are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
I shall never discover publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
nor commit their Preparation to
any Apothecary; for it's not fit such
Medicines should be abused by every
<hi>Conclave-Physician.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. The <hi>Delirium,</hi> that so oft sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venes
on Fevers, has its source from
Blood, that's too copiously thrown
out of the carotidal Arteries into the
<hi>Sinus's</hi> of the <hi>Crassa meninx,</hi> and the
veins of the Brain, which by exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a preternatural Heat, subverts
the temperament of the Brain. The
truth hereof appears, by the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
I have used on such occasions,
which in half an hours time have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the Patients to their right
Reason, by no other manner of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating,
than by causing a free Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in the Brain.</p>
               <p>Why a sudden Fright, or other
violent Passion, doth sometimes in
Bodies predisposed produce a Fever,
is not explicable by the common
Principles; whereas the application
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62337:139"/>
of this easie Notion, I have now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
renders it most evident, <hi>viz.</hi>
by causing a quick Pulsation.</p>
               <p>15. It is also most manifest, that
those who exhibit strong Sudorificks,
and hot burning Cordials, as <hi>Aq.
epidem. spir. corn. cerv.</hi> &amp;c. in the
beginning of Fevers, are culpable of
male practice, in regard they accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Pulsation, before the Veins are
discharged by Phlebotomy, to give
the arterial Blood a free passage.</p>
               <p>In many other Diseases we shall
find the use of those Theorems great,
though in some you must be furnisht
with another of greater importance
than the former; particularly in a
pulmonick Consumption, and in an
internal Rheumatism, a Distemper
first so named and discovered by me
in my Treatise of the <hi>Scurvey,</hi> where
you may read its Symptoms; to
which I will only add this Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That I have known it to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
Women, upon a suppression or
stopping of their <hi>Fluor albus</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
Medicines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:62337:139"/>
This <hi>Fluor albus</hi> is either thin, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,
and limpid, or thick, cloudy,
and mucous; and either is putrid
and fetid, or imputrid. It is the
suppression of the former, and by a
<hi>Metastasis</hi> thrown upon the Bowels,
causes most dismal shrieking pains in
the Guts, Stomach, or other Entrails,
and oft accompanied with Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
If at any time palliated, it's
very apt vpon some Interval to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.
Whence is to be remarkt, of
how dangerous a consequence an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
Cure may prove, not seldom
costing the Patient her life; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
since <hi>Conclave-Physicians</hi> are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ignorant of Remedies against such
internal Rheumatisms.</p>

the <hi>Basilica,</hi> to all those, whom by
that Argument he hopes to convince
to be his Patients, whether sick or
well; and how some are like to be
managed, this subsequent Narrative
will inform us. It was a continual
Fever, had seized on the Daughter
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62337:140"/>
of a <hi>Chevalier,</hi> who kept his ordinary
Residence at a certain Village, distant
from <hi>Paris</hi> few miles, though the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbiture
of the tender Patient hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be, at a Relations House at
<hi>Charenton,</hi> up the River <hi>Seyne</hi> four
miles, or two by Land. She had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ten <hi>Octobers,</hi> but could not pass
the eleventh of the year, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If you
consider the liveliness of her Features,
or pregnancy of Wit, from which her
Parents could not but be extreamly
happy in their future expectation,
you must imagine, their chiefest care
did center in the choice of a grave,
pious, experienced, and learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,
who by his most diligent and
watchful Attendance, might be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to encounter the feverish Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,
which in plain Terms did
not appear in the least fierce, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant,
unless an ordinary Headach
could render it such. The <hi>Herculean</hi>
Remedy was <hi>Iesuits Bark,</hi> steept in
small Beer, (such hellish bitter stuff,
as they brew about <hi>Paris</hi>) and this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62337:141"/>
to be used (<hi>pro Potu ordinario</hi>) as oft
as she was a dry. For a revulsion of
those velli<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ating Steams, that moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
up to the Brain, a potent Attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive
of some dry resiny Powder, one
degree above Saw-dust, was applied
to the Soals of her Feet; but how the
notion of this kind of Attraction ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
with Pulsion, now wholly in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
I am to seek. The success of
these Administrations was great; for
the Distemper did not accrew in the
least grain, though the continuance
did throw <hi>Monsieur le Docteur</hi> on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> representing it might
probably be a <hi>verminous Fever,</hi> and
therein the Doctor and the Lady, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Patient, both jumpt in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion;
for I never knew a Woman
contradict Worms in Children, though
they complained only of Corns on
their Toes. This was a sufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
to animate the <hi>Medico,</hi> to a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of eight grains of <hi>Mercurius
dulcis,</hi> and six of <hi>Diagryd,</hi> which was
confessed, though possibly it might
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62337:141"/>
be ten or twelve grains of Mercury;
for the Bill was either taken off the
File, or Direction given verbally. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
two or three days Interval, a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petatur</hi>
of Mercury was order'd, to
inforce the former, and produce those
potent efects, for which a single Dose
was incapable, And to the intent the
poor little Sufferer might arrive with
greater speed, to the happy Port of
Health, the <hi>Iesuits Bark</hi> was still to
be continued for her ordinary Drink.
Now who would have thought, but
that swift Mercury, agitating the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvian
Bark,</hi> would soon have wafted
this deplorable Passenger, to the <hi>Cape
of Good hope?</hi> The truth is, Mercury
was too boistrous, linking the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Bark,</hi> before she was got half Seas
over; for soon after the last Dose,
the Sufferer's Mouth and Face began
to swell, her Throat to be sore, her
Breath to stink, Teeth to loosen,
Spittle to ouse plentifully from her
Lips, Drought, Heat, difficulty of
Respiration, furring of the Tongue,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62337:142"/>
and all other Symptoms to duplicate;
for here was a great Drought and Heat
occasioned by the Fever, and a far
greater Drought and Heat added and
caused by the <hi>Mercurial salivation,</hi>
which daily (as is usual) increased,
insomuch that here was fifteen or six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Cloaths wetted in four an twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hours. This duplication of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Symptoms, concentrating chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
about the Throat and Mouth, made
such eating and painful Ulcers, that
a Gangrene ensued. Consider what
a miserable spectacle this was for the
worthy Parents and Friends to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold;
she being passionately beloved
by all that knew her. The Groans,
Shrieks, Outcries, and Signs, were
inexpressibly piercing. It was high
time to expel <hi>Sotos</hi> and <hi>Devotos,</hi> and
call for one that should bring Help
from the Stars, (she being past all
sublunary Assistance) who proved
to be an Apothecary Doctorated,
and honorated, an immense Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and wonderfully well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62337:142"/>
with the Celestial Inhabitants.
But alas good Man! as the Scheam
represented here, his chiefest Aid
consisted in pitying the Patient, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tidings of Death, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
an excellent Surgeon, whose
Inspection immediately discovered a
Gangrene in the Mouth, which by him
being cut out, the Bone appeared
bare to view. <hi>En fin,</hi> God Almighty
out of his infinite mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
was pleased to release her Innocent
Soul, from her macerated, tortured,
and lacerated Body, and take her to
himself. I do not question, but in
the Scheam erected by the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Astrologue, <hi>Mercury</hi> was the
Ascendent and Horoscope, looking
with a jealous eye on Dame <hi>Luna,</hi> in
Copulation with old <hi>Saturn</hi> in the

(the cause of the Fever no doubt)
embracing the other Whore <hi>Venus</hi> in

than the eighth. <hi>Mercury</hi> being in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn,</hi>

in revenge of the inconstant she-Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
to destroy all Women-kind, that,

so that the <hi>Astro-Doctor</hi> might very

appearing so full of Frowns, for

               <p>Leaving remote Causes, it's not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material
to calculate such as are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and immediate; but before I enter
further into the Merits of this Cause,
give me leave to ask a question in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest;
<hi>Did Quick-silver or the Fever kill
the Patient?</hi> you may possibly answer
the Question, by asking another, <hi>viz.</hi>
supposing a man in an high Fever, and
on the ninth day, his Wife to quit
scores, gives him a gentle Pat with a
Mallet, on the side of his Head; <hi>did
the Fever kill him,</hi> for it was on the

in the Law will unanimously an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
you, It was the <hi>Mallet; Ergo,</hi>
it was the <hi>Quick-silver.</hi> But how.?
upon that I will serve you by and by.
<hi>Would not the</hi> Jesuits Bark <hi>alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Mercury, have given the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
her last Dispatches, being exhibited
in a continual Fever?</hi> The first Part
of the <hi>Conclave</hi> doth plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
the Affirmative. Lastly, <hi>The</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
Bark, <hi>and Mercury sublimate dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed,
being both killing Medicines in
the precedent Case, which of 'em did the

<hi>Mallet;</hi> though beyond all peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had only the Bark or Mercury
singly be offer'd, the error of either
of 'em might have been retrievable. I
confess of the two, the prescribing of
the Bark was the most preposterous;
for had Mercury been directed with
a gentle Purgative, to carry it off, in
a verminous Fever, (<hi>caeteris indicanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>)
it would have been very practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
but this had only the appearance
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62337:144"/>
of an ordinary autumnal Fever, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by living in a Waterish Air<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
near a great River, upon the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a hot Sulphurous Summer,
the Cure whereof ought to have been
performed by Method and Remedies,
not yet arrived to <hi>Sotos,</hi> or his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
knowledge.</p>
               <p>Next, let's enumerate the Errors
committed in this case; First, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
of the Bark in a continual Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Secondly, Advising a violent scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniat
Purgative, in a continual Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which must necessarily hinder the
digestion of Humours, rake up a Mud,
that lay dormant, occasion a new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation
and <hi>Orgasmus,</hi> and reduce
the Blood to a greater Crudity, than
at the first kindling of the Fever.
Thirdly, The mixing of <hi>Mercurius
dulcis</hi> with Scammony, instead of some
gentle laxative Electuary, that would
have entangled the Mercury, and slipt
easily through the Guts, carrying the
Mercury clear off with it; whereas
Scammony before it comes to purge,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62337:144"/>
raiseth an high Ebullition, whereby
the Mercurial Particles are dispersed
throughout the Body, and lodged in
the Glanduls and Pores of the tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Lympha,</hi> which the Stools after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
provoked by the Scammony,
do not carry off; so that <hi>Sotos</hi> was
extreamly mistaken, if for his excuse
he pleads, he gave Mercury with a
strong Purgative, to throw it off.
Fourthly. The Capital error of all is,
the exhibiting of Mercury upon, and
with the <hi>Iesuits Bark,</hi> a most potent
Adstringent retaining and binding the
Mercury within the Body, stopping
all its Avenues and Outlets, so as there
can be no discharge or vent by Stool,
Urine or Sweat: but Mercury, a fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Dragon, or mineral Mastif, being
thus pent, lockt in, and provoked,
will not stick to take a Patient by the
Throat, tearing and worrying those
parts, until he is strangled; and
what is more, the Humours by being
lockt up by the <hi>Iesuits Bark,</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
extreamly inflamed, acrimonious,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62337:145"/>
and malignant. No wonder, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forced up to the Throat by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
they thus lacerated, devoured,
and gangrened those most tender
Glanduls. After all, as a Merchant
upon a great loss at Sea, or otherwise,
doth next day appear more gay and in
greater gallantry than ever, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
his Dealers, that the Report is
false, or at least that his loss is less to
him than a Flea bite; though it breaks
his Back within a week after, that is,
as soon as he has taken up of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
to the full proportion of his
Credit: even so this great Doctor,
without the least resentment of the
Misfortune, assumed a brisker hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and made a greater appearance
among his Brethren of the Faculty,
and in all publick Places, than before,
as if he accused the Friends of the
deceased of Ingratitude, for throwing
him off, that had so faithfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
his Devoirs, conceiving with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
that time wears off Black into inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
white. Certainit is, his good fortune
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62337:145"/>
exceeds that of <hi>Vesalius,</hi> the great Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>omist,
who having sent a <hi>Spanish</hi>
Don to his Ancestors, to testifie to his
Relations, that an incurable Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
was <hi>Causa mortis,</hi> lost no time in
dissecting of him; for upon the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Breast, his heart was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to palpitate and move; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the Standers by immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applied themselves for Justice to the
<hi>Inquisition,</hi> with an Accusation, that
<hi>Vesalius</hi> had barbarously murther'd
their Kinsman. His <hi>Catholick Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,</hi>
by using his utmost Interest with
the Inquisitors, at length prevailed to
exchange their sentence of Death into
penance of a Pilgrimage to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
in which expedition he dyed. To
return to my Narrative; though I
cannot offer the least Argument in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation
of so erroneous a Practice;
yet it's possible, the Doctors Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
Apprentice, (to whose negligent
care the making up of Medicines is
ordinarily committed) might aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the Mischief; either by mistaking
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62337:146"/>
the weight, wherewith the <hi>Mercurius
Dulcis</hi> was weighed; or by adding
three or four grains more than was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed;
or by making use of <hi>Mercury</hi>
ill prepared; or that which was kept
too long, and that probably (as most
of 'em do) in a Paper, through the
Pores whereof a subtil nitrous Salt is
attracted out of the Air, which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Body of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> doth
render it again corrosive; insomuch,
that ten grains of such shall raise a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation
sooner, than three or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
grains of <hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and well prepared.</p>
