            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THe Speeches of dying men are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; the Speeches of dying Christians are much more remarkable; How re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable then are the Speeches of dying Witnesses for Christ? It is rationally expected that dying men, much more that dying Christians, and most of all that dying Witnesses for Christ should speak best at last.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>These are the last words of</hi> David, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Sam. 23.1</note> It is their last. And the Sun shineth brightest at setting. They are immediately to give in their last account. They are upon the borders of Eternity. And the motions of Nature are more intense, as they draw nearer the Center. To be sure, Saints are most heavenly, when nearest Heaven. Rivers, the nearer the Sea, the sooner are met by the Tide. We have good Scripture-ground to expect that dying Christians, especially dying Witnesses for Christ, should have extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary assistances from on high for their last Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses: That the Wine of the Spirit should be strongest in them at their last. They have Gods Word for it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.19.</note> 
                     <hi>That in that hour it shall be given them, what they shall speak:</hi> for it is not they that speak but the Spirit of their Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:64438:5"/>One observeth that when <hi>Stephen</hi> was to deliver his last speech, and to suffer, he was filled with the Holy Ghost, so that all that sate in the Council, looking stedfastly on <hi>Stephen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 6.5.</note> saw his face, as if it had been the face of an Angel. His soul was so warmed by the love of God, that he looked both his Adversaries and the tempestuous approaching Storm out of countenance. When he was stoned he got a larger sight. He saw the Heavens opened, and his Majestick Glorious Master, the light-giving Diamond of Heaven,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 7.55</note> standing at his Fathers right hand. And this he got, no doubt, as for himself, so to hearten all those that were to come after, he being the first Martyr after Christ. Hence it hath been often found, that their last Speeches have been Oraculous and Prophetical. <hi>Zenophon</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonates <hi>Cyrus</hi> as inspired, whilst he is breathing out his last requests. The nearer we return to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Divinity (as <hi>Plotinus</hi> speaketh) the more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine we grow. One observeth from a Scripture instance, That what hath been asserted by dying Witnesses, hath most speedily come to pass. <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah</hi> told the children of Israel,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 24.20, 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Because ye have for saken the Lord, he hath also forsaken you.</hi> For this he was immediately stoned, and the Lord sealed his Word very speedily afterwards; <hi>For the Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians coming with a small company against them, the Lord delivered a very great multitude into their hands, and so without delay in their sight sealed the words of his dying Witness</hi> Zachariah. And why his word sooner then <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s, <hi>Ieremiah</hi>'s, <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s? &amp;c. By them he pleaded much longer with his Apostatizing Church. I know none but this: It was the Lords pleasure; and to shew his respect to dying Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, that he would have what they say taken
<pb facs="tcp:64438:5"/>
special notice of. It may be, that he might shew, that whatever fail, the words of dying Witnesses shall not fall to the ground. It is true, we must not lay such weight upon these sayings, as we must lay upon Scripture prophesies;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9</note> for though such say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings may be true prophesies, yet we are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly assured that these are prophesies, till they be accomplished: yet their sayings, while dying for and in the Lord, do give good encouragement to them that remain alive, and so to be much esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them; whether they respect the honour of God, or the good of souls.</p>
                  <p>The last Speeches of Christs dying Witnesses, have extorted even from Heathens acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the honour of God,<note place="margin">Vere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnus est Deus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianorum Calocerius</note> that truly the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans God is a great God: yea, by them sinners have been converted. <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> and others by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the end the Martyrs made, were brought out of love with the wayes of sin, and in love with the wayes of holiness.</p>
                  <p>These Speeches (here collected) are called <hi>Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Songs</hi> for their remarkableness, <hi>A Cloud of Witnesses,</hi> and <hi>The Sufferers Mirrour</hi> for their use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.

death. How can the best of us read these passages, without shame for our low attainments, for our little proficiency in the School of Christ? How unlike are our faces to the faces in this Mirrour? How self-denying were they? How selfish are we? How crucified to the world were they? How much glued thereunto are we? How easie was it for them to chuse the greatest Sufferings, rather then the least Sin? How hard is it for us not to chuse the greatest Sin, rather then the least Suffering? How willing were they to part with all for Christ? How unwilling are we to part with littles for Christ? What an honour did they esteem it to suffer for Christ, to be chain'd, to be whipt, to be wrackt, to be halter'd, to be stak'd for Christ? Have we such esteems of sufferings for Christ, and of such suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Are not we ashamed of our glory? How pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient were they under the greatest tortures? How impatient are we under very little troubles? How hot was their love to Christ, his Truths, Ordinances, People? How cold is ours? How zealous were they for the Honour of God? How luke-warm are we? How magnanimous were they? How cowardly and dastardly are we? How humble were they? How proud are we? How broken-hearted were they? How hard-hearted are we? What sympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing spirits had they? How little fellow-feeling is there now among Christians? How active were they for the glory of God, and good of souls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their sufferings? How slothful are we? And how little do we for either under our sufferings? How strong was their Faith? How weak is ours? How fearless were they of man, who can only kill the body? How fearful are we? How many of these Worthies attained unto Assurance, and had their
<pb facs="tcp:64438:6"/>
Evidences for Heaven clear? How are the most of us in the dark, as to an interest in God, and a right and title to Glory? How willing and desirous were they to die, even a violent death? How loth are we to die, even a natural death? How did they without the least fear play on the hole of this Asp, and with much courage put their hand into the Den of this Cockatrice? But how doth the fear of this King of Terrors make us subject to bondage? Thus they are useful to shame us: They are also usefull to prepare us to die, especially a violent death.

shall utter that, which scarce any will believe: I have found a nest of honey, an honey-comb in the entrails of a Lion. In the deep dark Dungeon I have found a Paradise of pleasure. In the place of sorrow and death, tranquility of hope and life: where others do weep, I do rejoyce; when others do shake and tremble, there I have found plenty of strength and boldness: in strait bands, and cold irons I have had rest: Behold he that was once far from me, now is present with me; whom once I could scarce feel, I now see most apparently; whom once I saw afar off, now I behold near at hand, whom once I hungred for, the same now approacheth and reacheth his hand unto me; he doth comfort me, and heapeth me up with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; he driveth away all bitterness; he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streth strength and courage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — O how easie and sweet is the Lords yoke! Learn, ye well-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, how amiable the Lord is, how meek, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, who visiteth his servants in temptations; neither disdaineth he to keep company with us in such vile and stinking Caves. Will the blind and incredulous world (think you) believe this? or rather will it not say thus? No, thou wilt never be able to abide long the burning heat, the pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardness of that place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The rebukes and frowning faces of great men how wilt thou suffer? Dost not thou consider thy pleasant Countrey, the Riches of the World, thy Kinsfolk, the delicate pleasures and Honours of this life? Dost thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the solace of thy Sciences, and fruit of all thy Labours? Wilt thou thus lose all thy labours which thou hast hitherto sustained? Finally, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou not death which hangeth over thee? O what a fool art thou, which for one words speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mayest salve all this and wilt not! But now to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64438:11"/>
answer: Let this blind world hearken to this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, What heat can there be more burning, then that fire which is prepared for thee hereafter? What things more hard, and sharp, and crooked then this present life which we lead? What thing more odious and hateful then this world here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent? And let these worldly men here answer me. What Countrey can we have more sweet then the Heavenly Countrey above? What treasures more rich or precious then everlasting life? and who be our Kinsmen but they which hear the Word of God? Where be greater riches or dignities more honourable then in Heaven. And as touching the Sciences, let this foolish world consider, Be not they ordained to know God? whom unless we do know, all our labours, our night-watchings, our studies, and all our enterprises here serve to no purpose, all is but labour lost. Furthermore let the miserable worldly men answer me. What remedy or safe refuge can there be unto him who lacks God, who is the life &amp; medicine of all men, &amp; how can he be said to fly from death, when he himself is already dead in sin? If Christ be the way, verity &amp; life, how can there be any life without Christ? The solely heat of the Prison to me is coldness; the cold winter to me is a fresh spring in the Lord. He that feareth not to be burned in the fire, how will he fear the heat of weather? Or what careth he for the pinching frost, which burneth for the love of the Lord? The place is sharp and tedious to them that be guilty, but to the innocent it is mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifluous. Here droppeth the delectable dew, here floweth the pleasant <hi>Nectar,</hi> here runneth the sweet milk, here is plenty of all good things. —In this world there is no mansion firm to me, and therefore I will travel up to the New <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>

which is in Heaven, and which offereth it self to me without paying any Fine or Income.—I have travelled hitherto, laboured, and sweat early and late, watching day and night, and now my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels begin to come to effect.—What man can now cavil, that these our labours are lost, which have followed and found out the Lord and Maker of the World, and which have changed death with life?—If to die in the Lord be not to die, but to live most joyfully, where is this wretched worldly Rebel, which blameth us of folly, for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving away our lives unto death?

now, and what it shall suffer in the later Times, by the subtilties of Antichrist and his Followers, the cruel Members of Satan; and it manifesteth what Promises, what Crowns, and what Glory the said Congregation shall have, after this present Conflict with the Enemies, that the promised Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards might quicken the hearts of those that the Torments feareth. — Unto St. <hi>Iohn</hi> were these Mysteries revealed, when he was by the Emperor <hi>Domitianus</hi> exiled for his Preaching, into the Isle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> at the cruel Complaints of the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Priests and Bishops, and by him writ and sent out of the same exile into the Congregations. — The Contents of this Book are from no place more freely and clearly opened, nor told forth more boldly, then out of exile. — Flattery dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at home, and sucking there still his Mothers breasts, may never tell out the truth, he seeth so many dangers on every side, as displeasure of Friends, decay of Name, loss of Goods, offence of Great men, and jeopardy of Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The forsaken wretched sort hath the Lord provided alwayes to rebuke the world of sin, hypocrisie, blindness; for nought is it therefore that he hath exiled a certain number of believing Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Realms of <hi>England,</hi> of the which afflicted Family my faith is that I am one.

His Servants have they impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, tormented, and slain, having his Verity in

much more contempt then before. We looked for a time of peace, (saith the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi>) and we fare not the better at all; we waited for a time of health, and we find here nothing else but trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

To tell them freely of their wicked works by the Scriptures, I have exiled my self for ever from mine own native Countrey, Kindred, Friends, Acquaintance, (which are the great delights of this life) and am well contented for the sake of Christ, and for the comfort of my Brethren there, to suffer poverty, penury, abjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reproof, and all that shall come beside.—Here are we admonished before-hand of two most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous evils; neither to agree with those Tyrants, that wage war with the Lamb in his elect Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, nor yet to obey those deceitful Bishops, that in hypocrisie usurp the Churches Titles. — Of those hath our heavenly Lord premonished us in this heavenly work of his, and graciously called us away from their abominations, lest we should be partakers of their sins, and so receive of their plagues.

O mighty power of the most High! which I also most miserable sinner have often tasted and felt. Before I came to Christ I had likewise spent all I had upon ignorant Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians. —They appointed me Fastings, Watchings, buying of Pardons, and Masses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But at last I heard speak of Jesus, even then, when the New Testament was first set out by <hi>Erasmu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>.</hi> At first I was allured to read, rather for the <hi>Latine</hi> (having heard it was eloquently done) then for the Word of God. At the first reading I hit upon this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of St. <hi>Paul, (O most sweet and comfortable sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to my soul)</hi> in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. It is a true saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. This sentence through Gods instruction and inward working, did so exhilarate my heart, being before wounded with the guilt of my sins, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64438:18"/>
that my bruised bones leapt for joy. After this the Scripture began to be more pleasant to me then the honey or the honey-comb. Therein I learned that all my Travels, all my Fasting and Watching, all the redemption of Masses and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, without faith in Christ, were but a hasty and swift running out of the right way, or else much like the vesture made of Fig-leaves, wherewithall <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> went about in vain to cover their nakedness, and could never obtain quietness and rest, till they believed in the promise of God, that Christ the seed of the Woman should break the Serpents head. Neither could I be relieved or ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the sharp stingings of my sins, before I was taught of God, that even as <hi>Moses</hi> exalted the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the Desart, so shall the Son of man be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, that all which believe on him, should not perish, but have everlasting life. As soon as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to taste and savour this heavenly Lesson, which none can teach but God onely, I desired the Lord to encrease my faith. And at last I desired nothing more, then that I being so comforted by him, might be strengthened by his holy Spirit and grace from above, to teach the wicked his wayes, which are mercy and truth, that the wicked may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto him by me, who sometimes was also wicked.—Accordingly I did teach, and set forth Christ, being made for us by God his Father, our Wisdome, Righteousness, Sanctification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. Who was made sin for us, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Sacrifice for sin, that we through him should be made the righteousness of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.

which is by faith in Christ, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 3. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as this hunger and thirst was wont to be quenched with the fulness of mans righteousness. —Therefore oftentimes have I spoken of those works, exhorting all men not so to cleave to them, as they being satisfied therewith, should loath or wax weary of Christ.

But who is he that would be a Traitor, or maintain a Traitor against your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty? Sure no man can do it without the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure of the eternal God. The Doctrine of the Gospel teacheth all obedience to Rulers, and not Sedition; and such as have preached the Word of God onely, have never been the movers of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience or rebellion against Princes, but they have been ready to suffer with all patience what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Tyranny any Power would minister unto them, giving all people example to do the same; whereas the Papists exempt the Pope and Priests from being bound to obey Magistrates. Yea, as to the people they teach, that the words requiring Subjection are a Counsel, and not a Command; and that the Popes Authority is sufficient to Dispense with all the Commandments of God. — Wherefore most gracious Prince, I lowly and meerly desire your Majesty to Judge between the Bishops and me, which of us is truest faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest to God and to your Majesty.</p>

                        <p>To burn me or to destroy me (saith he in his Defence of the Two and twentieth Article) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so greatly profit them; for when <hi>I</hi> am dead, the Sun, and the Moon, and the Stars, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yea and also Stones shall defend this Cause against them, rather then the Verity should pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. — As for me I do promise them here by this present Writing, and by the fidelity I owe to my Prince, that if they will be bound to our noble Prince, after the manner of his Law, and after good conscience and right, that they shall do me no violence, nor wrong, but discuss and dispute these Articles, and all other that I have written after the holy Word of God, and by Christs holy Scripture with me, then will I (as soon as I may know it) present my self unto our most noble Prince to prove these things by Gods Word against you all. —</p>

                           <pb n="49" facs="tcp:64438:33"/>He also writ unto King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Treatise to prove from the Scriptures of Truth, and out of the Writings of the Fathers, that faith onely justifieth before God. Prefacing it thus, Now if your Grace do not take upon you to hear the Disputation of this Article out of the ground of holy Scripture, my Lords the Bishops will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it, before they read it, as their manner is to do with all things, that please them not, and which they understand not, and then cry they, Heresie, Heresie, an Heretick, an Heretick, he ought not to be heard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He writ also several other Treatises, as what the Church is, what the Keyes of the Church be, and to whom they were given. Against free-will, that it is lawful for all men to read the holy Scriptures, that mens constitutions, which are not grounded in Scripture, bind not the Conscience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which Treatise he tells us, there be two manners of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; a Temporal, and a Spiritual Power. The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral is committed to Magistrates; in this Power the King is chief and full Ruler, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Unto this Power must we be obedient in all things that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the ministration of this present life, and of the Commonwealth, not onely for avoiding of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, but for conscience sake. So that if this Power command any thing of Tyranny against right and law (alwayes provided it repugne not against the Gospel, nor destroy our Faith) our Charity must needs suffer it. — Nevertheless if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee any thing against right, or do thee any wrong, if thou canst by any reasonable and quiet means<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without sedition, insurrection, or breaking of the common Peace save thy self, or avoid his Tyranny, thou mayest do it with good Conscience. —But in no wise mayest thou make any resistance
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64438:34"/>
with sword or with hand, but obey, except thou canst avoid as I have shewed thee. — But now it will be enquired, if it please the King to condemn the New Testament in English, and to command that none of his Subjects shall have it under dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, whether they be bound to obey this Command or no? To this he answers (having shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed why the King should not lay any such Command on his Subjects) If the King forbid the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any of Christs Sacraments, or the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word of God, or any other thing that is against Christ, under a temporal pain, or under the pain of death, men should first make faithful prayers to God, and then intercede the King for a release of the Command. If he will not do it, they shall keep their Testament, with all other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Christ, and let the King exercise his Tyranny (if they cannot flee) and in no wise under pain of damnation shall they withstand him with violence, but suffer patiently, and leave the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of it to their heavenly Father, which hath a scourge to tame those Bedlams with, when he sees his time: Neither shall they deny Christs Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, nor forsake it before the Prince, lest they run the danger of being denied by Christ before his Father. — This may be proved by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Apostles, when the High Priests of the Temple commanded <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> that they should no more Preach and Teach in the Name of Jesus:<note place="margin">

                        <p>At the Stake Dr. <hi>Barnes</hi> began with this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation following: I am come hither to be burned as an Heretick, and you shall hear my belief, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you shall perceive what erroneous opinions I hold.— I believe in the holy and blessed Trinity, three Persons and one God, that cteated and made all the World, and that this blessed Trinity sent down the Second Person Jesus Christ into the womb of the most blessed and purest Virgin <hi>Mary, &amp;c.</hi> I believe that without the consent of mans will or power, he was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and took flesh of her, and that he suffered hunger, thirst, cold, and other passions of our body, (sin except) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I do believe that he lived here among us, and after he had preached and taught his Fathers Will, he suffered the most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and cruel Death for me and all mankind. And I do believe that this his Death and Passion was the sufficient Price and Ransome for the sin of all the World; And I do believe that through his Death he overcame the Devil, Sin, Death, and Hell, and that there is none other satisfaction unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but this his Death and Passion onely; and that no work of man did deserve any thing of God, but only his Passion, as touching our justification; for I acknowledge the best work that ever I did is impure and unperfect. (Herewithal he cast abroad his Arms, and desired God to forgive him his Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes)
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64438:35"/>
Wherefore I trust in no good work that ever I did, but onely in the Death of Christ, and I do not doubt but through him to inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. — The Sheriffe hastening him to make an end, he turned to the people and desired all men to forgive him, and if he had said any evil at any time unadvisedly, whereby he had offended any man, or given any occasion of evil, that they would forgive it him, and amend that evil they took of him, and to bear witness, that he detested and abhorred all evil Opinions and Doctrines against the Word of God, and that he died in the Faith of Jesus Christ, by whom he doubted not to be saved.</p>

                        <p>In his Letter to <hi>William Tyms.</hi>—Satan hath two great pieces of Ordinance to shoot at you, with the which he cannot hurt you, because you have two bul-warks to defend you. The first of these terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Guns that he hath shot at you is fear and infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, for the uglesomness of death, and horrour of your many and great sins. But this pellet is easily put away with the sure shield of faith in the most precious death and blood-shedding of our dear Lord and onely Saviour, Jesus Christ, whom the Father hath given to us wholly to be ours for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and with him hath given us all things, as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, so that though we be never so great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet Christ is made unto us holiness, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and justification; He hath clothed us all his merits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and taken to himself all our sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that if any should be now condemned for the same, it must needs be Jesus Christ, who hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them upon him. But indeed he hath made sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for them to the uttermost, so that for his sake they shall never be imputed to us, if they were a thousand times more then they be.</p>
                        <p>The other pestilent Piece he shooteth off at you is, to provoke you to put some part of your trust and confidence in yourself, and in your own holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and righteousness, that you may that way rob God of his glory, and Christ of the honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64438:40"/>
of his death; but blessed be the Lord God, you have also a full strong Bul-work to beat back this pestilent Pellet, even the pure Law of God, which proveth the best of us all damnable sinners in the light of God, and that our best works are polluted, in such sort as the Prophet describes them, with the which manner of speaking, our free-will Pharisees are much offended, for it fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all mans righteousness to the ground.</p>

Secondly, if I shall enter into bonds, covenant and promise to appear, I shall do nothing but excuse, colour, and cloak their wickedness, and indanger my self nevertheless,

being bound by my promise to appear. — After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward debating the matter with my self, these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations came into my head. I have from time to time with good conscience (God I take to record) moved all such as I had conference with to be no dalliers in Gods matters, but to shew themselves after so great a light and knowledge, hearty, earnest, constant, and stable in so manifest a truth, and not to give place one jot contrary to the same. Now thought I, if I shall withdraw my self, and make any shifts to pull my own neck out of the Coller, I shall give great offence to my weak Brethren in Christ, and advantage to the enemies to slander Gods Word. It will be said, he hath been a great emboldner of others to be earnest and fervent, to fear no worldly perils and dangers, but he himself will give no such example. Wherefore I thought it my bounden duty both to God and man, being (as it were) by the great goodness of God called and appointed hereunto, to set aside all fear, perils and dangers, all worldly respects and considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and like as I had before, according to the measure of my small gift, within the compass of my vocation and calling, from the bottome of my heart unfeignedly moved, exhorted, and perswaded all that pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Do you think (said the Bishop) that the Holy Ghost hath given you such an illumination, that the truth should onely be revealed to you, and to none other. God forbid Sir (said Mr. <hi>Grange</hi>) I should have any such thought. I am not of the mind of those Dreamers, who brag of their having particular Revelations of the Holy Spirit, but I speak of an ordinary and general Revelation, such as is taught us out of the Bible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

What is then (said he) requried of a Christian? To believe (said she) in God the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, three Persons and one God. What (said he) is there nothing else required or looked for in a Christian, but to believe in him?<note place="margin">

Yes verily (said she) <hi>Faith</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> saith) <hi>onely justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.</hi> Why (said he) St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>If I have all faith without love, it is nothing.</hi> True (said she) for how can I love him, whom I trust not? or how can I trust him, whom I love not? Faith and love go both together, and yet love is comprehended in faith. How must we love our Neighbour? (said he) To love our Neighbour (said she) is to feed the hungry, to cloath the naked, and give drink to the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and to do to him as we would do to our selves. Why then (said he) it is necessary unto salvation to do good works also, and it is not sufficient onely to believe. It is meet (said she) that a Christian in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that he follows his Master Christ to do good works, yet may we not say, that they profit to our salvation; for when we have done all, we be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable servants, and faith onely in Christs blood saveth us. How many Sacraments are there? (said he) Two (said she) The one the Sacrament of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme, by which I am washed with water, and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated by the Spirit, and that washing is a token to me that I am a child of God: the other the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There are seven (said he) By what Scripture (said she) find you that. Well (said he) we will talk of that hereafter. What do you receive in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper? Do you not receive the very body and blood of Christ? No surely (said she) I believe that the Supper I neither receive flesh nor blood, but Bread and Wine, which Bread, when it is broken, and Wine, when it is drunken, putteth me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, how that for my sins, the Body of Christ was broken, and his Blood shed on the Cross,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64438:85"/>
and with that Bread and Wine I receive the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that come by the breaking of his Body, and shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Blood for our sins on the Cross. Why (said he) doth not Christ speak these words, <hi>Take, eat, this is my Body</hi>? Require you any plainer words? Doth he not say it is his Body? I grant he saith so (said she) and so he saith, <hi>I am the Vine, I am the Door,</hi> and yet is not the Vine, or the Door. Doth nor St. <hi>Paul</hi> say,<note place="margin">

It is the Book of the Law of the Lord. It is his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament and last Will which he bequeathed unto us wretches, which shall lead you to the path of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal joy; and if you with a good mind read it, and with an earnest mind do purpose to follow it, it shall bring you to an immortal and everlasting life.

the Law of the Lord God. Live still to die, that you by death may purchase eternal life. Trust not that the tenderness of your age shall lengthen your life: the young die (if God call) assoon as the old. Labour alwayes to learn to die, defie the world, deny the Devil, and despise the flesh, and delight your self onely in the Lord. Be penitent for your sins, but yet despair not; be strong in faith, and yet presume not. Desire with St. <hi>Paul to be dissolved, and to be with Christ,</hi> with whom, even in death, there is life. Be like the good Servant, and even at mid-night be waking, least when death cometh, and stealeth upon you, as a thief in the night, you be with the evil Servant found sleeping, and least for lack of oyl ye be found like the foolish women, and like him that had not on the Wedding Garment, and then ye be cast out from the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Rejoyce in Christ, as I do. Follow the steps of your Master Christ, and take up your Cross. Lay your sins on his back, and alwayes embrace him. And as concerning my death, rejoyce as I do, that I shall be delivered of this corruption, and put on incorruption; for I am assured, that I shall for loosing of a mortal life, win an immortal life, the which I pray God grant you, and send you of his grace to live in his fear, and to die in the true Christian Faith, from the which (in Gods Name) I exhort you that you never swarve, neither for hope of life, nor fear of death; for if you will deny his truth for to lengthen your life, God will deny you, and yet shorten your dayes. And if you will cleave unto him, he will prolong your dayes to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and his glory; to the which glory God bring me now, and you hereafter, when it shall please him to call you.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of Idolatry, which most of all stinks in Gods Nostrils, and hath been of all good men detested from the beginning of the world, for the which what Kingdomes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God hath punished with most terrible plagues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the utter subversion of them, is manifestly to be seen through the whole Bible; yea, for this he draadfully plagued his own people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But how he hath preserved those that abhorred superstition and idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is also to be seen from the beginning, out of what great danger he hath delivered them; yea, when all hope of deliverance was past, as touching their expectation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I exhort you also in the bowels of Christ, that you will exercise, and be stedfast in Prayer, the onely mean to obtain of God whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we desire, so it be askt in Faith. O what no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things do we read in Scripture, that have been obtained through fervent Prayer! — What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever you desire of God in Prayer, ask it for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ's sake, for whom and in whom God hath promised to give us all things necessary. Though what we ask come not by and by, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue still knocking, and he will at length open his treasures of mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — Yet once again I warn you, that ye continue fervent in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

It was a wonder to see with what words, with what Eloquence, Arguments, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and with what confidence he answered his Adversaries, and maintained his own Cause: that it is to be lamented that so fine a wit had strayed into the study of Heresie, if it be true that was objected against him. — When it was refused that he should first plead his own Cause, and then answer to the railings of Adversaries, he said, <hi>How great is this iniquity, that when I have been three hundred and forty dayes in most hard prisons, in

When it was demanded what he could object to the Articles against him? It is almost incredible to consider how cunningly he answered, and with what Arguments he defended himself. He never spake one word unworthy of a good man; that if he thought in his heart, as he spake with his tongue, no cause of death could have been against him, no not of the meanest offence.

As all the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets teach, and Christ commanded <hi>Peter, Iohn</hi> 20. and <hi>Paul</hi> all the Bishops and Priests of his time, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. — Christ left nothing untaught, but as a good Doctor manifested unto his Audience all things necessary for the health of man, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. — He gave also his Apostles and Disciples after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection commandment to preach, and likewise what they should preach, <hi>Go into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature, teaching them to observe what I have commanded,</hi> Matt. 28. — As they did most sincerely and plainly without all glosses or additions of their own inventions, and were as testimonies of the Truth, and not the Authors thereof. — Alwayes in their Doctrine they taught the thing that Christ first taught and Gods holy Spirit inspired them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles never took upon them to be Christ's Vicar in the Earth, nor to be his Lieutenant; But said, <hi>Let a men so account of us, as of the Ministers of Christ, and Stewards of the Mysteries of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.1. And in the same Epistle the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> hiddeth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to follow him in nothing, but where he followed Christ, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. They mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred not in the Church, as though Christ was absent, although his most glorious Body was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted into the Heavens above, but as present, that alwayes governeth his Church with his Spirit of Truth, as he promised, <hi>Matth. ult. Behold I will be with you to the end of the world.</hi> In the absence of his Body he hath commended the protection and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64438:103"/>
governance of his Church to the Holy Ghost, one and the same God with the Father and himself. — It was no little pain that Christ suffered in washing away the sins of this Church: therefore he will not commit the defence thereof to man. It is no less glory to defend and keep the thing won by force, then it is by force to obtain the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. — Therefore he keepeth the defence and governance of the Church onely and solely himself, in whom the Devil hath not a jot of right. Though the Apostles were instructed in all truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were but Ministers, Servants, Testimonies, and Preachers of this verity, and not Christ's Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars on Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but onely appointed to approve the thing to be good, that God's Law commanded, and that to be ill, which the Word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Seeing that Christ doth govern his Church alwayes by his holy Spirit, and bindeth all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters thereof unto the sole Word of God: what abomination is this, that one Bishop of <hi>Rome, &amp;c.</hi> should claim to be Christ's Vicar on Earth, and take upon him to make any Laws in the Church of God to bind the conscience beside the Word of God, and by their Superstition and Idolatry put the Word of God out of his place? — All, that are not blinded with the smoke of <hi>Rome,</hi> know the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Beast <hi>Iohn</hi> describeth in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> as well as the Logician knoweth that <hi>risibilitate distinguitur homo a caeteris animantibus.</hi> Christs supremacy and continual presence in the Church admits no Lieutenant, nor general Vicar: Likewise it admitteth not the Decrees and Laws of men brought into the Church, contrary unto the Word and Scripture of God, which is onely suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to teach all verity and truth, for the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man. — <hi>ch.</hi> 4. — This Law teacheth

man sufficiently as well what he is bound to do unto God, as unto the Princes of the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. Nothing necessary for man but in this Law it is prescribed. Of what degree, vocation, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling soever he be, his duty is shewed unto him in the Scripture. And in this it differeth from mans laws, because it is absolutely perfect, and never to be changed, nothing to be added to it, nor taken from it. And the Church of Christ the more it was, and is burdened with mans laws, the farther it is from the true and sincere verity of Gods Word. — Though <hi>Basil, Ambrose, Epiphanius, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, Bernard,</hi> and others erred not in any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Article of the Faith, yet they did not inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and more then enough extol the Doctrine and Tradition of men, and after the death of the Apostles, every Doctors time was subject to such Ceremonies and manners, that were neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable nor necessary. —</p>
                        <p>— Unto the writings of Scripture onely, and not unto the writings of men, God hath bound and obligated his Church. In this passage. I admonish the Christian Reader that I speak not of the Laws of Magistrates or Princes, that daily order new Laws for the preservation of their Commonwealths, as they see the necessity of their Realms or Cities require; but of such Laws, as men have ordained for the Church of Christ, which should be now and for ever governed by the Word of God. — This Law must prevail. We must obey God rather then man. The example hereof we have in <hi>Daniel</hi> of the Three Children, who chose rather to burn in the fiery Furnace, then to worship the Image that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had made. So did the Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. — Cursed be those that make such Laws; and cursed be those that with sophistry defend

them.—<hi>ch.</hi> 5.—The Authority of Gods word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth me to pronounce this true Judgement in the case of Images that be not worshipped in the Church, that their presence in the Church is against Gods Word, as well as to say, <hi>Sancta Maria ora pro nobis.</hi>

Christ therefore hath left the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the old Law unto the Church, in which he saith, <hi>Thou shalt not make any Image.</hi> — Of late years Images were in the Temple, and honoured with <hi>pater noster,</hi> heart and mind, leg and knee: Now they be applyed to another use to teach the people, to be Lay-mens Books, as <hi>Damascene, &amp;c.</hi> saith.

This Doctor was (as all men know) of singular learning and vertue. Again against the Authority of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great I set the Authority of <hi>Athanasius</hi> the Great, who denieth in express words the Images to be the Books of the Lay peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Lactantius Firmianus</hi> crieth so out against Images, that he saith there can be no true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on where they be. <hi>Tertullian</hi> judgeth the same. — Loved we God we would be content with the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64438:105"/>
Scripture. — Shall not the Patriarks, Prophets, Christ and his Apostles suffice the Church of God? What although many learned men have approved Images, should their wisdome maintain any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Word of God? — Such as defend them have nothing but sophistical arguments to blind the people with. The Scripture nor Apostles Church used none. Had all <hi>Asia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and <hi>Gabriel</hi> the Archangel descended from Heaven approved the use of Images, forasmuch as the Apostles never taught nor wrote any such thing, their Authority should have no place; the Word of God solely and onely is to be prefer'd, which forbiddeth Images. — <hi>ch.</hi> 10. — The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ to sanctifie us (according to <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.1 <hi>sanctifie my self, that they may be sanctified</hi>) doth abrogate all other things that mans constitutions attribute any holiness unto, as bewitched water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for onely Christ sanctifieth, and all holiness we must attribute unto him. — Sacraments must be used holily, yet not have this Office of Christ added to them. — <hi>ch.</hi> 11. — In the later dayes when Christ, as King, was to be born, the Angel decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Power and Puissance of his Kingdome. <hi>He shall reign over the house of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and of his Kingdome there shall be no end,</hi> Luke 1. Although the Commonwealth of the Church hath no certain place appointed, where it shall remain, as it was appointed in the old Law, yet certain we be that this Kingdome of Christ remaineth upon the Earth, and shall do till the Earth be burned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Howbeit as Christ wan and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this Kingdome in the later dayes without shield or spear, so doth he preserve it with his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, and not with carnal weapons. <hi>My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not of this world,</hi> John 18. Meaning he would
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64438:105"/>
not reign in this world, as a Prince of this world in pomp and pride, but defend his people with his holy Spirit, that the Devil and the World should not break their patience, though many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and sorrows should fight against them for the Truth's sake. Christ doth not deny to be King of the world, but he meant not to reign world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, to the hinderance and defacing of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Dignity and Title; as the Jews falsly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused him, as <hi>Cyrillus l.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 10. in <hi>Iohannem</hi> saith. — This Kingdome shall be ever persecuted till the worlds end. <hi>Isaiah</hi> the Prophet described the Church of this present life, saying, <hi>He will give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, but he will not remove thy teachers,</hi> chap. 30.20. Thus the Church shall alwayes remain but in affliction. I know such as favour not the Truth, will interpret my words, that I condemn all Princes and Kings, as enemies of the Gospel, because they peaceably enjoy their Kingdomes, whereas I wish them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes so to do to the glory of God: but of the one thing I will assure every Prince of world; The more sincere he is in the Cause of God, the more shall be his Cross. — God indeed preserveth above humane reason his Ministers, as he did <hi>Iacob</hi> from the hands of <hi>Esau, David</hi> from <hi>Saul, Daniel</hi> from the Lions, and <hi>Paul</hi> in the Ship, when there was no humane hope of salvation. — Likewise he governeth his Church with his onely Laws. — The onely Law whereunto this Congregation is bound is the Gospel, as Christ saith; <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. <hi>The Holy Ghost shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things which I have said unto you.</hi> Here Christ bindeth the Apostles and all the Church unto the things that he had taught them. — Such as teach the people to know the Commonwealth
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64438:106"/>
of the true Church by these signs, the traditions of men, and the succession of Bishops, teach wrong. Those two false opinions have given unto the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Bishops power to interpret the Scripture, and power to make such Laws in the Church, as it pleased them. — God hath given the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates power and authority to make such Laws for the Commonwealth as shall be agreeable with reason, and not against Gods Law, and likewise power to interpret the same Laws: but this is not to be admitted in the Church, unto whom God hath given the Gospel, and interpreted the same by his onely Son, taught the meaning and contents thereof himself. — The adversaries of the Truth defend many an errour under the name of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church: when the Church therefore is named, diligently consider when the Articles they would defend, were accepted of the Church, by whom, and who was the Author of them. Leave not till the matter be brought unto the first original and most perfect Church of the Apostles. If thou find by their writings, that their Church used the thing that the Preacher would prove, then accept it, or else not. Be not amazed, though they speak of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so many years, nor name never so many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors. — If either the Authority of Bishops, or the greater part should have power to interpret the Scripture, the sentence of the Pharisees should have been prefer'd before the sentence of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary, Simion, Elizabeth,</hi> or the blessed Virgin. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the true Church is many time but a small Congregation, as <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith, <hi>Unless God had left us a remnant, we had been as</hi> Sodom. Therefore the interpretation of the Scripture is not obligated to ordinary power, nor the most part. — Beware of deceit, when thou hearest the name of the Church.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64438:106"/>
The verity is then assaulted. They call the Church of the Devil, the holy Church many time. — Remember, Christian Reader, that the gift of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the Scripture is the light of the Holy Ghost given unto the humble and penitent person, that seeketh onely to honour God, and not unto those persons that claim it by title or place, because he is a Bishop, or followed by succession <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul.</hi> — Remember therefore to examine all Doctrine by the Word of God; for such as preach it aright, have their infirmities and ignorance, they may depart from the Truth, or else build some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and false Doctrine upon the Gospel of Christ. Superstition is to be avoided, false Doctrine to be abhorred, whosoever be the Author thereof, Prince, Magistrate, or Bishop. As the Apostles made answer, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. <hi>We ought to obey God rather then man. — ch.</hi> 13. — The Law is necessary for a justified man to teach him with what works he should exercise his faith, will, and obedience unto God. We may not chuse works of our own wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to serve him withal. He would have us to be governed by his Word, as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Thy Word is a light unto my feet:</hi> And Christ, <hi>In vain do they worship me by the commands of men.</hi> —</p>

                        <p>I thank God (said the Knight) that ever I knew you; for God did appoint you to call me, being a lost child, and by your good instructions, where before I was both an Adulterer and Fornicator, God hath brought me to the forsaking and detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the same.

men do, I am sent hither by the Queens command to die, and am come where I taught it to confirm it with my blood. And now Mr. Sheriffs, — My re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to you is, That there may be a quick Fire, shortly to make an end, and in the mean time I will be as obedient unto you, as your selves would wish. If you think I do amiss in any thing, hold up your finger and I have done: for I am not come hither as one inforced or compelled to die; for it is well known I might have had my life with worldly gain; but as one willing to offer and give my life for the truth, rather then to consent to the wicked Papisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Religion of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp;c. —</p>
                        <p>When the Sheriffs fetcht him from his Chamber to the place of Execution with Bills, Weapons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr. Sheriffs (said he) I am no Traytor, neither needed you to have made such a business to bring me to the place where I must suffer; for if ye had willed me, I would have gone alone to the Stake, and have troubled none of you all.</p>
                        <p>When he saw the multitude of People that were assembled, he said unto them that were about him, Alas! why be these People assembled and come together? peradventure they think to hear some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of me now, as they have in times past; but alas! speech is prohibited me.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the cause of my death is well known unto them: when I was appointed here to be their Pastor, I preached unto them true and sincere Doctrine, and that out of the Word of God; because I will not account the same to be Heresie and untruth, this kind of death is prepared for me.</p>
                        <p>When he was come to the place where he was to suffer, after he had begun to pray, a Box was brought and laid before him upon a stool, with his
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64438:113"/>
Pardon (or at leastwise it was feigned so to be) from the Queen, if he would turn; at the sight thereof he cried, If you love my soul away with it, if you love my soul away with it.</p>
                        <p>In his Prayer he was overheard to say; Lord, I am Hell, but thou art Heaven; I am swill, and a sink of sin, but thou art a gracious God and merciful Redeemer.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 155.</note> — Thou art ascended into Heaven, receive me Hell to be partaker of thy joyes, where thou sittest in equal glory with thy Father; for well knowest thou wherefore I am come hither to suffer, and why the wicked do persecute this thy poor Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, not for my sins and transgressions against thee, but because I will not allow their wicked doings to the contaminating of thy blood, and to the denial of the knowledge of thy Truth, wherewith it did please thee by thy holy Spirit to instruct me, the which with as much diligence as a poor wretch might (being thereto called) I have set forth to thy glory. And well seest thou, my Lord and God; what terrible pains and cruel torments be prepared for thy Creature; such, Lord, as without thy strength none is able to bear, or patiently to pass. But all things that are impossible with man are possible with thee. Therefore strengthen me of thy goodness, that in the fire I break not the Rules of patience, or else asswage the terrour of the pains as shall seem most to thy glory.</p>
                        <p>When he was at the Stake, three irons made to bind him to the Stake, were brought; one for his Neck, another for his Middle, and the third for his Legs.

And upon your knees thank God that ever ye were accounted worthy to suffer any thing for his Names sake. Read the second Chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> and there you shall see how the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, that watched their Sheep all night, as soon as they heard that Christ was born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> by and by went to see him. They did not reason nor debate with themselves, who should keep the Wolf from the Sheep in the mean time, but did as they were commanded, and committed their Sheep unto him, whose pleasure they obeyed.

It was an easie thing to hold with Christ, whilst the Prince and world held with him; but now the world hateth him, it is the true trial who be his. Wherefore in the Name, and in the Vertue, Strength, and Power of his holy Spirit, prepare your selves in any case to adversity and constancy. Let us not run away, when it is most time to fight. Remember none shall be crowned, but such as fight manfully; and he that endureth to the end shall be saved. Ye must now turn all your cogitations from the peril you see, and mark the felicity that followeth the peril, either victory in this world of your enemies, or else a surrender of this life to inherit the everlasting Kingdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beware of beholding too much the felicity, or misery of this world; for the consideration and too earnest love or fear of either of them draweth from God. Wherefore think with your selves, as touching the felicity of the world, it is good; but yet none otherwise then it standeth with the favour of God. It is to be kept; but yet so far forth, as by keeping of it we lose not God. It is good abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and tarrying still among our friends here; but yet so, that we tarry not therewithal in Gods displeasure, and hereafter dwell with the Devils in fire everlasting. There is nothing under God, but may be kept, so that God, being above all things we have be not lost. Of adversity judge the same. Imprisonment is painful, but yet liberty upon evil conditions is more painful. The Prisons stink; but yet not so much as sweet Houses, where the fear and true honour of God is lacking. I must be alone and solitary: It is better to be so, and have God with me, then to be in company with
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:64438:116"/>
the wicked. Loss of Goods is great; but loss of Gods grace and favour is greater. I am a poor sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple creature, and cannot tell how to answer before such a great sort of noble, learned, and wise men: It is better to make answer before the pomp and pride of wicked men, then to stand naked in the light of all Heaven and Earth before the just God at the later day. I shall die then by the hands of the cruel man: He is blessed, that loseth his life full of miseries, and findeth the life of eternal joyes. It is pain and grief to depart from Goods and Friends; but yet not so much as to depart from grace and Heaven it self.<note place="margin">

I can do no more, but pray for you; do the same for me, for Gods sake. For my part (I thank the heavenly Father) I have made mine accounts, and appointed my self unto the will of the heavenly Father: as he will, so I will by his grace. — I am a precious jewel now, and daintily kept, never so daintily; for neither mine own man, nor any of the Servants of the House may come to me, but my Keeper alone.</p>

When Christ would make the blind man to see, he put clay upon his eyes, which after the judgement of man was a means rather to make his double blind, then to give him his sight, but he obeyed and knew that God could work his desire, what means soever he used contrary to mans reasons. — To judge things indifferently, the trouble be not yet generally, as they were in our good Fathers time, soon after the death and resurrection of our Saviour Christ. — Was there ever such trouble as Christ threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon <hi>Ierusalem?</hi>

— For your liberality I most heartily thank you, and praise God highly in you for you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> praying him to preserve you from all famine, scarcity, and lack of the truth of his Word, which is the lively food of your souls, as you preserve my body from hunger, and other necessities that would happen unto me, were it not cared for by the charity of godly people. Such as have spoiled me of all that I had, have imprisoned me, and appointed not one half-penny to feed or relieve me withall; but I do forgive them, and pray for them daily in my poor Prayer to God, and from my heart I wish their salvation, and quietly and patiently bear their injuries, wishing no farther extremity to be used towards us: yet if the contrary seem best to our heavenly Father, I have made my reckoning, and fully resolved to suffer the uttermost that they are able to do against me; yea death it self by the aid of Christ Jesus, who died the most vile death of the Cross for us, wretched and miserable sinners. But of this I am assured, that the wicked world with all his force and power shall not touch one of the hairs of our heads without leave and license of our heavenly Father, whose will be done in all things. If he will life, life be it; if he will death, death be it; onely we pray that our wills may be subject to his will. — If we be contented to obey Gods will, and for his Commands sake to surrender our goods and our lives to be at his pleasure, it maketh no matter whether we keep goods and life, or lose them. Nothing can hurt us that is taken from us for Gods Cause, nor can any thing at length do us good that is preserved contrary to Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Let us wholly suffer God to use us and ours after his holy wisdome, and beware we neither use nor govern our selves contrary to his will by
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64438:121"/>
our own wisdome; for if we do, our wisdome will at length prove foolishness. It is kept to no good purpose, that we keep contrary to his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It can by no means be taken from us, that he would should tarry with us. He is no good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian that ruleth himself and his, as worldly means serve; for he that so doth, shall have as many changes as chances in the world. To day with the world he shall like and praise the truth of God, to morrow, as the world will, so will he like and praise the falshood of man; to day with Christ, to morrow with Antichrist. — Glorifie your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father both with your inward and outward man. If ye think ye can inwardly in the heart serve him, and yet outwardly serve with the world in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal service the thing that is not of God, ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your selves; for both the body and soul must concurre together in the honour of God;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note> for if an honest wife be bound to give both heart and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to faith and service in marriage, and if an honest wives faith in the heart cannot stand with a whorish or defiled body, much less can the true faith of a Christian in the service of Christianity stand with the bodily service of external idolatry; for the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Marriage is not so honourable between man and wife, as it is between Christ and every Christian. Therefore (dear Brethren) pray to the heavenly Father, that as he spared not the soul nor the body of his dearly beloved Son, but applied both of them with extream pain, to work our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of soul and body: so he will give us all grace to apply our souls and bodies to be Servants to him. — Let us not deride our selves, and say our souls serve him, whatsoever our bodies do to the contrary for civil order and policy.

Judge not my Brother truth by outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for truth now worse appeareth, and is more vilely rejected then falshood. Leave the outward shew, and see by the Word of God what is truth, and accept truth, and dislike her not, though man call her falshood. As it is now, so it hath been

The dayes be dangerous and full of peril, not onely for the world, and worldly things, but for Heaven and heavenly things.

Wherefore, my dear Friends, seeing God hath illuminated you in the same true faith, wherein the Apostles, and Evangelists, and all Martyrs suffered most cruel death, thank him for his grace in knowledge, and pray to him for strength and perseverance, that ye be not ashamed nor afraid to confess it. Ye be in the truth, and the gates of Hell shall never prevail against it, nor Antichrist with all his Imps prove it false; they may persecute and kill, but never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.

Hunter</hi> said unto him, My Lord, if you cannot perswade my Conscience by Scriptures, I cannot find in my heart to turn from God for the love of the world; for I count all things worldly but loss and dung in respect of the love of Christ. If thou diest in this mind (said <hi>B.</hi>) thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for ever.

                        <p>When he was brought to <hi>Burntwood</hi> to be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his Father and Mother came to him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired heartily of God that he might continue to the end in that good way, which he had begun, and his Mother said unto him, That she was glad that ever she was so happy to bear such a Child, which could find in his heart to lose his life for Christs Names sake. Then said he to his Mother, For my little pain which I shall suffer, which is but short, Christ hath promised me a Crown of Joy. May you not be glad of that, Mother? With that his Mother kneeled down on her knees, saying, I pray God strengthen thee, my Son to the end: Yea I think thee as well bestowed, as any Child that ever I bare.</p>
                        <p>His Father said, I was afraid of nothing but that my Son should have been killed in the Prison for hunger and cold, the Bishop was so hard to him.</p>

                           <pb n="239" facs="tcp:64438:128"/>The night before his Execution, he had a dream, that he was where the Stake was pitcht where he should be burned, and that it was at the Towns end, where the Butts stood, (which was so indeed) and that he met his Father going to the Stake, and that there was a Priest at the Stake, which went about to have him recant, and that he said to him, Away false Prophet, and that he exhorted the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to beware of him, and such as he was: which things came to pass accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Whilst he was led to the Stake, the Sheriffs Son came to <hi>William</hi> and embraced him, saying, <hi>William</hi> be not afraid of these men, who are here present with Bills and Weapons, ready prepared to bring you to the place where you shall be burned. <hi>William</hi> answered, I thank God I am not afraid; for I have cast my account, what it will cost me already. Then the Sheriffs Son could speak no more to him for weeping.</p>
                        <p>When he met his Father (according to his dream) his Father said unto him, God be with thee Son <hi>William. William</hi> answered, God be with you good Father, and be of good comfort; for I hope we shall meet again when we shall be merry.</p>
                        <p>At the Stake the Sheriffe told him, That there was a Letter from the Queen; if he would recant, he should live, if not, he must be burned. No (said <hi>William</hi>) I will not recant, God willing.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> telling him (upon his desire to the people to pray for him as long as he was alive) I will pray no more for thee, then I will pray for a Dog. Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> (said <hi>William</hi>) now you have that you sought for, and I pray God it be not laid to your charge in the last day; howbeit I forgive you.

my blood at your hands. Then said <hi>William Hunter,</hi> Son of God shine upon me. Immediately the Sun in the Firmament shined out of a dark cloud, so full in his face, that he was constrained to look another way.</p>
                        <p>When the Priest came (according to his dream) he said, Away thou false Prophet. Beware of them good people, and come away from their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, lest that you be partakers of their plagues. Then (said the Priest) look how thou burnest here, so shalt thou burn in Hell. <hi>William</hi> answered, Thou lyest, thou false Prophet, away thou false Prophet, away.</p>
                        <p>When the fire was kindled, his Brother said to him, <hi>William,</hi> think on the holy Passion of Christ, and be not afraid of Death. <hi>William</hi> answered, I am not afraid. Then lift he up his hands to Heaven, and said, Lord, Lord, Lord, receive my spirit.</p>

And therefore I cannot but commend the Essay, and elaborate Collections of this <hi>Author,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving the Memories of these Ancient Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
                  <p>It was well observed by Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> That old Wood is best to burn, and old Friends best to trust, and old Books best to read. Hence Scholars set a great price upon an ancient <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script.</hi> Here are old things, men of ancient dayes, and old Books in a new Edition, for thy benefit.</p>
                  <p>Here you will not find the fault, that <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are commonly guilty of, who, like flattering <hi>Limners,</hi> draw too favourably, or shadow over a wrinckle, and slily forge in some secret grace: Here is an honest Pen modestly, but yet faithfully giving thee an account of Believers, who through much faith, patience, and tribulation entred into the King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Here are worthy <hi>Patterns</hi> for you to follow; glorious <hi>Copies</hi> for you, who are but Beginners in the World, to write after. They all call upon you so to follow them, as they followed Christ. Here is a <hi>Cloud of Witnesses,</hi> which if you have (with Iesus) in your eye, you will be the better prepared <hi>to lay aside every weight, and to run with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the race that is set before you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Man is led by nothing better then by <hi>example;</hi> and examples of great Ones are most effectual: Such are these. I know abundantly how this lazy formal Age is ready to look on Scripture-Worthies, as men unimitable; as <hi>Giants,</hi> to whose stature

                     </gap>se <hi>presidents</hi> in all Ages abudantly testifie, that we frail men, by the power of the same grace of God, may reach to the same perfections. We are too apt in these dayes to think our selves good enough, if we find any worse then our selves; but we should not content our selves to run with the Foot-men, but to excell the best.</p>
                  <p>I have of late thought it a very high way to growth and perfection, to collect some of the choicest frames of the best Christians, and alwayes set them before us: Blessed be the Lord, this is done to thy hand; and mayest thou reap the advantage of this labour.</p>
                  <p>Here thou mayest read thy defects in these holy mens excesses, and amend thy self without any <hi>diminution</hi> to their glory. Here thou mayest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>light</hi> from that which <hi>dazleth</hi> thee, and <hi>lustre</hi> from that which (at present) <hi>ecclipseth</hi> thee. When thou considerest what a dastardly, cowardly Spirit is within thee, what an Enemy of the Cross of Christ thou art, here is that which will promote thy shame, that these (under the dawnings of Gospel-glory and grace) should be as <hi>bold</hi> as <hi>Lions,</hi> whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:64438:141"/>
these were as <hi>Rocks</hi> in the midst of the Floods, standing unmoveable when the Winds blew, and the Seas made a noise.</p>
                  <p>I heartily wish that the dew of Heaven may fall upon these <hi>holy Reliques,</hi> that such a Spirit may attend the Reader as did these, when called before Kings and Rulers for the Name of Christ.</p>

that he might have the benefit of the Castle, which was fortified against the Papists, since the death of the Cardinal in it.

In the Name of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ, and in the name of these that presently call you by my mouth, I charge you that you refuse not this holy Vocation, but as ye tender the glory of God, the encrease of Christs Kingdome, the edification of your Brethren, and the comfort of me, whom ye understand well enough to be oppressed by the multitude of labours, that you take upon you the publick office and charge of preaching, even as you look to avoid Gods heavy displeasure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that he shall multiply his graces upon you.

                        <p>Besides this Vocation, that which necessitated Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> to enter in the publick place, was his beating by his Pen Dean <hi>Annan</hi> (a rotten Papist) that had long troubled Mr. <hi>Rough</hi> in his Preaching, from all defences, that he was compelled to flie to his last refuge, the Authority of the Church, which (said the Dean) damned all <hi>Lutherans</hi> and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,

and therefore he would not dispute.

Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> ever told them within, That their corrupt life, having fallen into all kind of licentiousness, puft up with pride of their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and relying on <hi>England</hi> for help in case of need, could not escape the punishment of God. When they triumphed of their Victory, he lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and said,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 84.</note> They saw not what he saw. When they bragged of the force and thickness of their Walls, he said, They should be but Egge-shells. When they vaunted, <hi>England</hi> will rescue us, he said, Ye shall not see them, but ye shall be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into your enemies hands, and shall be carried into a strange Countrey.</p>
                        <p>The last of <hi>Iuly</hi> the Castle was delivered upon Articles, That the lives of all in the Castle should
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64438:153"/>
be saved, and safely transported into <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>France</hi> the principal, that looked for freedome, were put into several Prisons, and the rest were left in the <hi>Gallies,</hi> and miserably used, among which Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> was all the Winter.</p>

                        <p>When the <hi>Gallies</hi> returned to <hi>Scotland,</hi> within sight of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iames</hi> willed Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> (who was then extremely sick, that few hoped his life) to look to the Land, and asked if he knew it? He answered, Yes, I know it well, for I see the Steeple of that place, where God in publick open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my mouth to his glory, and I am fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, how weak soever I now appear, that I shall not depart this life, till that my tongue shall glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his holy Name in the same place.

But to shed any mans blood for their freedome, thereto would he never consent. Adding farther, that he was assured that God would deliver them and the rest of that company, even in the eyes of the world, but not by such means they looked for, that the praise of their deliverance should redound to his glory onely. He willed therefore every one to take the occasion that God offered to them, provided that they did

nothing against Gods command for deliverance. — Adding,<note place="margin">

                        <p>When Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> was delivered, he came into <hi>England,</hi> and was Preacher to <hi>Barwick,</hi> then to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> then to <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> being dead, the Persecution of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> made him leave <hi>England,</hi> with many other godly Ministers; and first he went to <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> where for a time he preached the Gospel to the <hi>English</hi> Congregation there.<note place="margin">

turning my Book, I chanced to see a Note in the Margin written thus in Latin, <hi>Vid eat Anglia, Let</hi> England <hi>beware,</hi> the Note written was this, Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it is that God worketh any notable work to the comfort of his Church, but that trouble, fear, and labour cometh upon such as God hath used for his Servants,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 44.</note> and Workmen; and also tribulation most commonly followeth that Church, where Christ Jesus is most truly preached. This Note was made upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. which place declareth that after Christ had used the Apostles, as Ministers and Servants to feed so many thousand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he sent them to Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there they met with a Storm, that was like to overthrow their poor Boat and them. — Remembring that I had handled the same Scripture in your presence, I thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more expedient, then shortly to call to mind such things, as then, I trust, were touched. — Why Christ sent away from him the people, the Evangelist <hi>Iohn</hi> declareth, saying, <hi>When Iesus knew that they were come to take him,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.</note> that <hi>they might make him King,</hi> he <hi>passed secretly</hi> (or all alone) <hi>to the mountain.</hi> — The people sought by Christ a carnal and worldly Liberty, regarding nothing his heavenly Doctrine, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> that such as would follow him, must suffer for his Names sake perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, must be hated of all men, must deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, must be sent forth,<note place="margin">

Which vain opinion perceived by Christ, he withdrew himself from their company, to avoid all such suspition, and to let them understand, that no such Honours did
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64438:154"/>
agree with his Vocation, who came to serve, and not to be served. — Why the Disciples should suffer that great danger, Saint <hi>Mark</hi> plainly shews,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mark</hi> 6.</note> saying, <hi>That their hearts were blinded, and therefore did neither remember, nor consider the miracle of the loaves, i. e.</hi> Albeit they touched the bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and gathered up twelve baskets full, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet did not they rightly consider the infinite power of Christ Jesus by this wonderful miracle; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of necessity it was, that in their own bodies they should suffer trouble for their better instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. When I deeply consider how the flock of Christ was fed under King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the dispersion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> methinks I see the same causes to have moved God, not onely to withdraw his presence frem the multitude, but also to have sent his well beloved Servants to the travels of the Seas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What were the affections of the greatest multitude that followed the Gospel is easily judged by their lives. Who lived (in that rest) as that he had refused himself? — as that he had been cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with Christ? — as that he had certainly looked for trouble to come upon him? yea who lived not in delicacy and joy, and seeking the world and pleasures thereof, caring for the flesh and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appetites, as though death and sin had clean been devoured? and what was this else then to make of Christ an earthly King? The Word, that we professed, daily cried in our ears, that our Kingdome, our Joy, our Rest and Felicity, neither was, is, nor should be upon the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in Heaven, into which we must enter by many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations. But, alas! we sleeped in such security, that the sound of the Trumpet could of many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be perfectly understood, but alwayes we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded our selves of a certain tranquility,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 46.</note> as though
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64438:155"/>
the troubles, whereof mention is made within the Scriptures of God, appertained not at all to this Age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore was our heavenly Father compelled to withdraw from us the presence of his Verity, to the end we may more earnestly thirst for the same, and with more obedience embrace and receive it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — I mean not that such as have left Christ in body and heart shall embrace the Verity, but such as by the infirmity of the flesh, and weakness of faith dare not openly and boldly confess that, which their hearts know to be most true, and lament for the imperfection by-past and present; from such shall not the amiable presence of Christ for ever be withdrawn; but yet again shall the eyes of their sore troubled hearts behold the Light of Christs Gospel, wherein they most delight. We the Ministers, who were Distributers of this Bread (the true Word of God) lacked not our offences, which also moved God to send us to the Sea. And because no mans offences are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest unto me as mine own, I will onely censure my self. — (<hi>O that all such Ministers, as are put from their Charges, would seriously and sadly peruse and lay to heart his humble confession.</hi>) The portion of heavenly Bread which I received from Christ by his benediction multiplyed in breaking, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but alas!<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 47.</note> how little did I consider the dignity of that Office, and the power of God, that then multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Bread, the people received of my hands? God I take to record in my Conscience, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the same Bread, that I received of Christs hands; and that I mixed no poyson with the same, <hi>i. e.</hi> I teached Christs Gospel without any mixture of mens dreams, devices, or phantasies, but alas I did it not with such fervency, with such indifferency and diligence, as now I know it was my duty. Some
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64438:155"/>
complained in those dayes that the Preachers were indiscreet persons, yea Railers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — but alas this day my Conscience accuseth me, that I spake not so plainly, as my duty was to have done; for I ought to have said to the wicked man expresly by his name, Thou shalt die the death. I find <hi>Ieremiah</hi> the Prophet to have done so to <hi>Pashur</hi> the high Priest, and to <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the King. — The blind love I did bear to this my wicked Carkass, was the chief cause I was not fervent and faithful enough in that behalf; for I had no will to provoke the hatred of all men against me. — As I was not so <hi>fervent</hi> in rebuking manifest iniquity, as I should, so was I not so <hi>indifferent</hi> a feeder as is required of Christs <hi>Steward</hi>; for the love of friends and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal affection of some men, with whom I was most familiar, allured me to make more residence in one place then in another, having more respect to the pleasure of a <hi>few,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 48.</note> then the necessity of <hi>many.</hi> — Moreover remaining in one place, I was not so diligent as mine office required; but sometime by counsel of carnal friends I spared the body, some time I spent in worldly business of particular friends, and sometime in taking recreation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And albeit men may judge these to be light and small offences, yet I acknowledge that unless par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don should be granted unto me in Christs blood, that every one of these three offences deserved damnation. — And beside these, I am assaulted, yea, infected and corrupted with seeking the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, estimation, and praise of men. — O Lord be merciful to my great offence, and deal not with me according to my great iniquity; but according to the multitude of thy mercies remove from me the burden of my sin; for of purpose and mind to have avoided the vain displeasure of <hi>man,</hi> I spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

little to offend thy <hi>Majesty.</hi> Think not that I thus accuse my self without cause, to appear more holy, or to accuse my Brethren; No, God is Judge to my Conscience, that I do it from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned and sore troubled heart. — This great tempest cometh from the great mercy of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, to provoke us to unfeigned repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for neither <hi>Preacher,</hi> nor <hi>Professor</hi> did right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consider the time of our merciful visitation, but we spent our time, as though Gods Word had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been preached to satisfie our <hi>phantasies,</hi> then to reform our evil <hi>manners.</hi> Which thing if we earnestly repent, then shall Jesus Christ appear unto our comfort, be the storm never so great. Haste, O Lord, for thy Names sake.</p>
                        <p>Observe next the vehemency of the fear, which the Disciples indured in that great danger, of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger continuance then any before; They were in the midst of the raging Sea,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 49.</note> and it was night, and Christ their Comforter absent from them, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to them neither in the first, second, nor third Watch. What fear think you were they in? Such as be in like danger in <hi>England</hi> do by this storm better understand, then my Pen can express. — What we read here to have chanced to Christs Disciples, and their poor Boat, the same thing hath chanced, doth, and will chance to the true Church, travelling (like a Ship) in the Sea of this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some World, to the Haven of eternal felicity. — The wind,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 50.</note> that alwayes hath blown against the Church of God, is the malice of the Devil: As the wind is invisible, and yet the poor Disciples feel that it troubleth and letteth their Ship; so the pestilent envy of the Devil worketh in Reprobates so subtily, that it cannot be espied by Gods Elect, nor by his Messengers, till first they feel the blasts
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64438:156"/>
thereof to blow their Ship backward. As the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement wind causeth the waves of the Sea to rage, and yet the dead water neither knoweth what it doth, nor can cease from being troubled, and troubling Christs Disciples in their poor Ship; so by the envy and malice of the Devil are wicked and cruel, both Subjects and Princes (whose hearts are like the raging Sea) compelled to persecute the true Church of Christ, and yet so blinded, that they see not their manifest iniquity, nor can they cease to run to their own destruction. — The whole malice of the Devil hath alwayes this end,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 52.</note> to vex and overthrow Christs afflicted Church. — Albeit the Tyrants of the Earth have learned by long experience,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 54.</note> that they are never able to prevail against Gods Truth, yet because they are bound Slaves to their Master the Devil, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cease to persecute the Members of Christ, when the Devil bloweth his wind in the darkness of the night, <hi>i. e.</hi> when the Light of Christs Gospel is taken away, and the Devil reigneth by Idolatry, Superstition, and Tyranny. — It is fearful to be heard that the Devil hath such power over any man, but yet the Word of God hath so instructed us, and therefore we must believe it. He is called the <hi>Prince and god of this world,</hi> because he reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and is honoured by Tyranny and Idolatry in it. He is called the <hi>Prince of darkness,</hi>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64438:157"/>
shall suffer. When therefore I hear what the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous Lions do, I pray, O Lord, those cruel Tyrants are loosed by thy hand, to punish our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ingratitude, whom, we trust, thou wilt not suffer to prevail for ever, but when thou hast cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us a little, and hast declared to the world the tyranny that lurked in their boldened breasts, then wilt thou break their jaw-bones, and wilt shut them up in their Caves again, that the generation and posterity following may praise thy holy Name, before thy Congregation. <hi>Amen.</hi> — I know that God shall yet shew mercy to his afflicted Church in <hi>England,</hi> and repress the pride of these present Tyrants, as he hath done those that were before us. Therefore, beloved Brethren in our Saviour Jesus Christ, hold up to God your hands, that are fainted through fear, and hear the voice of your God, who sweareth by himself, that he will not suffer his Church to be oppressed for ever, and that he will not despise our sobs to the end, if we will rowe and strive against this vehement wind: I mean, if that ye will not turn back headlong to Idolatry, then shall this storm be asswaged in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight of the <hi>Devil.</hi>

The tyranny of this world cannot keep back his coming, more

then the blustering wind and raging Seas let Christ to come to his Disciples, looking for present death. — We gave you warning of these dayes long ago: for the reverence of Christs blood let these words be noted; The same Truth, that spake before of these dolorous dayes, fore-spake also the everlasting joy prepared for such as should continue to the end. The trouble is come: O dear Brethren look for the comfort, and (after the example of the <hi>Apostle</hi>) abide in resisting this vehement storm a little space. The third watch is not yet ended.

Whereby it commonly comes to pass, that the Messengers of Life are judged to be the Authors of all mischief. Thus the Israelites cursed <hi>Moses,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Exod. 5.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And that albeit sometimes ye be moved to hate the Messengers of Life, that therefore ye shall not judge that God will never shew mercy after. No, dear Brethren, as he hath dealt with others before you, so will he deal with you. — One cause why God permitteth such blood-thirsty Tyrants to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest his Church, is this, Such is his justice, that he will not pour forth his extreme vengeance upon the wicked, until such time as their iniquity be so manifest, that their very flatterers cannot excuse it.<note place="margin">Exod. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was not destroyed, till his own houshold Servants and Subjects abhorred and condemned his stubborn disobedience. — If <hi>Gardener, Tunstal,</hi> and <hi>Bonner</hi> had suffered death when first they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served it, Papists would have alledged (as they did) that they were reformable, neither thirsted they for the blood of any man.

men I travelled rather to mitigate, yea to slacken that fervency God had kindled in them, then to animate or encourage them to put their hands to the Lords Work: wherein I acknowledge my self to have done most wickedly, and from the bottome of my heart do ask of my God pardon, that I did not what in me lay to have suppressed that Idol in the beginning.</p>

is my Witness, whom I have served with my Spirit in the Gospel of his Son, that I have taught nothing but the true and sincere Word of God, the true and solid Doctrine of the Gospel; and that the end I proposed in all my Doctrine was, to instruct the ignorant, to confirm the weak, to comfort the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of those who were humbled under the sense of their sins, and born down with the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Gods judgements.

That I did forbear none of whatsoever condition, I did it out of the fear of my God, who hath placed me in the Ministry, and I know will bring me to an account. Now Brethren, for your selves, I have no more to say, but to warn you to take heed to the Flock,<note place="margin">

him, and say from me, That unless he forsake that wicked course, wherein he is entred, neither shall the rock, in which he confideth, defend him; nor the carnal wisdome of that man, whom he count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth half a god (this was young <hi>Lethington</hi>) yield him help, but shamefully he shall be pulled out of that nest, and his carkass hang before the Sun (and so it fell out; for the next year, the Castle which he did keep against the Kings Authority, was taken, and he hanged before the Sun) the Soul of that man is dear unto me; and if it be possible, I would fain have him saved. They went, but could not prevail; yet at his death, he did express serious repentance for his sins.</p>
                        <p>The next day he was much in Prayer, crying, Come Lord Jesus, Sweet Jesus, into thy hands I commend my Spirit.</p>
                        <p>Being asked by those about him, if his pains were great, he answered, That he did not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem that a pain, which should be unto him the end of all troubles, and beginning of eternal joyes.</p>
                        <p>Oftentimes, after some deep Meditations, he burst forth in these words, O serve the Lord in fear and death shall not be troublesome unto you:<note place="margin">

                        <p>In the Evening, having slept some hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but with great unquietness; for he was heard to send forth many sighs and groans. Being asked, after he awaked, How he did find himself, and what it was that made him to mourn so heartily in his sleep? He answered, In my life time I have oft been assaulted with Satan, &amp; many times he hath cast in my teeth my sins, to bring me to despair; yet God gave me strength to overcome all his temptations:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64438:181"/>
and now that subtile Serpent, who never ceaseth to tempt, hath taken another course, and seeks to perswade me, that all my labours in the Ministry, and the fidelity that I have shewn in that Service, hath merited Heaven and immortality: but blessed be God, that brought to my mind these Scriptures, <hi>What hast thou, that thou hast not received? and not I, but the grace of God in me.</hi> With which he is gone away ashamed, and shall no more return. And now I am sure my Battel is at an end; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain of body, or trouble of spirit, I shall short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly change this mortal and miserable life, with that happy and immortal, which never shall have end.</p>
                        <p>After one had prayed for him, he was ask'd whether he heard the Prayer? he answered, Would to God that ye had heard it with such an ear and heart as I have done: adding, Lord Jesus receive my spirit. With which words, without any motion of hands or feet, as one falling asleep, rather then dying, he ended his life.</p>

                        <p>— Above all things, I desire the pious Reader, and that for the sake of our <hi>Lord</hi> himself, <hi>Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> not onely to read these things with judgement, but with much pity, knowing I was a <hi>Monk,</hi> and a <hi>most</hi> mad <hi>Papist,</hi> when I undertook this Cause, so <hi>drunk</hi> with, yea <hi>drowned</hi> in <hi>Popish Doctrines,</hi> that I was most ready to kill, and to co-work with the Murderers of all those who withdrew their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the <hi>Pope</hi> in the least. So great a <hi>Saul</hi> was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64438:205"/>
I, as there be yet many more. I was not so cold in defending the <hi>Papacy,</hi> as was <hi>Eccius</hi> himself, and such as he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that thon wilt find in my first writings very many and great things humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded to the <hi>Pope,</hi> which now I account <hi>highest bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy, and do abominate.</hi> — At first I was alone, and most unfit and unable to handle so great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; I call God to witness, that his Providence, not my own will and purpose, engaged me so far. When in the year 1517. Indulgences were sold most shamefully, I was then a Preacher, and a young <hi>Doctour</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> (as I was called) and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to disswade the people from hearkning to the Sellers of Indulgences, and therein I thought surely I had the <hi>Pope</hi> for my <hi>Patron,</hi> and upon that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was very valiant, seeing he doth in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees condemn the immodesty of the Gatherers of money, so he calleth the Preachers of Indulgences. Thereupon I writ two Letters, one to the <hi>Arch Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of <hi>Moguntz,</hi> who had one half of the money for the Indulgences (I knew not then that the other half did belong to the Pope) the other to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Branderburg</hi>; beseeching them to restrain the impudence and blasphemy of the Gatherers of the money. But the poor <hi>Monk</hi> was contemned. Being contemned I published a short Disputation, and a Sermon, concerning Indulgences, and afterwards my Resolutions, and that for the <hi>Popes</hi> honour, not that Indulgences might be condemned, but that good works of charity might be preferred before them. This was accounted troubling of Heaven, and setting the world on fire.</p>
                        <p>I am accused unto the <hi>Pope,</hi> and am cited to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at <hi>Rome,</hi> and against single me rise up the whole <hi>Papacy.</hi> These things were done in the year 1518. whilst <hi>Maximilian</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> held a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>

                        <p>Being called before him, poor I came on foot to <hi>Ausburg,</hi> upon the cost of and with Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from <hi>Prince Frederick</hi> to the <hi>Senate,</hi> and some other good men, who disswaded me (after I was come) from going to the <hi>Cardinal</hi> till I had <hi>Caesars</hi> safe conduct. When the <hi>Cardinals Oratour</hi> was told by me so much, he was angry. What (said he) do you think that <hi>Prince Frederick</hi> will take up <hi>Arms</hi> for you?

Hence I can better bear those that do even pertinaciously cleave unto <hi>Popery,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they have not read the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> seeing I that so many years most diligently read them, did notwithstanding stick thereunto so firmly.— In the year 1519. the <hi>Pope</hi> sent <hi>Prince Frederick</hi> a <hi>golden Rose</hi> by <hi>Charles Miltitius,</hi> who perswaded me ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to be reconciled to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to study the things of peace. I promised that I would most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly do whatsoever truth and my conscience would allow, and assured him that I was most desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of and studious for peace; and seeing I was drawn and necessitated to do what I did, what I did was not my fault. — <hi>Charles</hi> is accounted unwise, and the course he took imprudent; but in my judgement, if the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Moguntz</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi>
                                 <pb n="129" facs="tcp:64438:206"/>
before he had condemned me unheard, had taken the same course, the business had never come to this. — These things I relate good Reader, That if thou wilt read my little Works, thou mayest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I am one of them, who (as <hi>Austine</hi> reports of himself) profit by Writing and Teaching; not one of those, who from nothing on a sudden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chieftains.

Adversaries a <hi>Brood of Vipers,</hi> blind, hypocrites, the children of Satan: and of <hi>Paul,</hi> who calls the <hi>Sorcerer the child of the Devil, full of all subtilty and wickedness</hi>; and others, <hi>dogs,</hi> &amp;c. If his Hearers were tender and soft, they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him biting and immodest. Who more biting then the <hi>Prophets</hi>? the wicked mad company of flatterers have made the ears of this age so delicate, that as soon as we perceive our own wayes not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, we cry out we are bitten; and when we cannot repel the Truth on any other account, we avoid it under the pretence of railing, impudence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what is Salt good for, if it be not sharp? what a Sword if it will not cut? <hi>Cursed is the man that doth the work of the Lord negligently.</hi> — I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with none but onely about the word of Truth.

content with being a private <hi>Priest,</hi> and live upon your own inheritance. — What do you <hi>my</hi> Leo <hi>at Rome,</hi> but let the most wicked and accursed wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es use your Name and Authority to destroy mens estates and souls, to increase wickedness, to oppress faith and truth with the whole Church of God. O most <hi>unhappy Leo,</hi> you sit <hi>in a most dangerous seat.</hi> I tell you the truth, because I wish you well. If <hi>Bern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard</hi> did sympathize with his <hi>Eugenius</hi> ruling <hi>Rome</hi> in a more hopefull condition, though then very corrupt, what may not we complain, to whom in the space of three hundred years there is such an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of corruption and perdition?

                        <p>— Behold my <hi>Father Leo,</hi> upon what account I have so inveighed against that pestilent See. I am so far from speaking against your Person, that I hope I should do you the greatest courtesie,<note place="margin">

Not <hi>Luther</hi> but <hi>Cajetan</hi> is to be blamed; for what followed afterwards, seeing he would not suffer me to be silent, when I most earnestly desired it. — Upon the occasion of <hi>Eccius</hi> challenging me to dispute with him, many <hi>Romish</hi> corruptions were brought to light.— Now the name of the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> doth stink in the world, and the <hi>Papal Authority</hi> languisheth, their famous ignorance is misliked, of which there would have been no mention, if <hi>Eccius</hi> had not interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted

None may presume, that I will recant. I cannot bear the imposition of any Laws for the interpreting of the Word of God, which ought not to be bound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These two things excepted, there is nothing that I cannot, yea will not do or suffer for peace. I hate contentions. I will provoke none; no more will I be provoked. If I be provoked, I will not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a tongue for my Master Christ. — Take heed, my Father, of hearkning to those <hi>Syrens,</hi> who make you more then a meer man, even an half God, so that you may command any thing. — These are your Enemies, and seek your soul to destroy. — How unlike is <hi>Christ</hi> unto his Successors, who yet would be his Vicars? and I fear many are so too properly. <hi>A Vicar is of one absent.</hi> If the Pope be <hi>President,</hi> Christ being absent, what is he other then <hi>Christs</hi> Vicar? But what then is that Church, but <hi>a multitude without Christ?</hi> and what is such a <hi>Vicar,</hi> but <hi>Antichrist</hi> and an <hi>Idol?</hi> How much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who call themselves the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ</hi> present, not the <hi>Vicars</hi> of Christ absent? —</p>

                        <p>I <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> called <hi>Dr. of Divinity,</hi> do notifie to all that by my will, counsel, and help, the Books of the <hi>Pope of Rome</hi> were burnt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that (1) Because we have ancient examples for the burning of wicked and corrupt Books, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.

Let none therefore be moved by the sublime Titles of the Books, the <hi>Canon</hi> Law, The <hi>Decreetals,</hi> &amp;c. but first see what is taught therein, and then <hi>judge</hi> whether they be burnt justly or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly. —</p>

Christian, that it would be safer to live in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and see no man, then to live in that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Kingdome.

I suppose hereby it is manifest, that I have well weighed the perils and dangers, as also the divisions and dissentions, which have risen through the World by occasion of my Doctrine, of which I was yesterday gravely and sharply ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished: As for me, the face of things is very pleasant, when I see discords and dissentions stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up upon the account of the <hi>Word</hi>; for such is the course, the lot, and event of the <hi>Gospel</hi>; for Christ saith, <hi>I came not to send Peace, but a Sword; I came to set a man at variance with his Father.</hi> — The <hi>Emperours Prolocutor</hi> telling him,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Fol.</hi> 414.</note> That he had not answered to the purpose, neither ought he to call in question, what hath been in time past de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and condemned in <hi>Councils,</hi> and therefore a plain and direct answer, whether he would recant or no, was demanded of him? Seeing therefore (said <hi>Luther</hi>) your most Excellent <hi>Majesty,</hi> &amp;c. require a plain answer, I will give one, and that without horns or teeth; <hi>Unless I shall be convinced by Scripture testimonies, or evident reason</hi>; (for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve neither <hi>Pope,</hi> nor <hi>Councils</hi> onely, seeing it is evident, that they have often erred, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted themselves) I am so evercome by the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> which I have alledged, and my Conscience is so captiv'd to the Words of the Lord, that I may not, neither will I recant at all; and that because it is neither <hi>safe</hi> nor <hi>honest</hi> to act against Conscience. Here I stand. I have nothing else to say. God be merciful to me.</p>

                           </hi> Or wilt thou recant any thing in them? Then Dr. <hi>Martin</hi> besought the <hi>Emperour,</hi> that he might not be compelled to recant against his Conscience, captiv'd to and hindred by the holy Scriptures, without manifest Arguments to the contrary. The Answer (said he) that is required, is a plain and direct Answer. I have no other, then what I have already given. Unless my Adversaries can deliver my Conscience from captivity to those (they call) Errours by sufficient Arguments, I cannot get out of the Net, in which I am intangled. All things, which <hi>Councils</hi> have determined, are not therefore true; yea <hi>Councils</hi> have erred, and determined often things contrary to themselves: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Prolocutors</hi> Argument falleth. I can shew that <hi>Councils</hi> have erred, and therefore I may not revoke what is plainly and diligently exprest in Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Hereupon the <hi>Emperour</hi> resolved to pursue <hi>Martin Luther</hi> and his Adherents by Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and other means, that may be devised <hi>to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64438:213"/>

                        <p>Before <hi>Luther</hi> had any Answer from the <hi>Emperour,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Fol.</hi> 415.</note> several of all ranks visited him, and conferred with him; among the rest the <hi>ArchBishop</hi> of <hi>Triers</hi> sent for him, and Dr. <hi>Vaeus</hi> in the presence of many <hi>Nobles</hi> protested that <hi>Luther</hi> was not called to dispute, but onely the <hi>Princes</hi> had procured license from the <hi>Emperour</hi> benignly and brotherly to exhort him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To whom he gave this Answer; Most gracious and illustious <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Lords,</hi> I give you most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thanks for your clemency and singular good will, from whence proceedeth this admonition. I do indeed acknowledge my self altogether unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be admonished by so Mighty <hi>Princes.</hi> I have not reprehended all <hi>Councils,</hi> but onely that of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence,</hi> and that because that Council hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the Word of God, as appears in that this Article of <hi>Iohn Hus, That the Church of Christ is the Company of the Elect, is condemned by it.</hi> — I am ready to lose blood and life for you, so I be not compelled to revoke the manifest Word of God; in defence whereof, we ought <hi>rather to obey God, then man.</hi> Here I cannot avoid <hi>scandal.</hi> There be two manners of offences, at <hi>Manners</hi> and at <hi>Faith.</hi> — Now it is not in my power to make Christ <hi>not to be a Rock of Offence.</hi> — I am ready to obey <hi>Magistrates,</hi> how wickedly soever they live, so that I be not inforced to deny the Word of God.</p>
                        <p>Hereupon Dr. <hi>Vaeus</hi> admonished <hi>Luther</hi> to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Writings to the <hi>Emperours</hi> and the <hi>Princes</hi> judgement. He answered humbly and modestly, That he was so far from fearing their Examination,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64438:214"/>
that he was content to suffer his Writings to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed most accurately of the meanest, so that it were done by the Authority of the Word of God and of the holy Scripture. The Word of God (said he) makes so clearly for me, that I may not yield, unless I be untaught, and taught better by the Word of the Lord. St. <hi>Austin</hi> writeth thus; I give this honour onely unto the <hi>Canonical Books</hi> to believe them to be altogether true; as for other holy and learned <hi>Doctors</hi> I onely so far believe them, as they write the truth. St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids us, <hi>Prove all things and hold fast that which is good.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.</note> He saith also, <hi>Though an Angel from Heaven should preach any other Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. Wherefore I humbly beseech you not to urge my Conscience, bound in <hi>Scripture bonds,</hi> to deny the so clear Word of God. <hi>In all other cases</hi> I will be most obedient to you.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Marquess</hi> of <hi>Branderburg</hi> asking him, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was not resolved not to yield, unless he were convinced by the holy Scripture: Yes (said he) most <hi>noble Lord,</hi> or else by clear and evident reasons.</p>

Still I was undetermined what to do, but told a Friend, that had prayed with me for direction, I doubted not but God (according as our prayer and trust was) would give me such wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and counsel, as should be most to his honour and glory, the profit of my Neighbours and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and mine own eternal salvation by Christ in Heaven. — At length one came to me with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from a faithful Friend (which I never read, nor
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64438:223"/>
looked on) who said thus, My Friends advice was, that I should in no wise flee, but abide and boldly confess the Faith of Jesus Christ. At which words I was so confirmed and established in my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that from thenceforth I consulted no more, whether it were better to <hi>flee,</hi> or to <hi>tarry</hi>; but was at a point with my self, that I would not flee, but go to Mr. <hi>Barton,</hi> who did seek me, and patiently bear what cross it should please God to lay upon me. <hi>Whereupow my mind and conscience, being much troubled before, was now merry and in quiet state.</hi> — Thereupon I went to Mr. <hi>Barton.</hi> He shewed me a Letter from the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Derby,</hi> wherein he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to send me to <hi>Lathum.</hi> Thither I went.

Desiring him to speak to my Lord and his Council, that I might find some mercy at their hands; but he giving me but short answer, then I said, <hi>I commit my Cause to God, who hath num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the hairs of my head, and appointed the dayes of my life, saying, I am sure God, who is a Righteous Iudge, would make inquisition for my blood, according as he hath promised.</hi> — I desire the Reader of this Relation to pray for me, and all them that be in bonds, that God would assist us with his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that we may <hi>with boldness confess his holy Name,</hi>

                        <p>— I was thrust at with all violence of craft and subtilty, but yet the Lord upheld me.

                        <p>After that he began to speak to the people, shewing the cause of his death, and would have exhorted them to stick unto Christ. Whereupon one of the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> said, We must have no Sermoning now.</p>

Above all things I wish you continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and reverently to search and read the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and with the wholesome admonitions of the same to teach, exhort, comfort, and edifie one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, now in this time of the great famishment of souls, for want of the food of Gods Word. And doubt not but that the merciful Lord (who hath promised to be with us, even to the worlds end, and when two or three are gathered together in his Name he will be in the midst of them) will assist you and teach you the right meaning of the sacred Scriptures, will keep you from all errours, and lead you into all truth, as he hath promised. And though you think your selves unable to teach, yet

at the command of Christ, now in time of famine, seeing the hungry people in the wilderness far from any Towns, if they be sent away fasting, are sure to faint and perish by the way, employ those five loaves and two fishes that ye have, upon that hungry multitude, although you think it nothing among so many. And he that increased the five loaves and two fishes to feed five thousand men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall also augment his gifts in you, not onely to the edifying of others, but to an exceeding great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of your own knowledge in God and his holy Word: And fear not your Adversaries; for either according to his accustomed manner, God shall blind their eyes, that they shall not spie you, or get you favour in their sight, or else graciously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you out of their hands by one means or other. Comfort your selves in all your adversities, and stay your selves in him, who hath promised not to leave you, as fatherless and motherless children, without any comfort, but that he will come unto you, like a most gentle and merciful Lord. —</p>

no more of a Christian Believer in this life, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obey the Precepts of that most blessed Law.

And good people, I would ye should not think of me, that I believe to be saved, in that I offer my self here unto the death for the Lords Cause, but I believe to be saved by Christs Death and Passion: and this my death is, and shall be a witness of my faith unto you all here present. Good people, as many of you as believe as I believe, pray for me.</p>

Indeed it is an hard matter for them to burn, that have the mind and soul linked to the body, as a Thiefs foot is tyed in a pair of Fetters; but if a man be once able, through the help of Gods Spirit, to separate and divide the soul from the body, for him it is no more mastery to burn, then for me to eat this piece of bread.</p>

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64438:274"/>
ought to obey his Prince, but in the Lord, and never against the Lord; for he that knowingly obeyeth his Prince against God, doth not a duty to the Prince, but is a deceiver of the Prince, and a helper to him to work his own destruction. He is also unjust which giveth not to the Prince that is the Princes, and to God that is Gods. — Hitherto you see (good Father) how I have in words onely made a flourish before the fight which I shortly look for, and how I have begun to prepare certain kind of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to fight against the adversary of Christ. — And here methinks I see you suddenly lifting up your head to Heaven after your manner, and then looking upon me with your Prophetical Countenance, and speaking thus unto me, Trust not my Son (I beseech you vouchsafe me the honour of this Name, for in so doing I shall think my self both honoured and loved of you) Trust not to these word-weapons; for the Kingdome of God is not in words but in power.

Now (I say) be you assured, that even with my whole heart, God is my witness, in the bowels of Christ, I love you in the Truth, and for the Truths sake, which abideth in us; and, as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, shall by the grace of God abide in us for evermore.</p>
                        <p>Because the world, as I perceive, Brother, busily conspireth against Christ our Saviour, with all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible force and power, let us joyn hands together in Christ;<note place="margin">

Let us also prepare our selves for death, by which after our short afflictions here, by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, we shall triumph together with him in eternal glory. I pray you Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther salute in my Name your Reverend Fellow-Prisoner and Venerable Father Dr. <hi>Cranmer,</hi> by whom, since the first day that I heard of his most godly and fatherly constancy, in confessing the Truth of the Gospel, I have conceived great conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

and joy in the Lord. — It will also be to me great joy to hear of your constancy and fortitude in the Lords Quarrel.</p>
                        <p>I am earnestly moved to counsel you, not to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten the publishing of your Works, especially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your own Name, least your mouth should be stopped hereafter, and all things taken away from the rest of the Prisoners, whereby otherwise if it so please God, may be able to do good to many. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in the Lord, my most Dear Brother. — Once again and for ever in Christ, my most Dear Brother farewell.</p>

I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered shortly, That all the Laws of men might not, neither could rule the Word of God, but that they all must be discussed and judged thereby, and obey thereto: and neither my conscience, nor any Christians could be satisfied with such Laws, as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed from that Word.</p>

                        <p>— I told the Chancellor, That I would not be out of the Catholick Church, but into his Church by Gods grace,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Pag.</hi> 124.</note> I would never come. Well (said he) then is our Church false and Antichristian? Yes said I. — When I desired leave to confirm my Doctrine by writing, you would not grant it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I was a private person, and the Parliament was above the Authority of all private Persons; and therefore the sentence thereof might not be found fault with, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet my Lord (said I) I can shew that one man hath come into a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and after the whole had agreed upon an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, hath by the Word of God declared so pithily that the Council had erred in declaring the said Article, that he caused the whole Council to alter their Act. — <hi>Panormitanus</hi> also (said I) saith, That

unto a simple Lay-man that bringeth the Word of God with him, there ought to be given more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, then to a whole Council assembled together.</p>
                        <p>— The Chancellor facing me, and hoping to dash me out of Couutenance, I told him, in that Cause, being Gods Cause, he should not make me afraid to speak. —</p>

But now ye have done what ye can, my Lord, I pray you yet grant me one thing, that my poor wife being a stranger, and having ten children by me, may come and speak with me as long as I live.

Even so we may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer you, God is more to be obeyed then man; and your wicked Laws cannot so tongue-tie us, but we will speak the Truth. The Apostles were beaten for their boldness, and they rejoyced that they suffered for Christs Cause. Ye have also provided rods for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I might instance in what I once did at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross, for which I was fain to answer before all the Council, and many of my Brethren did the like; so that we for the not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking of their faults, shall not answer before God,

                        <p>Whereupon <hi>Romanus</hi> was brought before the Emperour, who said, What? art thou the Author of this sedition? art thou the cause why so many shall lose their lives?

                        <p>When the Tormenters would not truss him up and draw out his Bowels, because he was of noble Parentage; the Captain commanded him to be scourged with Whips with knaps of Lead at the ends.

                        <p>He preached the second time the living God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, his welbeloved Son, and eternal life through faith in his blood; together with the abomination of idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his face was buffeted, his eye-lids torn with their nails, his cheeks scotched with knives, the skin of his beard was plucked by little and little from the flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thereupon the meek Martyr said, I thank thee, O Captain, that thou hast open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto me many mouths, whereby I may preach my Lord and Saviour Christ: Look how many wounds I have, so many mouths I have lauding and praising God.</p>

To whom the Babe answered, That certainly what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it be that men affirm to be God must needs be One; which with One is one and the same: and in as much as this One is Christ, of necessity Christ must be the true God; for that there be many gods we Children cannot believe.</p>
                        <p>The Captain hereat amazed, said, Thou young Villain and Traitor, where and of whom learnedst thou this Lesson? Of my Mother (said the Child) with whose milk I sucked in this Lesson, that I must believe in Christ.</p>
                        <p>The Captain thereupon commanded the Child to be hoised up and scourged. The joyfull Mother onely saw that sight with dry eyes: yea, the rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked her sweet Babe for craving a draught of cold water.

She willed him to remember little <hi>Isaac,</hi> who beholding the Sword wherewith, and the Altar whereon he should be sacrificed, willingly proffered his tender neck to the dint of his Fathers Sword.</p>
                        <p>Then the butcherly Tormentor pluckt the skin from the Crown of his head, hair and all. The Mother cried, Suffer my Child, anon thou shalt pass to him, that will adorn thy naked head with a Crown of eternal Glory. The Child recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                        <p>When the Tormentor required the Child of the Mother,<note place="margin">

Look up with your eyes of hope; for your redemption is not far off, (but my wickedness hath deserved that I shall not see it) and also that which is behind of the blood of our Brethren, which

                        <p>The <hi>Friday</hi> at night before Mr. <hi>Rough</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, being in his Bed he dreamed, That he saw two of the Guard leading <hi>Cuthbert Sympson</hi> (Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con of the said Congregation) and that he had the Book about him, wherein were written the Names of all them, that were of the Congregation. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he awaked, and having told the dream unto his Wife, after some time spent in reading, he fell asleep again, and dreamed the same dream again: and awaking, told his Wife his dream, and said, O Brother <hi>Cuthbert</hi> is gone. And whilst he was making ready for to go and see how it was with him, Mr. <hi>Sympson</hi> came into Mr. <hi>Rough</hi>'s House, and brought the Book with him. Mr. <hi>Rough</hi> having told him his dream, perswaded him to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Book no more about with him: which he was loth to promise; because (said he) dreams are but fancies, and not to be credited. Then Mr. <hi>Rough</hi> straitly charged him in the Name of the Lord to do it. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Sympson</hi> left the Book with Mrs. <hi>Rough.</hi> And so the Congregation was preserved.</p>

to rejoyce in God, that he hath given you such faith to overcome this blood-thirsty Tyrant thus far? And no doubt but he that hath begun that good work in you, will fulfill it to the end. O dear Hearts in Christ, what a Crown of Glory shall ye receive with Christ in the Kingdome of God? Oh that it had been the good will of God, that I had been ready to have gone with you. I lie in my Lords Little-ease in the day, and in the night in the Cole-house alone, and we look every day when we shall be condemned; but I lie still at the Pools brink, and every man goeth in before me; but we abide patiently the Lords leisure, with many Bands, in Fetters and Stocks, by the which we have received great joy in the Lord. And now fare you well dear Brethren and Sisters in this World, but I trust to see you in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens face to face. — How blessed are you in the Lord, that God hath found you worthy to suffer for his sake. — O be joyfull even unto death. <hi>Fear it not,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>for I have overcome death.</hi> — Be strong, let your hearts be of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and wait you still for the Lord. He is at hand. The Angel of the Lord pitcheth his Tent round about them that fear him, and delivereth them which way he seeth best; for our lives are in the Lords hands, and they can do nothing unto us, before God suffer them: Therefore give all thanks to God. O dear Hearts, you shall be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with long white Garments upon the Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> with the multitude of Saints, and with Jesus Christ our Saviour, who will never forsake us. O blessed Virgins, you have played the wise Virgins part, in that you have taken Oyl in your Vessels, that ye may go in with the Bridegroom,

O dear Hearts, How pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious shall your death be in the sight of the Lord? for dear is the death of his Saints. O fare you well, and pray.
