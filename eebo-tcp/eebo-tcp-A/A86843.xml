            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PETITION
OF THE
VVELL-AFFECTED YONG MEN
IN
The City of London and Liberties thereof,
To the Right Honourable the Lords and Commons in the
High Court of PARLIAMENT now Aſſembled.</head>
            <opener>In moſt humble manner ſheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat your former gracious acceptation of Petitions, from perſon of as meane quality as our
ſelves, together with your late kind imbracement of that PETITION from our Maſters
and others of eminent quality (for which wee preſent our humble thanks) hath incited us
(though in regard of our preſent condition not ſo much conſiderable) to addreſſe our ſelves alſo in
all humility to this Honourable aſſembly (whom wee conceive the only meanes under God for
our redreſſe) beſeeching you to endeavour to theſe ruinating diſtractions, and though the preſent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
doth not ſo immediately reflect on your Petitioners, yet wee conſidering the loſſe of ſo
many of our fellowes lives, and the dayly hazard the reſt are expoſed to, and foreſeeing the face
of our owne ruine, in our Maſters preſent condition, as alſo prizing our Parents and friends lives and
livelyhoods, as deare as our owne: hold our ſelves ingaged by the lawes of conſcience and nature, to
be no leſſe ſolicitous for the bleeding miſeries of our Church and State, in regard (though ſervants)
wee are Subjects, and humbly conceive our ſelves to be conſidered herein.</p>
            <p>Wee come therefore (in the ſtill voyce) to imbowell our grievances and zealous deſires before you,
not preſuming to dictate to your graver judgments, but humbly deſiring you to pardon our boldneſſe
in petitioning; and the errors of our Petition, if any be. We unanimouſly beſeech you to conſider
theſe preſent diſtractions, the continuall increaſing violation of our Religion by Papiſts and Sectaries,
the breach of our knowne Lawes, the invaſion of the Subjects liberties, and generall decay of Trade,
reflecting alſo with ſerious thoughts upon thoſe inevitable dangers, that hover over our heads, uſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in by a civill, unnaturall, and bloody Warre, whoſe effects are the impartiall deſtruction of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
the effuſion of much innocent bloud, the impoveriſhing and diſpeopling the Kingdome, and
expoſing the body of the State, to the mercileſſe tyrany of Famine, Sickneſſe, and Invaſion, the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of an univerſall confuſion.</p>
            <p>All which (better knowne to your apprehenſions) wee humbly deſire you to ponder, and leave no juſt
way unattempted, which may conduce to the ſettlement of theſe differences, that the undiſcerning ſword
be not umpire to diſcide controverſies of ſo neere concernment, neither give audience to the incendiaries
of this Warre, whoſe only ayme (wee feare) is to prey upon the lives and livings of his Majeſties good
and loyall ſubjects, that ſo the goſpell of peace may not be maintained by Warre, but that theſe cemented
joynts of the Church may hold firmer the bond of unity, to the glory of God, the good of his Majeſty,
the preſervation of the Parliament, the only happineſſe of the Kingdome, and inablement for a ſupply of
the neceſsities of our diſtreſſed brethren in IRELAND: and your petitioners ſhall dayly pray, as in all duty
bound, for a bleſsing upon your conſultations; to which wee ſubſcribe our hands and hearts, each ready
to ſacrifice his life for accompliſhment hereof.</p>
