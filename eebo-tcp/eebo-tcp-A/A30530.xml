            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

A just and Lawful TRYAL OF THE <hi>Teachers</hi> and professed <hi>Ministers</hi> Of this age and GENERATION. BY A perfect proceeding against them.

And being brought to the Bar of Justice, these things are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged against them, and legally proved upon them, and their own professed Rule (the Scripture) have judged them guilty.

            <head>A just and lawfull TRYAL.</head>
            <p>THE time of tryal is come, wherein the Lord is trying the hearts of all men; and now it is manifest what lodgeth in the hearts of all man kinde, and by the fruit every tree shall be judged. The Lord hath beheld the wickedness of this generation, and it is very great, and comes not short, but rather abounds all other generations that have gone before: Wickednesse is grown high among Teachers and people, and the measure of iniquity is fulfilling daily. Come let us reason together; What think you? was there ever such a generation of Teachers as this is? Have they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny example that ever went before for their wickedness? to whom may they be compared? or with whom shall we parallel them? And because they say the Scripture is their Rule, therefore will we try them by it, and their own mouths shall condemn them; and such they shall be concluded to be, whose example they do follow, be it Ministers of Christ, or be it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers; unto the Apostles and Ministers of Christ they are compared, but are found quite contrary in many things, and their practise fitly sutes and agrees with all the false Prophets &amp; deceivers: and thus I shall prove them according to Scripture, wherein these men that are Teachers do disagree to the Apostles &amp; Ministers of Christ which he sent forth in former gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; and wherein they do agree with the deceivers, and Antichrists and false Prophets, that have run, and not been sent.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And first of all, the Apostles and Ministers of Christ were made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <note place="margin">Act. 1. 8. 4. 31. Mat 10. 8. 1 Joh. 1. 1.</note> of Christ by the <hi>gift of the Holy Ghost, and by power from on high onely,</hi> and what they Ministered unto others, <hi>they had freely received from Christ, and had handled, felt and tasted of the word of life:</hi> But the Teachers of this generation doth not agree with them in this, for they are made Ministers by natural learning and education, and the knowledge of Arts, and by the ordination of men, and by powers of this world, (and not by the gift of the Holy Ghost) and they spake that which they have heard out of books, and studied for by Arts, and which they have received from man, and not that which they have received only from the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Ministers of Christ they <hi>were approved of God, and called by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>into the work of the Ministry, and were not of man; neither by man,</hi> But many of these are approved of man, and not of God, and called by man,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52864:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and maintained by men in their Ministry; and herein they do differ and disagree; for (as I said) the Ministers of Christ were made Minister<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>by the Holy Ghost,</hi> and not by natural learning, but these are made Ministers by natural learning, or otherwise, and not by the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, herein do they disagree, The Ministers of Jesus Christ <hi>went</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 16. 4. 7. 11. 12. Acts 17. 17. 1 Cor. 4 11</note> 
               <hi>up and down through the World, declaring the word of the Lord freely at any time, in the Market-places, and in the Synagogues, and in the Streets, and went from Countrey to Countrey, and were strangers upon earth, not having any certain dwelling place, or any great Parsonages.</hi> But these settle themselves in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, for so much money by the year, and spend their time in ease and pleasure, and lust of the flesh, selling to the people for money what they preach, and herein they disagree; the Ministers of Christ preached freely as they had <hi>received freely;</hi> but the Ministers of this age sells for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney what they preach to the people: and thus they differ in their call to the Ministry, and in their practice in the ministry, and in their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance also, as is made manifest to many.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again, the Ministers of Christ preached to bring people into <hi>fellowship</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Joh. 1. 31.</note> 
               <hi>with God</hi> by preaching of the <hi>Gospel through converting sinners unto the knowledge of the truth,</hi> and by no other way did they make Christians, nor counted any so but such as had repented and were changed by the spirit. But the Teachers of this age do make Christians, by sprinkling them while they are Infants, before they preach the Gospel to them, or before they repent of their sins; and they bring them into fellowship, by traditions and a vain shew of baptism, and not by the spirit of God; and herein also they disagree, the one counted none Christians but such as were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the spirit of God, and knew the operation of Gods spirit; and the other counts all Christians that are sprinkled when they are Infants, while they are without the operation of the spirit of God, and converts them not unto God by their preaching, but tells them they are Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they preach to them.</p>
            <p n="5">5, Again, they differ in Doctrine; for the Ministers of Christ preached <note place="margin">John. 1. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Acts. 26. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Christ the light of the World, and said, he lighted every man that cometh into the World:</hi> But the Teachers of this age contend against that, and saith every man is not enlightned by him, but some have no light from Christ: and the Ministers of Christ <hi>they turned people to the light, from the darkness, and from Satans power to the Power of God;</hi> But the Teachers of this age doth <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13.</note> not turn people to the light of Christ within, but to the Saints words without, or to some other thing, and are divided among themselves, and so in effect cryes, Lo here, and lo there is Christ in this from, or that form; but the Ministers of Christ said, <hi>he was within people, or else they were Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Again, the Ministers of Christ said, <hi>Christ was the word,</hi> and the <note place="margin">Rev. 19. 13. Luke 1. 1.</note> Scripture <hi>was a Declaration of what they believed.</hi> But the Teachers of this age saith, the Letter and the Scripture is the Word, and saith it <hi>is the Instrument wherby God saves souls,</hi> &amp; saith <hi>it is both the writings and the things signified;</hi> and saith <hi>it is the foundation of foundations,</hi> but thus the Ministers of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52864:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Christ never spoke of the Letter: and thus herein they differ and disagree, the one preacheth <hi>Christ to be the Word,</hi> The other preacheth the Letter and the Scripture to be the Word. The Ministers of Christ said, <hi>Christ was</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eph 2 20.</note> 
               <hi>the foundation;</hi> but these say the Scripture is the foundation, and herein they are contrary, and sheweth by their Doctrine another spirit then was in the Apostles.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Again, the Ministers of Christ said <hi>they spoke wisdom among them that were perfect,</hi> and said. <hi>As many of us as are perfect be thus minded;</hi> and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 6. Phil. 3. Col. 1 28.</note> said, <hi>that the end</hi> of their Ministery <hi>was to present every man perfect in Christ.</hi> But the Teachers of this age denies persection, and say, None must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in this life; and if any preach up perfection, that it is to be attained, they say it is Error, and damnable Doctrine: Nay, they say none shall ever be free from sin, or ever have victory over their sin, nor overcome the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of sin while he be upon Earth: But the Ministers of Christ witnessed they were <hi>more then conquerers,</hi> and that they had put off the body of death, <hi>and were free from sin, and were the servants of Righteousnesse.</hi> And <note place="margin">Rom. 8, 37. Rom, 6. 22.</note> herein also they differ, and are not of one spirit; and we know that the Ministers of Christ were guided by the spirit of God, which held forth these Doctines; and we know the Teachers of this age, that their spirit must needs be of the Devil, because it holds forth and Practiseth what the Ministers of Christ did not, but the contrary.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Again, the Ministers of Christ were <hi>persecuted</hi> and <hi>suffered cruel and grievous things for righteousnesse sake,</hi> as you may read in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and <hi>did not render evil for evil to any man, for they suffered patiently.</hi> But the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of this age are not persecuted, but are Persecutor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and causeth men to be put into prison, and to be banished out of Towns; and sues people at the Law, and seeks occasions against the people of God; and herein they <note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 15.</note> disagree, and are not of the same spirit as they were which were Ministers of Christ, but sheweth a spirit contrary.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Again, the Ministers and Apostles of Christ <hi>were not chargeable to any, but made the Gospel without charge, and free, and laboured with their own hands,</hi> and did not live idely, but <hi>were often in cold, bunger, and nakedness, and perils, and tryals:</hi> but the Teachers of this age live in pride, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, and fulness, and doth not work with their own hands, but makes the Gospel of Christ chargeable, for many hundred thousand pounds in a <note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 8. 1 Cor. 11. 26. 22.</note> year doth but maintain them, which they have out of poor mens labours; and so these differ and disagree from the Ministers of Christ, and shews they are not of that spirit that they were guided by, but are guided by a contrary spirit, because they are contrary in their call, and in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and practise, and maintenance.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Again, the Ministers of Christ preached by the splrit, <hi>according as the spirit gave them utterance, and somtime continued preaching till midnight:</hi> But the Teachers of this age are limited by a glasse, and preacheth by a glass, and when the hour is out, their time of peaching is ended, and that <note place="margin">Acts 2. 4. Acts 20, 7.</note> which they have studyed for before-hand, that they preach, and not that which they have received immediately from the spirit of God: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52864:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
do they disagree, and in many things more, which after may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Again, the Ministers of Christ said, <hi>Ye may all prophesie one by one,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 31. 1 Pet. 4. 10. Acts 21. 9.</note> 
               <hi>that all might be edified; and as every one had received the gift of Christ, so they might minister to others, and desired that all the Lords people were Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Sons and Daughters did prophesie:</hi> But the teachers of this age will not suffer all to prophesie one by one, neither will allow any to preach as they have received from Christ, without such qualifications, and learned Arts, and ordinations of men, and they will not allow a woman to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie or speak among them, and <hi>all might speak the word of the Lord faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully that had it, and all might minister as they had received it;</hi> this was order in the Apostles dayes among them, but this is now counted confusion <note place="margin">Ier. 23. 28.</note> by the Teachers of this age; and if any speak to them or any among them, many such are made to suffer cruelty, or imprisonment, or such like, by their means; and herein they disagree, and shew that they are guided by another spirit than the Ministers of Christ were guided by, and so are not his Ministers, but Deceivers.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Again, the Ministers of Christ declared what they had <hi>heard, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 1. 2 Cor. 10. 16. 2. Cor. 4, 2.</note> 
               <hi>seen and felt, and tasted of the word of life; and none of them did boast in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans line,</hi> but what they all had received of the Lord, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and not their own inventions, and <hi>commended themselves to every mans Conscience in the sight of God;</hi> and they did not provide themselves Studies full of books to gather out of in a weeks time what to preach on the first dayes, as the Teachers of this age do, who by vain study, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning, frames up, and notes it in a Book, an hour, or two hours discourse to the people. And herein they disagree, and sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And here is their treachery made manifest, while they say they preach the Gospel in love to souls, yet its manifest they preach for love of money, for few or none of them preaches where there is no money; and people are absolute blind that do not see them, for in all things they agree with the deceivers and false prophets of old, and shews that they be of the very same spirit; and thus you see their own rule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns them, and because they say the Scripture is their Rule, therefore I have thought good to lay them to it, and measure them by their own line, &amp; all people may see wherin they are quite contrary to the Ministers of Christ, and wherein they wholly agree with the deceivers.

them by, let them bring in'their plea and defend themselves for this, if it be possible, for in those things which I have named, and many other, it is manifest, that they fully agree with the Deceivers, and disagree with the Minister o Christ, and by their fruits they are perfectly made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.</p>
            <p>Again, Christ spake in his daies, and the Apostles in their dayes, that false prophets and deceivers should come into the world, and after them, and they gave discriptions what such they should be, and what fruit they should bring forth, as I have before mentioned in that 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. and it is plain that these deceivers &amp; false prophets did come in, according as was prophesied; for <hi>Iohn</hi> said, <hi>By this we know it is the last times, for now are they come,</hi> which was many hundred years ago: I say, the deceiver and false Prophets which Christ prophesied of to come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. came into the world many hundred years ago, as you may read, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. And with this I shall conclude this particular, the teachers of this age by their fruits are proved already to be of that stock, and succeeders in the same works, by the same spirit of them which Christ said should come, and which the Apostle saw was then come, and so they did deceive many, as these do deceive many in the same way as them that went before them; And so let it not be a thing incredible to the people of these Nations, that many of these teachers which are called Ministers, are deceivers gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; but if there be any one that fears God among them, or loves truth and sincerity, it will be made manifest, and such I spare, and they shall be spared in the day of the Lord; But it I say, generally, and the main part of them, even they that bring forth these fruits before mentioned, which the false prophets brought forth, are not the Ministers of Christ, but deceivers, the Scripture, their own professed Rule doth prove them so; for it must needs be that they must be the same men that they were, whose spirit they walk by, and whose fruits they bring forth; and this cannot be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are the same trees that bring forth the same fruits; and let no man blame me for saying such are deceivers, that preacheth for hire, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines for mony, and goes for gifts and reward; and that are called of men Master, and have the chief place in the assemblies, and are covetous, and high-minded, and seeks for their gain from their quarter, with those things which I have mentioned, which are the same things wch the false Prophets acted in ages past; I say, I am not now to be blamed for saying these are deceivers, who are acting such things now in this age, as they acted then that were deceivers; but if you blame any, begin with <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and <hi>Micah,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and Christ and his Apostles, and the rest of the Holy men of God, for they are my examples in this, who did declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them that brought forth such works as these do that I have declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against, and I have done the teachers of this age no wrong for judging them by their own line, and laying them to their own professed rule; therefore do not rage at me, nor do not be offended at this; for I have but compared them with the Ministers of Christ, and with the Ministers of Antichrist, and shewed wherein they do agree to the one, and disagree to

the other; and all people may see, and the light in all conciences may judge of what I have said, so that as I said at the first, I may again say, what think you? was there ever such a generation of teachers? I now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, yea; there was in the days of the true Prophets; and in the days of the Apostles there were such as these are, which were deceivers; and is the times of Christ, there were such a generation as these are, who act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same things by the same spirit, as these do at this day; let them te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to this that will, my question is sober, and my answer is just and right, and I have dealt faithfully; and you may read the Scriptures that I have quoted for your own satisfaction; for though they falsly say, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is their rule, and accuseth us falsly that we deny the Scripture, yet the Scripture shall be judge between us in this matter; and what I have done is not in envy to any mans person, neither in upbraiding them i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l the Scriptures concerning the false Prophets, that they were so extreamly covetous and greedy of gain as these are, or that ever they took such desperate, wicked unlawful courses to get their maintenance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel people to pay them, as these teachers do, a very shame to rehearse it, and to their shame I do rehearse it, many a poor man in this Nation hath been sued by them at the Law, and put in prison by their means, and had their goods spoiled in a woful manner, for to maintain them, and to uphold them; yea some hundreds of poor people in this Nation, hath been dealt cruelly by, and unjustly with, because for conscience sake they have denyed to maintain them, to pay them tithes, or such like, this may be proved, that for five shillings unjustly claimed by them, they have taken goods by distraint to the value of five times so much, as <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> and <hi>Westmorland</hi> can witnesse, and many at this very day lies in holes and prisons by the means of the Priests, who teareth the people as Wolves doth the sheep; it is even woful to be considered, what havock is made of some mens persons, and some mens goods, and all to maintain the Teachers; the like never was in any generation, as is brought forth in this generation in this particular; and again their exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covetousnesse and greedinesse of lucre doth appear in that they claim wages of people, and do compel people to pay them wages after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I have said, for which people they do no work, neither do these people receive any work done by them with whom they thus deal; what thing can be more unjust under Heaven, that they should compel people by a Law to pay them, and thus punishes them if they will not, who set them not on work, and for whom they do no work; neither doth the people like their work or love it, but knows it to be deceitful, and yet are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52864:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
compelled by a Law to pay them; they have such a way to get money, that no trades-man besides themselves like it, for they cause people, and compel people to buy their wares, and they compel people to pay for their commoditie, which hath none of it, nor loves it; and this is more unjust then may be spoken, are they like Ministers of Christ? Or do they follow their example in these practices? What do you judge? All people bring in your verdict: or are they not like deceivers herein, even exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that everwent before; it is true they which preach the Gospel should live on the Gospel; this argument we do own, but let these men be tryed, and see if by their preaching their Gospel they have gained so much love in people as to maintain them without the Law, and without compelling of maintenance and livelihood from them by a Law; let but the Law cease to compel Tithes, and other things, from people to maintain them, and see whether their Gospel will maintain them or not, let but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates hold their hands from causing people to pay them Tythes by their orders and writs, &amp; i'le undertake, as I do believe they must either beg, or work, or a worse thing for a livelihood, or else perish, so little love is there in their own people towards them, so little love have they gained in the hearts of many people toward them these many years that they have preached; &amp; herein again I do believe that they do exceed all the false prophets: &amp; all the deceivers that ever went before them in this respect, none ever had the Magistrates to act for them as these have, and as it appears, the Rulers some of them are at the wils of the teachers, to do for them what they desire, either to take peoples goods, or to send them to prison; shewing that these Teachers have not a spiritual weapon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves, but that the Magistrates with their Law are their chiefest Armour, for if they can but get favour of a Magistrate, they have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to preach at such a place, and if they can get the favour of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate they can do well enough to be maintained, by causing such to be sent to prison, or taking treble dammages upon their goods if they wil not help to maintain them: and if they have the favour of the Magistrate, if any do reprove them for these things, and for other of their wickednesse, and if any do but tell them of it, they can have such sent to prison, as in revenge, for speaking and reproving them for their wickednesse, hath some hundreds of innocent people suffered cruel imprisonments, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cruel things in these Nations, so that iniquity is upheld as it were by force and power: so that it is not their Gospel that maintains them and gets them favour with the people, nor doth it defend them, but it is the command and warrant of the Magistrate which doth all this: so when the Magistrates ceaseth to approve them, to maintain them, and defend them, they must utterly fall into misery, and can neither be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, maintained or defended any other way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for because of this their wickednesse, God hath left them, and all honest true hearted people hath left them, therefore what a condition are the teachers in, who deserves not the love of men because they are so cruel-hearted towards them, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52864:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they deserve not the love of God, because they are so wicked against him; and I might yet more fully describe &amp; declare, wherein they do exceed the deceivers and false Prophets of old; but of this according as the Lord moves and leadeth: and this may suffice to shew what they are by their works, and by the spirit that leads them, which appears not to be the spirit of God, but the spirit of Antichrist.</p>
            <p>Furthermore and besides all this that I have said, herein they do exceed the deceivers that are gone before; for upon account the sum of their maintenance yearly in these Nations being reckoned maybe about <note n="†" place="margin">One mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion &amp; five hundred thousand pounds per annum.</note> fifteen hundred thousand pounds a year: Oh wonderful! is not this almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, that the teachers should put the nation to such a charge as this, and yet people receives nothing answerable to it? but all this money is spent for that which is not bread, and their labour wasted, and they have no profit thereby: this money might be made better use of, then to give it for deceiving the people: and if any doubt of this account, and shall think this is not like to be true, upon an even reckoning it may be proved and made appear considering how many parishes there is, and reckon what belongs to every Priests parish, with what is given to the Priests in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is abundance: these things are a shame to the Ministry of Christ, though the impudent teachers of these Nations are void of shame herein.</p>

               <p>VVHereas many of the priests of <hi>England,</hi> to hide themselves from the charge of being hirelings, they alledge these scriptures, <hi>The laborer is worthy of his hire, and the workman is worthy of his meat:</hi> but these Scriptures will not serve to cover their shame in what is charged against them; for this hire which Christ allowes to the labourers, <hi>is but to remain in the same house in which they enter, eating and drinking such things as they give them; with such who were worthy</hi> they were to remain, <hi>and to eat that</hi>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52864:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to suffice nature, with such who are worthy; so this Scripture makes not for their turn, nor doth it justifie their practices.</p>
               <p>Again, they object against and charge the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> who said, <hi>He that preacheth the Gospel shall live on the Gospel, and that it was a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to reap carnal things from them unto whom they sowed spiritual things;</hi> but this Scripture makes not for them; for as I have said, its not the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel that, maintains them, but the Magistrates with their Law that compels maintenance from the people, &amp; this is not to live on the Gospel, for we allow as <hi>Paul</hi> did, that they which preach the Gospel should live on the Gospel; therefore let the Magistrates cease with their power to cause people to pay them, and let all the world see if their gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel will maintain them, and let them reap their carnal things from them where they sow spiritual; but they must reap as a free gift too, and not by compulsion, for so the Apostle signifies, it is a small matter for <hi>any to reap carnal things where they sow spiritual things;</hi> yet what is this to prove the lawfulnesse of bargaining with people for so much by the year, as these teachers of <hi>England</hi> do many of them, &amp; will not preach except they have so much promised them before; for it is right to reap after sowing, but it is a transgression to bargain to reap before they sow; &amp; these scriptures will not hide them nor defend them in their practice; for if the Magistrates did not compel from people maintenance by a Law, the Priests of this age would reap but little from anything that they sow, for theres little love in the hearts of people towards them. Also they object, <hi>He that plants a Vineyard, may eat of the fruit thereof, and he that keeps a flock, may eat of the milk of the flock,</hi> this <hi>Paul</hi> said though he would not make use of his power herein, but wrought with his hands, that the Gospel might not be chargeable; but what vineyards have the teachers. of <hi>England</hi> planted? or what flocks do they keep? their vinyards proves not tender grapes, but wild sowr grapes, wild vines, and not vines to bring forth acceptable fruits; and their flocks proves not flocks of sheep, but wild rude peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who are in the nature of wolves, and Lyons, and if the Magistrates Law were not, their vineyard nor the flock would hardly yield them any maintenance; the Apostles planted first a vineyard, and gathered the sheep, before they reaped or eat any of the fruits, but the teachers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> differ from them in this, for they know what they must have before they plant, or before they seed their flock, and differs from the Apostles practice who first planted a vineyard, and gathered a flock before they could receive any crop; and they would <hi>not then use their power,</hi> but kept the Gospel of Christ without charge; so that this scripture will not prove the Priests actions lawful, in preaching for sums of mony: and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures they bring to prove the lawfulnesse of their preaching for hire, which may all be answered as these are, and whatsoever they can ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

whom the Ministers are made stewards, <hi>to watch over them &amp; to exhort them, to instruct them, and to edifie them;</hi> but not from the World who continues in unbelief and disobedience to the Gospel, may they receive any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward maintenance by compulsion, or by a free gift, neither may they receive great sums of mony by the year, or Tithes, or other offerings to maintain themselves and their families in pride and idlenesse, and lust and excess, and superfluity in meats and apparel; such a maintenance is by free gift, much lesse by force that is not allowed by Christ and his Saints, but is the maintenance of Antichristian Teachers, which never were sent of Christ, and such cannot be content with his allowance and wages, but lives in pride and pleasures of this world, and in vanity; and maintained they say they must be, and if they be so, they care not from whence it come, nor by what means; and that is the reason wherefore so many hundreds of honest people are so spoiled in their persons and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, the bodies of some being cast into prison and many others having their goods taken from them by force and distraint; and all this is to maintain Antichrists Ministers, who neither cares how they have it, nor from whom, or to what evil use they improve it; and this plainly appears in this Nation, by many evidences, but the Ministers of Christ doth deny such a maintenance, and such practises, and are come to that life which judgeth all these things.</p>
            <p>And as concerning <hi>compelling</hi> of maintenance, and forcing of it from people, this is utterly against the Law of Christ, and condemned by him and denyed by the Saints; for it is unreasonable and no equality in it, that people should be compelled to maintain a Ministry, especially such a one as they know is not the Ministry of Christ, neither is profitable to them, and which they receive no fruits from, for the Ministers of Christ doth not desire maintenance from the people of the world, neither can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any from them, neither in justice and equity should the Ministers of the world receive or <hi>compel maintenance</hi> from the Saints by force and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty: but this we would, and this is reason and equitie, let all ministers be maintained by such as approves them, and hears them, and partakes of their labours, and so the Saints will maintain their Ministers, and the world may maintain theirs, and every sort of people may maintain such Ministers as labours for them, and none to be forced to maintain such as they do not approve of, nor none hindred from maintaining of such, as they do approve of, be they true, or false Ministers; and this is reason and a good conscience, that every man be left free in such cases, <hi>to maintain whom he will, and to give as he will, and what he will;</hi> and this is reason and equity, that no man be compelled to give, or <hi>hindred</hi> from giving to whom he pleaseth, and what he pleaseth, and so let people make choice of their Ministers, whom they will approve and whom they will hear, and of whose labours they will receive, &amp; then let them main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, and if any be compelled, let them be compelled to pay their own servants, who ministers to them and not anothers, for whom the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

that every Minister be paid by them to whom he doth minister, and who receives him as a Minister, and for whom he doth work; and this great injustice and oppression in <hi>England</hi> will cease, if this Law of equity and righteousnesse were established, and all people left free to hear and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of whom they will, and then to pay them &amp; maintain them; and this would try the Ministers, and who converted the most to God, and gained the love of most people, and if they wrought well they may receive a <hi>maintenance accordingly, by the free gift of the people;</hi> and the Ministers that are not content with this Law, are out of pure reason and equitie, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they dare not trust the Lord, <hi>nor the fruits of their labors,</hi> but would be maintained in idleness, by unlawful means, by compelling maintenance from them to whom they do no work; and such shews great covetousness, who desires more then the <hi>milk of their own flock, and the fruits of their own vineyard;</hi> but in equity and justice let every Minister be maintained by the fruits of his own labour, from the people for whom he doth labour, and this will content most part of the people; and till this be established in the earth, truth, justice and judgment will be wanting in this particular; and this is according to truth, and to a righteous Law; and by this all people may understand what Ministers and Ministry we do allow and approved, and how Ministers ought to be maintained; and if any go forth to a place and country, and among the people that are not converted, then the Church ought to take care to maintain such in their work, till they may reap of their own labour, and eat of the fruit of their own Vineyard, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
