            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A New Engagement, or, Manifeſto: Wherein is declared the ſence and Reſolution of many thouſands of well-affected people in and about LONDON, and ſome adjacent Counties (viz. Kent, Hartford, Buckingham, and Berks, &amp;c.) who ſeeing all preſent Authorities to be perverted from their naturall end, the Peoples Safety, are neceſſitated to invite all Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Engliſhmen to put themſelves into a Poſture of Defending their own and Countries Liberties, and to labour for a ſpeedy eſtabliſhment of a Juſt and Equall Government.</head>
            <p>Publiſhed at the deſire of ſome honeſt and eminent perſons, for the ſatisfaction of all that ſeek not the advancement of Parties and Factions, but deſire the Peace and proſperitie of the Nation.</p>
            <p>THE freedom we were born to, is ſo juſtly due to every Engliſh man, that whoſoever ſhall remember the vehemency wherewith the people did thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Parliament before they had this; the zeal wherewith they contributed to the late War, for defence of this freedom, and the ſucceſs wherewith it hath pleaſed God to bleſs thoſe endeavours, will ſoon be ſatisfied that there is no better cauſe in the world to engage upon. And therefore,</p>
            <p>The cauſe we undertake at preſent, (for which we carry our lives in our hands) being the very ſame, will certainly need no Apology for it ſelf; the only thing that may ſeem ſtrange in theſe our actings being the irregular manner of proſecuting our un-doubted rights.</p>
            <p>Herein we deſire it may be conſidered, that all ordinary means, and ſome extraordinary have been already attempted, and after much patience proved altogether fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. That the Parliament hath made no other uſe of thoſe many ſignal opportunities put into their hands, then to continue their ſitting at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and dividing the publike treaſure among themſelves. That the chief Officers of the Army, though pretending to keep up the Forces under them, to ſee the ſame for the peoples good, accompliſhed in a ſhort time; have yet made no other uſe of their power, then to continue and enlarge their own commands. That beſides our being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of the fruit ſo long expected, and being made more ſlaves every day then other, to Committees, and ſundry other like arbitrary courſes, even in the moſt legal proceedings we find ſo much corruption tediouſneſs, chargeableneſs and obſcurity, practiſed and abetted by Officers of all ſorts, that the Law it ſelf is become no protection to us in our Properties or Liberties.</p>
            <p>We find that barbarous courſe ſtill maintained of impriſoning men for debt, thereby, hindering them from the uſe of their lawful callings, though they have nothing elſe wherewith to ſatisfie their Creditors, or to preſerve themſelves and their families from ſtarving.</p>
            <p>We find, that the reſtraining mens perſons at pleaſure, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thout cauſe rendred, and during pleaſure, was never more frequent.</p>
            <p>We find, That Tythes, whoſe beginning was ſuperſtitious, and is found by experience to oppreſs the poor husbandmen, to be vexations to all manner of people, and prejudicial to the Common wealth, were never ſo rigorouſly and cruelly exacted as at this preſent.</p>
            <p>We find Taxes to be ſo multiplyed without number or hopes of end, and Exciſe ſo cruelly exacted, that no man knows what is, or what ſhall be his own: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many millions of moneys have been levied and paid, both voluntarily and by compulſion, yet no accompt is given how they have been expended; but the publike debts are dayly increaſed, in ſtead of being ſatisfied, and ſuch vaſt ſums of money paid dayly out of the publike treaſury for intereſt, unto ſome rich Uſurers, as is almoſt incredible.</p>
            <p>We find the Trade of the nation (which the Parlia. at firſt promiſed to advance) to be ſo generally decayed, that without ſpeedy remedy the nation cannot long ſubſiſt. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

            <p>Conſidering therefore this deplorable eſtate of the Common-wealth, and the apparent danger of being imbroyled again each in others blood, unleſs a ſpeedy ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prevent it and conſidering not only that we have attempted all Regular ways, to procure relief for our long oppreſſed Country, but alſo that we cannot with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty any longer offer our grievances, and deſires to the Parliament in Petitions; and likewiſe conſidering, that our ſlavery under Arbitrary powers, is occaſioned by the want of a ſettlement of a juſt and equal Government, which, if it were eſtabliſhed, would ſpeedily eaſe us of all our common burthens; we cannot bethink our ſelves of a more probable remedy then to put our ſelves, and invite our Country-men to joyn with us in a poſture of defence, whereby we may be ſecure from danger, and from being prevented of our good intentions by the oppoſition of ſuch as have deſigned our ſlavery, while we propound to all our dear Country-men (who are ſure to be concerned as much as though they were in office) ſome certain grounds of common Right and Freedom, wherein they and we might ſee reaſon to agree among our ſelves, and thereupon to eſtabliſh a firm and preſent peace.</p>
            <p>The Particulars we offer are as followeth:
<list>
                  <item>1. That a period of time be ſet wherein this preſent Parliament ſhal certainly end.</item>
                  <item>2. That the people be equally proportioned for the cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce of their Depu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies in all future Parliaments, and that they do of courſe meet upon a certain day once at leaſt in two years for that end.</item>
                  <item>3. That a Contract be drawn and ſealed between the People and their ſeveral Deputies reſpectively, upon the day of their Election, wherein the bounds, limits and extent of their truſt ſhall be clearly expreſſed. As that they be empowered with ſufficient authority for enacting, altering and repealing of Laws; for erecting and aboliſhing Judicatories; for appointing, removing and calling to account of Magiſtrates and Officers of all degrees; for making War and Peace, and Treating with Forraign States. And that their power do not extend to the binding of any man in matters of Religion, or in the way of Gods Worſhip; nor to compel the perſon of any innocent man to ſerve againſt his will either by Sea or Land; nor to the making of any Law that ſhal be either evidently pernicious to the people, or not equally obligatory to all perſons, without exception.</item>
                  <item>4. That for the ſecurity of all parties, which have acted on any ſide in the late publick differences ſince the year 1640. and for preventing all contentions amongſt them, the people may agree amongſt themſelves, that no future Parliaments ſhall queſtion or moleſt any perſon, for any thing ſaid or done in reference to thoſe publicke differences.</item>
                  <item>5. That the great Officers of the Kingdom as well Civill as Military, be often removed, and others put in their roomes, either every year or every ſecond year at the fartheſt, to the end that the perſons employed may diſcharge their places with the greater care when they know themſelves lyable to a ſpeedie account, and that other men may be encouraged to deſerve prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when they ſee the preſent incumbents not affixed to their Offices as to free-holds.</item>
                  <item>6. That all determinating Committees (except ſuch as are neceſſary to be kept up for the managing of Forces by Sea or Land) the Chancery with all other Arbitrary Courts, be forthwith diſſolved, or at leaſt all power taken from them, which they have hitherto exerciſed over mens perſons or Eſtates, and that henceforward as well Ordinances as acts of Parliament be executed in the Ancient way of Tryalls by Juries.</item>
                  <item>7. That the huge volumes of Statute-Laws and Ordinances with the penalties therein impoſed, as well corporall as pecuniarie, be well reviſed, and ſuch onely left in force as ſhall be found fit for the Common-wealth, eſpecially, that mens lives be more precious then formerly, and that leſſer puniſhments then death, and more uſefull to the publique be found out for ſmall offences. That all Laws, Writs, Commiſſions, pleadings and records be in the Engliſh tongue, and that proceedings be reduced to a more certain cheap and expeditious way then formerly. That no Fees at all be exacted of the people in Courts of juſtice, but that the publick Miniſters of State be wholly maintained out of the publique Treaſurie.</item>
                  <item>8. That Eſtates of all kinds reall and perſonall be made lyable to debts, but no empriſonment at all by way of puniſhment, nor in order to making that ſatisfaction, which poſſibly can never be made, but onely by way of ſecuritie in order to a tryall for ſome criminall Fact, to be determined within ſome ſhort and certain ſpace of time, and that this power of reſtraining mens perſons be very cauciouſly allowed, to which end the benefit of <hi>Habeas Corpuſſes</hi> to be in no caſe donyed by thoſe whom it concerns to grant them.</item>
                  <item>9. That Tythes be wholy taken away, the pariſhoner, from whence they are due, paying in liew thereof to the State where they are not appropriate, and to the owner where they are, a moderate and certain rent charge out of his land. The Miniſters to be maintained either by the voluntary contribution of ſuch as deſire to hear them, or elſe by ſome ſettled penſions out of the publike treaſure.</item>
                  <item>10. That as ſpeedy and as perfect an Accompt as may be, be given and publiſhed for the ſatisfaction of the people, how thoſe vaſt ſums of money have been diſpoſed of that have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed voluntarily and other wiſe, ſince the beginning of theſe troubles.</item>
                  <item>11. That ſo ſoon as publike occaſions will poſſibly permit, the impoſition of Exciſe and all other Taxes upon the people be wholy taken away; and that in the mean time all care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence be uſed, in taking away thoſe occaſions, and in the husbandly managing of the publike purſe, and to that end that a balance be made and declared of all publike revenues and expences; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat a courſe be taken for paying all publike debts and damages ſo far as may be; that the debts upon intereſt be diſcharged by ſale of ſuch lands and goods as are either properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or any ways accrewed to the State, and that they be ſold to the beſt advantage.</item>
                  <item>12. That there be no leſs care taken for the growing wealth of the Nation, conſiſting principally in trade, which being our ſtrength and glory, ought by mitigating of the Cuſtomes, and by all other good means, to be cheriſhed and encouraged.</item>
                  <item>13. That (though reſtoring peace and commerce be the ſureſt way of providing for the poor) yet ſome more effectual courſe may be found out then hitherto hath been for ſetting thoſe to work who are able, for bringing up of children to profitable employments, and for relieving ſuch as are paſt their labor, eſpecially ſuch as became ſo in the ſervice of their Country, during the late War.</item>
                  <item>14. That the affairs of Ireland be taken into a more ſerious conſideration then heretofore, and that a peaceable way of reducing that Nation may be once endeavoured, and in caſe that ſucceed not, the War be proſecuted with that vigor and unanimity, as, by Gods bleſſing, we may promiſe to our ſelves a ſpeedy end of thoſe troubles, a timely relief to many famiſhing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies there, and better intend the affairs of England.</item>
                  <item>15. That all Monopolies and reſtraint of trade, under colour of any Companies, Fraternities, or otherwiſe be forthwith aboliſhed.</item>
                  <item>16. That the Ancient and almoſt antiquated badge of ſlavery, <hi>viz.</hi> all baſe Tenures by Copies Oaths of Fealty, Homage, Fines, at the will of the Lord, &amp;c. (being the Conquerors marks upon the people) may be taken away; and to that end that a certain valuable rate be ſet, at which all poſſeſſors of Lands ſo holden, may purchaſe themſelves Freeholders, and in caſe any ſhall not be willing or able, that there be a prefixed period of time after which all Services, Fines, Cuſtomes, &amp;c. ſhall be changed into, and become a certain Rent, that ſo perſons diſaffected to the Freedom and welfare of the Nation, may not have that advantage upon the people, to draw them into a War againſt themſelves upon any occaſion, by vertue of an awe upon them in ſuch dependent tenures.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſidering that the ſettlement of the Nations Peace and Freedom hath been conſtantly declared by the Parliament to be their only end in engaging in the late War, and conſidering the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r many promiſes, ſolemn vows, and oaths made by them to the people to confirm them in the belief of their ſincere intentions therein, we ſhould hope to find no oppoſition from them in theſe our deſires; but however we cannot but be confident that the Souldiery of the Army (who ſolemnly ingaged at Newmarket, in June la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
