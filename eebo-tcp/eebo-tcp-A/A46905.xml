            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that have plowed with their heifers to find out the
riddle.</p>
            <p>1. Some straining the words so far, as to interpret
them to be a <hi>prediction</hi> of the rejecting of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
and election or taking in of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi>
being those, that like untamed <hi>heifers,</hi> would not
submit their necks to the yoke of Gods law, which
was as difficult for that stubborn and stiff-necked
people to do,<note place="margin"> in loc.</note> as for the wild oxe (of which S. <hi>Jerome</hi>

therefore Christ rejecting these, makes choice of
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> a people of a more tame and gentle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to bear his Evangelical yoke, and to them he
says, <hi>take my yoke upon you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Others conceive the Prophet by these words
to express the <hi>Israelites ineptitude</hi> and <hi>unfitness</hi> for
the performance of any good that was required of,
or expected from them. They were like the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's
girdle</hi> hid at <hi>Euphrates, marred;</hi> or like the <hi>pin</hi>
in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> made of the vine, <hi>useless, and good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
they were</hi> (as the Psalmist speaks) <hi>wise to do
evil, but to do good, they had no understanding. The

               <hi>did not know,</hi> this brutish people did not understand.
They misunderstood, or neglected their duty, and
were as <hi>unskilfull</hi> in the <hi>choice,</hi> as <hi>unfit</hi> for the <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi>
of it; their <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>wishes</hi> being like those of
the <hi>horse</hi> and <hi>oxe,</hi> mentioned by the <hi>Poet, Optat
ephippia bos piger, optat arare caballus.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to these creatures, the <hi>Prophet</hi> compares them,
it being as impossible for them to do well, or run in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95143:3"/>
the ways of Obedience, as it is for <hi>Horses to run upon
the rock, or one to plow there with Oxen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Others apprehend the words as a <hi>reproof</hi> of
their <hi>folly,</hi> in that they thought to advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or establish their kingdom by idolatry, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
and the like, mentioned <hi>ch.</hi> 4. which was a
course as <hi>foolish,</hi> as a <hi>horses running upon a rock,</hi> and
as <hi>fruitless,</hi> as <hi>ones plowing there with oxen.</hi> As
though the <hi>Prophet</hi> had told them, how agreeable
soever wickedness was to their <hi>nature,</hi> yet it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their <hi>design;</hi> they made use of very unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>means</hi> to promote their <hi>ends;</hi> they were so far
from advancing themselves by <hi>impiety,</hi> that they
took the <hi>readiest</hi> and <hi>most compendious</hi> way to effect
their <hi>ruine.</hi> They that think by fraud and injustice,
by oppression and violence, by rapine and other
wickedness to lay the foundation of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
do thereby undermine those very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which they lay; they cannot set upon a
more speedy and effectual way of <hi>destroying</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
than by <hi>practising</hi> such attempts upon
others.</p>
            <p>4. Others understand the words as a <hi>reproof</hi> of
their <hi>gross security,</hi> and <hi>sottish stupidity,</hi> in that they
thought, notwithstanding their sins, <hi>God</hi> upon the
account of his <hi>Covenant,</hi> was bound to be propitious
to them, and to load them with his benefits; they
looked that themselves (like <hi>Gideons</hi> fleece) should
be <hi>wet with the dew of heavens blessing,</hi> though all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
about them, were but as <hi>dry ground:</hi> Because
<hi>God</hi> entred into league with their Fathers, they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95143:4"/>
therefore expected the <hi>benefit</hi> of that covenant,
though they did not perform the <hi>condition</hi> of it.
The <hi>Prophet</hi> at once refutes their <hi>folly,</hi> and condemns
their <hi>impiety,</hi> telling them <hi>God</hi> could be unmindfull
of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> seeing they on their parts had so
hainously broken it; and whilest they were such <hi>stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi>
and <hi>senseless rocks,</hi> he could no more run on in
the way of <hi>blessing,</hi> and <hi>doing them good,</hi> than <hi>horses
could run on a rock,</hi> or <hi>one plow there with oxen, for
they had turned judgement into gall, and the fruit of
Righteousness into hemlock,</hi> he therefore must deal
accordingly with them, he will recompense them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their doings. The divine <hi>Nemesis</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliate
to men according to their offences. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
sinner shall not always go unpunished, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>effects</hi> of his sin, adequate to the <hi>nature</hi> of
it. <hi>As I have done</hi> (saith <hi>Adonibezek) so hath God</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 1. 7.</note>
               <hi>requited me.</hi> And though the <hi>Jews</hi> here might think
to escape better, and compound with <hi>God</hi> for their
sins, and hope by their numerous sacrifices, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious
worship to propitiate that <hi>Deity</hi> they had
displeased, yet <hi>God</hi> tells them, <hi>though ye offer me</hi>
               <note place="margin">ch. 5. 22.</note>
               <hi>burnt-offerings, and meat-offerings, I will not accept
them, neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your
fat beasts. Take thou away from me, the noise of thy
songs: for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. But
let judgement run down as waters, and righteousness as
a mighty stream.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Others think the words to be an <hi>exprobration</hi> of<note place="margin">Vincere consuetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem dura est pugna.</note>
their <hi>accustomed courses</hi> in sin, they had been so long
inured to the <hi>practice</hi> thereof, as it was now difficult
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95143:4"/>
or impossible for them to lose the <hi>habit. Can the Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian
change his skin, or the Leopard his spots? then
may ye do well, that are accustomed to do evil. Can
horses run upon a rock, or one plow there with oxen?</hi>
Then may ye execute justice, that have <hi>turned judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into gall;</hi> and do uprightly, that have <hi>turned
righteousness into hemlock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Others take the words to be a <hi>denunciation</hi> or
<hi>threatning</hi> of the <hi>divine judgement,</hi> which should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
overtake them. It is as impossible for such
sinners, as you are, to stand out Gods judgements,
and go free, as 'tis for <hi>horses and oxen to run, or plow
on a rock.</hi> Which judgement some conceive to be
either,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>General,</hi> in the unsuccessfulness of their affairs
and undertakings, wherein their labours should be as
<hi>fruitless,</hi> and endeavours as <hi>successless,</hi> as a <hi>horse</hi> or
<hi>oxe's running</hi> or <hi>plowing upon a craggy rock.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that threatning in <hi>Deut.</hi> They should be <hi>cursed</hi>

the Territories of their Kingdom: yet (as 'tis <hi>v.</hi> 13.)
they <hi>rejoyced in a thing of nought,</hi> for the courage and
strength and success of their enemies should be such,
that they should besiege their gates, beat down their

the Prophets <hi>unsuccessfulness in his reproofs</hi> which
were frustrated by them. They were become so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
in their <hi>principles,</hi> so depraved in their

he is ready to <hi>reprove</hi> himself, for that mispense

               <note place="margin">Ch. 5. 12.</note>
               <hi>and turned aside the poor in the gate</hi> (the place of open

               <hi>in the earth;</hi> or (as the Prophet here expresses
it) <hi>they turned judgement into gall, and the fruits of
righteousness into hemlock,</hi> they made that which
in it self is <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>pleasant,</hi> as <hi>nauseous</hi> and <hi>distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
to <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>gall</hi> and <hi>hemlock</hi> are to the tasts of

            </p>
            <p>In which charge drawn up against them may be
considered,</p>
            <p>1. The specification of their Sin.</p>
            <p>2. The nature and quality of it.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Specification</hi> of it. The Prophet thinks
it not sufficient to tell them onely they are sinners,
but charges that sin upon them, for which they are
most <hi>notorious.</hi> Discourses at large and in <hi>general,</hi>
seldom make impression upon any in <hi>particular;
generalia non pungunt:</hi> Such a reproof is like the
flourishing or brandishing of a sword in the air, none
is pierced or wounded by it; a close and particular
<hi>application</hi> is requisite for <hi>conviction;</hi> as in the
course of the law general accusations will ground no
actions, for if a man be accused, 'tis not sufficient to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95143:6"/>
say he is a malefactour, but he must be charged with
particulars; so the Prophet according to that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
when he arraigns these sinners here, he
frames an indictment against them of <hi>notorious</hi> and
<hi>personal</hi> offences. Men generally take great excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against this kind of dealing, especially they that
are in power and authority, such as those against
whom the Prophet here draws up his accusation,
which notwithstanding is not stifled by any awe of
their <hi>power,</hi> or suppressed by any fear of their <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
If they be <hi>great,</hi> he is the messenger of one
that's <hi>greater,</hi> and therefore if they be bold in <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
it well becomes him to be so in <hi>reproving.</hi> Those
that are advanced above the ordinary pitch of men in
the world, think the addition of their outward for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
(which is often all the worth they have to boast
of) must exempt and priviledge them from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes
which come from those that in any secular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
are below them; accounting it a diminution
of their greatness to be taxed with any crime, as
though the <hi>reproof</hi> of their <hi>sin</hi> were a greater disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
than the <hi>commission</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>It is the folly of men that they had rather be <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered</hi>
in their vices, than <hi>reproved</hi> for them, especially
if they be so notorious as the world takes notice of
them. These magistrates here could happily have
been content that the Prophet had inveighed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
some other sin, wherein they had not been
concerned, thereby to justifie themselves in their
own eyes, whilst they heard others condemned
for that, of which their own thoughts proclaimed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95143:7"/>
them guiltless; but when he comes so close unto
them, as to touch their <hi>guilt,</hi> and thereby to gall their
<hi>conscience,</hi> this proves as bitter and distastfull to them,
as their injustice and oppression did to others.</p>
            <p>Such like entertainment this kind of dealing had
from <hi>Ahab,</hi> who upon that account esteemed <hi>Elijah</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 21. 26.</note>
his enemy, and for the same reason was so incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed<note place="margin">1 Kin. 22. 8.</note>
against <hi>Micaiah,</hi> as he could not endure him.
The <hi>Galatians</hi> entertained hard thoughts of Saint<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 16.</note>
               <hi>Paul</hi> for it, and looked upon him as their enemy
<hi>because he told them the truth.</hi> The mistaken
world counts it <hi>love</hi> and <hi>respect</hi> to forbear <hi>reproof,</hi>
and <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>ill will</hi> to tell men their <hi>faults;</hi>

               <hi>disgustfull his messge,</hi> yet he is so far from <hi>flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
them in their <hi>greatness,</hi> or <hi>soothing</hi> them in their

the <hi>deformity</hi> of their <hi>vices,</hi> and the <hi>stain</hi> of their
<hi>greatness,</hi> even their <hi>injustice</hi> and <hi>oppression,</hi> that
they had <hi>turned judgement into gall, and the fruits

            </p>
            <p>2. Which leads, <hi>secondly</hi> to the consideration of
the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> of their <hi>sin,</hi> which is of great
extent, and like the sin of our first parents, hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others included in it. This is</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Inversio naturae,</hi> an inverting and changing of
nature it self; This is to alter the essence and being
of things; to reduce the creation, as much as is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
into its Primitive <hi>Chaos</hi> and confusion; to take
away all distinction of right and wrong; <hi>to call
evil good, and good evil; to put bitter for sweet, and
sweet for bitter, darkness for light, and light for
darkness;</hi> 'Tis to make <hi>Candida de nigris, &amp; de
candentibus alba.</hi> 'Tis a stranger inversion of nature
than for <hi>horses to run,</hi> or <hi>oxen to plow upon a rock.</hi>
God hath imprinted in the natural consciences of
men notions of right and equity, and he blots out,
and obliterates these, that make so strange a
<hi>metamorphosis,</hi> as to turn <hi>judgement into gall, and
righteousness into hemlock.</hi> This is</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Abusus legis,</hi> an abuse of the law. Which is
abused</p>
            <p>1. By a <hi>bare pretence</hi> unto it, which is a crime so
much the greater, by how much it does the more
closely lurk and shroud it self under that which is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95143:8"/>
intended for its prevention, thereby making the law
a partner with it in the transgression. Such cunning
oppression under the specious colour of justice, is one
of the greatest dishonours can be laid upon the law,
which yet is most commonly done by those that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be the chief preservers of it, who instead of
being <hi>instruments of justice,</hi> become <hi>engines of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,</hi>
which they act the more <hi>safely</hi> and <hi>securely,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
under a pretence of <hi>equity,</hi> being herein like
the <hi>bush</hi> or <hi>bramble</hi> in the Fable, that, instead of
sheltering the sheep from the storm, tears the fleece
from it; such greedily feed upon other mens
<hi>wants,</hi> live by other mens <hi>losses,</hi> and as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
souldier complained against <hi>Pompey, miseriâ
nostrâ magnuses,</hi> they grow great by other mens <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series.</hi>
It was one of the aggravations of <hi>injustice</hi>
that Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> complained of in his time, that<note place="margin">Ad Donat. l. 2. Ep. 2.</note>
               <hi>inter leges ipsas delinquitur, inter jura peccatur, nec
innocentia illic, ubi defenditur, reservatur.</hi> As there
is no <hi>impiety</hi> like that <hi>impiety</hi> that is committed in
Gods <hi>sanctuary,</hi> so no <hi>injustice</hi> like <hi>that injustice</hi>
whereby men in the <hi>midst of laws</hi> sin <hi>against law,</hi>
and do <hi>injustly</hi> in the <hi>Courts of Justice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To erect an high Court of pretended <hi>Justice</hi> to
condemn <hi>Royal innocence,</hi> is so much the <hi>greater
injustice,</hi> by how much under that disguise it would
appear to be the <hi>less. Pretences</hi> of justice alter not
the <hi>nature</hi> of actions, though they may set a fair
<hi>gloss</hi> upon them: The <hi>Devil</hi> is not at all the better
for appearing in <hi>Samuel's</hi> mantle; no more are mens
fraudulent actions for having the law as a cloak to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95143:8"/>
cover them; by the help of which they generally
arrive at a greater <hi>height</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
than they could otherwise attain to. Under the
protection of this, a crafty <hi>pleader,</hi> like <hi>Tertullus,</hi>
will argue any thing <hi>injuriously;</hi> a spitefull <hi>prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,</hi>
like <hi>Sanballat,</hi> will suggest any accusation <hi>falsly:</hi>
a confident <hi>witness,</hi> like those against <hi>Naboth,</hi> will
swear any thing <hi>boldly:</hi> a tame or heedless <hi>jury,</hi> like
the <hi>Jews</hi> against our <hi>Saviour</hi> will swallow down
any thing <hi>rashly</hi> and <hi>inconsiderately:</hi> a craving <hi>Scribe,</hi>
or corrupted <hi>Officer,</hi> like him in the <hi>Gospel</hi> that writ
fifty for an hundred, will for a <hi>tacite</hi> bribe foyst in any
thing <hi>secretly</hi> and <hi>unjustly:</hi> by reason whereof, though
the <hi>Judge</hi> in these cases be not like <hi>Felix</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
a reward <hi>privately,</hi> but administers justice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
by <hi>respects</hi> and <hi>impartially,</hi> yet can he scarce
<hi>hinder</hi> (though he may <hi>complain</hi> as <hi>Dioclesian</hi> the
Emperour, that <hi>pessimis servis cautus &amp; optimus
venderetur imperator</hi>) but that justice will some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be perverted, and <hi>judgement turned into
gall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The law is abused by an <hi>unnecessary use</hi> of it,
when men bring trifling and frivolous suits, not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the Magistrates cognizance to the Judgement
seat; so that let the judgement be what it will, it
must needs in some measure prove <hi>gall</hi> to the parties
concerned in it; for even he that gets the conquest
by so chargeable a remedy, shall thereby be a loser;
a man's <hi>relief</hi> by such means being heavier than the
<hi>injury</hi> it removes; for it often happens, as he in the
story said, <hi>ut tu victrix provincia plores.</hi> In which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95143:9"/>
cases such may have cause to answer the congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations
of their friends, as <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> (in <hi>Plutarch</hi>)
did his after he had gotten two famous victories
over the <hi>Romans,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
if they should get<note place="margin">In vita Pyrrhi.</note>
a few more such victories, it would be to their
utter ruine. And if such quarrelsome and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
spirits (with whom there is no more ado, but
a <hi>word</hi> and an <hi>action,</hi> a <hi>trespass</hi> and a <hi>process</hi>)
will not be so favourable to themselves as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
such trivial actions, it were well if <hi>Judges</hi>
would take <hi>Gallio's</hi> course, and drive such
actours from the Judgement seat. We go not
to the Physician for every <hi>ail,</hi> and small <hi>distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
no more should we to the law for every petty
<hi>quarrel</hi> and slight <hi>offence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's a strange opinion that hath possessed the
minds of many (not to say most) men, that
when they please they may sue for their <hi>own,</hi> and
lawfully contend for their <hi>right,</hi> and he is accounted
a good and just man that seeks after no more: but if
this be universally understood, and in all cases, it will
not hold true. For the rules of <hi>equity</hi> as well as of
<hi>Christianity</hi> oblige us to yield oftentimes in such
things wherein by <hi>law</hi> we might stand, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
such things which by <hi>law</hi> we might require, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which <hi>equity,</hi> justice and peace could not consist.
<hi>Equity</hi> hath a power of over-ruling, that <hi>liberty</hi>
which the law gives, and enjoyns us in many cases to
recede from our right for the upholding and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
either of <hi>publick</hi> peace or <hi>private.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

they that always make use of the law to get their

and so an <hi>injury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The law is abused by an <hi>undue suspension</hi> and

<hi>and turning judgement into gall,</hi> for <hi>suppressing</hi>
of the law is <hi>oppressing</hi> of those that should be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

            <p>The greatness of any must not cause <hi>fear</hi> in those,

committed. Deliver him that suffereth wrong from<note place="margin">Ecclus 4. 9.</note>
the hand of the oppressour, and be not faint hearted,
when thou sittest in judgement, says the wise son of
<hi>Sirach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fear</hi> regards more the greatness of the person, than
the nature of the cause; to prevent which <hi>Jethro</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises
<hi>Moses</hi> to employ such in judicial affairs, as were
men of courage <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> strenuous and undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and <hi>God</hi> himself forbids the <hi>magistrate to fear the
face of man, for the judgement is God's.</hi> It was a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous
resolution of <hi>Papinianus,</hi> that chose rather to
<hi>die,</hi> than to <hi>excuse</hi> the parricide of the Emperour <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus
Bassianus.</hi> And it was no less heroick act of
those <hi>Catholick Bishops</hi> who being charged by the
<hi>Arrian</hi> Emperour to condemn <hi>Athanasius,</hi> both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
witness, and unheard, would rather hazard their
estates, than by fear be betraied to do that injustice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Favour</hi> is another obstructer of the law, which
when it is observed, judgement must needs be perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Accept no person against thy soul, &amp; let not the
reverence of any man cause thee to fall, as that wise<note place="margin">Ecclus 4. 22.</note>
man advises. It was a strange message that <hi>Agesilaus</hi>
the <hi>Lacedemonian Prince</hi> (a man otherwise justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
for his good government) wrote to some <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95143:10"/>

yet for my sake dismiss him: however let him be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed.
But as the <hi>law</hi> (which is the <hi>dumb magistrate</hi>)
is made without respect of persons, so should the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi>
(which is the <hi>speaking law</hi>) execute it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
favouring of them, punishing a <hi>grand oppressour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
as well as a <hi>petty purloiner,</hi> an <hi>haughty adulterer,</hi> as
well as an <hi>inferiour debauched person,</hi> and laying the
law to a <hi>great Recusant,</hi> as well as to a <hi>poor schismatick
or separatist;</hi> and if such <hi>great ones</hi> were made <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of justice, and the laws not suppressed out of <hi>fear</hi>
or <hi>favour</hi> to them, such severities would strike more
awe &amp; terrour into transgressours, then the punishing
of an hundred underlings, and inferiour persons. Such
should have no more favour shewed them than what
<hi>Galba</hi> Governour of <hi>Arragon in Spain</hi> (the same as
some think that afterward was Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi>) did
to a condemned Gentleman that intreated he might
not die the death of ordinary malefactours: he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him onely this priviledge, that waving the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
gallows, he should have one made <hi>higher,</hi> and if
he would <hi>carved</hi> and <hi>painted</hi> too.</p>
            <p>4. The law is abused by a too <hi>severe execution</hi> of
it, when the extremity of it is prosecuted against any,
that perhaps have done something contrary to the
<hi>letter</hi> of the law, but not violated or contradicted the
<hi>end</hi> of it, or <hi>intent</hi> of the law giver; in which cases if
rigour should always be used, laws which are intended
for the <hi>behoof,</hi> and <hi>benefit,</hi> would by such severe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95143:11"/>
become the <hi>bane</hi> and <hi>ruine</hi> of humane soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety;
and judgement which of it self is <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,</hi>
by such forcing and straining it, would be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>gall</hi> and <hi>bitterness. Wringing of the nose</hi> (says
<hi>Solomon) bringeth forth blood,</hi> and by wringing of
the law, and making it a nose of wax to bend to the
humour of every inconsiderate prosecutour, forceth
blood, and thereby rather contracts a guilt, than takes
any away. Our laws are not like <hi>Tiberius</hi> or <hi>Caligula</hi>'s
decrees, which were termed <hi>furores, non judicia;</hi> and
therefore are they not without great necessity to be
executed (as <hi>Draco's</hi> were said to be written) in blood;
for by such proceedings <hi>summum jus,</hi> would be <hi>sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
injuria.</hi> To prevent which not onely <hi>ours,</hi> but <hi>all</hi>
well governed polities, have given some power, more
or less, into the hand of the Magistrate, even in those
<hi>Courts</hi> that were (as one speaks) <hi>strictissimi juris,</hi>
according to the exigency of circumstances, and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of occasions to qualify and mitigate something of
the <hi>severity</hi> of laws by the rules of <hi>equity;</hi> wherein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
the great wisdom of <hi>Law-makers,</hi> who though
they wisely foresaw the <hi>mitigation</hi> of the law, to be as
necessary and requisite, as the <hi>severity</hi> of it, yet because
of the proneness of all men to offend, thought it fit
to express the <hi>extremity plainly</hi> and <hi>literally,</hi> thereby
to keep men within the compass of obedience; but
to leave the <hi>mitigation</hi> to the discretion of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
<hi>tacitely</hi> and <hi>secretly,</hi> thereby to moderate <hi>rigour</hi>
into <hi>equity:</hi> which is so far from <hi>evacuating</hi> the law,
or <hi>perverting</hi> justice, that it rather <hi>establishes</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms</hi>
it; for <hi>equity</hi> being of the essence of all laws, it
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95143:11"/>
must either be directly <hi>expressed,</hi> or implicitly <hi>understood</hi>
in them. These two have such near and close depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon each other, that like <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s twins,
they live and die together; for (as the Philosopher

per verborum aucupia, &amp; literarum tendiculas</hi> (as <hi>Tully</hi>

make the law, which is intended for a <hi>fence,</hi> become
a <hi>snare,</hi> and to <hi>oppress</hi> that innocency, which it should
<hi>protect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. This sin of injustice and oppression, or turning
<hi>judgement into gall,</hi> is <hi>contemptus authoritatis;</hi> it is an
implicit contempt both of that divine and humane
authority, by which laws are constituted. It is aspitting
defiance in the face of Magistrates, and contemning
of that power wherewith they are invested, which they
who are guilty of such practises, think to elude, by
outwitting the law, and those that sit to judge accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it. And such how do they hugg themselves in
their private recesses, and inwardly applaud the dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their wit, which is able to contrive the gaining
of so great a conquest, as to make Magistracy it self
accessory to their practises. Such, they deal with the
<hi>Magistrate,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> with our <hi>Saviour,</hi> suffer a <hi>scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
robe</hi> to be put on him, and crown him with <hi>ensigns
of authority,</hi> onely that he may thereby become a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95143:12"/>
more ready object of <hi>scorn</hi> and <hi>derision.</hi> And what
greater <hi>opprobrium</hi> can be offered to the <hi>Magistrate,</hi>
than not onely to <hi>nullify</hi> and <hi>evacuate</hi> his power, but
to <hi>render</hi> it <hi>contemptible</hi> and <hi>ridiculous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the contempt rests not here, it rises higher still,
and reaches not onely to the <hi>Judge's seat,</hi> but to the
<hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and sets a mark of <hi>contempt</hi>
and brand of <hi>infamy</hi> upon the several <hi>attributes</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
both his <hi>wisdom,</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>justice:</hi>
for he that by fraud, or violence, or other indirect
means (though under the covert of the law) invades
or usurps upon the rights of another, does, so far as in
him lies, without any warrant, frustrate and annihilate
the gifts of God, and takes upon him to thwart and
contradict his most wise Providence, setting up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as it were, in God's stead, and dethroning him,
to erect and establish a new order of providence of his
own, thereby <hi>reproaching</hi> his <hi>wisdom,</hi> as though God
had not wisely enough dispensed his blessings; <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning</hi>
his <hi>power,</hi> as though he were not able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the injuriously oppressed against a furious adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary;
<hi>impugning</hi> his <hi>mercy,</hi> as though he would not
suffer God to bestow his largesses, but upon whom
himself shall please; and <hi>impeaching</hi> his <hi>Justice,</hi> as
though God would not take notice of, &amp; repay those
wrongs which are done upon the earth. And thou
that, by a plea of judgement, dost these things, thinkest
thou, that thou shalt escape the judgement of God?
no, they that <hi>honour</hi> him shall be <hi>honoured,</hi> but they
that thus <hi>contemn</hi> him, shall be <hi>contemned</hi> by him.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Lastly,</hi> this turning of <hi>judgement into gall, is, Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratio

that were raised about it; nor as <hi>Jotham's bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
to rend and tear those that hope to find relief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their shadow. When any are put into <hi>offices</hi> of
trust, or <hi>places</hi> of power, it is not to this end, that they
should bear rule &amp; sway over others at their pleasure
but that they should be a succour &amp; help to those that
stand in need of, seek to, &amp; depend upon them for their
aid. God endues them with that power which others
want, that they may make use thereof, to help those
to right, who have not power to help themselves; and
when any shall so far abuse this power, as to make use
thereof to contrary ends, and instead of <hi>helping</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
to right, to <hi>take</hi> it from them; instead of being
a <hi>refuge</hi> to them from the oppressour, themselves to
turn <hi>oppressours,</hi> it is an high provocation and indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
offered to him, to whom they stand accountable
for that power they have received from him, and who
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95143:13"/>
expects some proportionable returns to be made unto
him, and if they be made contrary to his expectation, how
direful and sad will the account be? what a strange reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will the rich steward make, when God shall at last (as
assuredly he will) require of him an account of his steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?
Behold, thou hast given me five talents, and I have
made them ten; and when the question shall be put, how,
or by what means? what a strange and unaccountable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
will it be to say, I have unjustly and injuriously rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
from my fellow-servants those few talents which thou
gavest them: I have gained thus much by my violent
maintaining a cause which thou <hi>hatest,</hi> and which my own
<hi>conscience</hi> secretly told me was most <hi>unjust.</hi> So much I have
wrung from others by extortion and oppression, by forged
records, sycophancy or false accusation, by suborned wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and such other unjust practises, which surely are sore
evils, that are too commonly <hi>done under the sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now for the <hi>punishing</hi> and <hi>preventing</hi> of these and
such like practises, upon whom are the minds of the people
set, but upon your <hi>Lordships?</hi> their eyes are <hi>towards</hi> you;
their hopes are <hi>in</hi> you; their expectations are <hi>from</hi> you. In
your known integrity and uprightness is their confidence
placed for a redress of those injuries, which either through
the <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>pride,</hi> or <hi>malice,</hi> or <hi>revenge,</hi> or <hi>wrath,</hi> or <hi>cruelty</hi>
of oppressours have been either <hi>felt</hi> or <hi>feared</hi> by them. May
your authority accordingly be made use of, to abate the
<hi>pride,</hi> and suppress the <hi>power,</hi> and curb the <hi>insolency,</hi> and
quell the <hi>oppressions</hi> of those that use (or rather abuse) their
<hi>power</hi> and <hi>might</hi> to overbear and sway down <hi>right</hi> and <hi>equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
so that all may see that it is not the <hi>fullest baggs,</hi> or the
<hi>greatest friends,</hi> or the <hi>skilfullest pleaders,</hi> that shall prevail
beyond the merits of any cause, when they have to do with
such upright <hi>Judges</hi> as your <hi>Honours,</hi> who will not suffer by
indirect practises, <hi>judgement to be turned into gall, or the
fruits of righteousness into hemlock.</hi>
