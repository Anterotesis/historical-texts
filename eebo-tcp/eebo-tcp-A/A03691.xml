            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is nowe an whole yéere paſte, ſince I herde of a booke ſecretely ſcattered abroade by M. Fekenham emonge his fréendes: And in April laſte I came by a copie therof. When I had redde the booke, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued bothe the matter and the maner of the mannes doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynges therein: I ſawe his proofes ſo ſclendre: and his maner of dealinge ſo ſhameles: that I ſtoode in doubte what to doo, whether to diſcouer the man by writinge, or to ſhake him of with ſilence. If I had not ſéene a further meaninge in his ſettinge foorth and publiſhinge the booke, then he durſte plainely vtter, or then his cunninge coulde by any meanes Anſweare vnto: or then, that I with a good conſcience mought haue neglected: I woulde haue paſte it ouer with ſilence, as a péece of woorke not woorthie of Anſweare. But ſéeing the chiefe ende and principall purpoſe intended, as may be iuſtly gathered in publiſhyng the booke, was, to ingrafte in the mindes of the ſubiectes a miſlikyng of the Quéenes Maieſtie, as though ſhe vſurped a power, and authoritie in Eccleſiaſticall matters, whereto ſhe hath no righte: to ſclandre the whole Realme, as though it were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and directly againſt the Catholike Churche, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinge and refuſinge to haue Communion therewith: And vndre my name to deface the myniſters of Chriſtes Churche: I coulde not chooſe, oneles I woulde wilfully ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect my duetie to her Maieſtie, ſhewe my ſelfe ouermuch vnkinde vnto my natiue Countrey, and altogeather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

careleſſe of the Churche Myniſterie, but take penne in hande, and ſhape him a ful and plaine anſweare, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any curioſitie. Wherein I folowe the order of M.

Their iudgementes and ſentences ſhall appeare in readinge by the forme of letter: for leuinge foorth the Latine to auoide tediouſnes, I haue put into Engliſh the Authours mindes and ſentences, and cauſed them, for the moſte parte, to be Printed in Latine letters, that the Engliſh reader may know and decerne the Authours ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges from mine.</p>

               <p>THe proprety of him that meaneth to declare rightly any matter doone, is to ſet foorth the trueth without malice, to obſerue the due circumſtances of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, perſones, &amp; times: and to vſe ſimple plaineſſe without guileful ambiguities. This Title is ſo repleniſſhed with vntrue reporte, &amp; ambiguous ſleightes, without the note of any neceſſary circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtance, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is not almoſt one true woorde therein: wherby you geue at the firſt a taſte to the indifferent reader, what he muſt looke for in the ſequele.</p>
               <p>You pretende, and would haue your friendes to thinke, that the firſt fower chiefe pointes ſet foorth in your booke, were deuiſed by you, put in writing, and ſo deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, as the matter and grounde whereuppon, the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to be had betwixt me &amp; you ſhould ſtande: And that I made therunto none other but ſuche reſolucions, as it hath pleaſed you vntruely to report. In the firſt parte, you conueigh an vntrueth vnder a coulorable and ambiguous meaning, in theſe woordes, <hi>as M. Iohn Fekenham by vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge did deliuer vnto the L. Biſshop of VVyncheſter.</hi> In the other parte, you make an vntrue reporte without any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loure at all. I doo graunt and will not denie, that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to me a booke: whiche, I thanke God, I haue to ſhewe, whereby to diſprooue you. The ſame will declare
<pb facs="tcp:4439:4"/>
the time when, the place where, the occaſion wherefore, the perſonnes to whome the booke was written, and what is the matter in generall therein conteyned: Whereunto muſt be added, at what time the ſame was deliuered vnto me, vpon what occaſion, and to what ende. All whiche circumſtances you omitte in your booke publiſhed, leaſt you ſhoulde haue bewrayed your ſelfe, and haue appeared in your owne likeneſſe.</p>
               <p>The booke by you deliuered vnto me, touchinge the Othe, was writen in the Tower of London (as you your ſelfe confeſſed, and the true title thereof doth plainely te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie) in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of the Parliament holden <hi>Anno quinto</hi> of the Q.

And although you woulde haue it ſeeme by that you haue pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed abroade, that the cauſe why you wrote, was to be reſolued at my hande: yet the trueth is (as you your ſelfe reported) that you &amp; your Towerfellowes, hearinge that the Statute mooued for the aſſuraunce of the Quéenes ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yall power, would paſſe &amp; be eſtabliſhed, did conceiue that immediatly after the ſame ſeſſion, Commiſſioners ſhould be ſente vnto you, to exact the othe. Wheruppon you to be in ſome areadines, to withſtande and refuſe the duetie of a good ſubiect, not without healpe of the reſt (as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered) deuiſed the matter conteyned in the booke, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame to writinge, and purpoſed to haue deliuered it for your aunſweare touchinge the Othe of the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie to the Commiſſioners, if they had come. This may appeare by the title of that booke that you firſte deliuered to me whiche is woorde for woorde as followeth.</p>

               <p>In this title there is no mencion of ſcruples &amp; ſtayes deliuered to the Biſhop of Wyncheſter, but of aunſweare to the Quéenes commiſſioners. I am not once named in the title, ne yet in the booke deliuered to me: neither is there one woorde as ſpoken to me: although in the booke ſet abroade, you turne all as ſpoken to me. In your booke publiſhed are founde theſe kindes of ſpeaches: <hi>To the L. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of VVyncheſter. VVhen your L. ſhalbe able &amp;c.

I ſhall ioyne this iſſue vvith you, that vvhen any one of you, the Queenes highnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsioners. &amp;c.</hi> From October, at what time you were ſente to me, vnto the ende of Ianuary, there was daily conference betwixte vs in mattiers of Religion, but chiefely touchinge the fower poyntes, whiche you terme ſcruples &amp; ſtayes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and that by woorde of mouthe, and not by any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge. In all whiche pointes, you were ſo anſweared, that you had nothinge to obiecte, but ſéemed reſolued, and in a manner fully ſatiſfied. Whereuppon, I made afterwarde relation (of good meaninge towardes you) to certaine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable perſones of the good hope I had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyued of your conformitie. At whiche time, a certaine friende of yours ſtanding by, &amp; hearing what I had declared then to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable in your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendacion, did ſhortly after reporte the ſame vnto you, which as it ſéemed you did ſo much miſlike (doubtinge that your confederates ſhould vnderſtande of your reuolt, which they euer feared, hauing experience of your ſhrinkyng from them at Weſtminſter in the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there, the firſte yéere of the Quéenes Maieſtie) that after that time I founde you alwaies muche more repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb facs="tcp:4439:5"/>
and contrary to that wherin ye before times ſéemed in manner thoroughly reſolued: And alſo to goe from that you before agreed vnto. By reaſon wherof, when in deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge betwixt vs, you vſinge many ſhiftes, amongſt other did continually quarell in Sophiſtication of woordes, I did will you, to thende we might certainly goe forwarde in the pointes materiall, that you would wryte your Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions or Aſſertions in fourme of Propoſitions: which I coulde not cauſe you to doo in any wiſe, but yée would ſtill ſtande vncertainly in grauntinge &amp; deniyng at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: Yea, although I for the better agreement to be had, did drawe ſuch in fourme of Aſſertion, &amp; gaue them in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge vnto you, as I gathered of your owne mouthe to be your opinion: yet woulde yée in no wiſe ſtande to, &amp; reſte in any one certainly, but vſed ſtill your accuſtomed wra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge and wanderinge at large. Whiche your behauiour ſo muche miſliked me, that I coulde not but erneſtly chardge you with inconſtancy, in that yée woulde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times denie, that yée before had grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted: and alſo graunt, that yee before had denied. Then beynge ſo muche preſſed herewith, and perceyuing that your froward quarellinge with the plaine woordes of the Statute, coulde no lenger couer your euill meaninge, at the length you did require, that I woulde put in writinge the woordes of the Othe, with the ſence or interpretation added thereunto, as you conſideringe theruppon, might deuiſe the fourme of your Propoſitions, wherupon wée might afterwardes debate. By this it may appeare, bothe how vntrue it is, that you hitherto had deliuered vnto me any ſuch ſcruples of yours in writinge, as you pretende in the title (for then I néeded not to haue ſought any Propoſitions of your Aſſertions) and alſo how vntrue this is, that the interpretation of the Othe whiche I wrote at your requeſt, before I euer ſawe

any writinge of yours, was to aunſweare your ſcruples and ſtaies deliuered to me in writinge.</p>
               <p>After this in February followyng, certaine perſones of woorſhip reſorted to my houſe, partly to ſée me, &amp; partly to heare ſomewhat betwixt me and you. And after that wée had reaſoned in certaine pointes touchinge Religion, wherein yée ſéemed openly to haue litle matter to ſtande in, but rather did yelde to the moſte in ſubſtaunce that I had ſaide: neuertheleſſe beinge after withdrawen in ſome of their companies, although yée did ſeeme openly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and agrée with me in that I had ſaid: Yet (ſaide you,) <hi>The mattier itſelfe is grounded here,</hi> (pointing to your breaſt) <hi>that ſhall neuer goo out.</hi> Which beinge tolde me, I did veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly then challendge you for your double dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge, and colourable behauiour: ſayinge, that I thought you did not that you did, of any conſcience at all: &amp; therfore compted it but loſt labour, further to trauaile with ſuche a one as had neither conſcience nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancie. But you, to ſhewe that ye did all of conſcience, ſhewed me both what yee had ſuffred for the ſame in diuerſe manners, and alſo howe the ſame was grounded in you longe before. For proufe whereof, yée offred to ſhewe me a booke of yours, that yée had deuiſed in the Tower, &amp; the ſame ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did deliuer vnto me, not as your ſcruples and doubtes to be reſolued at my hande, wherein yée ſéemed in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference before had, reſolued: but onely to declare, that the mattier had béen longe before ſettled in you, and this was thonly and méere occaſion of the deliuery of the ſaide booke vnto me, entituled as is before declared &amp; not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But as you haue caſt a miſte before the eies of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, vnder the ſpeache of a deliuery in writinge, without notinge of any circumſtance that might make the mattier cléere, wherein you ſhewe your ſelfe to haue no good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge:

               <p>The Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories make mention of many Synodes or councelles, called or aſſembled at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and order of this Emperour.

The occaſion of this famous and moſte godly councell, was the great diſſention kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, partly about a neceſſary Article of our beliefe, partly about a ceremony of the Churche. Arius incenſed with ambitious enuie, againſte Alexander his Biſhop at Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, who diſputed in one of his leſſons or treatiſes, more ſubtily of the diuinitie than aduiſedly, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour layeth to his chardge, quarelled Sophiſtically againſt him, and mainteined an horrible Hereſie. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, the Churches were alſo deuided amongeſt them ſelues, aboute the order or ceremony of kéepinge the Eaſter daie. The Emperour ſente Hoſius with his letters, as I ſaide before, into the Eaſte parties to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peace the furious diſſention about bothe theſe matters, and to reconcile the parties diſſentynge. But when this duetifull ſeruice of the Emperour, tooke not that effect whiche he wiſſhed and hoped for, then as Sozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menus writeth, he ſummoned a councell to be holden <note place="margin">Lib. 1. ca. 17.</note> at Nice in Bythinia, and wrote to all the chiefe Myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Churches euery where, commaundinge them that they ſhoulde not fayle to bée there at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted. The ſelfe ſame alſo dothe Theodoretus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, bothe touchynge the occaſion, and alſo the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons <note place="margin">Lib. 1. ca. 7.</note> made by the Emperour.

And when the Emperour (ſaieth Euſebius) ſawe that he <note place="margin">Lib. 3. De vit.

               <p>In the fifth Action, the Iudges willed the Synode, to <note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> reade thoſe thinges, whiche were agreed vpon touchinge the Faith: whereabout began a great contention, one parte of them allowinge, an other ſorte diſallowing that was redde amongſt them.

When they preuailed nothinge, they threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the whole Synode, that they would ſignifie theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered clamours vnto the Emperour, whiche they did. The Emperour immediatly of his Supreme authoritie, appoincted the order of Committies, whiche the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges had deuiſed before: geuing them in commandement, that goinge aſide by them ſelues, they ſhould conſult and conclude a trueth in Faith, with ſuche plainneſſe, that there might no more doubtes ariſe thereof, whereunto al ſhoulde agrée.

               <p>The Emperour commeth into the Synode place, in <note place="margin">Act. 6.</note> his owne perſone, with <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> his nobles, and Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and maketh vnto the Synode an Oration, of this effect. He careth for nothing ſo muche, as to haue all men rightly perſwaded in the true Chriſtian faith: He decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the occaſions, why he ſommoned the Synode: He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth that no man be ſo hardy, hereafter to hold opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or diſpute, of the Chriſtian faithe, otherwyſe than was decreed in the firſt Nicen councell, he chargeth them therefore, that all partaking, contention, and couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes laide apart, the onely truthe may appeare to al men. He declareth his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into the Synode, to be for none other cauſe, then to confirme the fayth, and to remoue from the people in tyme to come, all diſſention in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And laſt of all, he proteſteth this to be his whole care, and ſtudy, that all people may be brought into an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and vnifourme agreement in pure Religion, by true and holy doctrine. The chiefe Notarie, humbly aſketh of the Emperour, if it will pleaſe him to heare their defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion redde: The Emperour willeth that it ſhould be reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted openly, he enquireth of them all, if euery man conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto: they anſwere, that it is agreed vpon by all their conſentes. Whereunto they adde many accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, commending the worthines of his Emperiall gouernement, concluding: <hi>By thee O woorthy Emperour, the right faith is confirmed, haereſies baniſhed, peace reſtored, and the Churche refourmed.</hi> After theſe acclamations, the Emperour

doth openly declare vnto the Synode a ſtatute, whiche he maketh to cut of and put away from thencefoorth, al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner occaſion of contention about the true faithe, and holy Religion. The whole Synode deſireth the Emperour, to diſſolue the councell, and to giue them leaue to departe: whereunto the Emperour woulde not conſent, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth that none of them depart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baſsianus,</hi> of late the Biſhop at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> complaineth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Emperour, to directe his letters to the Synode, to <note place="margin">

After due examination had by the Iudges, openly in the Synode in this controuerſie, the Iudges aſked of the Synode, what they iudged to be doone. The Biſhops adiudged <hi>Baſsianus</hi> to be reſtored. But the Iudges appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Emperour, woulde not alowe that ſentence, but deemed neither of them bothe worthy to occupy that Byſhoprike, and that there ſhould be a thirde choſen, and admitted to that ſea, to the whiche iudgement, the whole Synode did accorde. After the ende of this councell, the Emperour doth confirme the determination thereof by his publique Decree.</p>
               <p>This Synode being finiſhed, the Emperour baniſhed <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> into the Cytie of Gangren. Whiche thyng doon: <note place="margin">

After that Zeno the Emperour knew of the crafty dealing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heretiques, he wrote to his Lieutenaunt <hi>Anthemius,</hi> that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue Peter Mogge, and reſtore <hi>Timotheus</hi> to the Byſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, and further, that he ſhould puniſhe thoſe, that were the authors to enſtall Peter Mogge. <hi>Anthemius</hi> receyuinge the Emperours mandate, did depoſe Peter Mogge, as one that was but a counterfayte made Biſhop, contrary to the Lawes of the catholique Churche, and reſtored <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus Salefacialius,</hi> who beinge reſtored, ſent certayne of his Clergie to the Emperour to render him thankes.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Timotheus, Ioannes de Talaida</hi> was choſen, wherof when <hi>Acatius</hi> Biſhop of Conſtantinople hearde, he being

In this Popes time (ſaith the Pontificall) came Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus the Emperour to Rome, whom this Pope with his cleargie, met ſixe myles out of the Citie, and did humbly receiue him. It is wonderful to conſider (althoughe the Hiſtorians, beyng Papiſtes for the moſt parte, couer the mater ſo muche as may be) what practiſes the Popes vſed to catche from the Emperours to them ſelues, the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie in gouerninge of Churche matters: When they ſawe, that by ſtowte and braue preſumption, theyr ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious appetites coulde not be ſatiſfyed, they turned ouer an other leafe, and coueringe their ambitious meaninge with a patched cloke of humilitie &amp; lowlineſſe, they wan muche of that, whiche with pride and preſumption they had ſo often before this time attempted in vaine.</p>

And ſo this Pope Leo by the commandement and power of the Emperour Iuſtinian, brought Rauenna vnder his obeiſaunce, as the Pontificall reporteth.

But <hi>Benedictus</hi> the ſeconde, who ſucceded next to Leo the ſeconde, went in this point beyonde all his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, for Conſtantine being moued with his humanitie, pietie, and fauourablenes towardes al men, when he ſent to the Emperour for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation: the Emperour ſent ſaith Platina a decree, <hi>that from henceforth, loke whom the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, the people, and the Romain army, ſhould choſe to be Pope, all men, without delay, ſhould beleue him to be Chriſtes true vicar, abiding for no confirmation by the Emperour, or his Lieutenant as it had been wonted to be doon. &amp;c.

               </p>

For whan the Churche was gréeuouſly vexed with the controuerſie about Images, there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers great Synodes or Councelles called, for the deciding of that troubleſome matter by the Emperours: and at the laſte, that whiche is called the ſeuenth generall or oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menicall Conncell was called and ſummoned to be holden at Nice in Bithynia, by Conſtantine and Irene the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſſe his Mother, who was the ſupreme worker and gouernour (although but an ignoraunt and very ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious woman, I will ſay no worſe) in this matter. For her Sonne was but aboute tenne yéeres olde, as <hi>Zonoras</hi> affirmeth, and ſhe had the whole rule, although <note place="margin">Zonoras Tom. 3.</note> he bare the name. After the deathe of Paule, the Emperour appointeth <hi>Taraſius</hi> the Secretary to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarche at Conſtantinople, the people lyked well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

The Emperour writeth to the Patriarche of olde Rome, and to the other Patriarches, willinge them to ſende their Legates, vnto a Councell to bée holden at Nice in Bithynia. The Biſhoppes aſſemble at Nice by the commaundement and decrée of the Emperour, as they confeſſe in diuerſe places of this Councell. Whan the Biſhoppes were ſette in Councell, and many Laye perſones of the nobilitie with them: &amp; the holy Ghoſpelles
<pb facs="tcp:4439:59"/>
were brought foorth, as the maner was (although the holy Ghoſpelles were not made Iudges in this councell, as they ought to haue been, and were in al the forenamed generall councels) <hi>Taraſius</hi> commendeth the vigilant care and feruent zeale of the Emperours, about Churche mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: for ordering and pacifiyng wherof, they haue called ſaith he, this councell.

For this cauſe, he hath with paine gathered this councel together: geueth licence alſo and libertie to euery man without al feare, to vtter his minde and iudgemont fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely: to the ende the truthe may the better appeare. He ſheweth the order he obſerued, in making <hi>Taraſius</hi> Biſhop: He preſcribeth vnto the Biſhoppes what is their office, and what they ſhould doo: propoundinge vnto them the holy Ghoſpelles, as the right &amp; onely true rule they ſhould folowe. After this he mencioneth letters brought from the Biſhop of Rome by his Legates, the whiche he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth to be openly redde in the councell: and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth alſo other thinges that they ſhould reade. There was nothing attempted or done in this councel, without the authoritie of the Emperours, as in all the former ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall councels.

               <p>About this time was one <hi>Bonifacius</hi> not Pope, but as they call him the great Apoſtle of the Germaines, the like for all the worlde to our Apoſtle here in Englande, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtinus Anglorum Apoſtolus:</hi> Either of them might be called, the Popes Apoſtles, whoſe great champions they were.

This Leo (his ſtreight dealinges with the Romaynes was ſo hatefull vnto them) was brought ſhortly into muche daungier of his life, but farre more of his honeſty.

If the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this moſt Chriſtian Prince in Eccleſiaſtical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be well conſidered, it ſhall well appeare, that this Charles the great, whom the Popes doo extolle as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Conſtantine, &amp; patron vnto them, (as he was in deede, by enriching the Churche with great reuenues and riches) was no whit greater for his martial &amp; Prince-like affaires in the politique gouernaunce, than for his godly ordering &amp; diſpoſing the Churche cauſes: although that in ſome thinges he is to be borne with, conſideringe the blindnes and ſuperſtition of the time.</p>
               <p>Although herein <hi>Lodouicus</hi> Charles his ſonne, were ſomwhat inferiour to his father: Yet not withſtanding, he reſerued theſe Eccleſiaſticall cauſes to him ſelfe, &amp; with no leſſe care he ordred the ſame, although in ſome things, being a very milde Prince, he winked and bare ouermuch with the ambition of the Popes. Shortly after, whan as the foreſaid Leo was departed, was Stephen next elected Pope, and without the confirmation of the Emperour, tooke the Papacy vpon him. All the hiſtories agree, that
<pb facs="tcp:4439:66"/>
he came ſhortly after into Fraunce to the Emperour, but wherfore, moſt of them leaue vncertaine. <hi>Platina</hi> thinketh to auoyde the hurley burley in the Citie that was after the death of Leo. <hi>Sabellicus</hi> thinketh the Emperours coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to be the cauſe. <hi>Nauclerus</hi> ſaith, <hi>he went in his owne perſone vnto the Emperour Lodouike about, or for the Churche matters,</hi> whiche proueth that the Emperour had chiefe authoritie in ordering the Churche buſines. But our Engliſh Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, as ſome writers affirme, doo plainly declare, that his comming into Fraunce was, to make an excuſe of his vnlauful conſecration, againſt the decrees made to Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les by his predeceſſours, <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> fearing therefore the fequele of the matter, he firſt ſent his Legates before him to be a preparatiue to his purgation, and afterwards came him ſelf to craue his pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the rather to pleaſe Themperour, brought a moſt beautiful crown of gold for him, and an other for the Empreſſe: wherof folowed, as <hi>Nauclerus</hi> ſaith: <hi>Omnia quae petiit à pio Imperatore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuit, he obteined whatſoeuer he asked of the godly Emperour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe when Stephen had diſpatched all his matters, he retourned home: and ſhortly after, an other Eccleſiaſtical cauſe happened, for within a while the Biſhop of <hi>Reatina</hi> died, and there was an other choſen. <hi>And when the ſea of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> (ſaith Nauclerus) <hi>was voide, the Pope would not conſecrate the elect Biſshop onles he had firſt lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therto of the Emperour.</hi> The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of this ſtory, make the matter more plaine.

And Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicus the Emperour did this not of pride, but that he woulde not looſe the priuileges and rightes of the Empire.</hi> Note all theſe thinges well, the Pope on the one part, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was choſen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any contention, yet would he not be conſecrate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Emperours confirmation: otherwiſe he thought it an vnmodeſt part. The Emperour on the other ſide, not onely ſendeth his Embaſſadours to confirme, but or euer they confirme him, to examyn and diligently to diſcuſſe, after what ſorte he came in, and whether he were elected lawfully or no. And this he did, not of a pryde (ſaye they) muche leſſe of any vſurpation, but bicauſe he woulde not looſe or diminiſhe the right herein, that belonged to the Emperiall maieſtie. Here ſay they, he did it of purpoſe, bicauſe he would not loſe his right, and not his onely, but the right of the Empire. But leaſt it ſhould ſéeme he did tyrannouſly herein, and oppreſſed the Churche, or enfrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her liberties, it foloweth, all moſt worde for worde in both theſe writers, <hi>Platina,</hi> and <hi>Nauclerus. For he was a milde, merciful, and moſt gentle Prince of nature, and one that did alwayes mainteine the right and dignitie of the Churche.</hi> Loo howe great clemency this is compted in him, and the defence of the dignities and rightes of the Churche: the whiche after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4439:67"/>
and nowe of the Popes, is compted the greateſt tyranny and oppreſſion of the Churche that can be. But further to approue this deede of Lodouike, the foreſayde authours recite many Canons, decrees, &amp; conſtitutions, that this Emperour made in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes and thinges: and eſpecially for the reformation of the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered behauiours of the Biſhoppes and Clergie. In ſo muche that <hi>Platina</hi> comparinge the diſſoluteneſſe of the Churchemen in his time, crieth out: <hi>Woulde God (O Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uike) thou were aliue in theſe our times, for nowe the Churche wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thy moſte holy ordinaunces, and thy diſcipline.</hi> The ſelfe ſame <hi>Lodouicus</hi> (ſaith Platina) <hi>called a councell of many Biſshoppes at Aquiſgrane, to Goddes honour, and the profite of the Church dignitie.</hi> The Prelates in the preface to this Sinode, doo declare, what was the care &amp; authoritie of the Godly Emperour, in this Sinode. They affirme that the moſte Chriſtian Emperour, had called an holy and general congregation or Councell at <hi>Aquiſgrane:</hi> He beganne therein thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to handle the mater, with wiſedome voide of curioſitie: He counſailed, yea warned the holie Synode aſſembled, what was néedefull to be doone, touching certaine chiefe miniſtees of the Churches: He warned them further, to drawe out of the Holie Canons, and the ſaiynges of the holie Fathers, a fourme of inſtitution for the ſimple ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rte of Miniſters, whereby they might more eaſilie learne to walke in theyr duties without offence. <hi>The Synode geueth God thankes, that he had praeferred ſo holie, wiſe, and deuout a Prince to haue the chardge, and ouerſight of his Churche, and the Churches needefull buſineſſe or matters.</hi> The Synode, accordinge to the kinges aduertiſement, furthered alſo with his helpe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, collecteth a fourme of Inſtitution, wherein is conteined at large, after what ſorte the Prelates oughte to frame their liues, rule, or gouerne the people commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>This Emperour called an other Councel at <hi>Ticinum</hi> in Italy for the cauſes hereafter expreſſed. The matters or cauſes which the honorable Emperour <hi>Lodouicus</hi> did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde his Biſhoppes to conſider of, are theſe: touching the ſtate of his kingedome: of the conuerſation of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes, Prieſtes, and other Churchmen: of the doctrine and preachinge to the people: of writinge out of Bookes: of reſtoring of Churches: of ordering the people, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitalles for ſtrangers: of Monaſteries both for men and wemen. What ſo euer is out of order in theſe forenamed ſtates, eyther thorough the neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the guides, or the ſlouthfulneſſe of the inferiours, <hi>I am</hi> (ſaide he) <hi>verie muche deſirous to knowe, and I coueite to amende or refourme them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Goddes will, and your holy aduiſe, in ſuche ſorte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that neither I be founde reproueable in Goddes ſight, neither you nor the people incurre Goddes wrathfull indignation for theſe thinges, howe this may be ſearched, founde out, and brought to perfection, that I committee to be entreated by you, and ſo to be declared vnto me. The leſſer matters alſo, whiche in generall touche all, but in eſpeciall, ſome, and neede refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: I will that yee make enquirie of them, and make relation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me thereof: as for example if the rulers in the countreys neglect, or ſell Iuſtice, if they be takers or oppreſſours of the Churches, widowes, orphanes, or of the poore. Yf they come to the ſermons. Yf they doo reuerence and obey duely their Prieſtes. Yf they preſume to take in hande any new opinions or argumentes that may hurt the people. &amp;c.</hi> The Biſhoppes after they had conſulted vpon theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, doo make relation vnto the Emperour, what they had done: ſhewynge him, that they had founde ſome of the Biſhoppes and chiefe Myniſters faulty, and humbly pray the Emperour on their behalfe, that he will of his goodnes graunt theſe, ſome ſpace to amende their faultes.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4439:68"/>
They complaine to the Emperour of Biſhops &amp; Prieſtes, for lacke of preachinge, and that noble men &amp; gentle men, come not vnto thoſe few ſermons that bée. And ſo then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyte many other enormities, as about tythes, inceſt, and ſuche like, eſpecially in religious perſones, who for the moſt parte are cleane out of order.

In the whiche combate, though with muche adooe, at length they wroonge them ſelues from vnder the Emperours obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Yet alwaies euen hitherto, Princes haue had no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle intereſt in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, as hereafter ſhall appéere.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Benedictus,</hi> was Nicolas choſen, whom the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour him ſelfe beynge preſent, did confirme, as witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Nauclerus: <hi>At the ſame time, was the Emperour Lodouicus. 2. at Rome, who confirmed the Popes election.</hi> The ſame alſo ſaith Martyn, to the whiche Volateran addeth of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour &amp; the Pope: <hi>De communi conſilio ambo cuncta gereba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

And a litle after talking of the Pope: <hi>The Pope decreed by the conſent of Lodouicus, that from thence foorth, no Prince, no not the Emperour him ſelfe, ſhould be preſent in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell with the Cleargie, onles it were when the principall pointes of faith were treated of.</hi> Hitherto in all theſe Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, the Emperour hath the doinge, as well or more than the Pope. But this laſt decree, that by the allowa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Emperour, the Pope made, exempteth Temporall Princes from Eccleſiaſticall matters in their councelles, though in the moſt principall matters Eccleſiaſtical, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

After whom Adria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the third, like vnto his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſour, the ſecond of that name (who by cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning ſleight practiſed to defraude the Emperour of his authoritie) eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oportunitie, by reaſon, that Charles the Emperour, as <hi>Sabellicus</hi> ſaith, was farre of, buſied in the warres, doth promote this matter to be decreed by the Senate and the people, and this he did immediatly after he was made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and perſuadeth them, that they doo not hereafter wayte for the Emperours approbation, and confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in appointing their Biſhop, but that they ſhoulde kepe to them ſelues, their own fredome. The whiche thinge alſo <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the firſte, with others attempted, but coulde not

bringe it to paſſe, as <hi>Platina</hi> reporteth.

But to their great griefe, he within a while was taken from them.</p>
               <p>The next Pope Stephen had an obſcure tyme, ſauing that Charles therein called a councell at Collen, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him <hi>Arnulphus</hi> the Emperour, other twoo: the one at <hi>Moguntia,</hi> the other at <hi>Triburum.</hi> Of theſe Popes and thoſe that followed, as <hi>Formoſus, Stephanus, Romanus, Benedictus, Leo, Chriſtophorus, Sergius,</hi> and a great company moa, the Hiſtorians geue but an homely teſtimonie, and <hi>Naeuclerus</hi> ſaith, that to ſatiſfie their voluptuous luſtes, they dyd maliciouſly malice one another, as moſt cruel Tyrantes, and he added this reaſon. <hi>Cum non extarent qui eorum vitia coercerent, bicauſe there was none to correcte and chaſten them for their euill doinges.</hi> For ſo long as the Princes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed their authoritie in ouerſeing carefully the Churche matters, and the myniſters, ſo well the Popes, as other Biſhoppes, there grewe no ſuche intollerable diſorders, neither were there ſuche monſters, (for ſo <hi>Nauclerus</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth theſe Popes) that continued any ſpace: But were by the Princes authoritie ſuppreſſed, and therfore <hi>Naucle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> citeth out of <hi>Platina,</hi> and affirmeth it to be true, that the cauſe of theſe monſtrous Rebelles in the Churche was: <hi>Quod Reſp. ignauos &amp; deſides principes habeat. By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the common wealth had improfitable and ſlouthfull Princes.</hi> Thus theſe writers burdeine and charge the Princes with the diſorders and enormities in Chriſtes Churche, wherein they doo them wronge, if they thought not, that it apperteined to the Princely authoritie to ouerſee, care, and prouide for the good order of Chriſtes Churche: and to redreſſe, puniſhe, and remoue the inordinate euilles

Yea, <hi>Sabellicus</hi> ſo wondereth at theſe tragicall examples of the Biſhoppes of this time, and their horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble obliuion of Godly Religion, that he aſcribeth the good and godly moderation that was in the Biſhops, and the dutifull execution of their office, from Charles the great, till the ende of the Frenche Empire, whiche was an whole age: to be not ſo muche of them ſelues, and their owne good wills, as of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> awe and feare they had of the Princes, kinges, and Emperours, who were their guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.

But put the caſe that your antecedent were true, yet is it a faulty fallax made <hi>à dicto ſecundum quid, ad ſimpliciter,</hi> and the conſequent followeth not, for that there is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the concluſion, than the antecedent doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende, whiche is ſuche an euill fauoured forme of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that yonge ſtudentes in the ſcholes would be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thereof.

                  <note place="margin">Epiſt. 50.</note> 
                  <hi>the Apoſtles time, this prophecie was yet in fulfilling: wherfore do the</hi>

                  <hi>Heathen rage, and the people muſe vpon vaine thinges? The kinges of the earth ſet them ſelues, and the Princes conſult together againſt the Lorde and his Chriſt.

                  <hi>with reuerence. Therfore ſeyng that as yet in the Apoſtles time, kinges ſerued not the Lorde, but ſtill did deuiſe vaine thinges againſt God and his Chriſt, that all the foreſayinges of the Prophete might be fulfilled, than truely impieties coulde not be inhibited by princes Lawes, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be mainteyned. For ſuche was the order of the times, that both the Iewes ſhoulde kill the preachers of Chriſte, thinkinge to doo God good ſeruice therein as Chriſt had forſpoken: and alſo the gentiles ſhoulde rage againſt the Chriſtians, that the martirs might winne the victory thorough pacience. But after that this began to be fulfilled whiche is writen: And al the kinges of the earth ſhall woorſhip him and all the nations ſhal ſerue him: what man onleſſe he be not well in his wittes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm. 71.</note> 
                  <hi>will ſay that Kinges ought not to haue a ſpeciall regarde for the Churche of Chriſte, and all manner godlines amongſt their ſubiectes?</hi> You frame an other reaſon vpon S.

For anſweare, I denie this argument, for it is a naughty and deceiptfull Sophiſtication, called, <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacia aequiuocationis.</hi> There is equiuocacion in this woorde <hi>(Prieſtes)</hi> and alſo in theſe woordes <hi>to gouerne and rule the Church of God.</hi> This woorde <hi>Prieſt,</hi> hath diuerſe ſignificacions which are to be obſerued: leaſt the ſimple readers be confirmed or brought into errour thorough the equiuocation therein.

The weighty burden, that you are loden with &amp; can not beare, is that you muſt by othe renounce all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine power and authoritie: the cauſe that maketh you fainte and feble, is, that it is directly againſt two articles of our Creede: So that your feble reaſon is grounded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your ſimple ſkill vpon the place, <hi>ab apoſitis &amp; pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantibus.</hi> Before I aunſwere to the argument, I will put the Reader in remembraunce of the deuiſion whiche you make, chopping &amp; chaunging one article into twaine, to make ſome ſhewe of an heinous matter. Surely it were ouermuche deteſtable, if you were moued to ſweare but againſt one article of our Crede, as yee were neuer moued by me, either to or fro, to ſweare any thing at all. There be three ſymboles or Credes, whiche haue been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and receiued of Chriſtes catholique Churche. The <note place="margin">Clemens in compe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fide.</note> ſymbole of the Apoſtles, of the Nicen councell, and of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius.</hi> The Apoſtolicall is ſo called, bicauſe it was col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected (as ſome ſaye) by the twelue Apoſtles, and therefore conteineth (as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly receiued opinion is in Chriſtꝭ Churche) according to the nomber of the. xtj. Apoſtles, but twelue articles, whiche are called in the vſuall ſpeche of the catholique Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the twelue articles of our Crede or beliefe. If this, <hi>I beleue the communion of ſainctes,</hi> be a ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall article from this, <hi>I beleue the holy catholique Churche,</hi> as you doo phantaſie, then there muſt needes be at the leaſt thirtene articles of the Crede, contrary to the vniuerſally receiued opinion of the catholique Churche. You were wont to ſtaye your ſelfe much vpon the cuſtome of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Churche, and woulde vrge ſtifly, although not ſo
<pb facs="tcp:4439:105"/>
truely the vniuerſally receiued opinion of the catholique Churche, as a matter that might not bee reiected, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: and howe chaunceth it nowe, that you are become ſuche a chaungeling, that cleane contrary to the vſe of the catholique Churche, whiche acknowledged but twelue, you wil make thirtene articles of the Créede at the leaſt? Beſides this, the catholique Churche in the time of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian and Auguſtine, and before alſo, did not reken or iudge theſe to be twoo ſeuerall articles, but did coumpte them one article, concludinge theſe woordes, <hi>the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Sainctes,</hi> in this ſentence, <hi>I beleue a catholique Churche of Chriſte,</hi> recyting the Symbole without reherſall or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning, <hi>the communion of Sainctes,</hi> as it is plainely ſet foorth by S. Cyprian and Auguſtine, in their expoſicions of the Apoſtolicall Créede. The mattier meant by <hi>the communion of Sainctes,</hi> is vttered in theſe woordes: <hi>I beleue an holy catholike Churche of Chriſt.</hi> Whereunto hath been added ſence theſe auncient fathers times, as it may ſéeme by the way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, <hi>a communion of Sainctes,</hi> to expreſſe in plaineſſe of ſpeche, that Chriſtes catholique Churche, is nothing els, but a felowſhippe, and communion of faithfull ones, whiche are ſainctes. Nowe let vs ſee howe to ſweare, as this thirde chiefe point of the othe ſetteth foorth, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt this article of our Créede, <hi>I beleaue the holy catholique Churche, the communion of Sainctes.</hi> All true ſubiectes ought and muſt renounce and forſake all forraine iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, powers, ſuperioritie, preheminences and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of euery forraine Prince, and Prelate, ſtate or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate. This is the propoſition of that part of the othe: to the whiche adioyne this propoſition, all true ſubiectes ought and muſt beleaue, <hi>an holy catholique Churche of Chriſte, the communion of Sainctes.</hi> Eſpy nowe what oppoſition is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they may not both matche

together, and be verified in one true and faithful ſubiecte. The one, ſay you, is directly againſt the other. Then ſaye I, there is a direct oppoſition &amp; repugnancy betwixt them, by due examination we ſhall finde out the oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Trie the partes of theſe propoſitions ſeuerally without the <hi>verbe</hi> that coupleth them together, and you ſhall not find any oppoſition, either <hi>contrary relatiue, priuatiue,</hi> or <hi>diſparate:</hi> ioyne them together with the <hi>verbe</hi> that coupleth, &amp; being propoſitions, they are not one againſt the other <hi>contrary, ſubcontrary, ſubalterne</hi> nor <hi>contradictory,</hi> and therfore vntruly, &amp; no leſſe vnſkilfully babled of you, that the one is directly againſt the other, when a <hi>yong ſcholer</hi> that hath red but the rudimentes of his Logike, could haue ſéen &amp; iudged, that there is in them no oppoſition or repugnancy at all. To renounce and forſake Antechriſt &amp; his Churche by othe or otherwiſe, and to beleue in Chriſte and rightfully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his holy catholique Churche by all maner of wayes, ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth neither directly nor indirectly one againſt the other, but are matched together &amp; agreeth iumpe one with the other. Surely your eies were not matches, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were your wittes at home, whan you ſpied cut this repugnancy, if you had not publiſhed this learned piece of worke, your friendes ſhould neuer haue knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what an huge heape of conning &amp; knowledge, is hidden in that litle head of yours. The demaunde in your iſſue is eaſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the deſcription or definition of Chriſtes true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Churche. The catholique Churche of Chriſte is a multitude, ſocietie and communion of Sainctes and <note place="margin">The diffinâ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of the catholique Churche.</note> faithfull ones, that haue been, ſhalbe, and are nowe on liue in the earth, how and whereſoeuer they be deuided, and diſperſed in time and place, the whiche multitude of Sainctes, haue a participation in common amongſt them ſelues of all good thinges, geuen, graunted, and growing
<pb facs="tcp:4439:106"/>
from God through Chriſt, of ſpirite, faith, Sacramentes, prayer, remiſſion of ſinnes, and heauenly bliſſe: and are vnited to Chriſt their head by faith, and faſtened togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther amongeſt them ſelues, as members of one body with the bond of loue. To this catholike church, euery Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man is bounde to bee ſubiecte and obedient as a member ought, and may be ſubiect and obedient to the body.</p>
               <p>And we doo teache and confeſſe in this Churche ſuche an attoneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, participation, and communion, among all the members in doctrine, faith, Religion, and Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that neither this, nor any other Realme, may lawfully diſſent from this Churche, or renounce and refuſe to haue communion therewith, as God be praiſed we of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme doo nowe ſhewe our ſelues by al Chriſtian meanes, neuer more at any time, to agree and conſent in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this catholike Churche, in neceſſary doctrine, right faith, true Religion, and the right vſe of Chriſtes Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. The foule lies that you heape together, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhamefully to defoyle your owne neaſt and natiue countrey, neadeth none other confutation, than onely to make them playne to be ſeen and iudged of all men, that the Realme may be ſory, that euer it neſtled ſo vnnatural and filthy a byrde, and your friendes aſhamed of ſo mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and impudent a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is a ſhameful Lie, that by corporal othe or any other wayes, we renounce and refuſe to haue communion with the catholike Churche of Chriſte. And this is a monſterous Lye, that the catholike Churche is a foraine authoritie and power out of this Realme. Who was euer ſo madde, as ones to thinke, or ſo doltiſhe as to ſpeake any thing againſt the catholike Churche, but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to forſake it, and that bicauſe it is a foraine power

and authoritie. The Othe maketh no mention in any one woorde, of the Catholique Churche, it ſpeaketh of a foraigne Prince, Prelate, and Potentate, and ſo of the foraigne Power and Authoritie of ſuche a foraigne ſtate. Wherevpon M.

Then for ſome iſſue to be had of this matter, ſeeynge that the meaninge of the Othe, is not as the expreſſe vvoordes doo purport.

If this be true, that you haue ſaid, it is manifeſt by your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that I declared her Maieſties meaninge in that Othe, to be none otherwiſe than the expreſſe wordes are, as they lye <hi>verbatim.</hi> For when I ſhowe her meaninge to be, that ye ſhould acknowledge in her highnes, the only ſupreamacie, I doo declare plainely, that ſhe meaneth to exclude, all other men from hauinge any ſupreamacie: for this excluſiue, only, can not haue any other ſenſe or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning And whan I adde this ſupreamacie to be in all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall cauſes or thinges, I ſhewe an vniuerſall compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion

Beſides theſe in your whole trauaile folowing, ye labour to improue this (as you ſay) mine aſſercion, to wit, that all Spirituall iuriſdiction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon the poſitiue Lawe of Princes: If this bee mine aſſercion, as ye affirme it is, and therefore bende all your force to improoue it, ye witnes with me againſt your ſelfe, that I declared her Maieſties meaning, was to take neither more nor leſſe authoritie, and iurrſdiction, vnto her ſelfe, than kynge Henry and kinge Edwarde had, for they had no more than all. And if her Maieſtie take any leſſe, ſhe hath not al.

               <p>It is very true, that after yée had quarelled muche in ſondry thinges touchyng woordes and termes expreſſed in the Act of Parliament, and in the interpretation of the Othe: Yée did neuertheleſſe finally agrée in the whole matter thereof, finding onely doubt in one pointe of mine aſſertion, namely touchyng iuriſdiction Spirituall or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, all whiche you affirmedcon, trary to mine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, to be committed by Chriſte to Biſhops &amp; prieſtes, as proprely apperteyning to their office and calling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further commiſſion or authoritie from Princes or any other power.

An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ph. lib. 2.</note> to your argumentes. Spiritual Iuriſdiction is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into twoo ſortes, the one is called <hi>Cohibityue,</hi> the other not <hi>Cohibityue,</hi> That whiche is called not Cohibityue, is that iuriſdiction or power that is exerciſed and woorketh in the inwarde and ſecrete courte of conſcience: that is the preachinge of the Ghoſpell, myniſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and the abſoluinge and reteininge of ſinnes by the woorde of God in the publique myniſtery. This ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they call not Cohibityue, bicauſe in the Court of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, no man is bound or lowſed vnwillingly or againſt his will. To exerciſe this kinde of Iuriſdiction, neither kinges nor ciuill Magiſtrates, neither any other perſone
<pb facs="tcp:4439:111"/>
may challendge or take vppon him, onleſſe he be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully called thereunto. Iuriſdiction Cohibitiue hath twoo partes, the one conſiſteth in the exerciſe of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and circumſtaunces thereunto required by Chriſtes inſtitution: the whiche power or Iuriſdiction belongeth to the Churche onely, and not to the Prince, Biſhoppe or Prieſt: for noman hath authoritie to excommunicate but onely the Churche, and thoſe who receiue authoritie there vnto by commiſſion from the Churche. The other kinde of Cohibitiue Juriſdiction is a power or authoritie, that conſiſteth and is exerciſed, <hi>in foro cauſarum, in the courte of cauſes,</hi> and apperteineth <hi>ad externum &amp; publicum fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, to the externall and publike Courte,</hi> and is defined to be, ſaith <hi>Antonius,</hi> an authoritie or power to declare the Law, geue ſentence and to iudge in all controuerſies (pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge to the Courte) what is euery mans right, and in ſumme, to doo thoſe thinges, that iuſtice dooth require ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to the Lawes. <hi>Ioannes Quintinus</hi> defineth Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to the ſame effect, but openeth the nature thereof more plainely, ſayinge: <hi>Iuriſdiction is an office and authoritie, to declare the Lawe, that is, to admyniſter iuſtice and equity<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction conſiſteth onely in the contentions or debatinge of matters in Courte or iudgementes. This authoritie to iudge dooth diſcende nowe from the Prince alone, in whome onely is all power.

For the vſe of thoſe keyes, that are occupied in the Courte of conſcience, belongeth onely to the Euangelicall Prieſtes. But this Iuriſdiction may lawfully be exerciſed of thoſe that are not myniſters of the woorde and Sacramentes, and are not Prieſtes.</hi> As the twoo former partes of Eccleſiaſtical iuriſdiction haue their vertue, power, and inſtitution of Chriſte immediatly, euen ſo this third part, whiche is ſaide to conſiſte <hi>in foro cauſarum,</hi> with thoſe thinges which may be vſed or exerciſed by vertue thereof, dothe depende vppon the poſitiue Lawes of Chriſtian Magiſtrates, or where ſuche wanteth vppon the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue rules and orders of that Churche, where ſuche or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders muſte be practiſed, and not immediatly vppon the Lawe of God. You tooke vppon you to proue, that this ſeconde kinde of Cohibityue Iuriſdiction with the appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances thereof: as I haue reherſed, was appointed by

the expreſſe woorde of God immediatly to Biſhoppes and Prieſtes, without further commiſſion of Princes or other power, whiche I denied.</p>
               <p>Nowe let vs conſider the force of your proufes, and ſée how they conclude your cauſe. Firſte yée ſay, <hi>that the woordes of the firſt parte of the Othe, doo by expreſſe woordes of the Acte, geue vnto the Q. highnes all manner of iuriſdictions, priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and preheminences in any wiſe touchinge and concerninge any Spirituall or Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction within the realme, with an expreſſe debarre and flat deniall made of al ſpirituall iuriſdiction vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Biſshoppes thereof to be exerciſed ouer their flockes and cures without her highnes ſpeciall commiſsion, to be graunted thereunto: they hauinge by the expreſſe woorde of God, commiſsion of ſpirituall gouernement ouer them.</hi> Your euill dealing with the woordes of the Acte and the Othe, expreſſeth an vnkindely mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge to the Prince and the ſtate: for that either the Acts or the Othe debarreth or denieth expreſſely or couertly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Biſhopes of this realme to exerciſe ouer their flockes and cures, without her highnes ſpeciall commiſſion graunted therto, any ſpirituall iuriſdiction aſſigned to a Biſhop by the woorde of God, is altogether vntrue. The Statute geueth or rather reſtoreth to the Prince Iuriſdiction and authoritie to enquire after what ſorte, the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate and perſonnes behaue them ſelues in their cures and chardges, to refourme and correct the diſorders, negligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and enormities riſinge amongeſt them to the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of their office in their cures and chardges: and in ſumme to order and prouide, that they doo execute their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice accordinge to their callinge in their cures &amp; chardges. This is not to debarre or denie them the exerciſe of their office without a ſpeciall licence. Neither doo the expreſſe woordes of the Statute geue to the Prince all manner of iuriſdictions in ſuche abſolute wiſe as you reporte, <hi>in</hi>

                  <hi>any wiſe, and any ſpirituall iuriſdiction within the realme.</hi> For theſe termes, <hi>all manner, in any wiſe,</hi> and <hi>any ſpirituall iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> whiche you enforce ſo muche are not founde in the gifte or reſtitucion of ſpirituall iuriſdiction made by the acte vnto the Prince: But in that parte where the acte ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth afterwarde power and authoritie to the Prince to execute the Iuriſdiction, now vnited and annexed to the Crowne, by méete delegates, to be aſſigned, named, &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion or letters patentes vnder the great Seale of Englande. If yée will hereof inferre that bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Princes haue by vertue of the acte, full power and authoritie to name, aſſigne, and authoriſe any perſon whome they ſhal thinke méete to exerciſe, vſe, occupy, and exequute vnder them, all manner of iuriſdictions, priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and preheminences in any wiſe, touchinge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any Spirituall or Eccleſiaſtical iuriſdiction with in their dominions or countreies: Therefore all manner iuriſdiction is in the Prince to be exerciſed, vſed, occupied, and exequuted by them: for otherwiſe you will ſay, the Princes cannot geue and committe to others, that which they haue not receiued and is not in them ſelues. Your argument is eaſily anſweared in fewe woordes: it is a foule Sophiſtication, <hi>a ſecundum quid ad ſimpliciter.</hi> Theſe woordes of the Acte, <hi>all manner, in any wiſe,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained and bounded, within the limites of the gifte: where you of purpoſe, to beguile the ſimple with all, doo let them runne at lardge, and ſette them foorth as méere and ſimple vniuerſalles without any limites at all. The Act geueth or reſtoreth to the Prince iuriſdictions, priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, ſuperiorities, and preheminencies ſpirituall &amp; Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, but it addeth this Limitacion ſuche as by any Spirituall or Eccleſiaſtical power or authoritie hath here<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tofore béene, or may lawfully be exerciſed or vſed. And for

that theſe woordes <hi>(as by any Spirituall or Eccleſiaſticall power or authoritie hath heretofore been, or may lawfully bee exerciſed and vſed)</hi> may bee maliciouſly ſtretched by a wranglinge Papiſt, and might ſeeme to ſome, that haue good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alſo, to geue ouer large a ſcope, the matter or obiect wherein, or where about, theſe Spirituall or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call iuriſdictions, priuileges, ſuperiorities, and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minences, are exerciſed vſed and doo conſiſte, is limited and added in theſe expreſſe woordes <hi>(for the viſitation of the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate and perſones, and for reformation, order and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſame, and of all manner errours, hereſies, Schiſmes, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, offences, contemptes, and enormities)</hi> whiche woordes of limitation in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gifte, as they geue not to the Prince, the exerciſe of that iuriſdiction that conſiſteth and woorketh in the inwarde and ſecrete Courte of conſcience, by the preaching of the woorde and mynſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, whiche belongeth onely and alone to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes, neither doo they authoriſe the Prince to vſe that iuriſdiction that belongeth properly to the whole Church: euen ſo doo they geue rightly vnto the Prince to exerciſe all maner iuriſdictions, priuileges, ſuperiorities, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminences in any wyſe touching, and concerninge any Spiritual or Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction, conteined vnder the ſeconde kinde of Cohibitiue iuriſdiction: for that may the Prince lawfully exerciſe and vſe, and doth not belong vnto the Biſhops, otherwiſe than by commiſſion and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Poſitiue lawes. This limitation of iuriſdiction ſet forth by expreſſe wordes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Act, you know right wel: ye were alſo at ſundry times put in minde thereof, and you were wel aſſured, that your alleaging y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes of the Act ſo darkely, confuſedly and vntruely, could not further your cauſe amongeſt the wiſe: and yet woulde you néedes publiſhe them in this ſorte to the people, whereby at the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4439:113"/>
leaſt, to make both Prince and the Lawe odious vnto the ſimple ſubiectes. The Biſhoppes haue by the expreſſe woorde of God, commiſſion of Spiritual gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ouer their flock, that is, to féede the flock of Chriſt, committed to their charge, with Gods holy woorde, as I haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before. Thei haue commiſſion to abſolue the faithfully penitent, and to reteine or binde the impenitent: that is, to declare and aſſure both the one &amp; the other by the worde of the Goſpel of Gods iudgement towardes them. What wil ye inferre hereof? will ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude therfore, they haue all maner of ſpirituall gouernement or iuriſdiction ouer them? Yonge Logicians knowe, this is an euell conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that concludeth vpon one or diuerſe particulers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiuely an vniuerſall. Thus ye argue, Biſhoppes by the expreſſe worde of God, haue commiſſion to preache to their cures, to remitte or reteine ſynnes. <hi>Ergo,</hi> they haue commiſſion by the expreſſe woorde of God, to Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon councels, or Synodes generall or prouinciall, to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite: that is, iudicially ſitting in iudgement, to enquire of mens manners, and forinſically to puniſhe or correct, and to decide the controuerſies amongeſt the people: tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching contractes of matrimony, whoordome, tyethes, ſclaunders &amp;c. and to ordeine decrees, Lawes, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, rites, &amp;c. If this concluſion followe conſequently vpon your antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, than doth it ouerthrowe the doctrine of your Romiſhe diuinitie, whiche graunteth not to the Biſhoppes immediatly from God this power, without a ſpeciall commiſſion from the Pope, in whome onely, as the Papiſtes ſaye, is fulnes of iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and power. But if this concluſion followe not conſequently vpon the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, as a man more than halfe blynde, may plainely ſee, it doth not: than haue ye concluded nothing at all by Chriſtes diuinitie, that may further the matter yee haue
<pb facs="tcp:4439:114"/>
taken in hande to proue. You falſely reporte the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in this that you ſay: the Biſhops haue commiſſion by the expreſſe woorde of God, to geue vnto their flockes &amp; cures, the holy ghoſt by the impoſicion of their handes. For the place which yée quote for that purpoſe, expreſſeth <note place="margin">Act. 8.</note> no ſuche commiſſion, neither any other place of the holy Scriptures. The Biſhoppes haue ſo daungerous a cure and chardge ouer the ſoules committed vnto them, that God will require the bloud of thoſe that periſhe (thorough their negligence) at their handes: and therfore hath geuen them ſufficient commiſſion for the diſchardge of their cures. It were therefore an horrible abſurditie, if they might not exerciſe any Iuriſdiction ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: if they might not viſit, refourme, order and correct them, by that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion without a further commiſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But doo yée not perceiue, which the moſt ſimple may ſée, whereof alſo yée often were admoniſhed by me, your warblinge ſlaight, and Sophiſticall quarellinge in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of woordes &amp; termes? As there are twoo ſortes of Iuriſdiction, whereof the one not Cohibityue, properly belongeth to the Biſhoppe whiche he may and ought to exerciſe ouer his flocke, without any other commiſſion than of Chriſt: ſo to viſit, refourme, order and correct, are of twoo ſortes: the one a Scripturely viſitacion, reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and correction by the onely woorde of God, which the Biſhoppes may and ought to exerciſe in time, and out of time, with all poſſible watchefulnes and diligence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further commiſſion. The other kinde of viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, reformation &amp; correction, is Forinſecall or courtly, whiche I comprehende vnder the ſeconde kinde of Cohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Iuriſdiction, and this the Biſhoppe may not exerciſe without a further commiſſion from the Prince. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ouer foule an abſurditie in you to inferre, that the

                  <hi>VVhereunto I do adioyne this obiection follovving. Firſt for the time of the olde lavve, vvhiche as Paule ſaide vvas a very figure of the nevve, Moſes, Aaron, Eleazarus, being Prieſtes, <note place="margin">Exod. 24. Exod. 29.

Beſides that for the vvhole time, of the old Lavve, there vvas an expreſſe lavve made, vvhereby all Cyuill magiſtrates and iudges vvere co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded in all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matters, to repayre to the Biſhoppes and Prieſtes, and to ſtay vppon their determinacions and iudgementes, vvithout declinyng on the right hande, or the left. And if that any man ſhould diſobeye the determinacion once geuen of the Prieſt, morietur homo ille, like as appeareth. Deut. 17.</hi>

               <p>This adiunct will not ſerue your turne, for it is not poſſible to ſtretche it without burſtinge, to ioyne with that you muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude. You beginne to ioyne your woorke togeather with a ſaying of S. Paule, which he neuer ſaid, you ſhould haue noted the place where S. Paule ſaithe, that the olde Lawe was a very figure of the newe. There is no ſuche ſaying: S. Paule ſaith to the Hebrewes: <hi>that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lawe hath the ſhadowe of good thinges to come &amp;c.</hi> where he ſpeaketh not generally of the whole Lawe, but of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall parte and ſacrifices, whiche were ſhadowes of Chriſte and his ſacrifice, and not of the Biſhoppes Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction after Chriſt, vnder the Law of the Ghoſpell. Thus
<pb facs="tcp:4439:115"/>
aptly alſo doo your allegations out of the olde Teſtament ſerue your purpoſe: for one of the thrée, to wit, <hi>29.</hi> of <hi>Exod.</hi> hath no woorde of this Iuriſdiction: onely it ſheweth the manner of conſecratinge the Prieſt, and the ceremonies thereabout. In the. <hi>24.</hi> of <hi>Exod.</hi> it is ſaide, that <hi>when Moſes wente vp into the Mount, he ſaide vnto the Elders: Tary vs here vntill wee retourne vnto you. Beholde Aaron and Hur, are here with you: if any man haue ought to doo, let him come to them,</hi> that is if any <note place="margin">Lyra.</note> matter of controuerſie ariſe in mine abſence, let Aaron &amp; Hur, haue the hearinge and decidinge of it, as I ſhoulde haue, if I were preſent. By this place Aaron had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority geuen vnto him but for a time in the abſence of Moſes, by commiſſion from Moſes, the chiefe ruler and gouernour of Goddes people, and that not alone, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge Hur one of the Elders, an auncient and a wiſe man ioyned in commiſſion with him. This allegation maketh directly againſt your concluſion: for it ſheweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Aaron had this authority but by commiſſion from Moſes the Prince of the people. In the thirde place <hi>Num. 27.</hi> where God ſhewed vnto Moſes, that Ioſue ſhoulde gouerne the people after him, it is ſaide: that <hi>Ioſue ſhoulde ſtande before Eleazar the Prieſt, who ſhall aſke Councell for him by the iudgement of Vrim before the Lord, and at his woorde they ſhal goe out and in, both he and the people of Iſraell:</hi> that is, whan Ioſue ſtandeth in doubte what to doo for the better gouernement of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, either in the time of peace or warre, he ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande Goddes will therein by the high Prieſt, to whome the Lorde will miraculouſly declare his will and pleaſure by the light or ſhininge of the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thumin,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to Gods will ſhewed in the <hi>Vrim</hi> to the high Prieſt, and by him to Ioſue, he muſte direct and order his gooyng in and out: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſay you. The Biſhoppes and Prieſtes now in the time of the Ghoſpell, haue Iuriſdiction by the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4439:115"/>
expreſſe woorde of God, to kéepe Courtes, to cal Councels, to make Lawes, &amp; forinſecally to viſit, refourme, order, &amp; correct their flockes &amp; cures. The moſt ſimple can iudge of this ſequele. After like ſorte it is writen <hi>Deut. 17.</hi> That whan harde and doubtfull caſes come before the iudges or inferiour Magiſtrates, whiche cannot eaſely be tried or founde out by them: than the inferiour Magiſtrates ſhall goo to the high Prieſt, and to the chiefe iudge at Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem for the time beinge, who ſhall ſhewe what is to be doone: whoſe ſentence &amp; iudgement muſt not be diſobeyed, vnder the paine of death. Doo you not aptly conclude, thinke you, that the Biſhops in the time of the Ghoſpell ought to haue this Courtly iuriſdiction, bicauſe the high Prieſt, and the Temporall iudge, did determine doubtfull caſes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of the olde Teſtament? for the Prieſt alone did not determine all cauſes, as you ſéeme to alledge the texte.</p>

               <p>God be thanked, that S. Luke maketh to vs a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient report of this councell, who maketh no mencion of any Prieſt there preſent, as you vntruely report, onles ye will thinke he meant the order of Prieſtes, whan he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the faction of the Phariſées. Whether the Apoſtles called this councell or not: or that the Congregation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled together in their ordinary ſort, for praier, preaching, and breaking of bread, <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> with the others, ſent to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> did declare the cauſe of their meſſage before the whole Churche, which is more likely, I will not determine, bicauſe S. Luke maketh no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof. But if it be true that ye affirme that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles called or aſſembled this Councell. Then was it
<pb facs="tcp:4439:117"/>
not the authoritie or Acte of one Apoſtle alone. Beſides this, if the Apoſtles called this councell, they called they Layte ſo wel as the Clergie to the councell: yea, as may ſéeme probable, mo of the Laytie than of the Clergie. The decrées were not made by the Apoſtles alone, as you fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely feyne. For S. Luke ſaith, the decrée was made by the Apoſtles, Elders, and the whole Congregation. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, I graunt, as was moſte conuenient with the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had the debating, arguing and diſcuſſing of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie. They declared out of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures what was the truthe: And I doubt not but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the Church, what they thought moſt conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be determined: But the determination and decrée, was by the common conſent, both of the Apoſtles, Elders, and people. Therfore this controuerſy was reformed, ordered, and corrected, not by the authoritie of the Apoſtles alone, without the Elders, neither they togeaher did it without the aſſent of the Churche, and ſo this allegation maketh no deale for your purpoſe, but rather cleane againſt it.</p>

               <p>Your whole drifte in this parte is, to proue that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes and Prieſtes may viſite, geue the holy Ghoſte, by the impoſition of their handes: and make lawes, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and decrees to their flockes and cures.

The inſufficiency of this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, doth eaſely appeare, to thoſe that doo conſider the ſtate and condicion of the Apoſtleſhip, and compare ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the office of a Biſhop or Prieſt. The Apoſtles did, might, and could doo, many thinges that Biſhoppes and Prieſtes, neither may, nor can doo. The matter is more
<pb facs="tcp:4439:118"/>
plaine than that needeth any proufe. But as the ſequele faileth in forme, ſo let vs conſider the matter, wherupon ye grounde the ſequele, that your friendes may ſee what foule ſhiftes ye are driuen to make, for the maintenaunce of an vniuſt claime. That the Apoſtles did viſite their cures and flockes, you proue by two places of the Actes: in the firſt place, ye feine the Scriptures to ſaie, that it ſayeth not: for in the eight of the Actes, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion made of any viſitation: the other place ſpeaketh only of a Scripturely viſitation, and nothing at al of your Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinſecall or Canon Lawe viſitation. The Canon Lawes viſitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is to be exerciſed by a great nomber of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as the Scripture knoweth not. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about that viſitation is occupied for the moſte part, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt the Scriptures. The perſonnes that may lawfully viſit in your Canon Lawe viſitation, <hi>are Popes, Legates from the ſide: Legates ſent and borne, Legates and meſſengers of the Apoſtolike ſea, Patriarches, Archebiſhoppes, Biſhoppes, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decons,</hi>

                  <hi>Deanes, Archeprieſtes, Abbottes, and other inferiour perſonnes hauinge iuriſdiction. All Archbiſhoppes whiche are Legates borne, haue authority to viſit their prouinces by double right, to wit, by right Legatiue, and by right Metropolitane, and ſo they may viſit twyſe in the yere. All theſe viſitours muſte beginne their viſitation with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Maſſe of the holy ghoſt. The Biſhoppe and euery ordinary viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, muſt beginne his viſitation at his Cathedrall churche and Chapter. He muſt come into the Church where he viſiteth, and firſt kneele downe and pray deuoutly, chiefly directinge his eyes and minde to the place wherein the honourable ſacrament of Chriſtes Bodie is hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and kepte.</hi> The matters of the Canon Lawe viſitation are in parte theſe. <hi>The viſitour ought to viewe dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly whether the place where the Sacrament is kepte, be cleane, well garniſhed and cloſe, for the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, and the holy Chryſme ought to be kept ſhut vnder locke and keye. He muſt ſee that there be great lightes of waxe to geue light in</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:4439:118"/>
                  <hi>that place, Then muſt he viſit the place of the holy reliques, and of Baptiſme. And ſearche diligently what manner of place it is and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be kepte ſhut. Beſides this he muſte viſit the Aultares and litle Chappelles, and muſt with his eies view he whole Church whether it be cleanly and cleane. Then he muſt viſit the veſſelles and Church veſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes whether they be cleane, and kept in a cleane place, as they ought to be, and whether the veſtymentes be ouermuche worne and broken, and in caſe the viſitour ſhall finde ſuche veſtimentes vncleane, rente, and conſumed with occupyinge, he muſte burne them in the fire, and cauſe the aſhes to be buried in ſome place, whereby there is no paſſage. But in any wiſe let him not ſuffer</hi> (ſaith Socius) <hi>purſes or ſuch like thinges to worldly vſe to be made of the coopes or tunicles. Laſt of all, let him ſuruey the houſes and poſſeſsions belonging to the Churche. The Biſhop dooth viſit alſo, to Biſshop enfantes, and to conſecrate or hallow Churches. The viſitour alſo ſhall enquire and examine, whether any man knowe or beleeue, or that the fame is, that the Sexten, the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, or the Veſture keeper, hath well and ſaufly kepte, the veſſels, veſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and other thinges or ornamentes of the Churche, as Maſſe bookes, Grayles, Antiphoners, Legendes, and other thinges appointed to diuine Seruice, and whether any thinge moueable, or vnmoueable be diminiſhed, and by whome, wherefore, whan, and after what ſorte, whyther they be diligently preſent at the Dirigees for the dead.

for the time whiles Chriſtes Churche was to be erected, and the woorde to be ſounded thorough the worlde: And therfore Chriſoſtome ſaieth: That this gyfte perteyned onely to the Apoſtles. For (ſaith he) the Conuertꝭ in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria had receiued before Peter and Iohn came, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Remiſſion of Sinnes: But the ſpirite of Myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that is the gyfte of tounges, healinge, propheciyng, and ſuch like, which are the gyftes of the Holy Ghoſte, &amp; therefore are called the Holy Ghoſte, they had not as yet receiued. There were many that by the power of Goddes ſpirite coulde woorke Myracles, but to geue this power to others, none coulde doo but the Apoſtles. For that was propre, and onely in them. Marke nowe the ſequele of your allegation for proufe of your purpoſe: Thus you ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue: The Apoſtles gaue by the impoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their handes, to the Samaritans, the gyftes, of Healinge, Propheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge, of Tongues, &amp;c. Therfore euery Biſhop and prieſt hath power to geue the ſame gyftes, to their flockes and cures. There was neuer none ſo blinde, or ignorantly brought vp in your cures, belongynge to the Abbay of Weſtminſter, but that did well perceiue, that neither your Biſhoppes, Abbottes, or Prieſtes, had, or coulde do any ſuche ſeate.

Touchinge the thirde parte of your proufe, whereby yee conclude, that Biſhops and Prieſtes may make Lawes, orders, and decrees, to their flockes and cures, bicauſe the Apoſtles ſo did, as you ſay: Although I neede make none other anſweare, then to denie your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which you can by no arte maineteyne, the inſufficiency whereof is manifeſt, to thoſe that haue but a little ſkyll, eyther in Logike or Diuinitie: Yet I will briefly conſider the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereupon you grounde this miſhapen ſequele, that

Paule had founded the Churche of Corinthe, and had brought them to Chriſt through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge of the Ghoſpell, there ſprange vp amongeſt them in his abſence many vices and offences, contrary to the Doctrine he had taught, and the Godly admonitions, that he had geuen vnto them: wherfore being aduertiſed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he wrote his Epiſtle vnto that Church, wherin he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth their faultes, partely in generall, and partely in ſpeciall: And in the ende of the tenth Chapiter, concludeth with this general admonition, that <hi>All thinges be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, and to the Glory of God.</hi> In the. xi. Chapiter, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth certeine faultes in ſpeciall, committed by them in their publique aſſemblies, and Churche méetinges, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this generall admonition, and contrary to that he had taught them in ſpecial, touchinge their honeſt and comely behauiour in their publique prayer, preaching, &amp; communicating in Chriſtes Sacramentes, which of al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges ought chiefely to be ſo done, as therby God may be glorified, and al offences eſchued. To this ende S. Paule had taught the Corinthes, that in theſe publique &amp; holy exerciſes, it is moſt ſéemely that men prophery &amp; pray bare headed: Contrarywiſe wemen, not without their heades couered. Many obſerued this comelyneſſe in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and propheciynge, as Paule had taught them: Others contentiouſely did withſtande and gaineſay the ſame, as an order that Paule hadde deuiſed, and brought in of his owne deuiſe, beſides Goddes woorde, as you alſo yma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that Paule made this order beſides the Goſpell, of his own authoritie, wherwith to bynde the Corinthes. To anſwere both the contentious Philoſophers, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the Corinthes, and the ſuperſtitious Papiſtes, nowe in lyke forte moleſtinge the Chriſtians, S. Paule
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4439:120"/>
proueth, that this comlynes is grounded vppon Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and not a Lawe newly deuiſed of his owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie beſides the Ghoſpell. This is his proufe, the man by Gods ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hath the ſuperioritie, and the woman muſt be in ſubiection. God hath appointed for them bothe, ſignes and tokens of this dominion and ſubiection. He hath ordeined that man in token of ſuperioritie, ſhoulde haue his head vncouered: as contrariwyſe the woman, in token of ſubiection, to haue her head couered.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if man laye away that ſigne and token of dominion whiche God hath ordeined for him to vſe, and taketh vpon him the ſigne and badge of ſubiection, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonoureth God his head, and breaketh his ordinance. And ſo the woman, if ſhee leaue of the couerture of her head whiche God hath geuen to her, to be worne as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and badge of her ſubiection, and taketh vpon her the ſigne of ſuperioritie, ſhe diſhonoureth her head, and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Gods ordinaunce. S. Paule addeth an other reaſon, wereby he proueth that, this this was no Lawe made by him to the Corinthes. Nature, ſaith he, hath taught you this comely order. If this were a Lawe and Decree of nature, it was not S. Paules deuiſe beſides Gods word. S. Ambroſe vpon this place ſaith, that <hi>S. Paule ſpake theſe woordes, according to Gods Lawe, whiche forbiddeth,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the man to weare his heare. Chryſoſtome</hi> affirmeth this to be an ordinaunce of nature. <hi>But</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whan I ſpeake of nature, I meane of God, who is the authour of nature.</hi> So that it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by S. Paules owne proufes in defence of that he had taught, and by the witneſſe of S. Ambroſe and Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome, that the man to be bareheaded, and the woman couered, was not a Lawe, order and decree, made by S. Paule to the Corinthes, as you vntruly fable: but Gods ordinaunce, made plaine, ſet forth, and taught by hym,
<pb facs="tcp:4439:121"/>
that all thinges might be done in the Churche in comely order, to Gods glory. Of like ſorte was the reformation and order, whereof you ſpeake about the more woorthy receiuinge the Lordes Supper. The Apoſtle maketh thereaboute no newe Lawe, order, or decree, beſides the Ghoſpel, but reproueth the Corinthians, for that they did not, aboute the receipte thereof, obſerue the lawe of the Ghoſpell: He blameth them in generall, that their Churche aſſemblies were not to the encreaſe, but rather to the decreaſe of vertue in them ſelues: He reproueth them that in ſteade of brotherly loue, vnitie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, there was Contempte, Schiſme, and Diſſention amongeſt them: He rebuketh them, for that they made that Supper Pryuate, whiche the Lorde him ſelfe had made, and inſtituted to be Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon: He reprehendeth them for Drunkenneſſe, and that with the contempte of the poore: And he ſharpely ſhaketh them vp, for that they abuſe the Churche, contemninge the right vſe thereof. Is not this Chriſtes Lawe, that the people ſhoulde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in vertue? Is not this Chriſtꝭ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſtians ſhoulde lyue in brotherly loue, vnitie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde? Is not this Chriſtes Inſtitution, that his Supper ſhoulde be Common, and not Pryuate? Dooth not Chriſtes lawe condemne Drunkerdes, and contempte of the poore? And is not this Goddes decree, that his houſe ſhoulde not be prophaned or abuſed? If theſe be Gods ordinances, as you can not denie them to bee, than are they not Paules lawes, orders, or decrees, neyther by writynge or woorde of mouthe: otherwiſe than that Paule was Goddes mouthe and ſcribe, to vtter, not his owne lawes beſides the Ghoſpell, but Goddes ordinaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces comprehended within his Ghoſpell. So that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beynge preſente, he taught them by woorde, or being
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4439:121"/>
abſente by wrytynge, he neyther wryite nor ſpake, other then he had receyued of the Lorde. He promiſed, ſay you, to diſpoſe other thinges at his comminge. It is true, but not other wiſe then he did theſe aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. He exhorteth, ſay you, the Theſſalonians, to abide in the traditions, whiche they had learned by woorde or by writinge. Yee ſay trueth: but he dooth not thereby bynde them to this, as to a lawe, order, or decree, made by him beſydes the Ghoſpell: but he moniſheth them, as S. Ambroſe expoundeth his meaninge, <hi>To ſtande faſt, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and perſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I maruaile not, that yee miſreporte S. Paule, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge, that he made orders and decrees, touchinge pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge and preachinge vnto the people in tongues vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, &amp; that all wemen ſhoulde keepe ſilence in the church and congregation, for it may ſeeme, yee neuer readde the place, but tooke it, as you hearde it reported.

The firſt woorde of the ſentence which knitteth the ſame, as a concluſion to that that goeth before, yée haue left out.

It ſuffiſed you to heape vp a ſorte of teſtimonies togeather, to make a ſhew although nothing to the purpoſe. Yea the woordes ſpoken to the Prophet Hieremy maketh plainely againſt you.

So that other iuriſdiction ouer people &amp; kingdomes, than the preachinge of Goddes woorde Hieremy had not. <hi>Hieremyes mouth is touched,</hi> ſaith y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gloſe ordinary, <hi>and the Lordes woordes are geuen</hi> (to him) <hi>that he ſhoulde receiue boldenes to preache.</hi> Of this holdenes to preache the woorde of God, ſpeaketh <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianz.</hi> in the place by you alledged. After he had comforted his hearers, he tourneth his ſpeache to the Princes, and ſuche as were in authority, <hi>muſte wee ſpare you</hi> (ſaithe he) <hi>bicauſe of your power, as though we feared, or were aſhamed of the libertie geuen vs of Chriſte? Chriſtes lawe hath made you ſubiect to my power, and to my iudgement ſeate.</hi> He ſpeaketh of a ſpirituall ſubiection by faith, &amp; obedience to the myniſter, exhortinge, comfortinge, and edifiyng to eternall life by the woorde of God. And he addeth more expreſſedly what maner of rule or empyre he challendgeth, namely ſuche as bringeth the fleaſhe to be ſubiect to the ſpyrite, ſuche as maketh earthly thinges ſubiect to Heauenly. And the ſubiection he requireth is none other, than ſuch as the ſpiritual ſhéepe oweth to the ſpiritual paſtour, whoſe rule and ſubiection Chriſte vttereth in this ſentence: <hi>My ſheepe heare my voice and follow me.</hi> I know ſaith Nazianzene to the <note place="margin">Ioan. 10.</note> Emperour, <hi>that thou arte a ſheepe of my flocke,</hi> and thereupon he concludeth that he muſte boldely preache the woorde to the Emperour, &amp; that he on the other ſide is ſubiect therto &amp; ought to obey. And this is the propre Iuriſdiction that belongeth to the Biſhoppes &amp; Prieſtes, the whiche if they
<pb facs="tcp:4439:130"/>
exerciſe with all poſſible diligence &amp; faithfulnes, they ſhall eſcape the curſes that the Prophete Ezechiel menaſſeth: As co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywiſe if they vſe neuer ſo princely, your popiſh, or rather pompous Canon Lawe iuriſdiction, whiche con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in Courtly conſiſtories, &amp; Forinſecall iudgements, farre diſagreynge from the right iuriſdiction of true and Chriſtianlike Prelates, they ſhal not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende eſcape the deſerued maledictions, and curſes threatned to ſuch by the Prophet Ezechiel. Chryſoſtome in the homily by you ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted condemning the preſumptuouſnes of the kinge <hi>Ozias,</hi> in enterpriſing to offer incenſe, whiche belonged by Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement onely to the Prieſt, doth compare the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect or matter of bothe their Myniſteries togeather, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge, that the Prieſtly dignity reſpectinge the matter whereabout it is exerciſed, whiche is heauenly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, doth farre excéede the other, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the matter thereof is but earthly and outwarde. His woordes maketh his meaninge plaine: <hi>The kingly throne</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of earthly thinges, and hath not beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de this power, any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther authority. But the throne of the Prieſt is placed in heauen, and he hath authority to pronounce of heauenly buſineſſes, who ſaithe theſe thinges? the kinge of heauen him ſelfe: what ſo euer yee binde vppon earthe, ſhalbe bounde in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo: and what ſo euer ye lowſe on earth, ſhalbe lowſed in heauen alſo, what may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared with this honour?

               <p>Now ſith in al theſe obiections hitherto, ye haue brought foorthe nothinge at all, that eyther made not againſte your ſelfe, or that maketh any whitte for you, it is more then time yée drawe to Concluſion, and bycauſe no good Concluſion, can followe of euill premiſſes, yée were dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to conclude, &amp; finiſhe vp your obiection with the like patchinge, wreſtinge and falſifiynge your Authours, as yee did before: and therefore in the Concluſion, like to him, that hauinge no right to any, claymed all, to obteine ſomewhat at the leaſt: Euen ſo you, to prooue that your Biſhops, and prieſtes haue al iuriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical, alleage a peece of a ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence out of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> which barely by it ſelfe recited, géeueth not onely all that vnto the Biſhop but al thinges belonginge to the Church beſides, and that no man may do any thinge, not ſo muche as toll a bell to ſeruice, or ſweepe the Church, but onely the Biſhop muſt dooe all alone. Whiche concluſion ſome of your complices would ſo litle allowe, as thoſe whom yee would ouerbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and yee your ſelfe might go play you, as one that had naught to doo, in any thinge perteining to the Churche. But to helpe the matter, and to make <hi>Ignatius</hi> woordes plaine without abſurditie, you muſt take with you the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of the ſentence that followeth, which yee leaue out, of <hi>The Sacrament of Thankeſgeuinge,</hi> and <hi>Celebratinge the Diuine Seruice,</hi> and then it ſhall eaſily appeare, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of ſuche dooinges of a Biſhop, as in déede declare his function &amp; office, &amp; yet furthereth no whit the Concluſion
<pb facs="tcp:4439:131"/>
of your obiection. So that your Concluſion beynge yet as inſufficient as the reſt, you are faine to adioyne an other péece thereunto: Wherein although yee ſhewe howe euill a ioygner you bee, to adioygne thoſe two péeces of ſentences togeather in one Concluſion, that are of cleane ſundry matters, yet in one poynte yee haue made them bothe agree, that as yee wreſted the one, ſo ye not onely wreſt, but flatly falſifie the other, and yet neither of them bothe ſtande you in any ſteade, to helpe your obiection, muche leſſe to conclude the ſame. For fyrſt, how dooth this followe: <hi>S. Auguſtine ſaith</hi> (ſay you) <hi>of the Doctours of the Churche: That they beleeue, I beleeue: that they holde, I holde: that they teache, I teache: that they preache, I preache: yeelde to them, and thou ſhalte yelde to me. Ergo,</hi> Biſhoppes and Prieſtes haue power and authoritie to make lawes, orders, and Decrees, and to vſe all cohibitiue iuriſdiction ouer their flockes and cures. Nowe if your freendes that haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued hitherto as you beleeue, haue helde as you holde, taught as you teache, preache as you preache, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge the vpright dealinge and conſcience, that you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende, haue yelded vnto you herein, do but a litle examine your falſe dealing with thoſe Fathers, whom you would ſeeme ſo wholy to folowe, I thinke they woulde no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger beleeue you, holde with you, nor yelde vnto you, but ſuſpecte you as a deepe diſſembler, or rather abhorre you, as an open ſclaunderer and belyer, not onely of me, but of the auncient Fathers them ſelues. For firſte I woulde learne of you, where S. Auguſtine hath thoſe woordes, in all his ſixe bookes againſt Iulian, <hi>Iſtis cede &amp; mihi cedes,</hi> if he haue them, ſhewe where: if he haue them not, then howe dooe ye followe S. Auguſtine? Howe dare you impudently ſaye, ye preache and teache that he did, when ye manifeſtly mangle, alter, peruert, and corrupt the ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4439:131"/>
that he did teache. In deede for faſhions ſake ye cite a péece of S. Auguſtines ſentence, <hi>that they beleue I beleeue,</hi> &amp;c. but for that which followeth <hi>iſtis cede &amp; me non cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: yelde to them and thou ſhalt not ſtrike or whippe me:</hi> you haue put in theſe woordes, <hi>iſtis cede &amp; mihi cedes, yelde to them and thou ſhalt yelde to me:</hi> and yet this corrupting of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence maketh it ſerue no whit the more for your purpoſe, but vttereth your falſhood: that belike will not ſpare to corrupt that whiche maketh flat againſt you, that thus vſe to corrupt this, which maketh neither to nor fro with you, nor againſt me. But as S. Auguſtine writinge in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame matter againſt Iulian, a Diſciple of Pelagius, an Engliſhe Monke, dealing with S. Auguſtine, as ye haue doon with me, ſaide to Iulian: ſo ſaye I to you. <hi>Ye feine me</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>to ſaie that I ſaie not, to conclude that I conclude not, to graunte that I graunte not, and you conclude to your ſelfe that whiche I denie, &amp;c. In deede you haue laboured more to finde out thoſe reaſons whiche ye</hi>

                  <hi>might better vtter againſt your ſelfe than againſt me. But in ſuche a cauſe ye ſhould not neede to take ſuche peines, if you had any ſhame in you.</hi> S. Auguſtine in theſe bookes againſt Iulian, as in his other againſt the Donatiſtes, (as I haue declared before) did attribute vnto the Emperours and Princes, the Biſhoppes and Prieſtes, ſuche Eccleſiaſticall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction as I haue doone.

               <p>You deliuered this obiection vnto me in writinge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte Eaſter and Whitſontide, about the ende of April: within two daies folowinge, when I had redde the ſame, I tould you, that in the collection of your common places, you were muche abuſed, for that you had miſtaken them, and obſerued no iuſte circumſtances of the authorities, whereby to haue knowen the authours meaninge: And ſo wée continued in debatinge and reaſoninge, from time to time, about this matter of Iuriſdiction, and others, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the beginning of September folowinge, before which time, your obſtinacy grewe ſo muche, that I was forced, through your vnorderly behauiour, to reſtreigne you of your licentious talke, and ſequeſter you from conference with any, hauinge ſo muche before abuſed your ſelfe, and eſpecially in mine abſence, and I was the rather moued ſo to doo, for that I perceiued all that I did, was but in vaine: as at diuerſe times and often, I repeated that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

you, obſtinately bente to the contrary, meaninge by ſuche ſtouteneſſe to recouer your credite, which through your inconſtancie was ſo empaired amongeſt your frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. I ſaide, at your firſte comminge, and many times after, you beynge ſente by the Honourable Councell, that you were welcome, whiche by good proufe, although vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly without any your good deſerte, yée founde true. I did ſay, that I woulde leaue to haue any further talke or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with you, touchinge matters of Religion, or any other: but you ſhoulde haue ſhewed the time and place, where, and when theſe woordes were ſpoken: I ſpake them the Sunday at after diner, when in your gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I did reprooue you of your diſorders, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreigned you of ſuche libertie, as before yee had enioyed. The promiſe made vnto you, not to vtter that whiche yee ſhoulde ſay by way of reaſoninge, in preiudize of the Q.

                  <hi>The perfourminge of his promiſe vvas as hereafter folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveth. Firſt there vvas a rumour ſperced abroade very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after by his ſeruantes, that I had ſubſcribed to certaine Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nne in number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seconde, there vvas by his ſeruantes a further rumour rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, of my recantation, tyme and place appointed therof to be at the Pariſhe Churche of VValtham, vvhere his L. did then manure and abide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdely, his L. did at his open table, and in the praeſence of many, chardge me vvith the change of my Religion nine times, and beinge put in further reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance by one M. Denny vvho vvas a Sogener vvith him, his L. ſaide, that I had altered and changed my Religion, not onely nine times, but nineteene</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4439:134"/>
                  <hi>times, and that I vvas of no Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourth, his L. did permitte the ſaide M. Denny at his open table toto muche to abuſe me. VVhere the ſaide M. Denny did openly and before many, chardge me vvith theſe three crimes follovvyng, Firſt vvith incontinency of life, thus ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge: That if I had not as many children as he, he did knovve that I had deſerued to haue ſo many. Seconde vvith Gluttony, affirminge that I vvas an Epicure. Third and laſte vvith Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryſie, and that I vvas a great diſſembler and an Ipocrite. The ſaide M. Denny beyng a man to me vvholly vnknovven. His L. did ſhevve him ſelfe openly to be ſo vvell pleaſed vvith theſe his ſlaunderours vvoordes, that he myniſtred iuſte occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for me to thinke that his L. had procured the ſaid M. Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thereunto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifth, by ſo muche the more, I had good cauſe to thinke ſo, for that his L. did immediatly thereuppon, viz. vvithin one hovver after, in fortifiynge the ſaide talke commaunde me to cloſe impriſonment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixth, and laſte after that he had kepte me ſixe vveekes in cloſe impriſonment, by his L. complainte I am novve at this preſent pryſoner in the Tovver, muche contrary to his promiſe before made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The premiſſes beyng true (like as they are all moſte true) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng to openly committed and before to many vvitneſſes to be denied. Your honour may eaſily iudge vvith vvhat vviſdome, diſcrecion, and charity I haue beene vſed, I being a poore man, the Q. Maieſties priſonner and to his L. committed (I dare boldely affirme) to be vvell vſed. It vvas very ſtraunge to me to ſee ſuche behauiour openly ſhevved at the table of ſuche a man. Surely for mine ovvne parte, I vvas neuer ſo vſed, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther openly or priuately at any mans table before in my vvhole life. My hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble ſute therfore vnto your honour is, that proufe and triall may be had of my trueth herein, and vvhat my deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinges hath beene for the vvhole time of my abode there. In due ſearch and examinacion hereof I doubt not but there ſhal fall out matter betvvixte vs, either of muche ſimplicitie and trueth, or els of great crafte and falſehoode, either of honeſt, vertuous, and godly, or els diſhoneſt, vicious, and vngodly v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and either of muche light, learninge, and knovvledge, or els of very groſſe ignoraunce, and palpable darkenes, let it fall</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:4439:134"/>
                  <hi>and light on the vvhiche ſide it ſhall happe, vppon the triall and examination made, I doubt not by Goddes helpe, but that your honour ſhall haue a full ſhevve and a ſufficient proufe made of euery thinge that hath paſſed betvveene vs. There may be deniall made for a ſhifte and ſome ſhorte time, but for any longe time it may not poſsible endure, euery thinge being ſo openly committed and done, ſo diuerſe and many beinge of knovvledge and vvitnes thereof.</hi>

               <speaker>The B. of Wyncheſter.</speaker>
               <p>To this challendge of promiſe breache, in theſe ſixe pointes: Truely I know not of any rumour ſpredde of you, by any of my ſeruauntes, or otherwiſe that yée ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to any Articles, ne, yet euer herde any thing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, before I ſawe the ſame reporte in your booke publiſhed: And if any ſuche rumour were ſpredde by any my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes or other, you ſhoulde haue named him, that he might receiue condigne puniſhment therefore.</p>
               <p>Seconde, as to the further rumour of your Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſay likewiſe I vnderſtoode nothinge but by your owne reporte in your booke, and therefore referringe the Authour to be puniſhed accordingly, I thinke the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to light vppon your ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as to my chardge of your changynge in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. ix. times, yée. xix. times, I ſaid ſo and that truely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon proufe of your vnconſtant affirminge and denying, not ſo fewe times, as I had good experience oft in you, and can haue witnes in the ſame.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, touchinge your abuſing by M. Denny, yée miſreporte the Gentleman, as to any thinge that euer was ſpoken before me. But if any ſuche were, it was as I herde ſay at my retourne home (for I was abroade in preachynge whan ſuche ſcoffinge talke was betwixte you) by occaſion of ſome talke myniſtred on your parte to
<pb facs="tcp:4439:135"/>
M. Denny, partely by waie of merie talke betwixte you twaine, &amp; partely ſturred vp by your vnſéemely woord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and yet none of all theſe in my hearinge. But in the laſt date, whan I reſtraigned your libertie, you did ſo much before me at my table prouoke the ſaide gentleman by calling him Epicure, for that he faſted not as ye ſaide, that I, fearing leaſt M. Denny like a younge man ſhould geue ſome euil woords againe, willed him to ſay nothing, for that I my ſelfe woulde anſweare the matter for him: Mine anſweare was, that I meruailed why you woulde call him Epicure: for if you ſo thought, becauſe he did eate fleaſhe, &amp; neuer fyſhe, I ſaide, he might ſo well faſt with fleaſhe, as with fiſhe: but if it were for that he vſed not abſtinency, I ſaide in that M. Denny did more then you: for where you had euery daie in the wéeke your thrée mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, frydaie and other, the gentleman was contented thrée daies in a weeke, with one meale a daie, and neuer dyd eate aboue two. And as it is vntrue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> either M. Denny was a man to you vtterly vnknowen, beynge conuerſant togeather in one houſe a quarter of a yeere before, and in familiar company, yea ſought many times by you to play at the bowles, to walke in the parke, &amp; to be mery togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo is it alſo vntrue, that I hearde you ſo abuſed as I coulde or did like therein, and ſo vntruely dooe you ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that I ſhoulde procure M. Denny, by any meanes to abuſe you, as yee malitiouſely conceiue of me.</p>
               <p>Fiftely, as to the reſtrainte of your liberty, whiche you cal cloſe impriſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment, to haue ben for theſe talkes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte M. Denny and you, within one howre after: You knowe right well, that your reſtrainte was not vppon that occaſion, but vpon your ſeemely behauiour aboute other matters, whereof ye make no mention, leaſt you ſhoulde haue prooued your ſelfe a Lyer. After I had in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4439:135"/>
fewe woordes calmed the ſtorme that ſéemed would aryſe betwixt M. Denny and you. I entred into talke with you in matters of Religion, as I was wont to doo daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The talke was of veniall &amp; mortall ſinne: you haue not forgotten the occaſion, I am ſure: for if you haue in your remembraunce the Monkiſh Iebuſites, you cal them Ieſuytes, you may remember that a croſſe that came from them, gaue the occaſion of the talke in that matter. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that no ſinne is ſo veniall as it coulde be remitted by any ceremony: yea, there is no ſinne but the ſame of it ſelfe is mortall, and yet venyall, to be purged by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Chriſte onely: and that all ſinnes, were they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo mortall, were neuertheleſſe venyal, ſauing al only the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, whiche is irremiſſible. For this my ſaiyng, and other pointes whiche I condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ye fell into ſuche a rage, that ye not onely rayled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Biſhop of Sariſbury, ſaiynge: he was vtterly vnlearned, and that he ſhould neuer be hable to anſwere M. Hardinges booke, but alſo openly called me almoſte in plaine termes Heretique, and ſaid, <hi>my doctrine which I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched</hi> (yet ye would neuer heare me) <hi>was erroneous, filihy, and blaſphemous:</hi> ſo filthely your blaſphemous mouth, coulde raile againſt Gods truthe. Whereupon, I, to ſtate you, ſaid alonely that thoſe were vnmannerly wordes to be ſpoken at myne owne table: and therfore would as than ſaye no more openly vnto you there, but tolde you that after dyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I would ſhewe you more of my minde, betwixt you &amp; me. And ſo ſhortly after dinner, I came vp to you, and there calling you into the Gallorie of my houſe, adioyning to your chamber, I put you in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce of that which I had before oftentimes admoniſhed you, of your outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous talke in myne abſence, vſed oftentimes openly at my table, whereof I had ſondry tymes geuen you warninge,
<pb facs="tcp:4439:136"/>
for that the ſame might breede perill to your ſelfe, blame to me, and offence to others. And bicauſe I founde ſtil the continuance of that your miſorder: yea, to be muche more vehement many times in mine abſence than in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: Therfore I willed you thenceforth to abſteine from conferring with any man in any wiſe at all, adding that you ſhould haue to your chamber, all thinges neceſſary, &amp; what meate you woulde competently appointe for your owne diet, whiche ye had accordingly. And although I did reſtraine you from comming to my table, or to goe ſo muche at large as you had doon: yet had you no other ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than you had before, which was your owne man: you had a faire Gallory adioyning to your chamber, openinge to my parke, your ſeruaunt a chamber by him ſelfe, nexte to yours, ye had Leades faire and large, on the whiche ye might walke, and haue proſpect bothe ouer the Parkes, Gardeins, and Orchardes. And therewith thriſe in the weake at the leaſt, whiles I laye at Waltham, with one by me appointed, you walked abroade into the Parkes, Garden, and Orchard: and this you call your cloſe empri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment. Sixthly, touching my complaint to the moſt honourable of you, whereby you were remitted priſoner againe to the Tower, what the ſame was, their honours can well declare, if their pleaſure ſo be: beinge ſuer that I haue not broken promiſe with you hetherto, in vttering your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the Lawes of the Realme, as I haue before ſaid, whiche ye ſhewed at any time in the priuate conference. And ſo ye haue not any cauſe to challenge me in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>To conclude, by the premiſſes it may appeare to the honourable as by a taſt, what ſinceritie there is in you. Againe, that this your quarreling and beliynge me by ſpreadyng this booke, was and is chiefly, to recouer your
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:4439:136"/>
credit with thoſe of your faction: who as I haue ſaid, had conceiued ſome doubt of your reuolt, and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme them in their grounded errour, and herewith to bring me and other ſuche as I am, into obloquy and hatred. And laſtly, to impugne &amp; barke againſt the Q. Maieſties Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and due authoritie, whiche you and your complices daily labour to ſubuert: which matter I referre to be further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, by the graue wiſdome of the moſte honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
