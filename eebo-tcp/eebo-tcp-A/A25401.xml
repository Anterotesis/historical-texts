            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat such anciently were the manners
of men, and such the times, wherein
the condition of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> was
sumptuous, and most flourishing, not
onely with those truly excellent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of <hi>Learning,</hi> but also with
those of <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Preferments, History
the witness of Truth</hi> is a sufficient evidence: Among the
<hi>Heathen, Theophr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>stus</hi> is my Author,<note place="margin">L. 9. de Plantis, c. 4.</note> That in stead of the
<hi>Tithe</hi> (wherin notwithstanding we take our selves to be
very bountiful) the <hi>thirds</hi> were paid. Among the <hi>Iews,
Philo</hi> reporteth, That the wealth of the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rban</hi> was
oftimes the object of envy to the neighboring <hi>Kings.</hi>
Among the <hi>Christians,</hi> as in other Nations, so truly in
this our, it is certain, That the desire to increase the
Revenue of the <hi>Clergy</hi> proceeded to such a height, that
it was greatly to be feared, lest the <hi>Church</hi> should swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
up the <hi>Common-wealth:</hi> That therefore it was sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
taken into consideration <hi>then,</hi> (and so is <hi>now,</hi>
when there is little need of caution) that no Lands
should be bequeathed in <hi>Mortmane, i. e.</hi> to <hi>sacred uses,</hi>
without the <hi>Royal Patent.</hi> Such anciently were the

manners of men, and such the times. While mens
manners, and the times were such, a disputation touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the right of Tithes was nor doubtful, nor necessary.
But at length in this our age, when, as commonly old
men so, the world growing old, is wholly set upon
money, there is a general <hi>chiragra,</hi> an epidemical <hi>Gout</hi>
in the <hi>hand.</hi> There are no improvements to the <hi>Clergy,</hi>
would that were all: there are frequent impairings. I
say, frequent impairings; and I wish it might onely be
said, there <hi>are;</hi> and that there might never be cause of
using the <hi>future tense.</hi> But to this humor of the present
age, (wherein, what for that <hi>unholy hunger after gold,</hi>
there is nothing esteemed Holy) we may adde another
Error, That those <hi>Worthies,</hi> not to be named without
all honorable respect, whose help God made use of for
the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> were very solicitous for the
<hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but less attended the <hi>Churches

as they, who thought they should finde the <hi>Baptist</hi> in

<hi>Abraham</hi> there, were both deceived.</p>
            <p>Which Error, though a small one, (and a small one
indeed it is, if we compare it with those great and
famous acts performed by them) yet, we may justly
fear, will lie heavy upon succeeding Ages; an which
true-hearted honest men (from that of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 14 4</note>

worse, which I will not speak of; falsly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance,
and I pray God it prove so. but not rashly, I
am sure, not without cause. And indeed they ought to
have <hi>withstood the beginings</hi> (as we say) and have snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this sweet bit from this eating and drinking Age,
which perverts all to most detestable use; and have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48668:3"/>
taken care not onely of <hi>increasing the light,</hi> but also of
<hi>allowing oil.</hi> Which because not done, this evil spreds
daily more and more, and the <hi>devourers</hi> of <hi>Church-Revenues</hi>
whisper up and down in corners, as most an
end the maner is, that the <hi>Church</hi> may be impleaded
and sued for the remainder of <hi>Tithes;</hi> and thereupon
finde out new quirks to put <hi>Her</hi> in a worse condition;
then, talk of a stipend: Finally, so turn themselves on
all sides, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> may at last say it to their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<hi>Their sowing or their mowing is nothing to us.</hi> To pass
by <hi>other things,</hi> as lost and gone by <hi>prescription,</hi> I shall
make bold to plead for <hi>Tithes</hi> and shall thereupon chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
them, who are otherwise minded, and prove that
the Tithes, of the yeerly comings in, are by the highest
equity due to the <hi>Clergy;</hi> and that no <hi>Parliaments,</hi> no
<hi>Lords</hi> or <hi>Commons</hi> can settle that affair more wisely, then
it was of old provided for by the <hi>Sacred Law;</hi> then
<hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Lawyer himself.</hi> (so absolute, that <hi>Iustinian</hi> is no

whose candle I shall light mine: wherefore it will be

is of no force, and the <hi>Apostle</hi> puts a trick upon
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> when he compares the <hi>Levites</hi> with <hi>him.</hi>
For the reason is not alike: The <hi>Levites</hi> require <hi>their
Titbe</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> for <hi>they</hi> have a <hi>commandment</hi> to take <hi>Tithe</hi>
of the people:<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 5.</note>
                  <hi>Melchisedek his,</hi> because <hi>Abraham would,</hi>
not because <hi>he ought.</hi> Again, if this service were <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> and <hi>free, Melchisedek</hi> were no with better then
<hi>Abraham.</hi> For what hindereth but that I may debase

                     </gap>?</hi> My <hi>civility</hi> indeed would be the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
But if, upon both these considerations, this
were absurd, it follows that <hi>he</hi> paid <hi>Tithe</hi> not as a <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,</hi>
but as they were due by <hi>Law.</hi> Concerning the <hi>Law</hi>
then, I demand again; By what <hi>Law?</hi> Not of <hi>Sacrifice;</hi>
for <hi>he</hi> offered none: of <hi>Blessing</hi> then, it's clear. For
there is a coherence betwixt these two; <hi>Melchisedek
blessed,</hi> and <hi>Abraham paid Tithe.</hi> Now I assume. Tithes
are due to <hi>Mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hisedek blessing.</hi> The same <hi>right</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
under <hi>Christ.</hi> How can that be made to appear?
Out of the 12. verse of the 7. Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
There is no <hi>change</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> but by the <hi>change</hi> of the
<hi>Priesthood.</hi> But there is the same <hi>Priesthood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
of <hi>Melchisedek;</hi> for which, if need be, <hi>God himself</hi> will
give us <hi>his oath.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 110 4.</note> Therefore there is the same <hi>right</hi> under
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48668:4"/>
both. Tithes therefore are due to <hi>Christ,</hi> in whom, and
from whom, and by whom <hi>we</hi> are all <hi>blessed: He himself
blessed</hi> for ever. Which, it is but equal, that <hi>they</hi> should
receive in the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Christ, who</hi> bless us in the <hi>name</hi> of
<hi>Christ.</hi> For even <hi>Melchisedeks blessing</hi> was but from <hi>man,</hi>
though in the <hi>person</hi> and <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> Therefore the
<hi>right</hi> of <hi>Tithes</hi> remaineth under <hi>Christ.</hi>

unfortunate a genius, under so unhappy a planet, as to
say, that <hi>Tithes</hi> were paid to <hi>Melchisedek</hi> as a <hi>King.</hi> But
I have found one that saith so; see you, how without
all reason. 1. The <hi>Levites</hi> have <hi>right</hi> to <hi>Tithes:</hi> They
have, as <hi>Gods Vicars:</hi> 'Tis true, they are: But are they
<hi>Gods Vicars:</hi> as <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>King?</hi> O what a multitude of
<hi>Kings</hi> should we have! 2. <hi>Moses</hi> saith not that Tithes
were paid to <hi>him</hi> as making a <hi>royal banquet,</hi> but as <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;</hi>
which not with standing should have been said, if
they had been paid to <hi>him,</hi> under that notion, as <hi>symbols</hi>
of <hi>that power.</hi> 3. The <hi>Apostle,</hi> upon that payment of
<hi>Tithes,</hi> grounds not <hi>his Kingdom,</hi> but <hi>his Priesthood.</hi> 4. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there are as many <hi>Adversaries</hi> to that opinion, as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters:</hi>
even the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

gloss is [<hi>because he was a Priest</hi>] therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> gave
<hi>him Tithe.</hi> You see the force of the Argument: And
this you likewise see, that, whatever is brought against
it, comes miserably short.</p>
               <p>I shall pass from <hi>Abraham;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Argu. 2.</note> and yet not far. My
next reason shall be from <hi>

                        <desc>•••</desc>

of the <hi>faithful,</hi> from whom we received the sirname of
the <hi>Israel</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> and of <hi>whom,</hi> I doubt not, but, what
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> concerning <hi>Sara,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 6.</note> (as she obeved)</hi> the like will
you conclude.<note place="margin">Gen 28. 20, 21, 22.</note> He therefore, vows a vow. If <hi>the Lord
will be with me, and keep me, and will give me bread to eat,
and taiment to put on: Then, of all that he shall give me, I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48668:5"/>
will surely give the Tithe to him.</hi> You will grant, I know,
that this was no Will-worship; for then <hi>Iacob</hi> should
have <hi>vowed,</hi> what the <hi>Lord</hi> had disavowed. Therefore,
doubtless, he relied upon the <hi>Divine Will:</hi> the <hi>command</hi>
is the interpreter of that <hi>will.</hi> Moreover, the reason of
the <hi>command</hi> must necessarily be this: On whom the
Lord shall bestow such favors, as he did on <hi>Iacob,</hi> he
must be bound to the Lord by the same <hi>law:</hi> For, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it were so, the <hi>reason</hi> of the <hi>command</hi> would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain;
and so the <hi>command;</hi> and so the <hi>consequence;</hi>
and so, finally, the <hi>vow</hi> it self. But if this <hi>reason</hi> be full
of <hi>reason,</hi> and the <hi>equity</hi> thereof, as is meet, extend it
self to all; is there any man will deny this Law was

               <p>And this reason may satisfie any <hi>private man,</hi> why <hi>he</hi>

Let all, that give themselves to the <hi>exposition</hi> of the

               <p>I adde this further: Since <hi>Gods blessing</hi> of his <hi>goods</hi> is

there will be the same condition of the <hi>precept:</hi> For it

reason of the precept, such is the precept, it self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third reason is taken from the Prophet <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

some are very earnest to have them, the <hi>Prophets</hi>
would cast them away; would never urge them so
carefully; they would suffer them to wax cold; would
never speak of them so highly. This is not their usual
maner: but, if the <hi>ceremonies</hi> were never so <hi>carefully

                  <hi>Tithes</hi> are to be paid,

                  <hi>Tithes</hi> are

               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48668:6"/>
I pass by Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> as too prolix, who yet was
the first who prosecuted this Argument in his <hi>Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
on the <hi>Prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, because it is an easie matter to finde <hi>Tithes</hi> under
the Law, and the credit of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> is in this
point suspected, go to, let us seek in the <hi>New,</hi> and
set our foot on that ground which seems most slippery
to contest on.</p>
               <p>And first of all I object that place of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Argu. 4.</note>
the words of Christ himself:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>These ought ye to have
done, and not to leave the other undone.</hi> This place I do
not, (for why should I assume that to my self, which
is none of mine?) the <hi>ancient Church</hi> urgeth thus.
Tithes, which Christ himself hath commanded not to
leave undone, the decrees of Princes ought not give
order to leave undone. Now who knows not the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption?
But this Reason hath the greater strength,
because, when, in some places before, the discourse
first; and afterward the practise of washing of hands,
of rubing the ears of Corn, and other <hi>ceremonies</hi> had
been faln upon, Christ, not unwarily, omiteth those
particulars, defendeth their omission of them, and,
which is more to be wondred at, doth himself author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize
the people to omit them. But, concerning this of
Tithe, his words are express, <hi>Ye ought not to leave them
undone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, which is of more weight yet, when the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
was of matters of greatest importance, of <hi>mercy</hi>
and <hi>judgement,</hi> and that in the same <hi>Paragraph</hi> (as I may
say) he makes a law, as for the <hi>doing</hi> of the one, so,
for the <hi>non-omission</hi> of the other. What seek ye more?
No man can easily imagine, in how great esteem this
Argument was with the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall give you two of many. One whereof shall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48668:6"/>
speak for the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> the other for the <hi>Latine.</hi>
Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> his words are these: <hi>Worthily doth our
Saviour adde,</hi> These things ought ye to do; for <hi>Alms</hi> is
a <hi>Tithe.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Homil 73. in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Matth.</note> Now <hi>Alms cannot hurt possibly. For we ought not
to do them,</hi> as observers of the Law; neither doth he
say we ought; But <hi>these things</hi> ought yet to do. <hi>For when
formerly he disputed</hi> of clean and unclean, <hi>He added not
there,</hi> these things ought ye to do: but manifestly he
overthrew them. <hi>Wherefore, Brethren, he speaketh of</hi>
Tithe, These things ought ye to do; <hi>but</hi> concerning
their Washings <hi>he speaketh not so:</hi> The words, as you
see, are a little differing, the sense is not differing.</p>
               <p>Now hear Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his <hi>Enchirid:</hi> to <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
cap.</hi> 76. <hi>Wo be to you,</hi> Pharisees, <hi>who</hi> Tithe every
Herb: As if he would say: <hi>Indeed I exhorted you to</hi> give
Alms, <hi>by which all things would be clean unto you; But wo
to you</hi> who Tithe Herbs. <hi>For these I knew to be your</hi> Alms,
<hi>think not that I admonished you concerning then.</hi> And a
little after (for it would be troublesome to put in all:)
<hi>But lest he should seem to refuse those</hi> Alms, <hi>which are given
of the fruits of the earth,</hi> These (saith he) ye ought to
do, <hi>that is,</hi> Judgement and Charity; and yet, <hi>neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,</hi>
not to omit <hi>the other, that is,</hi> Alms of the fruits of
the Earth. I need adde no gloss.</p>
               <p>I study brevity: and put you in minde of one thing,
(though there be no need, I know, ye observed it) that
Tithes both by S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine</hi> are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the common-place of <hi>Alms.</hi> Some are of another
opinion: I will not greatly contend; for I had rather
it should be accounted a <hi>sacred Tribute,</hi> then <hi>Alms.</hi> But
this place is safe enough: And by it they gain thus
much, that <hi>Tithes</hi> ought not to be abrogated.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to the fifth: <note place="margin">Argu. 5.</note> And, or I am much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
it may be concluded from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> That Tithes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48668:7"/>
are to be retained even under <hi>Christ.</hi>

communication, which was used by <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is
to be imitated in all things, as much as may be, by the

which doth best provide for communication in all good

there will be many Errors; part will be concealed, part
will be substracted; I dare say, there will be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
in <hi>all good things.</hi> Lastly, though all possible
caution be used, the communication of a Pension will
be onely Analogical: But I have learned long since,
and nature, law and reason perswade thus much, that,
where we may have the <hi>Thing it self,</hi> we should not
trouble our selves about the <hi>Analogy:</hi> Wherefore in
the communication betwixt the Pastor and his Flock,
if the truth it self of the <hi>Thing,</hi> of the <hi>Communication,</hi>
may be had in <hi>all good things,</hi> (and it may be had) those
<hi>stipendiary proportions</hi> are not to be <hi>sought after,</hi> or rather
(for that is too little a great deal) are utterly to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</hi>

Further,<note place="margin">Argu. 6.</note> Let this be a sixt Argument. That <hi>Political
Law</hi> concerning <hi>Tithes</hi> did sometime binde the <hi>Church:</hi>
it cannot be denied. But it was never made voide:
Therefore it bindes <hi>now</hi> too. What things were <hi>abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
the <hi>Apostle</hi> sheweth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 14. Those things which
were the middle partition wall, first, betwixt God and
man; secondly, betwixt man and man, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> We are excluded from the first member
of the Division; for God commanded Tithes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they do not displease him. And also from the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for there was peace on all hands, in the point of
<hi>Tithes;</hi> which the <hi>Heathen</hi> did pay annually to <hi>their,</hi>
(as I shall shew anon) as well as the <hi>Iews</hi> to their
<hi>Priests.</hi> But that the other part of the <hi>Political Law</hi>
was excepted, this may be an Argument, because it is
esteemed by King <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 147. 19, 20. a great
blessing: And I shall hardly be brought to beleeve that
the <hi>death</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> deprived us of any blessing. Besides,
if it were wholly cancelled, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> offended against
the Rules of Law, when in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. he brought
a testimony from <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 1. that is, from an <hi>antiquated
Law.</hi> But that controversie runs into another: I will
not prosecute it.</p>
               <p>But this I will,<note place="margin">Argu. 7.</note> out of the seventh to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> verse
eighteenth, which shall be my seventh Argument. And
it is if I mistake not, as a most fair place, so, most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to this Controversie. <hi>There is verily a disanulling
of the commandment going before, for the weakness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableness
thereof.</hi> So that no Law is to be antiquated
or disanulled, which is not either <hi>weak</hi> or <hi>unprofitable.</hi>
The Law concerning Tithes is a Law <hi>going before,</hi> an
ancient Law: Let any man shew me either the <hi>weakness</hi>
or <hi>unprofitableness</hi> thereof, I will joyn hands and grant
the cause; let this Thesis pass the sponge for me. But
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48668:8"/>
this Law hath <hi>strength,</hi> as much as any Law, ever had,
is like to have, can possibly have, from the <hi>Author, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
multitude, custome;</hi> and that, lastly, not the <hi>mute</hi> or
<hi>silent,</hi> but the <hi>express</hi> and <hi>clear approbation</hi> of all Ages.
And its <hi>use</hi> too: for it hath a long time been imployed,
without complaint of any, to that <hi>use,</hi> to which it was
appointed: and, unless the sinews of it had been cut by
certain <hi>Improper Proprietaries,</hi> it had been better imploy'd,
neither would the <hi>Church</hi> have ever complained in that
point.</p>
               <p>On the other side,<note place="margin">Argu. 8.</note> (which shall be my eighth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
with how unhappy success hath it been <hi>changed</hi>
in some places? And where <hi>stipends</hi> are substituted in
lieu of <hi>Tithes,</hi> how many <hi>deceipts, difficulties, complaints?</hi>
How many weaknesses and unprofitablenesses? <hi>This,</hi>
where Tithes are yet intire, may easily induce us to this
opinion, That they ought not to be repealed; and
where they are repealed, that they ought (unless it be
wholly impossible) to be revoked. <hi>Geneva</hi> payeth four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
pounds, a poor matter, God knows; yet it is <hi>Calvins</hi>
complaint in many places of his <hi>Commentaries</hi> (modest
enough, as became him, but loud enough) that the
stipends were but niggardly paid. In the sixt to the
<hi>Galatians,</hi> and the fourty seventh of <hi>Genesis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scotland</hi> also hath exempted it self from <hi>Tithes.</hi> There
is in print a complaint of <hi>Iohn Knox,</hi> exhibited in the
<hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Ministers</hi> to the <hi>Parliament at Edinburgh,
Anno Domini</hi> 1565, <hi>December</hi> 25. When I read the eighth
leaf of it, it pities me for them: I say no more, but
what the Boys use to sing, <hi>Felix quem faciunt, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Those Fathers,<note place="margin">Argu. 9.</note> whom I lately named, provided
much wiser in this point, both for themselves and us. I
come to them. We have had Arguments enough from

holy Scriptures: And there is none of you (I hope)
but will willingly admit the <hi>Practise</hi> of the whole

the dayes are now at hand, in which we ought to gather in
the Harvest, and therefore let us give thanks to</hi> God <hi>who
gave all, and think of</hi> offering, <hi>or rather</hi> paying <hi>our Tithes:</hi>
(and a little after:) <hi>For we offer Tithes of Duty, and he
that will not pay them, takes by force that which belongs to

For he will be a most full witness, as being one who

on the third of the Prophet</hi> Malachi. <hi>(For I pass by</hi> his
Epistle to <hi>Nepotian, where he saith that he lives of
Tithes.) The words are these.</hi> What we said concerning
Tithes, which anciently were paid to the Priests and Levites;
understand that the same ought to be done by the people living
in the Church under the Gospel, to whom it is commanded, not
onely to pay Tithe, but also to sell all and follow the <hi>Lord.</hi>
Which if we will not do, let us at least imitate the <hi>Jews</hi> in
this, to give part of all, and give that which is due unto the

               <p>Very well, all this is true, they say. But the <hi>Church</hi>

they wholly subscribe to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> in
which Tithes are confirmed. Which two things do
sufficiently prove, That both the <hi>payment</hi> of Tithes,
and the <hi>division</hi> of <hi>Parishes</hi> were anciently among <hi>us,</hi>
and that they are not such upstarts, as some fondly have
imagined. About the same time also was a Council
summoned at <hi>Mentz,</hi> in the seventh Chapter whereof,
we read thus. We admonish and command, that Tithes,
which God hath appointed to be paid to him, be in no
case omited to be paid: and they adde this Penalty,
<hi>Whosoever shall after due admonition neglect to pay</hi> Tithes,
<hi>let them be excommunicated.</hi>

<hi>And it concludes thus:</hi> We do therefore ordain
that the ancient custome <hi>of the faithful</hi> be restored. But if
any shall be <hi>obstinate,</hi> let him be for ever separated from the
Members of the <hi>Church. Before that, the first at</hi> Aurange,

the Fourths, or every Fourth yeer the whole. <hi>Tithe</hi> be paid

in the fourteenth Chapter of the</hi> Council <hi>at</hi> Tribur. <hi>It hath
pleased this</hi> Council, That Tithes and all other their possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be preserved to the ancient Churches, as was decreed in
the Holy Council at Chalcedan, cap. 17.</p>
               <p>You have heard the <hi>Councils</hi> speak: and that upon
mature deliberation, disputation, determination; that
they did establish, not define; confirm, not appoint,
Tithes; that they were formerly granted by <hi>private

they went to the <hi>Councils.</hi> For <hi>subscription</hi> in the <hi>first

place. But, there, to proceed distinctly, I shall
divide this one Question into three Members. First,
Whether <hi>Reason</hi> will that there be a <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>

this pass by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> The Ministers of the Gospel

have a power to eat and drink, and not to work: the
Reason. Every Laborer is worthy of his hire. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he cut his own Vine, or feed his own Flock: and,
<hi>the Ox must not be muzzled that treadeth out the Corn.</hi> This
is one degree. Secondly, But if any Laborer, much
more Laborers in the Common-wealth. <hi>Every Souldier
warreth at the publike charge, not at his own.</hi> They that
assist the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> are to be assisted by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
-wealth.</hi> But a <hi>Minister of the Gospel</hi> is a <hi>Laborer</hi> and
<hi>assistant</hi> of the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> This is a second degree.
Thirdly, But if he must be maintained, who is any
way profitable to the <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> He, whose help
<hi>she</hi> useth in <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> things, much more;<note place="margin">In Pryta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeo.</note> and,
if it might be, with such additions of Fortune, as they
use to be honored with, who have deserved well of the
Republike. For all <hi>Reward</hi> is beneath the <hi>merit</hi> of this,
and there is no comparison betwixt <hi>Spiritual sowing,</hi> and
<hi>Carnal reaping.</hi> Wherefore, without doubt, <hi>Carnal</hi>
things are due to them who sow <hi>spiritual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come to the second Member; Whether out of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
yeerly profits? <note place="margin">De Orbis concordia. l. 3. c. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Postellus,</hi> a man of great learning, is of
this opinion, That this is a common principle engrafted
in all by nature, <hi>viz.</hi> That a <hi>certain portion</hi> of the <hi>yeerly
profits</hi> be paid to the <hi>Ministers of the Holy things.</hi> For it
is <hi>just</hi> and <hi>agreeable to reason,</hi> that there be a yeerly <hi>sacred
tribute,</hi> wherewith we should <hi>sacrifice</hi> to God, for the
<hi>increase</hi> of our estate, as we use to keep <hi>anniversary so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities</hi>
in thankfulness. And there is all the Reason in
the world for it: but whether should this be <hi>out of the
profits of the groun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> or <hi>by a pecuniary reward? Reason</hi>
would the former. For in all created things there is the
<hi>image,</hi> and (as I may so speak) the <hi>superscription</hi> of God,
as there is in <hi>Coins</hi> of the <hi>King.</hi> The <hi>tribute</hi> is distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>inscription.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Kings fifteens,</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48668:12"/>
                  <hi>subsidies</hi> (as they call them) have the Royal impression.
The <hi>Divine tribute</hi> is not silver or brass stampt with the
image of a <hi>man,</hi> but of God himself; as there is in all
<hi>Creatures</hi> a <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>Divine power, wisdom, and
mercy.</hi> Of that therefore let the <hi>sacred tribute</hi> be.</p>
               <p>Would you have another? <hi>Reason</hi> will, that the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi>
of the <hi>Gospel</hi> should receive his <hi>reward</hi> that way,
wherein there may be equality of fortune, wherein
the mutual <hi>participation</hi> of plenty and want, of <hi>joy</hi> and
<hi>grief</hi> in common with the people may redound to him.
It is expedient it be so. For is he sustained with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
profits? Is it <hi>fair</hi> weather? <hi>He</hi> is glad, <hi>he</hi> rejoyceth, <hi>he</hi> sings <hi>praise</hi> to God no less willingly, then any <hi>husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi>
for <hi>he</hi> hath <hi>his</hi> share in that <hi>fair</hi> weather. Is it
tempestuous? <hi>He</hi> sighes, <hi>he</hi> groans, <hi>he</hi> falls to <hi>his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
no less fervently, then any <hi>husbandman:</hi> for he
hath his share too in that <hi>tempestuous</hi> weather. Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
and Communion, that great bond of <hi>nature,</hi> of the
<hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and of the <hi>Church,</hi> is conserved and
maintained. On the contrary: Is he sustained by an
<hi>yeerly stipend?</hi> Be there <hi>seasonable showres?</hi> the <hi>people</hi>
rejoyce; <hi>he</hi> rejoyceth not: for (as we said in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining)
<hi>their sowing or their mowing</hi> is nothing to <hi>him.</hi>
Comes there an <hi>unseasonable drought?</hi> The <hi>people</hi> mourn;

to <hi>him. Sympathy,</hi> that great bond of <hi>nature,</hi> of
the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> is dissolved. This
ought not to be so: Wherefore that <hi>Reason</hi> is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I proceed to the third: What part? The tenth.
They say, that the <hi>Positive Law</hi> (for that is their expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
<hi>is the determination of the Law of nature. The Law
of nature</hi> determineth <hi>the death of a murtherer:</hi> but the

                  <hi>Law of nature</hi> determineth a <hi>stipend to him that ministreth

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h,</hi> we grant it not. God
is as careful for our sustenance, as <hi>he</hi> was for the <hi>Levites:</hi>
there was nothing <hi>then</hi> reserved to the <hi>Positive Law;</hi>
nor therefore <hi>now.</hi> This whole point may be dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Reason.</hi> The <hi>Levites</hi> had right to <hi>Tithes:</hi> But <hi>the
Ministry</hi> of the Gospel,<note place="margin">2 Cor 3. 8, 9.</note> as it is more excellent in <hi>nature,</hi>
and more eminent in <hi>dignity,</hi> so, is more profitable in
its <hi>use,</hi> then was theirs. Our people receive <hi>more</hi> and
<hi>greater</hi> benefits from <hi>us;</hi> therefore they ought to pay
<hi>more, Reason</hi> presently insinuates. What a shame is it,
that <hi>Christians,</hi> who owe <hi>more,</hi> should not pay <hi>as much?</hi>
If therefore men would hearken to <hi>Reason,</hi> we might
possibly receive <hi>more ample</hi> fruits; not, likely, <hi>less.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>Tithe</hi> hath all the points of <hi>Equity</hi> in it. It was
<hi>chosen</hi> by God; and so not without great <hi>reason;</hi> and
therefore not, without great <hi>reason,</hi> to be <hi>rejected.</hi> What
is alleaged to the contrary? One or two, I know not
what, scarce worth the name of reasons; not so much
as a <hi>shadow</hi> of what we may call <hi>great reason,</hi> nay indeed
not of any <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>mean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Most equal <hi>and</hi> reasonable <hi>it is in respect of the</hi> constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Excellently Saint</hi> Augustine: For what if <hi>God</hi>
should say, Thou art mine, O man; this Earth, which thou
tillest, is mine; these Seeds, which thou sowest, are mine;
these Beasts, which thou imployest, mine; the Rain and
Showers, mine; the Sun and heat, mine; all mine; thou
which lendest onely thy hand, deservest onely the Tithe; but
I grant nine to thee, give me the Tithe. If thou wilt not
give me the Tithe, I will take away the nine: If thou wilt
give me the Tithe, I will multiply the nine. <hi>Could a more
reasonable Speech possibly be made?</hi>

Out of the second to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the eighth Chapter
and the thirteenth Verse. For then is any thing most
equally disposed, when one is not <hi>eased,</hi> and another
<hi>burthened,</hi> when it is not too <hi>loose</hi> for one, too <hi>stra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Rich</hi> are not spared, the <hi>Poor</hi> are not opprest: which is
the common complaint of the <hi>Edicts</hi> of Princes; the

from the same Authors, that those <hi>Tithes</hi> were never

<hi>Temporal or Lay Office</hi> in the <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> that, at
first, and as long as any thing was held <hi>religious</hi> or <hi>holy,

                  </gap> it is, I know not, but I remember
that <hi>Musculus</hi> relates,<note place="margin">In Gen. c. 14.</note> that, in the first beginings of the

the <hi>Idol-Priests,</hi> and instated on the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the
<hi>Church.</hi> But this is most certain that the <hi>places of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Accounts</hi> of <hi>Tithes,</hi> though in declining times
they fell into the power and possession of <hi>Kings</hi> and
<hi>Princes,</hi> did at first belong to the <hi>Priests.</hi> For when in the
begining the same men were both <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Priests</hi> (as
<hi>Plato</hi> reports of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> of <hi>Anius,</hi>
King <hi>Anius, King</hi> of men, <hi>Apollo's Priest</hi>)
the Priesthood being afterwards, as too hard and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
a <hi>companion,</hi> transfer'd from themselves to
others, they did notwithstanding retain the <hi>Tithe</hi> as a

                  <hi>Samuel</hi> is no description of a <hi>good King,</hi> but a <hi>Tyrant.</hi>
Which makes me wonder the more at them, who
would have the <hi>Levites Tithe</hi> to be part of the <hi>Kings</hi>
Inheritance; and that <hi>Kings</hi> did part with their own
Right, when <hi>Tithes</hi> were confer'd upon the <hi>Church.</hi>
But this falls to the ground by the example of <hi>Mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
