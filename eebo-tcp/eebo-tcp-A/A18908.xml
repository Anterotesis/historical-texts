            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I did so. First into the Low-countries I went, Afterwards into Scotland. After that againe into the Low-countries. Then again into Scotland: And once againe into Netherland, &amp;c. Sometimes haled by this faction, sometimes pulled by that faction. But (the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercifull vnto me) howsoeuer I was notablie distract a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout externall Church-gouernment, yet (as all my printed bookes will testifie) I kept me euer fast vnto the maine point, that is,<note place="margin">The time when, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop by whom he was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral function.</note> vnto the foundation of the Gospell, I had before here receiued: and had in Lancashire for some two yeares pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely ministred, being before (now some nine yeares since) ordained fully thereto by Bishop <hi>Wicham</hi> then Bishop of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colne.</p>

And as the light of the faithfull increaseth till it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect day; so, togither with my last returne for England, the fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie mist was risen and fled, the Sunne of righteousnesse shined vpon me: and that (to the praise of God be it spoken) in such euidence of scripture, as I hope my selfe enabled to draw (as on a table) an euident <hi>Idea</hi> and shape of that miscarying way, if so men will waigh it in simplicitie of spirit.

Secondly, if doctrine and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion distinguish them, then it shall be as verily sinne for the Doctor in his exercise to meddle with exhortation, or for the Pastor to meddle with doctrine, as it was for <hi>Vzzah</hi> an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Leuit to touch the Arke of God (though in a danger to fal) which medling with the Arke distinguished <hi>Aarons</hi> family, from the other two Leuits. Thirdly, then it skilleth not though the Pastor be a man of no learning (for all the learning to speake of, lieth in a deliuerie of the scriptures naturall sense, with a drawing out of his proper doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ines) and to exhort, is so farre inferiour to doctrine, as the application of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine (to a seen sore) doth vtter no such knowledge, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision and composition of the medicine. If they say, the Pastor is to exhort, but not <hi>onely,</hi> he may <hi>also</hi> teach: the like (say I) with as good reason may be spoken of the Doctor, not onely to teach, but principally. Which toyish order of teaching &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting, as no reformed Church abroad is acquainted with it (for they acknowledge no sole Doctor, but of the schooles) so their distinction of <hi>Not onely,</hi> but <hi>principally,</hi> as it may be vsed likewise in the following offices, so let vs see how much it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for them.</p>
            <p>The Elders they distinguish by <hi>Ruling</hi> (from 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.) as the Pastor and Doctor,<note place="margin">Their Lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as fond.</note> by the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>doctrine.</hi> Here say they, are both sorts of Elders: Rulers in the first place, teachers in the second.

If it be replied, that the Pastor and Doctor also are to rule though not principally: so others may aswell reply, the Elders are not onely (though principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to be exercised in Ruledome, for they also may teach. That the Elders might onely rule, not teach; though they make him a Bishop (in english Ouerseer) yet they will vnderstand him vnder the word Deacon: for thus it is in the demonstration of discipline.</p>

            <p>Marke well, how first he maketh two sorts of Bishops (Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Doctors) then two sorts of Deatons; Ouerseers and distributors. First, a right plaine man may obserue, that to make an Ouerseer (or gouerning Elder) to be a Church-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, it is verie ridiculous. Secondly, to make Bishops one in the first diuision, &amp; Ouerseers another in the second diuision: it is to make a difference between <hi>I</hi> and <hi>I</hi>: that is, a difference where none is. For Bishops and Ouerseers are all one: Bishops being the Greeke word, and Ouerseers the English. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision so of the offices, not onely void of diuinitie and art, but also of verie common sense. Yet a correction due to the sons of God, when they seeke to bring in their owne inuentions. But to what purpose haue they thrust the word Ouerseer vnder the word Deacon? Because forsooth in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. they would not vnderstand the office of Elders in the word Bishop: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is there required, that euerie Bishop (or Church ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer) he should be <hi>Apt to teach:</hi> and they would haue Elders of another stampe. Whereas that in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1.2. (together with <hi>Act.</hi> 20.17. where Elders are by vers. 28. expounded O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerseers or Bishops, on all which the Apostle enioyneth teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he before had) it plainly euinceth, that all Ouerseers are to be exercised in teaching. By both which plaine places, that more obscure place in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. (<hi>They that rule well are worthie double honour, specially they that tyre themselues in the word and doctrine</hi>) it must be vnderstood, either of one and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11529:5"/>
the same sort of Elders in the Church; whereof all deseruing well, some (by reason of more trauaile) deserue better: or else (whereto I rather condescend) the first is spoken of Ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers to a particular Church: the latter (for <hi>Kopiontes</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth we ari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that there is no time nor place for the Deacon to preach and baptize, the scripture affordeth not that. The contrarie appeareth in <hi>Philip,</hi> preaching and baptizing in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, before the Apostles came thither to promoue him into an Euangelists place: or yet the Angell had called him to any busines with the Eunuch. Besides, seeing the scripture requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth such a one to hold the mysterie of faith, to be full of the holy ghost, and of wisedome, it plainly argueth, it is, because he may assist in that busines. And seeing (by all probability) those seuen Deacons were of the 70 disciples (for then they were in that Church; and be sure that the people would choose the best) it cannot be auoided, but Deacons must be fitted that way: that so ministring well, they may be preferred in time to a greater degree.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing speech is here of a Parable, it would be considered, first, whether the word carie with it mo senses then one in Canonicall writ: and then, in what sense it is peculiarly vttered.</p>
            <p>For varietie of sense, I rest well resolued in that auncient collection of the Greeke father <hi>Chrysostome:</hi> who vpon the 48. Psalme according to the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gints</hi> or Greeks account (for they ioyne the 9. and 10. Psalms in one; with vs and the Hebrew distinctly two: and then for keeping the number of 150. psalmes, they cut the 147. psalme into two: beginning their 148. with the 12. verse, <hi>Laud the Lord O Ierusalem, &amp;c.</hi> which account the old Latine also obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth) on the same 48. psalme, he collecteth two senses from the olde Testament, according to the <hi>Septuagints</hi> version: and other two senses in the new Testaments Greeke: that is, foure senses in the whole.</p>
            <p>In the olde Testament, he first obserueth it for a <hi>Rebuke</hi> or opprobrie: as where in psalme 44. we read, <hi>Thou hast set vs for a Parable,</hi> that is, for a by-word or marke of rebuke. And in <hi>Iudges</hi> 14.14. it is taken for a <hi>Riddle:</hi> where of <hi>Samson Be-dan</hi> (sprong of <hi>Dan</hi>) it is written, <hi>Out of the eater came sweet, &amp;c.</hi> which in vers. 12. is termed well a Riddle, but in the Greeke, a Parable. In the new Testament lieth other two senses, which <hi>Hysteron proteron</hi> (for methode sake) I rehearse thus. In <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.19. (speech hauing passed of <hi>Abraham</hi> his offering <hi>Isaac</hi>) it is said, <hi>That from the dead he receiued him (En parabole)</hi> in a Parable or type; or (as we haue it well) <hi>after a sort.</hi> The fourth sense is that which here in <hi>Mathew</hi> is vsed, and that is for a <hi>Similitude:</hi> as if he should haue said, <hi>Another similitude Iesus he put forth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</hi> Wherin if we obserue, first the partie which propounds
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11529:7"/>
the parable; then secondly, the parties to whom it is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it shall carrie with it his proprietie of edification.</p>
            <p>The propounder is Iesus, in plaine English, <note n="a" place="margin">Math. 8.21.</note> He that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to saue his people from their sin: appointed by God the father to saue the whole Israel of God. The heroicke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his person (essentially God, essentially man, by true distinction of natures, constituting but one person, Mediatour Christ) it may cause vs with more reuerent attention to listen his similitude. For sentences deliuered by persons of state, they ordinarily stand for Maximes of mightie consequent. And if we consider his inestimable loue towards his people, that may moue vs more: for who will not be vrged by a sweet and trustie friend? But if it be remembred, that he is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our mightie friend, but also <hi>He,</hi> whom the Prophets call <note n="b" place="margin">Isa. 9.6.</note> 
               <hi>Counsailor,</hi> and the <note n="c" place="margin">Pro. 8. &amp; 9. Psa. 104.24.</note> 
               <hi>Wisedome</hi> of God in whom the whole worke of Creation restes, surely, this may be a furtherance, (not onely to attention, but also) to perswasion for a readie receipt of those words of wisedome.</p>
            <p>Touching the parties to whom this Sauiour of ours speaketh, it is the multitude, his disciples not exempted. The Parable vnexpounded, is principally because of the people; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whom the scripture had foretold <note n="d" place="margin">Vers. 14. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>That in hearing they should not vnderstand, and seeing they should not perceiue, because of the fatnes of their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> So that our Sauiour vseth not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables so, but when he hath warrant of scripture: nor fat hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and insensible soules are not so spoken vnto, but when scripture will be so verified vpon them. Our Sauiours enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall speeches may teach vs to obserue the times (and so <hi>Origen</hi> and others do read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Seruing (Kairô) Time,</hi> not <hi>(Kuriô) the Lord</hi>) considering, <note n="e" place="margin">Prou. 25.11.</note> 
               <hi>A word spoken in his place, is like Apples of Gold and pictures of Siluer.</hi> Vnto some, holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries are to be sealed: but vnto leane hearted disciples, and such as will not play the hogs and dogs with pearles, the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mysteries of God are to be reuealed. His truthes are not like <hi>Isis</hi> and <hi>Osyris</hi> mysteries in Aegypt, who are to be locked vp in the bosomes of their sacred priests. Indeed, the priests of spirituall Aegypt do locke vp all from the people in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen

tongue, saying: that <note n="f" place="margin">Hosius de expresso ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo Dei.</note> 
               <hi>The people are swine and dogs, and holy things are not to be giuen vnto them.</hi> But no people are we to terme so, who minister an outward hope (though mixed with infirmitie) of being truly desirous to heare and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, not for cauillation but for edification.</p>
            <p>And seeing a Parable or similitude expounded, it is the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest doctrine or forme of teaching of all others (seeing it hath allusion to common naturall things, where with man is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted) as also, considering with the plainnes there is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence naturall ioyned for beautification thereof vnto the eye of nature; it should teach all ministers herein sometimes to be exercised, as was <hi>Salomon</hi> that great preacher of Israell: for of him (carying a representation of our Iesus) it is thus written: <note n="g" place="margin">Eccle. 12.9.10.</note> 
               <hi>The wiser the preacher, the more he taught the people knowledge, and caused them to heare, and searched forth and prepared many Parables. The preacher sought to find out pleasant words and an vpright writing, euen the words of truth.</hi> Yet, seeing Parables of themselues doe not naturally conclude or proue, but onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine and illustrate doctrine alreadie proued (euen as in all schooles the axiome runs: <hi>Similia illustrant non probant</hi>: Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies do beautifie, but proue not) therefore Parables must be no further pressed then may be found consonant to the analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie or proportion of faith.

And yet this no cloake for ignorant bablers, who oft speake despitefully of methode; not because they know what it is (for it may be they are void of all Art and learning) but because literature hath no such enemie as ignorance. But let vs come vnto the thing compared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The kingdome of heauen is like, &amp;c.</hi>] To the sense of these words, first seuerally, then ioyntly. The word <hi>Kingdome</hi> (as is also the Hebrew and Greeke) it is deriued of the word <hi>King,</hi> as being the thing where abouts a <hi>King</hi> is exercised. And which more is, I take it to be compounded of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Doome,</hi> (and so by contraction <hi>Kingdome</hi>) because hereabouts a King doth exercise his doome or iudgement. Vnto which kingdomes Constitution is required, first a <hi>King</hi>; secondly a <hi>People</hi>; thirdly <hi>Doome,</hi> iudgements or lawes; fourthly, an <hi>Execution</hi> therof ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to equitie.

The first Preacher of this phrase, it is <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> in this present gospell, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.2. where he cries, <hi>Repent, for the kingdome of heauen is at hand.</hi> In which speech he hath relation vnto that kingdome whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.14. giuen by the ancient of daies vnto <hi>One</hi> like the sonne of Man: which in <hi>vers.</hi> 22. &amp; 27. he communicates with the Saints of the most high, a kingdome after the receipt and possession thereof, appointed to endure for euer. Whereunto if we adde that to the Hebrewes, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the remouall of the olde heauens and earth (that is,<note n="q" place="margin">Heb. 12.27.28.</note> of the Iewish Church and pollicie) that so a new kingdome might be receiued of the faithfull that should neuer be shaken, it shall so appeare euidently, that the kingdome of heauen here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, it is no other thing then the state of the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Church, whereto <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> prepared the way, and baptized. Yea, that this conclusion is Catholike and subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto of all, euerie one that is read, can well enough testifie.</p>
            <p>The state of new Testaments Church it being so called, we therby may collect the grosse darkned iudgement of the world, who takes it rather for a kingdome of hell, then of heauen: and the rather because the appendices of this kingdome or Commonwealth are like to Iesus incarnate: that is, <note n="r" place="margin">Isa. 53.2.3.</note>

As the son of man did not sow his children but by begetting them through the doctrine of truth; so the diuell
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:11529:14"/>
doth not create or sow these his children, but by causing them to be such through the doctrine of vntruth. And this his fact of vnhappines is said to be done of him while men slept, that is, while the Church (and specially the Ministers thereof) they were secure and watched not. The Apostle <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 20.28.29. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> knowing by faith in this doctrine, that after his departure Wolues would enter into his Church (yea, that of their owne selues some should arise, speaking peruerse things for drawing disciples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them) he tels them the way of preuenting this euill, namely, that they should watch ouer themselues, and ouer the flocke (for God neuer exacteth our seeking his glorie (nor can we) by the neglect of our owne soules: though some would closely teach the contrarie, namely, that they might doe euill to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues that so good might come thereof, whose damnation is due) for drowsie sleepines (which after came to passe) it would cause confusion enter and arise to the disturbance of all good.</p>
            <p>That it is said, the diuell soweth this tarish doctrine (though he doth it onely by his ministers) we must maruell thereat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all.

            <p>It is euer accorded vpon, that the Tares are wicked-ones, but what kind of wicked-ones, as also whether within the Church or without, therein is much dissonancie. Libertines say, that they are the whole bodie of wicked people in the Church: and so from our Sauiours speech (<hi>Let them grow</hi>) they would haue all excommunication ouerthrowen, and all wicked that wil, be admitted vnto the holy supper. Others, that they be heretikes, who are to be permitted of the Magistrate, if so happily they may become wheat by repentance. Others, (whereof here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after)

they vnderstand them to be such wicked only as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of godly pollicie: that is, not for loue to them, but to the wheat or children of the kingdome. Touching their place, the Browniste affirmes them to be without the Church; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our Sauiour saith, <hi>Let them alone:</hi> applying the Apostles speech thereto, <note n="q" place="margin">1.

               </gap>nough appeareth, that so verily as the wheat appeared, so verily the Tares appeared. The children of the kingdome appearing such by their fruit, the children of Sathan that way appearing also. Nor appeares this lesse in this, that the Ministers after are grieued at the <hi>Sight</hi> of them: and for that doe interrogate, if so they may pull them vp? If they had been without, it would not so haue troubled the minds of those that were within: and if they had been hypocrites or inuisible wicked, it could not haue troubled them at all. Those errors are by the Parable it selfe plainely ouerturned. But more plainely (if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) it shall appeare by conference of other scriptures. when as I come to examine our Sauiours words, <hi>Let both grow together, &amp;c.</hi> Meane time obserue, that two sundrie seeds are sowen, &amp; thereof ariseth two sundry sort of people within the Church. The first not onely <hi>within</hi> the Church, but <hi>of it</hi> also: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore termed children of the kingdome. The other <hi>within</hi> the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:11529:15"/>
Church, but <hi>not of it,</hi> and therfore termed children of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Contrarie seeds, so haue contrarie effectes. The house of <hi>Cloë</hi> in Corinth, by the fruit shewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to be true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; others by vnbeleeuing the resurrection did show them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be troublous members: or rather a corrupt humour in the bodie that deserued to be purged. And surely, as we would be deemed followers of the sonne of man in a care of planting good, so we must endeuour our selues to sow onely good seed. If we come into pulpit with vnresolued opinions, we must leaue behind vs an vnresolued people, staggring, reeling and caried away with euerie wind of doctrine. But if we sow tarish doctrine in the pulpit, let vs know that the diuell will water it blade and fruit. If we will watch ouer the flocke, we must first watch ouer our selues: yea, take heed to our tongue, least it be set on fire from hell, and so conuert the Churches peace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a flame.</p>
            <p>Who would haue thought that Sadduces (deniers of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) should haue appeared in the Church of <hi>Iudah?</hi> But the Leuites (some of them) leauing the altar, and betaking them <note n="t" place="margin">For this doe read the state of Maccabees in <hi>Ben-Gorion.</hi>
               </note> to <hi>Iudahs</hi> crowne and scepter, the Lord therefore did punish them with vnbeliefe, who should haue taught others the true beliefe. Who would haue thought that in the Asian Christian Churches such notable heresies could haue risen? who would haue thought that in our Brittaine Churches so many horrours should haue risen? But it is not to be wondred at: first because our Sauiour foresaw and forespake hereof, when as he thus as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similated his kingdome of heauen. Not saying it should be so in the world, but it should be so in the Church. Secondly, as through other Churches, so through ours this sleepie ministery hath passed, wherby an entrance hath been made, &amp; a way pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto an Ocean of euils. And that which worse is (of those that would be deemed Reformers) many proue Deformers: and if in zeale they haue once stepped ouer shoes, they count it credit rather for Constancie sake to slosh in ouer boots, then with <hi>Augustine</hi> to write a booke of Retractations; or with <note n="v" place="margin">2.

Let the secret Pharisaicall practices of some witnes that, euen what time I was publikely (to the comfort of distressed soules) exercised in Southwarke vpon this present parable. But the Lord rebuke Sathan. If I being once ouer-caried with their tarish doctrine, doe now go before them in pointing out, and remouing such scandales (&amp; all this without Magistrates constraint, or worlds allurement, witnesse my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings abroad published before in forraine parts) then let them not thinke scorne or take it for a discredit to follow: least eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie faithfull Minister that commeth after, do both by word and writing cast the doung of their solemne assemblies in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. If they looke to be saued by holding the foundation, they must not be vnwilling to suffer the losse of their timber, hay, and stubble, when the fire of God in his spirit and word do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to burne it. By the practise of the law, our own hand should first be vpon the beast, and this done voluntarily: but if men vpon a good meaning will couer those cattell of <hi>Agag,</hi> yet they shall bleat, crie out and pursue them vnto destruction. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the text.</p>
            <p>Vers. 27. <hi>Then came the seruants of the householder and said vnto him, Master, sowedst thou not good seed <note n="x" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Two questions are propounded by the seruants vnto the householder, whereof this is the first, together with the answer. For the householder or master of the field, it is plaine before to be the sonne of man. Touching the seruants, some take them to be Magistrates in the Commonwealth: some take them to be Ministers in the Church: I vnderstand it to be spoken of both, and so both will well inough fit, first the Analogie and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith; secondly, it accordeth aptly vnto the experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced state of Church and Commonwealth, though principally of Ministers.</p>

do arise: they ouersee the Catholike Church: they spie not onely offensiue things in the world (whereof no maruell) but also in the kingdome or new Testaments Church. They grieue at the sight, and troubled they are in their soule about the present Confusion. All this notably and comfortably lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe, that in those last dayes God would not onely stirre vp zealous Ministers for Church reformation, but also excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Magistrates (as were <hi>Zerubbabel, Nehemiah</hi> and others) for the reformation of Iudah.</p>
            <p>Nor was this vnseene of <hi>Iohn</hi> in Patmos,<note place="margin">Reuela. 17.12 13 14 15 16 17 18.</note> what time the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of God telleth <hi>Iohn</hi> (in the solitarines of his spirit) that the ten hornes (or ciuill powers) which once had subiected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto the whorish Citie (Metropolitane then of the earth) what time they lay asleepe by drinking her spirituall fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they finally should awake, <hi>And hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh and burne her with fire. For God hath put into their hearts to fulfill his will and to do with one consent, for giuing their kingdome vnto the Beast, vntill the words of God be fulfilled.</hi> But those wordes of God (for the time of their sleepe) once fulfilled, they arise (as did <hi>Henry, Edward</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in England) setting fire on the whore for burning vp her abominations. And therefore thrice abominable those spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that by word or writing proclaime them Schismatikes (as do the Papists) or Suborners of the beasts kingdome (as doe blind Reformists, Brownists, Anabaptists and Arrians).</p>
            <p>Touching the Ministers, seeing vnto them the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent charge of the Church is giuen, by how much more those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils creepe in through their predecessours negligence, by so much the more those their successours are stirred vp in an holy fierie zeale for remouing of present euils. Such a one was <note n="z" place="margin">He florished Anno. Dom. 1260.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:11529:16"/>But marke that those seruants of Christ, they trust not to their owne iudgements herein: and therefore, they runne vnto Christ to be enformed, by what meanes all this euill is come. Who, as they seeke to him, so from him they receiue a ready and faithfull answere. Who hauing vnderstood by the word of the Lord, that all this was the worke of Satan in his ministers, what time men lay asleepe in securitie (euen as a Garden so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen and planted with good, it bringeth forth readily weedes of all sorts, after a little time of rest) vpon this assurance;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then the Seruants said vnto him, wilt thou then that wee goe and gather them vp? <hi>29.</hi> But he said, No: least while ye goe about to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Tares, ye plucke vp the wheat with them also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second Interrogatorie and his answere followeth. The question propounded by the same seruants (Magistrates, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, zealous people) the answere is returned by the same Housholder and Master of the Church Christ Iesus. By those holy hearted seruants their second demaund (<hi>Wilt thou that we goe and gather them vp?</hi>) it plainly appeareth, that they not onely were grieued to see the Church pestred with such tarish companions, but also that they had a zeale burning in them, for rooting them vp: and yet discretion ioyned with zeale, in that they will not walke herein by any conceit of their owne, but onely by the rule of their Master Christ. Griefe at such tares (I doubt not) there is in many: zeale also for tearing vp such tares, I doubt not also there is in many: but a true content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to passe by their owne conceipt, and to search out their Masters meaning for reformation, it resteth in ouer-few. Hee will walke by this rule, another by that rule for reformation of faith and manners. As for the Brownist, Anabaptist and Arian, they will walke by no rule for reformation of this wheat field, and purging it from weedes: but at one choppe, they hew downe all for Antichristian, and will haue no visible Christian to be found in this confusion of the field. Tut say they, labour we for curing Babel (misapplying <note n="a" place="margin">Ierem. 51.9.</note> 
               <hi>Ieremies</hi> speech thereto) we would haue cured her, but could not, therefore my people <hi>Go out.</hi> And so, when they haue separated from all, condemned all (good and bad, Church and Babel: condemning the substance
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:11529:17"/>
of faith and manners in all, because of some disputable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, or at most, because of some accidentall euils) they must euery head beginne a new field, a new Church, and all new. And because all are not of one mind, therefore euery one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins a Church (spicke and span new) of a sundry fashion.</p>
            <p>The Brownist keepes the Baptisme he hath in our Church, but denieth the Ministeriall ordination; appointing their lay-people to lay hands on Ministers heads, and so blesse them to their ministeriall office: alleadging the practise of <hi>Israels</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, laying their hands on the Leuits heads <hi>Nomb.</hi> 8. Whereas alas, that was but their forme of Approbation, not of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For when the people (or Elders of the people) had laid on hands, the Leuits thereupon might not administer before the Lord: for their Ordination and blessing resteth to the high Priest: and thereupon came the holy Canon, <note n="b" place="margin">Hebr. 7.7.</note> 
               <hi>Without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, the lesser is blessed of the greater.</hi> For in <hi>Nombers</hi> 8. it followeth, that <hi>Aaron</hi> tooke the Leuites, filled their hands with oblation, with his hands did shake them before the Lord: and so (after benediction) did set them to the Altars worke. And this hath <note n="c" place="margin">Pet. Mar. on 1. Sam. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> well obserued and distinguished. And indeed, the ancients made <hi>This</hi> (not <hi>Teaching</hi>) to be a cause of distinction betweene <hi>Episcop</hi> &amp; <hi>Presbyter</hi> (or Bishop and Priest: for these words are of the former Greeke corrupted) namely, <hi>That the Bishop might ordaine, the Elder not</hi>) for so <hi>Chrysostome</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing said that <note n="d" place="margin">So do all Ancients.</note> Elders are vnderstood vnder the word <hi>Bishop</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. hee after saith: <hi>Inter episcopum &amp; presbyt.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation alone, they are their superiours: and this</hi> (power) <hi>onely they are thought more to haue, then haue the Presbyters,</hi> or Elders or Priests. Therefore (passing by Priestes, as all of them figures of Christ) they casting eye vnto Church-order, they ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cause resemblance alike to be had betweene Bishop &amp; Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, as was of old time betweene the high Priest and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Priests: and the resemblance of common Presbyter and Deacon, to lie in such difference as was betweene the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Priest and common Leuits. And indeede, the trueth is such: though such as despise ancient record and reading do (as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:11529:17"/>
some doe at home) make sacred Ordination a friuolous cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. Whereby the Brownists of common inferiour lotte, they haue learned to bid their father (hee that begot them to that faction) to kneele downe, and they t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Touching the Anabaptists, they stand not partaking in the matter (as doth the Brownist) but they exusflate or blow off our Baptisme, so well as Ordination, saying: <hi>All that floweth from Antichrists ministers, it must be Antichristian.</hi> And so, one baptizeth <note n="e" place="margin">I knew one such, and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes it.</note> himselfe (as <hi>Abraham</hi> first circumcis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Apostle promiseth (<hi>if hee come</hi>) to lay him out in his colours, intending thereby no doubt to prepare a way for his casting out: but meane time hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits him, inasmuch as he bids them not deliuer him to Satan.

And when to the Corinthes he writes, <hi>I feare when I come againe, my God abase me among you, and I shall bewaile many: of them which haue sinned</hi> ALREADIE, <hi>&amp; haue not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their vncleannes and fornication &amp; wanto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for no loue to the tares, but for loue of Church and Common-wealthes peace it was, that <hi>Dauid</hi> permitted <hi>Shimei</hi> of <hi>Beniamins</hi> quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tribe fauourite to <hi>Saul</hi>: as also suffered bloody <hi>Ioab</hi> to liue all his dayes, for that otherwise he might haue brought all the souldiers on his necke, for auenging the death of their worthy Generall.</p>

And for this cause (namely for preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of life, and auoiding some great euil ensuing) we often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times permit that we like not. Nor is he fit to gouerne a family (much lesse a Church) that walketh not by this rule &amp; conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. If any now demand what if <hi>Diotrephes</hi> repent, or for want of repentance he be by <hi>Iohn</hi> in after time cast out, is such a one yet a Tare? Two answers are hereto framed. The first is, yea: as <hi>Simon</hi> was surnamed <hi>Leper</hi> (because once a Leper) so may such a one be called a Tare, because once a Tare. The second answer I giue thus: if either of the former things fal out, he may be said to haue stood (for the former clasping season) as a tare, but now he bewraies himself not to, be such: Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as, the <note n="o" place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note> incestuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was deliuered vp to Satan for leauen &amp; a seruant to Satan, who <note n="p" place="margin">2. Cor. 2.</note> after proued a man of true spirit &amp; holines. The Parable (as other Parables) it must not be stretched beyond the purpose of our Sauiour made manifest by other consent of scripture: and so I haue proued <hi>Augustines</hi> collection to be found &amp; irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If any reply, only those open wicked ones are Tares as die Tares (because it is after said, they shall by the Angels in the great haruest be gathered vp) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>so could add, because Tares are bid to grow vntil the last haruest, therfore none are Tares that liue not vntill the last haruest. As also, by that reason we should neuer know who are Tares vntill death: and so to no purpose commaunded to <hi>let them grow togither,</hi> seeing after death they can no more grow togither. To auoid such foolish consequents, the proprietie of a Parable must therfore ay be heeded.</p>
            <p>The former conclusion remembred, downe fals the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines collection, who would haue all publike wicked permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: seeing here is not speech of all euill ones, but of a kind of euill-ones which cannot with kingdomes children their good be pulled vp, or cut off, by Magistrate or Minister. Euen as in the Parable of the <note n="q" place="margin">Math. 25.</note> fiue foolish virgins, he declareth not open wicked, but hypocrites (seeing they had their lamps and lights and went to meet the bridgroome so well as the other fiue. Nor was their foolishnes discouered to the Church, vntill they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:11529:19"/>
had slep the sleep of all flesh (good and bad) and were raised againe by the shout of the Archangell) so euerie Parable hath his owne propriety. Here also falleth to ground all such as haue with <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Erasmus</hi> vnderstood them to be heretikes, whom the Magistrates should permit to growe, vntill happily they might become wheat. Yet <hi>Chrysostome</hi> addeth: <note n="r" place="margin">Chrysost. hom. 47. on. Math.</note> 
               <hi>Non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibet, &amp;c. Our Sauiour forbiddeth not to dissipate the conuenticles of heretikes, the stopping of their mouthes, to cut off all libertie of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: onely he forbids the killing of them.</hi> But as he hath no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant hence of preseruing heretikes liues, so he hath warrant inough from many places, for scattering the assemblies, stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their mouthes, &amp;c. And surely, the Magistrate can neuer be thought to be zealous for the Lord, when he beares (as the ordinarie States of Germanie doe) a sword for their ciuill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but none for the Lords religion. To ground also here fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Anabaptistes doctrine of Christians vnlawfulnesse for bearing and exercising the sword against trangressors: seeing (say they foolishly from hence) they may liue to become true Christians. In a word, diuers fantasies here fall downe (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> before the Arke) nor meruell, seeing tymber, hay and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is in the Lords day appointed to burne; that so, gold, siluer, and precious stone it may be discouered for only sutable to the foundation of this heauens kingdome.</p>
            <p>Now to the second question, <hi>How the permission of such Tares</hi> (or tarish persons) <hi>they shall not pollute the fellowship</hi>? That such permission is not sinne or pollution to the permitters, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth if but in this, that Christ not onely aduiseth, but also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth such permission for the peace &amp; good of his wheat, or true sonnes of the Church. If first such open wicked vpon due sight and search be found (not thistles, da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If I say, sinne dwelling in him, he is not therfore seruant to sinne but to Christ, because a better spirit or lawe ruleth in him: much lesse can another mans sinne pollute me or my new man created in Christ, who is so farre from being led captiue by his sinne, as I hate it; and as meanes by God are giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in my place, do labour the slaughter of his sinne and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion thereof: and when such meanes of remouing him is lacking to me, yet the good-will of remouing such a scandale is neuer lacking. Keeping thus my heart and conscience cleane, all things that are without, are to me cleane &amp; pure. But if the conscience be priuie to a liking of the scandale, and negligent in vsing the fit meanes God hath granted for remouing such a scandale, then he is pollution vnto me, and my soule is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his sinne. The one and the other of those conclusions, haue their ground also from that to <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15. and in <hi>Marke</hi> 7.18.19.20, 21.22.23.

As I say, our Sauiour willeth so long sufferance of the tares, so hence we are to obserue the forme of speech (<hi>Let them grow togither vntill the haruest</hi>) whence some conclude euery tare his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular haruest at the time of his death, as also a generall haruest of all in the end of the world. Touching such particular haruest here is no speech (although it be true from other scripture, that the tree falling into the cold nipping <note n="y" place="margin">Eccles. 11.3.</note> North it shall there lie) the speech here is onely of the great vniuersall haruest, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in finall doome is giuen to all. If any say, but all the tares which haue been some 100. yeares since are dead, &amp;c. I answer, our Sauiour promiseth to his Apostles, that in executing their commission, he would be with them vnto the end of the world, and lo they died and ceased preaching and baptizing 1500. yeares since. The Apostle charged <hi>Timothie</hi> to keepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement vnspotted till the appearance of Christ Iesus, and <hi>Timothie</hi> fell on sleepe about 1500. yeares since also.

               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:11529:23"/>
the other peculiar to his manhood, and (as it was) finit. The first Will strong as God, the second infirme as man, but infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity without sinne. In a word, all the wicked (tares or other weeds) they must now be seuered from the Lord his wheat: and that which more is, they must be collected and bound vp in sheaues. Not in one sheaue but sundrie, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their euils. One faction in one sheafe, another faction in another sheafe: but all prepared for one hell, for one fire, euerlastingly burning.</p>
            <p>Yet (though but one hell, one fire of wrath) scripture see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to imply (by vniuersall consent of the Church) that the measure of torment shal be <note n="x" place="margin">Reue. 18.6.</note> diuersly proportioned, according to the proportion and qualitie of sinne in the subiect. Nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like I a certaine Ancient his iudgement touching this, namely, that as in creatures all apt to burne, yet some feede the fire more then the other (as for example: oylie and gummie timber, more then fewell of a diuers nature) euen so, of sinners dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, all capable to burne: but the same fire and torment more enlarged by the subiect it worketh vpon, as his sinne shall be more large and notable. Sin (be it more or lesse) is so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as the subiect whereon the burning wrath of God shal haue matter to feed vpon for euer. And this is the way, whereby the iustice of God against sinne, it shall be declared a Iustice for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. In this day, the Originists (who haue taught that diuell and all shall once come out of that fire and be saued) they shall find that sinne in the damned neuer dies (nay, I rather thinke that it is encreased: if so sinne can be enlarged in hell: seeing sinne vnmortified, is budding &amp; bringing forth more euil in thought word, worke) and so consequently, the <note n="y" place="margin">Isa. 66.24.

            <p>And as the tares (the most politicall wicked) together with the whole corporation of Satan, they thus shal find in the end, their glorie turned into shame, &amp; their temporarie heauen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an eternall hell. So the Lord his wheat or children of the kingdome (for though the other were <hi>in it,</hi> yet they were not <hi>of it</hi>) they are in this great day gathered into the Lords barne. Though they grew together here, they must be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered there. The wicked shall not stand in the assembly of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:11529:24"/>
righteous: nor after that day, shall the soule of any righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> be combred and galled with Sodome. The Iebusits gall vs heere, but they drinke gall and wormewood for it there. We contentedly suffer here, but it is appointed that we shall be glorified there. Into the Lords barne, <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, heauens glory we shall all be receiued: and there for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie placed.</p>
            <p>But as there is more or lesse measure of torment for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; so, shall there not be a diuersitie of glorification in Christ Iesus his members? The vniuersall streame of antiquity conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding affirmatiuely, I dare not ioyne with them that conclude negatiuely. Besides, the scriptures they vrge to this purpose, I cannot see them otherwise applied then aptly and fitly. For our Sauiours words in <hi>Iohn,</hi> 
               <note n="z" place="margin">Iohn. 14.2.3.</note> 
               <hi>In my fathers house are many dwelling Mansions (if it were not so I would haue told ye) I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> Where they reply that these seuerall mansions are to be vnderstood here in the Church: I answer, that cannot be: for the sundrie mansions must be considered in the place whither Iesus was repairing (namely, in heauens glory) and not in the earth whence he was departing. Which better appeareth in that after he preoccupates this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Apostles (<hi>What shall become of vs meane time?</hi>) whereto he answereth their thought, saying: <hi>Though I go to prepare a place for you, I will come againe.</hi> And where the auncients do alleadge that of <hi>Paul: There is another glorie of the Sunne, and another glory of the Moone, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother glory of the Stars, (for one Starre differs from another in glory)</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">This clause in proprietie is the end of the verse.</note> 
               <hi>So also in the resurrection of the dead.</hi> If any here reply, that this is to be vnderstood of the first resurrection (which is here) from sinne, he speakes openly against the generall and scope of the Chapter: which was to teach the resurrection of our bodies (not soules) against some that in the Church denied it. Againe, if they say that the comparison is between earthly and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bodies, in this place it is apparantly false: for here he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes: Looke what difference in the glorie of Starres, (though all glorious) euen such difference in the resurrection of bodies, though all glorious: for before the resurrection, no bodie is glorious. And surely, were it we considered but the state of a bodie (where we see all the members excellent, yet a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:11529:24"/>
of excellency: and yet the difference no cause of emulation in the bodie, because ech member hath that which is fitting his own place) as also, if we consider that all the beauteous order of God it lieth in distinctions, it must help to perswade, that in his mysticall bodie there be an Identitie (or One-nes) touching the generall, <hi>Eternall life</hi>: yet there must be distinction or difference touching the measure of glorification.</p>
