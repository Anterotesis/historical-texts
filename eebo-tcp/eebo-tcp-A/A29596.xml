            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS the over-flowing of <hi>Nilus</hi> doth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
leave many Seeds and Spawns of
Monſters behind it, ſo the late Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Schiſm in this Nation, hath left
many prodigious and monſtrous Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
with us; amongſt the reſt, That it's lawful for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to take up Arms againſt their Prince in Defence of
Religion, or to prevent Popery. And this Doctrine I
muſt tell you, Sir, is become ſo Epidemical, that many of
the Religioniſts have adopted it into the Family of their
Faith. I have here <hi>in tranſitu, tanquam Viator Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulas,</hi>
made ſome Reflections upon their pernicious <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orem:</hi>
The Colours, I muſt confeſs, are laid in Water,
but ſome better Artiſts hereafter may lay them in Oyl.
Howſoever I do appeal to your Noble ſelf, whoſe ſingle
Opinion (in point of Loyalty) I more value, than the
Judgment of the moſt advanced Heads. I know, Sir,
you carry an Antidote in your Ears, and a Counterpeſt
in your Breaſt, againſt the Poiſon and Contagion of theſe
Principles. Your innate Loyalty hath taught you even
from your Cradle to bear Arms in defence of your Prince.
<pb facs="tcp:95483:3"/>
I am ſure your Religion (which you profeſs) cannot

with you, That it's Lawful for Subjects in a Monarchical
State, as <hi>England</hi> is, to take up Arms for Religion, or in
defence of it, without warrant and Authority from the
King.</p>
            <p>Sir, this Aſſertion of yours is ſo horrid and pernitious
in conſequence, and ſo fatal to all Kings and Princes, and
to Religion it ſelf, that I muſt tell you, it's,</p>

            </list>
            <p>1. It's contrary to the Doctrine delivered in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which teach us, the Sword belongeth only to the
King, and to them that are ſent by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1 <hi>Pet.

In the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> there is a remarkable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
between Subjection and Reſiſtance; <gap reason="foreign">

or Offenſive, if it be againſt the Superior Power, which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95483:4"/>
God hath ſet over us, is forbidden. But this hath been ſo
excellently diſcourſed of by many learned perſons, that
I ſhall not give you further Trouble herein; yet there is
one Objection which you make your <hi>Achilles,</hi> which I ſhall
endeavour to anſwer, and that is 1 <hi>Pet. c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Submit
your ſelves unto every Ordinance of man, whether it be to the
King, as Supreme:</hi> from whence you conclude, that the
King is the Ordinance of man, and deriveth his power
from the People, and in caſe of breach of Truſt, its lawful
for them to take up Arms againſt him.</p>
            <p>

               </gap>) do not denote efficiency in
the Subject, but its paſſivitive; ſo that it's not meant of
any Ordinance created by man, but eſtabliſhed in, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men.</p>
            <p>2. There is a ſignal Character in that very Text, that
keeps it from concluding the Supreme Power to be Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in the People, not only by calling the King Supreme,
ſuch as in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Divinity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. are affirmed to be
ordained of God, and ſo no human Ordinance: but alſo
by diſtinguiſhing the Governours, <hi>v.</hi> 14. from the King or
Supreme, <hi>v.</hi> 13. by this, that the Governours are ſent by
<hi>(i. e.</hi> have Commiſſion from) the King; which might in
the like manner be alſo affirmed of the King, that he were
ſent by the people, if he were the Creature or Creation
of them, but is not ſo much as intimated by the Apoſtle:
But on the contrary, Supremacy affixt to him, and Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to be paid to him (not for the people, but <hi>for the
Lords ſake)</hi> as Subordination to, and Miſſion from the
King, is affirmed of all other Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>3. It's contrary to the Laws of this Kingdom for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to take up Arms upon any pretence whatſoever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Warrant and Authority of the King.</p>

King, who ſhould defend the Kingdom? If it be in the
people (as you would have it) then all have an equal
Right to command, and ſo for want of a good accord amongſt
them (as they will rarely agree to reaſon) the Kingdom
would be loſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore the <hi>Poſse Regni</hi> by the Laws and Conſtitutions

            <p>2. It's not lawful for Subjects in the Realm of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to take up Arms for Religion, either to reform it, or
to take away that eſtabliſhed, or to introduce a new one
without Warrant or Authority of the King. Becauſe,</p>
            <p>1. The King is the Supreme Head of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2. And at a Convocation
holden <hi>Anno 22 H.</hi> 8. by a publick Inſtrument made by all
the Biſhops and whole Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> the King was
acknowledged to be Supreme Head of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
Inſt. part.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 121.</p>
            <p>2. All Eccleſiaſtical Authority and Juriſdiction in this
Kingdom are originally derived from the King, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>De
Jure Regis Eccleſiaſtico;</hi> he hath power within his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to declare what are Articles of Faith, according to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95483:5"/>
Scriptrue, to make Laws for the Government of the Church,
to appoint forms of Worſhip and Diſcipline; and he hath
power to make Orders and Conſtitutions for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Clergy, as it was reſolved by all the Judges of
<hi>England,</hi> 2 <hi>Feb.</hi> 2 <hi>Jac. Croke part</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 37. <hi>Moors Rep.</hi> 755.
And theſe Rights and powers of the King are inherent in
him, as Eſſential Flowers of the Crown, and as ancient as
the Crown it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For Subjects to raiſe Arms in oppoſition of any of theſe
Powers, or againſt the Laws and Conſtitutions to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
by the King made, it's High Treaſon within the Statute
of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. for the Church and Common-wealth make but
one Monarchy; therefore they which take up Arms againſt
the Eccleſiaſtical Power of the King, take up Arms againſt
the Monarchy, and ſo againſt the Monarch. And I muſt
tell, you, Sir, That originally there was no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Church and State, as to Juriſdiction, until Chriſtian
Monarchs divided Juriſdictions, and delegated Civil and
Eccleſiaſtical perſons to take Conuſance, and judge of
Cauſes ſeparate: And thoſe Juriſdictions are called Civil
and Eccleſiaſtical, in reſpect of the Delegates only, and not
in reſpect of the Caſes whereof they take Conuſance, and
judge. And the ſame perſons which <hi>ratione Ligeantiae,</hi> are
Members of the Common-wealth, <hi>ratione Fidei,</hi> are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Church.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> (that great Oracle of the Law) ſaith,
If Subjects take up Arms, to alter Religion eſtabliſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Realm, or the Laws, or to any other end, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Reformation of their own heads, without Authority
from the King, this is a levying of War againſt the King;
becauſe they take upon them Royal Authority, which is
againſt the King, and <hi>per</hi> Conſequence it's High Treaſon,
<hi>Inſt. part.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Old caſtle</hi> of <hi>Cowling</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> in
Parliament was adjudged a Traytor, for that he and others
to the number of twenty men called <hi>Lollards,</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
to ſubvert the State of the Clergy, <hi>Rot. part.</hi> 5 <hi>H.</hi>

In Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time Sir <hi>Nicholas Throgmorton</hi> conſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat</hi> to levy War within the Realm
for alteration in Religion; he joyned not with him in the
execution of this Conſpiracy, yet both adjudged Traytors
by the Common Law, before the Declaration of the Stat.
25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Dy fol.</hi> 98.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Jac.</hi> The Lord <hi>Gray</hi> and other Conſpirators met, and
conſpired to make an Inſurrection, whereby they deſigned
to ſeiſe the King into their power, until he ſhould grant
them a Pardon of all Treaſons, a Tolleration of the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of the Popiſh Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They were indicted for
Compaſſing the Kings Death; the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> was tryed by
his Peers, and had Judgment to be drawn, hang'd and
quarter'd.</p>
            <p>In the Fifthty firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, it was declared
by Parliament, that for Subjects to aſſociate or enter into
any Covenant to reform Church or State, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of the King, was High Treaſon by the Fundamental
Laws of this Nation, and entred upon the Roll, <hi>Nullo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicente.
Rot. part</hi> 51 <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>If the end of raiſing Arms be to overthrow any Statute,
any part of the Law, and ſetled Government in Church or
State, this is war againſt the King, and High Treaſon.</p>
            <p>In that great Inſurrection of the Villains and meaner peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's time; they took an Oath,
<hi>Quod Regi &amp; Communibus fidelitatem ſervarent,</hi> to be true
to the King and Commons, and that they would take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what they paid for, puniſhed all Theft with Death;
here was no intendment againſt the perſon of the King; the
intent was to eſtabliſh the Laws of Villenage and Servitude:
this in Parliament, 5 <hi>R.</hi> 2. is declared to be Treaſon againſt
the King, 5 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>part</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 31, 32.</p>
            <p>In the Eighth year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, <hi>William Bell,</hi>
and <hi>Thomas Lacy</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> conſpired with
<hi>Thomas Cheyney,</hi> called the <hi>Hermite of the Queen of Faires,</hi>
to overthrow the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Realm; and for
the effecting of it, they with 200 more met together, and
concluded upon a Courſe of raiſing greater Forces in the
ſaid County of <hi>Kent;</hi> this was adjudged Treaſon: It's the
ſame offence by force of Arms to conſpire to overthrow the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95483:6"/>
Eccleſiaſtical Laws and Government of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Bradſhaw,</hi> and <hi>Robert Burton,</hi> and others of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-ſhire,</hi>
conſpired and agreed to aſſemble themſelves with
ſo many men as they could procure at <hi>Enſlowhill</hi> in that
County, and there to riſe, and from thence to go from
Gentlemans houſe to Gentlemans houſe, and to caſt down
Incloſures as well for enlargement of High-ways, as of Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Lands; and they agreed to get Armour and Artillary
at the Lord <hi>Norris</hi>'s houſe, and to bear them in going from
Gentlemans houſe to Gentlemans houſe for the end afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
and to that purpoſe perſwaded divers others; and all
this was confeſſed by the Offenders, for which <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> and
<hi>Burton</hi> were attainted of High Treaſon, <hi>P.</hi> 39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> by all
the Judges of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be Treaſon to conſpire and agree to aſſemble to caſt
down Incloſures, certainly it muſt be Treaſon to conſpire
and conſult by power of Arms, without Royal Authority,
to caſt down the Incloſures of the Church (which is <hi>Hortus
incluſus)</hi> and fenced with ſo many excellent Laws to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
it againſt the Ravage of the Beaſts of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the
Fury of unreaſonable men.</p>
            <p>For Subjects to take up Arms to remove evil Counſellors
from the King, it's High Treaſon, as it was adjudged in
the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> what then is the Offence by
force of Arms to remove the ſacred Oracles of the Church,
and to pull down the Pillars of it?</p>
            <p>So that it doth demonſtratively appear, that the ſole power
of the Sword is in the King; for to ſuppoſe that another
hath right to bear the Sword, beſides the Soveraign, is to
ſuppoſe, that the Soveraign hath an equal, which is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to the notion of Soveraignty, and that in the ſame
Government there may be two Soveraign Powers.</p>
            <p>3. In the next place we ſhall conſider whether this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of taking up Arms for Religion, or in defence of it,
or to prevent any other from ſetling, or upon any other
godly pretence, without Authority from the King, be
warranted by the Judgment of the moſt Learned and Pious
men in all Ages, That it's not lawful for Subjects, without
Warrant from their King, to take up Arms for Religion,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95483:7"/>
or defence of it, or upon any other godly pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his <hi>Apologeticks c.</hi> 30, 33, 37. tells us, That
the Ancient Chriſtians in his time, although having an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and perſecuting Emperor, did honour him, as choſen
of God, and ſecond from God, and firſt after God; and
did chuſe rather to ſuffer, than to make reſiſtance by force
of Arms, although they lacked not number and ſtrength
to do it.</p>
            <p>The like Example we have in that renowned <hi>Thebaean</hi>
Legion of 6666 Chriſtian Soldiers called <hi>Agaunenſes</hi> from
the place of their Suffering, who, without making reſiſtance
as they had ſtrength to have done, ſuffered themſelves rather
to be ſlain for their Chriſtian Profeſſion, by the Officers of
<hi>Maximinian</hi> the Emperor, Executors of his cruel Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt them: This fell out in the 18. year of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> as
<hi>Ado Viennenſis</hi> writeth in his Chronicle, which was in the year
of God 297. as Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> reckoneth in his Annals;
and of that pious and Chriſtian Reſolution <hi>Venantius Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi>
an ancient Biſhop of <hi>Poictiers</hi> hath left unto us a noble
<hi>Eulogium,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Bibliotheca Patr. Tom.</hi> 8. <hi>Edit.</hi>
4. <hi>fol.</hi> 741.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> in his firſt Oration, ſpeaking of the
Perſecution by <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, where the Chriſtians
were more in number, and ſtronger in power to have made
open Reſiſtance, if they had in their Conſciences found it
agreeable to their Chriſtian Profeſſion, declareth plainly,
that they had no other remedy againſt that Perſecution, but
patient Suffering for Chriſt, with gloriation in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> having received commandment to deliver the
ſacred Houſes or Churches to be poſſeſſed by the <hi>Arrians,</hi>
declared what he thought convenient to be done in ſuch a
caſe, to wit, neither to obey in that which he could not
perform with a good Conſcience, nor yet to reſiſt by force
of Arms. His words to the people <hi>(Concione tertia contra</hi>
Auxentium) are theſe; <hi>Quid ergo turbamini? volens nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
vos deſeram, coactus repugnare non novi: dolere potero,
potero flere, potero gemore, adverſus arma, milites, Gothoſque
lachrimae meae arma ſunt, talia munimenta ſunt Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,
aliter debeo, nec poſſum reſiſtere:</hi> Why then are ye
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95483:7"/>
troubled? I ſhall never willingly leave you: If I be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,
I cannot gainſtand; I may be ſorry, I may weep, I
may ſigh, againſt Arms, Soldiers, the <hi>Gothes</hi> alſo, my Tears
are Arms; for ſuch are the Guards of a Prieſt: otherwiſe
I neither ought, nor may reſiſt. And in the ſecond Book
of his Epiſtles, 14 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> to his Siſter <hi>Marcellina,</hi> ſpeaking
to the ſame purpoſe, he ſaith, <hi>Non ego me vallabo circumfuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
populorum, rogamus,</hi> Auguſte, <hi>non pugnamus—tradere</hi>
Baſilicam <hi>non poſſum, ſed repugnare non debeo:</hi> I ſhall not
fortifie my ſelf with a multitude of people about me—We
beſeech, O Emperor, we fight not—I may not deliver
the Church, but I ought not to make reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Such alſo was the Doctrine and Practiſe of many other
great Lights which ſhined in the days of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate,
and in the days of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperors, and <hi>Gothick Arrian</hi>
Kings.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writing of a lawful War, acknowledgeth
that only to be lawful, which hath Authority from the Prince;
<hi>Intereſt enim quibus cauſis, quibusque Authoribus homines
gerenda bella ſuſcipiant, ordo tamen ille naturalis mortalium
paci accommodatus hoc poſcit, ut ſuſcipiendi belli Authoritas
atque Conſilium penes Principem ſit.</hi> Aug. lib. 22. contra <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum,</hi>
c. 75. <hi>For it's much to be regarded,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for what
Cauſes, and by whoſe Authority men undertake Wars, but that
natural order which is accommodated to the peace of mortal
men, require this, That the Authority and Counſel of undertaking
War, be in the power of the Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Bilſon</hi> ſaith, <hi>In making of War, the perſon muſt be
reſpected as well as the Cauſe; be the Cauſe never ſo juſt, if
the Perſon be not authorized by God to draw the Sword, they
be not juſt or lawful Wars. Private men may not venture
on Wars, unleſs they be directly warranted by him that hath
the Warrant from God.</hi> Dr. <hi>Bilſon</hi> in his Book entituled, <hi>The

            <p>He ſheweth, that the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> have no lawful

            <p>
