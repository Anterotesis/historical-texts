            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The French Hiſtory tells us, that the men of <hi>Burgundy</hi> were ſo affrighted at the apprehenſion of the approach of their Enemies, that they thought long Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to be men with Lances.

                        <p n="1">1. Conſider the condition of this and other Churches in the time of the ten Roman Perſecutions, and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame Churches afterward in latter times, when they loſt their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Under the Roman Perſecution theſe Churches were in great meaſure pure in Doctrine, and holy in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; and when was the rage of the Devil and his Inſtruments more againſt them than when they were pureſt? and had they been able, Satan and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments would then have utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them: But in after-times they

grew looſe and corrupt, and then they fell by the world, when they were moſt ſuitable to the world, and moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in the world.</p>
                        <p n="2">2.

yet they fell by the hands of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Sarazens</hi>; a clear demonſtration, that it is not in the power of men or devils to deveſt men of Church-priviledges, and holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, when they pleaſe; therefore when ſuch are taken away, it is the Lord that takes away the Candleſtick out of its place, being provoked there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the ſins of men, and eſpecially by the unfruitfulneſs of a people under the Goſpel.</p>

I will ſend my beloved ſon; it may be they will reverence him when they ſee him: But when the husbandmen ſaw him, they reaſoned among themſelves, ſaying; this is the heir; come let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours: So they caſt him out of the Vineyard, and killed him; what therefore ſhall the Lord of the Vineyard do to theſe hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96928:28"/>
He will come and deſtroy theſe husbandmen, and ſhall give the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ineyard to others.</hi> Now it is ſaid, Ver. 19. <hi>that the chief Prieſts and Scribes the ſame hour ſought to lay hands on him, for they perceived he had ſpoken this Parable againſt them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſenſe is this: God planted his Church in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he brought it out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and removed and tranſplanted it out of a dry and barren ſoil, and ſet it in a fat and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place, <hi>viz.</hi> the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Land flowing with milk and honey, he gave them his Word and Ordinances, ſent his Prophets among them, riſing early and ſending them, and called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to bring forth fruit; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, they perſecuted his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, ſlew divers of them, and at laſt ſlew his own ſon.

The ſixth Head, the Roman Emperours, they raiſed many bloody perſecutions againſt the Church of Chriſt, and though God reſtrained ſome of them, and gave his Church a breathing, yet many of them tortured their own brains to deviſe cruel tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith to torture the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,

But the Pope, the ſeventh and laſt Head, hath been more miſchievous, and continued longer than all the reſt: Take his firſt riſe, from the time the Heathen Emperours were cut off, and the Pope hath continued 1360 years, or thereabout; and <hi>Rome</hi> was builded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a thouſand and ſixty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope aroſe; ſo that this Head hath continued neer three hundred years longer than all the other ſix, which may give us hopes his time is now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt expired, and ſince the Church hath been vexed by him for ſo many Ages, it is not ſo much to be admired he ſhould fall ſpeedily, as that he hath ſtood ſo long. The Pope was born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, and came not to his full ſtature till about the year ſix hundred, or ſomewhat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

                        <p>The miſchief done to the Church by this ſeventh Head, hath been partly by fraud, partly by open violence; partly by bringing in corruptions in matter of Doctrine, (Popery is not a ſingle Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, like that of <hi>Apollinaris,</hi> or <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> but a heap and ſink, or common ſewer, in which there is a confluence of Hereſies and corrupt Doctrines meeting together) and partly by rage and cruelties; witneſs their cruelties to the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes.</hi> About the latter end of the reign of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Second,<note place="margin">Du Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſ. ad Cardin.</hi> Du Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</note> King of <hi>England,</hi> Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> III. held a Council at the Lateran Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> where they conſulted about the extirpation of the <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> They were a people that did not acknowledge the Pope, prayed to none but to God alone, had no Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, went not to Maſs, denied Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and read the holy Scriptures. The Pope therefore gave the ſame graces to them that ſhould ſpill the blood of

                        <p>Now whoſoever be the Inſtruments of great trouble to the Church, or changes in the world, it is the hand of the Lord that doth it; we have no cauſe to repine and murmure at ſuch and ſuch, but have juſt cauſe to blame our ſelves for it; others have not dealt ſo ill with us, as we have dealt with God; therefore when God takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way peace, and ſends trouble, takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the fruits of the earth, and ſends famine, takes away health, and ſends Epidemical diſeaſes, in all theſe we are to eye God; remember that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are a great deep, and like the great Mountains; if we do not thorowly ſearch the reaſon of it, let us confeſs our underſtandings are too

Becauſe of that right and property that God hath to, and in all his creatures; they are his creatures, whatſoever they have he gave them, therefore he doth with his own as he pleaſeth: Gods own people did not conſider this, therefore the Lord threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the Church to take away what he had given her, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>She did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oyl, and multiplied her ſilver and gold, therefore I will return and take away [my] corn in the time thereof, and recover [my] wooll, and [my] flax gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to cover her nakedneſs</hi>: Though man be the poſſeſſor, yet God is the chief Lord; we are but Stewards, God is the owner, as <hi>David</hi> acknowledgeth. <hi>All things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.15. God hath given us only the uſe of ſuch things he hath committed to us for a time, not the propriety. A Steward cannot ſay, this houſe is mine, theſe Farms are mine, theſe are my Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, this is my Land, theſe are my Cattle, this is my Treaſure, for they are his Lords: He only hath the care of them, not the propriety in them: So every particular man (whatſoever
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96928:38"/>
he enjoyeth) he hath but the uſe of it, not the propriety. God is the Lord of heaven and earth, he ſtileth himſelf <hi>the poſſeſſor of heaven and earth</hi>; all theſe things are his, he hath <hi>jus ad omnia, jus in omnibus</hi>; a right to all things, a right in all things: therefore he calleth all the creatures his ſervants, Kings and Emperours are his ſervants: <hi>My ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> and all the Kingdomes of the world are Gods; God calleth all things his: as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid concerning <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s ſons, Ephraim <hi>is mine, and</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>is mine; as</hi> Reuben <hi>and</hi> Simeon, <hi>they ſhall be mine, Gen.</hi> 48.5. So God calleth all things his which we do poſſeſs. Theſe houſes are mine, theſe riches are mine, theſe lands are mine, theſe children and ſervants are all mine; the Sea is his, and he made it, and all the Fiſhes therein are his; <hi>The earth is the Lords, and all the fulneſs thereof, Pſa.</hi> 24.1. and <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50.10, 11. God challengeth all the creatures to be his; <hi>Every beaſt of the forreſt is mine, and the cattle upon a thouſand hills are mine: I know all the fouls of the mountains, and the wild beaſts of the field are mine</hi>: the rich treaſures within the bowels of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96928:38"/>
earth, the rich Mines of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are his, the precious pearls are his, yea all the Inhabitants of the world are his: And all men at the beſt are but <hi>Domini uſu fructuarii</hi> (as the Civilians term is) ſuch as have the uſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, but not the right and property in the things they poſſeſs. God hath let out the world to the ſons of men, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did his Vineyard at <hi>Baal-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Cant.</hi> 8.11, 12. unto certain Keepers. <hi>Solomon</hi> was to have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pieces of ſilver, and thoſe that kept the fruit thereof two hundred: God will have the honour of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and poſſeſſion, we the fruit of his Vineyard: Therefore it was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous uſurpation of fooliſh <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.11. <hi>Shall I take my bread, and my water, and my fleſh, that I have killed for my Shearers?</hi> He ſpeaks like a covetous, uſurper, as if all theſe were his own, and not Gods, as if he had both the propriety and uſe of them. There are two things that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that God hath the right and property of what we do enjoy.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is but one Lord of all things in the world: God is the wiſe Creator of all things, and he will be the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96928:39"/>
Lord of all his creatures: he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the propriety of things to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, although he giveth the uſeful frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his creatures to man. There are two reaſons why God made man Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of all the creatures; one is, <hi>ut cum mundus refertus ſit, intelligeret, quod locum in coelis, &amp; non in terris quaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>: that ſeeing all neceſſaries are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him on earth, he ſhould not ſeek after a place upon earth to ſettle himſelf in, but a Manſion in heaven. Another reaſon is, to ſhew, that ſeeing all things were made before him, that the creatures were the Lords, and not his; that he was brought to this great houſe of the world to be Gods Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, Tenant, or ſervant; therefore God enjoyned <hi>Adam</hi> to labour preſently, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Paradiſe he was to dreſs the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſtate of Innocence, when he enjoyed the whole world, yet he was not <hi>Dominus terrae,</hi> the Lord of the earth; the earth was the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof: <hi>Adam</hi> was but as the French-men call a titular Lord, <hi>Dominus ſine terrâ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Becauſe God will have all men to be dependent upon him; if men had their riches or honours from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96928:39"/>
they would ſtand upon their own bottom, they would even dare with Impudence to ſtand out and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with God: Who is the Lord, ſaith proud <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> Thus every one would be ready to ſay, who is the Lord that I ſhould ſerve him? but when men ſhall know, that what they have, they have from God, they will depend upon him as a Steward dependeth upon his Maſter; you ſee the unjuſt Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. was undone, when his Maſter turn'd him out of his ſervice.</p>

Although ſome of theſe outward things are in ſome degree neceſſary for this preſent life, yet our heavenly Father knoweth how far forth they are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and how much is neceſſary for us, or elſe gives us content in himſelf imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately without them: yet theſe things are not ſo needful as they are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed to be: it is wonderful to conſider what ſweet joy and content many a Childe of God hath had; when they have been ſtript of theſe things; and the reaſon is, becauſe when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God do want theſe things, they do more fully apply themſelves to God; when a Chriſtian is ſtript of theſe, and hath none of theſe things to reſt upon, then the affections of the ſoul are like water running one way in one Channel: whatſoever S. <hi>Pauls</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition was, he could find e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in Chriſt to be content; in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, he knew how to be abaſed, ſweetly ſatisfying himſelf in this, that he was an adopted Son of God, and he knew how to be hungry, becauſe he had bread and meat to feed on that the world knew not of, and could feaſt himſelf with marrow and fatneſs at that time, when carnal eyes thought
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96928:44"/>
him ready to periſh for hunger: he knew alſo how to ſuffer want, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with that abundance that is found in Chriſt: Many evil men have been forced to ſuffer need, but were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inſtructed to it as <hi>Paul</hi> was; they never learnt to relieve themſelves in their wants out of the fulneſs of Chriſt, as the Saints do, who (be their wants never ſo great) do find enough in Chriſt to ſatisfie them all. Again, the Lord doth immediately fill and ſatisfie the ſoul with himſelf, when it lies under many outward wants, and repleniſheth them with abundance of joy, when they are under many occaſions of ſadneſs and ſorrow. So ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>As ſorrowful, yet alwayes rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet poſſeſſing all things:</hi> He was filled with the joy of the Holy Ghoſt at the ſame time when he had many outward occaſions of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: as poor in reſpect of worldly enjoyments, yet being able to enrich o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in God; as having nothing (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the world) yet poſſeſſing all things in God. Thus doth the Lord glorifie the All-ſufficiency of his grace, in giving in himſelf plentifully to his poor
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96928:45"/>
people, when they are under many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtraits and wants.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, there are many things which we fondly perſwade our ſelves we can in no wiſe want, while we poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them; but when they are taken from us, God teacheth us how to live without them. One that was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rich, and fared delicately, having by the providence of God, loſt all, being brought to a hard pinch, is glad of a meſs of pottage to his dinner, and to go to bed ſupperleſs; he is then taught to be content with his mean eſtate, and to ſay, I had not thought I could have lived ſo ſparingly. <hi>Drexelius</hi> tells us of a prodigal Knight, who having bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all his ſubſtance in Banquets and Belly-cheer, and for want of an Horſe, being forced to go on foot, in this ebbe praiſed God, and ſaid; I thank God, who hath ſet me on my own legs again; I had not thought before this, that I was ſo good a footman: So God deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with many men, he reduceth them to a mediocrity and temperance, by a wholſome penurious indigence.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:96928:48"/>
may either with-hold or take away thoſe good things promiſed; for theſe things are promiſed upon condition of our hearkening diligently to the voice of the Lord our God, to obſerve and do all his Commandments, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.1, 2.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. God may take what he will from the wicked, without croſſing his truth, becauſe they have no intereſt in Chriſt and his promiſes; the promiſes are all yea and Amen in Chriſt, but the wicked can claim no intereſt in the promiſes, becauſe they have no intereſt in Chriſt; and if God leave them any good thing, it is more than he promiſed them; if he take away their children, and leave them health, it is more than he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them; if he takes away health and wealth, and give them only their lives, if he caſt them not into hell it ſelf, it is more than he promiſed them.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. When God takes away health, wealth, goods, liberties, outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, from his own people, he hath made up all their loſſes afore-hand; he hath given himſelf, an infinite God, to be their portion; nay, he that takes theſe outward things from them, will give them a kingdome, and that Will make

meat that periſheth, and to try who can outſtrip one another in worldly riches, although God can ſoon clap a pair of wings to them, and make them to flee away from them. Theſe things are the <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> the chiefeſt good, the very God of the world, the Paradiſe, the All in All of this world, the great <hi>Diana</hi> that all the world mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies; they think it better to be out of the world than to have no riches, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming them the only miſerable men that are poor and needy: <hi>Jeroboams</hi> golden Calves are ſtill the worldlings God, the world is of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to this day; no luſts are more unſatiable than worldly luſts, they are green and vigorous even in old age, the love of the world is a ſin that never waxeth old; when men ſhould think moſt on the world to come, yet then are old earth-worms too mindful of this preſent evil world.</p>
                     <p>O what unſpeakable folly is this, ſo eagerly to thirſt after and purſue ſuch periſhing vanities, which may ſoon be taken from us, and which only ſerve us while we are in this world; for if once our ſoul be taken from us, then whoſe ſhall all theſe things be? while the

rich Glutton lived in the world, he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red deliciouſly every day, and wore Purple and fine linnen every day; but when he died, he left all theſe things behind him: Death turned him out of the comforts and poſſeſſion of theſe things. He that drank Wine in Bowls, is now drinking of the Cup of Gods wrath in hell: he that had all things to the full, doth now want a drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cool his flaming tongue; he that was cloathed with Purple and fine lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen every day, is now bound with chains of darkneſs, and cloathed with woe, curſes, and unſpeakable wrath: he that maintained Hawks and Hounds for his delight and pleaſure, is now howling and roaring with curſed Fiends and damned Hell-hounds. Thus he that had the worlds goods only, while he was in the world, he hath nothing in hell to enjoy but Gods wrath, that is his everlaſting portion.</p>
                     <p>So again, rich <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> that had this worlds goods, have now no need of them in heaven; there is no need of the Sun by day, nor of the Moon by night, for the Lord God is the light thereof. What a folly is it in men therefore to labour ſo eagerly after this

Who ever ſeeks the world for their bed, ſhall at beſt find it but ſhort, and ill made, and a ſtone and thorns under their ſides to keep them waking, rather than a ſoft Pillow to ſleep upon. O that it were written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bags, upon the doors, upon the cheſts, tables, counting-houſes of worldlings, which holy <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked came I forth of my Mothers womb,</hi>

Thus worldlings toil, and ſpend their lives and ſtrength for the goods of this world, and think in their old age to take their eaſe, and give up themſelves to a devout ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; but before that, it may be God takes away their goods by fire or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or ſuffereth thieves and robbers to break in upon them, and take away all their wealth and riches from them; or it may be death cometh, and exerciſeth dominion over them, and turneth them into hell, and there they burn, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers enjoy their goods upon earth. Will ye then ſpend moſt of your care, thoughts, ſtrength, and time, for the things of this world, and have no care and thoughts for grace and heaven? Will ye like <hi>Martha,</hi> cumber your ſelves about many things that may quickly be taken from you, and neglect the one thing neceſſary that ſhall never be taken away from you, if once you have it? <hi>Luke</hi> 10.42.

Ah! what pity it is to ſee how Satan layes upon many men a burden of cares above a load, and makes a Pack-horſe of their ſouls, when they are wholly ſet upon the world; we owe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

yet then his will and fancy is ſtrong to act this wickedneſs; ſick men, old men, can then commit mental unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with greedineſs; yea, many there are that come into our publick Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, chiefly to look after and look upon beautiful faces, and when they are outwardly converſant in the Worſhip of God, when they are hearing the Word, their eyes and heart may then be full of adultery.

ſtrong drink, and continued until night, till the Wine enflamed them, whoſe frequent walks were from their own Beds and Houſes to the Alehouſe, and from the Alehouſe to the Tavern, whence (being not able to ſtand by themſelves) they were led or carried to their Beds again, reelling to and fro, ſtaggering, and being at their wits end; and ſo they who had ſomething of men in them when they aroſe in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were (when they came to lie down at night) turn'd into Beaſts, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings being departed from them, and themſelves at their wits end?

                     <p>Neither is all ſorrow for ſin, godly ſorrow, yet this is an high degree of mourning. <hi>Pharoah</hi> lamented his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, <hi>I have ſinned; Judas</hi> alſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his grievous ſin, <hi>I have ſinned in betraying innocent blood, Mat.</hi> 27.3 and now he mourneth in hell for his ſin: and we have ſome examples of men, who ſin and mourn, and then ſin afreſh, and mourn afreſh, crying out, O my pride, O my drunkenneſs, O my ſwearing, O my uncleanneſs! that the beholding their bitter mourning, would make a tender heart to mourn with them; many ſuch there are that mourn on earth for a fit, and mourn in hell for ever. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13. Death-bed lamentation and mourning for ſin, is not alwaies repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mourning.</p>
                     <p>Neither are all that mourn under dreadful apprehenſions of Gods anger againſt them, and terrours upon them ariſing from their ſenſe of ſin, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Gods wrath, true mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; yet this like the former, is an high degree of mourning, yet below holy mourning; ſuch a mourner was <hi>Cain</hi>;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96928:67"/>
the load of terrours upon his heart, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed forth all his tears and complaints. There are ſuch examples ſtill of men, who in their fears of death and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and agonies of conſcience, do weep, confeſs their ſins, reſolve to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſin, and yet when they have eaſe, do ſin again, and they are again as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, as irreligious as they were before, nay, they become more hardned in ſin, and oppoſite to God and godlineſs than they were before.</p>
                     <p>Neither do all who mourn after grace and pardon, truly mourn; yet this is one of the neereſt degrees to ſpiritual mourning that is found in hypocrites. An unregenerate man may feel ſuch a load of guilt upon his conſcience, as that he may mourn after grace and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, yet not be comforted: as there is a temporary ſorrow for ſin, ſo there is in th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But all ſuch as mourn in bitterneſs of ſpirit under their ſpiritual wants: Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> gives this as a reaſon,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cartwr.</hi> Harmon. Evangel.</note> why in the Beatitudes our Saviour addeth mourning next to poverty of ſpirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the want of grace and Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is ſuch a lamentation, that nothing
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96928:67"/>
quieteth them ſo long as they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. And though God by the hand of his bounty, give them all outward things liberally, as health, ſtrength, riches, friends, yet ſtill they mourn over their ſpiritual wants; theſe are the true mourners, that complain for the want of ſpiritual riches. What is this worlds goods, if I have not the grace and favour of God? As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, What is the preſence of an Angel, if we have not the preſence of God with us? ſo what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing? what are all things? if I have not Gods favour, I am undone for ever.</p>
                     <p>Again, ſuch as mourn bitterly for ſin, they truly mourn. <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Wo to us, for we have ſinned.</hi> Woe is the time that ever I ſinned againſt God; Wo is me that ever I did curſe, ſwear, and blaſpheme the holy name of God; wo that ever I was drunk; wo that ever I ſinned againſt the Lord: ſuch a mourning was that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> he went forth and wept bitterly: wo is me that ever I did deny my Lord and Maſter. Such a mourner was <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who waſhed the feet of Chriſt with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head: ſo <hi>David</hi> made his bed to

                     <p>Again, ſuch as mourn for ſin, not only becauſe it doth terrifie the conſcience, but becauſe it doth pollute and defile the ſoul; who mourn for ſin, not only becauſe it is a ſoul-damning evil, but becauſe it is a God-diſhonouring evil, theſe are true mourners. Thus <hi>David</hi> mourned, <hi>Againſt thee, againſt thee have I offended, Pſal.</hi> 51.4.

For courage and valour that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be truſted to: bee a man never ſo ſtout hearted, let him have the heart of a lion, yet courage may fail the moſt valiant, when they have occaſion to make moſt uſe thereof.

                        <p>The reaſon why none of theſe things are to be truſted to, is becauſe God is the only fountain of all thoſe excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and good things, whether of body or minde, that are upon any men upon

earth; and therefore as the greateſt, ſtreams that run with the fulleſt current and carry the biggeſt veſſels, if they be not continually relieved with a conſtant ſpring, they would ſoon fail, &amp; leave their channel dry: So men of the greateſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or moral endowments, unleſs they are relieved by a conſtant influence from Heaven, from the Fountain of life, they will ſoon wither and decay.</p>

Pſal.</hi> 62.10. do not ſtudy how by defrauding and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting others, you may enrich your ſelves, and work out your own ends, by baſe and wicked oppreſſion: if a man would undertake ſome dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize to the hazarding of his life, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promiſe of ſome reward from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, it ſheweth he did relie much upon that man; elſe hee would never make ſo dangerous an adventure upon ſuch a mans woid: many men relie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſins; they promiſe fair, pleaſure, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and hereupon they hazard their ſouls upon uncertainties: if thou truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in any ſin, thou wilt be exceeding vain, becauſe ſin is the greateſt deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the world: ſin is deceitful all over,

root and branch; the inward luſts are deceitful, and all the iſſues, ſuccours, roots and branches, that proceed from it, are deceitful.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. God would have us alſo to underſtand, that there is no truſting to riches: Riches are called <hi>deceitful riches, Mat.</hi> 13.22. They promiſe, or ſeem to promiſe much more than they perform; they are therefore compared to thorns, by our Saviour: many are taken with the green leaves, but are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſenſible of the thorns that grow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; they bring many troubles to thoſe that have them, and lay many loads upon their backs, and prove ſnares to their ſouls, leaving them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great diſcontent, and hindering the ſouls of many men, in the purſuit of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happineſs. And many times they are deceived in the very thing it ſelf, as to the ends themſelves moſt aim at: <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.26. <hi>The way of the wicked ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth them.</hi> V. 27. <hi>The ſlothful man roſteth not what he took in hunting.</hi> As hunters many times loſe their prey; ſometimes the dogs eat it; ſometimes others catch it out of their hands. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> hunted after the wedge of Gold, but loſt his life by it; and <hi>Saul</hi> got fat

cattle, but loſt his kingdome by it. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a wicked man gets much wealth and riches, but never reap that comfort by them as they expect: neither do they get the bleſſing of God to ſweeten thoſe outward comforts to them, though they have them: and in the mean time perhaps their Conſcience woundeth them, and although they feed upon the ſweet of Gods creatures, yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as gravel in their bowels, like the book which St. <hi>John</hi> did eat, which was in his mouth as honey for ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but bitter in his belly, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.10. The remembrance how many men came by their wealth and riches, proveth very woful and bitter to them.</p>
                        <p>Finally, there is no creature to bee truſted to; not friends: nor relations, nor great mens favours. <hi>Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie, Pſal.</hi> 62.9.

But God takes away ſuch comforts as theſe, and he will have us to ſubſcribe, it ought to be ſo, and for that cauſe God takes away our deareſt relations and beſt comforts ſometimes from us, that we may ſee our errour, in placing too much of our love upon theſe things, and give God the very yolk of our hearts,</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> A fourth end God aims at, in taking away theſe things from us, is to have us to be inſtructed in this, that <hi>mans life conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth,</hi> Luk. 12. 15. By life two things are underſtood,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That a mans happineſs doth not conſiſt in the abundance of the things he doth enjoy; only Chriſt, and a right to, &amp; aſſurance of heaven, that is a mans happineſs in this life, and the fruition of Chriſt and heaven hereafter, is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happineſs of a man: <hi>Lazarus</hi> was an happy man, though he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and <hi>Dives</hi> a miſerable man, though he had abundance. Earthly-minded
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:96928:77"/>
perſons ſeek for ſatisfaction from earthly things; therefore there be many that ſay, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">(1.) Such a ſatisfying good, as may make our ſouls happy; they look downward, and think to find this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in outward things. But <hi>David</hi> oppoſeth his reſolved choice to their vain wandring deſire; <hi>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me</hi>; as if he had ſaid, I know where to have enough, Lord let me enjoy thee, and have the light of thy countenance ſhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon me, and I am ſatisfied: Then he ſpeaks of his former experience, that formerly he had found ſatisfaction from God. <hi>Thou hast put gladneſs in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine encreaſed, Pſal</hi> 4.6, 7. as if he had ſaid, the fulleſt Barns and Wine-cellars cannot yeeld that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to an earthly heart, that my ſoul hath formerly found in thee; when they are as full as they can hold, yet their immortal ſoul is not ſatisfied; but I by enjoying thee am fully ſatisfied: Then <hi>David</hi> compareth the ſatisfaction he had found in God, not only with the abundance of theſe things, but with the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96928:78"/>
encreaſe of them; for it is the encreaſe of outward things that is apt to win the heart: a leſſer eſtate encreaſing doth more win the hearts of natural men, than a greater eſtate not encreaſing: But <hi>David</hi> found more content in God, than worldlings did, not only in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, but alſo in the encreaſe of corn and wine. Laſtly, ſaith he, <hi>Thou haſt put gladneſs into my heart.</hi>] Thou haſt infuſed it into my ſoul: it is God that ſheddeth ſweet conſolation into the ſpirit of a man; he doth not only give matter of joy, and ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to a believer, but giveth, as it were, the very affection of it to the ſoul. As for earthly things, they put not comfort into our hearts, if a man will have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good from them, he muſt extract and draw it out; and when the heart and the world do cloſe moſt, yet it then falls ſhort of ſatisfaction; but God doth put gladneſs into the heart, and he can ſatisfie it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. By life is meant likewiſe, that although a man had never ſo many poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, had an houſe full of gold and ſilver, yet all his wealth cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long his daies, nor adde a minute to his life; as if our Saviour ſhould reaſon
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96928:78"/>
thus; I wonder to ſee men take ſuch great pains for the things of this life, to toil and labour in a reſtleſs manner: if every pound they got and had, would adde a day or year more to their lives, there were ſome reaſon why men ſhould thus toil for riches: but can a rich man redeem his life from death with thouſands of gold and ſilver for a day? would not a rich man that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth death and hell, give a world (if he had it) that he might not die and be damned, and yet ten thouſands of worlds cannot redeem a mans ſoul from death and hell; therefore why are men ſo greedy after theſe things that cannot make their lives any longer?</p>
                        <p>Let us take a view of the Parable which our Saviour ſpake upon this very occaſion of a rich Farmer, wherein ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things are to be obſerved.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. His Trade was very gainful, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated by his ground, which brought forth plentifully, the world was coming on upon him apace.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. He had heaped together abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of riches, he had ſo much, he could not tell where to lay them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. See what he reſolved upon, <hi>viz.</hi> to follow his pleaſures and contentments
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96928:79"/>
without all controul; as the Proverb is, What is a Gentleman more than his pleaſure? he would take his pleaſure as well as the beſt man in his Country; he would play the Glutton, and Hunt, and Hawk, and Whore, and Drink, and Swear, and Swagger, and let him ſee what man would dare controll him, he would make the Town and Country too hot for him. Thus ſaith he to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>Soul, thou haſt riches enough.</hi>] and that not for a day, or a moneth, or a year, but for many years: go take thy pleaſure, eat, drink, and be merry; thy abundance of riches will maintain thee in it; here you ſee the proſperity of a rich covetous fool.

ſhalt die, <hi>They (i. e.</hi> the Devils) <hi>ſhall come and take away my ſoul.</hi>] And thou that didſt dream of many years pleaſure, ſhalt burn in hell to Eternity. <hi>Salvian</hi> hath a good meditation on this place:<note place="margin">Bonis ſuis aliis prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinem, ſibi miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam, aliis gaudia, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, aliis volupta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vem, ſibi ignem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuum. <hi>Salvian.</hi>

Now becauſe we are as fearful to meddle with mortification, as the dog is to drink of <hi>Nilus,</hi> therefore our moſt gracious God doth exerciſe us with loſſes and fiery tryals, that by them we may be the more ready to mortifie our corruptions. The Scripture ſets it forth by a full expreſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying our luſts and the affections thereof, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.24. in alluſion to Chriſts crucifying: obſerve the manner of his death, his hands and feet were nailed to the Croſs, the Souldiers thruſt their Spears into his ſide, it was neer the heart of Chriſt: Thus muſt we do with our ſins, we muſt run the ſpear into the very heart of ſin, and we muſt nail the hands and feet of our luſts: Nail the hands (1) The outward acts of ſin, and nail the feet, that ſo we might not walk any more in the luſts of our fleſh, as we have formerly done; that look as <hi>Job</hi> after his manifold loſſes and ſore tryals, ſaid, Lord I have ſinned, I will do ſo no more: ſo do thou ſay, Lord I have a proud heart, I have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within my houſe in pride and lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I have boaſted of my great wealth

                        <p>You may plainly ſee there was ſuch bowels of compaſſions in the Saints in Scripture.

How tenderly affected was <hi>Job,</hi> with every particular mans diſtreſs? <hi>When the ear heard me, then it bleſſed me; and when the eye ſaw me, then it gave witneſs to me; becauſe I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherleſs, and him that had none to help him. The bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon me, and I cauſed the widdows heart to ſing for joy. I was eyes to the blind,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96928:83"/>
and feet was I to the lame, I was a father to the poor,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 29.11, 12, 13, 15, 16. This the Apoſtle calls <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of the bowels of the Saints</hi>; which is a Metaphor taken from ſuch, as being almoſt faint with a great heat, do finde ſome ſhady place to cool them; ſuch is relief to our needy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Till we have been in miſery and neceſſity our ſelves, we ſhall ſcarce af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford our diſtreſſed brethren, any more than lip-compaſſion: Alas poor man! he is in great wants, he is in a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, it grieveth me to ſee him, this is all; this is that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>James</hi> taxeth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.15.16. <hi>If a brother or ſiſter be naked, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of daily food: and one of you ſay unto them, depart in peace, be you warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and filled, notwithſtanding you give them not thoſe things which are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the body, what doth it profit him?</hi> Your lip-love, and your lip-compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is no comfort at all to him; Chriſt will throw ſuch compaſſionate Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites into hell: where there is no relief from the hand, there is no pitty nor compaſſion in the heart; <hi>A niggardly hand is the Index of an iron heart:</hi> this compaſſion is no other than paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

The Prophet calleth God, <hi>the portion of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Jerem.</hi> 10.16. The Vine is the Drunkards portion; Mammon is the Covetous mans portion; Pleaſure is the Voluptuous mans portion; Gods wrath is the Wicked mans portion, <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wicked he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, this ſhall bee the portion of their cup,</hi> Pſal. 11.6. outward ſorrows, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward graces, and God himſelf, are the godly mans portion, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven is his inheritance. True it is! ſome of Gods people have theſe outward things alſo, but they have them not as their portion; and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96928:84"/>
many times he takes them from thoſe that have them, that they may make God their only portion, Therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup,</hi> Pſal. 16.5. The meaning is, the Lord is to me inſtead of houſe and land, of meat and drink, and all neceſſaries for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life. As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Becauſe God could ſwear by no greater, therefore he ſware by himſelf:</hi> So it may be ſaid in this caſe, becauſe God could give no greater portion to people, therefore he gives himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. And when they are ſtript of other things, yet even then they have God to live upon. Wherefore did God keep <hi>Iſrael</hi> forty years in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and made them to hunger and thirſt, and fed them with Mannah, which neither they nor their Fathers did know? was it not to this end, <hi>that he might make them know, that man did not live by bread only, but by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord, doth man live,</hi> Deut. 8 3. What doth a great rich heir live upon, but this portion? hee may have many other conveniencies, but hee chiefly makes account of his portion for his
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:96928:85"/>
livelyhood. God is an All-ſufficient portion; whoſoever hath him for his portion, hath enough; there is enough in him to ſupply all our wants: the creatures at beſt, can but ſupply this or that particular want; but <hi>my God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſhall ſupply all your wants.</hi> All other portions are defective, but this ſufficeth all: Some things give health, but not comfort; ſome things give comfort, but not honour; ſome things give honour, but not ſatiety. Still the ſhooe wrings in one place or other, there is ſomething or other wanting to us: but God is an All-ſufficient porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſoul; he is health to the ſick, wealth to the poor, honour to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, an habitation to the diſtreſſed; he is all that we need or can deſire, yea, he gives abundantly more than we are able to ask or think. God is of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the moſt tranſcendent portion, for communicating, for ſecurity, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty: wee may bee robbed of our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther portions, or they may be leſſened, diminiſhed, burnt, ſpent, conſumed; but here is an abiding portion; <hi>God is my portion for ever,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aſaph, Pſal.</hi> 73.26. Hee is an everlaſting portion. <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:96928:85"/>
he will be our guide even unto death,</hi> Pſal. 48.14. God is a moſt ſure and certain portion, and many times when Gods Children have leaſt of the things of this world, he giveth moſt of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them, in whom is every good and perfect gift, and all things richly to enjoy. <hi>Aaron</hi> had no lot among his brethren, but God ſaith to him, <hi>I am thy part, and thine inheritance among the children of Iſrael,</hi> Num. 18.20. So it is with all Gods children when they are ſtript of all, then God is their portion, and their inheritance: hence a beleever may conclude, the Lord is my portion, therefore I ſhall not want; <hi>ſurely mercy and goodneſs ſhall follow me all the daies of my life:</hi> hee that hath the Sun, can never want light; he that hath a fountain, can never want water; and he that hath the moſt high God, the poſſeſſour of all things, can never want any thing that is good for him: it is an infinite advantage to bee heir of all that God hath to give, both in heaven and in earth: well may hee ſay, when I have nothing, yet I want nothing, becauſe I have God who is all things to me: <hi>The lines are fallen to

So may I ſay to you that have ſuſtained the loſs of your houſes, goods and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, ye have great need of patience. As Souldiers have need of good Boots or Shooes to ſave their feet and legs from being hurt with gravel ſtones, thorn-buſhes, ſticks, or other impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that may either lie or be hurled in their way: ſo a Chriſtian-ſouldier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing armed, and having his feet ſhod with patience, may by help thereof paſs the pikes, and go thorow all loſſes, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and calamities, that may betide or befall him in the warfare of this world. <hi>In patience poſſeſs ye your ſouls,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.19. As faith gives us poſſeſſion of Chriſt, ſo pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence gives us the poſſeſſion of our ſelves. An impatient man is ſo far from poſſeſſing himſelf, that he loſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and tearing himſelf in his paſſion, throws all reaſon out of door, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon follows a great loſs; the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96928:89"/>
of the mind is not attained but by patience, the ſoul is not poſſeſſed by your deep counſels, nor by your pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, nor by your wealth, but by your patience. Impatience expoſeth a man to the greateſt hazards and dangers: if the Waggoner hath not reaſon enough to guide the Waggon, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but ſuffereth the horſes to have their heads, they will draw both him and it into deſtruction: The impatient man is void of reaſon, and ſo expoſeth himſelf to ruine, he createth a conſtant trouble to himſelf, his life is a burden to him, and he enjoyes the poſſeſſion of nothing with comfort, that hath not the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own ſoul: when people are impatient under every petty loſs or ſmall croſs, the Lord in juſt judgement lets greater croſſes to befall them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet thoſe that have impatient ſpirits; and let them expect it, they muſt look for trouble and vexation all their daies, that give way to this evil of impatience. God in his providence hath thrown you out of poſſeſſion of your houſes; what a ſad thing were it for you to be thrown out of the poſſeſſion of your ſelves by impatience? Impatience, ſaith one, is the Daughter of Satan, and the Parent
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96928:90"/>
of folly and madneſs. An impatient man for the loſs of a peny will throw away his purſe, and if he hath loſt but an handful of corn, he is ready to fire the whole field. I have read of a Noble man that was Lord Chamberlain to the Emperour <hi>Rodolphus</hi> the Second, that bringing ſome water for the Emperour to waſh his face in a Veſſel of Chryſtal covered, by his default and negligence the cover fell off and was broken; whereupon the Emperour in a great rage took and threw the Veſſel likewiſe to the ground, uttering theſe words; <hi>Let the devil take the horſe, ſince he hath got the ſaddle</hi>: So by one impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient act he caſt away four hundred Crowns, for at ſo much the Chryſtal was valued. Thus a light and leſſer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is oftentimes doubled with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſmall loſſes through impatience do become great and extraordinary da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages. Patience ſweetens every loſs, and takes away the weight and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of afflictions: Patience to the ſoul is as the lid to the eye; for as the lid being ſhut, ſaves it from many things that would annoy it; ſo patience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the ſoul and that which it ſuffereth, is a great ſafe-guard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96928:90"/>
Patience is a Sovereign remedy againſt all loſſes and croſſes, it cureth all; it keeps the heart from envy, the tongue from murmuring, the hand from revenge, it overcometh our Enemies without weapons, it makes a man a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Martyr without fire or ſword; ſuppoſe a man be brought very low in his outward eſtate, yet if he be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, he feels the want of nothing; it is all one not to have the world, and not to need it; he that doth not want, hath enough, patience gives contentment in the midſt of want, and then a man may be ſaid to abound; it is all one to be without loſſes and croſſes, and patiently to bear them: no affliction, no loſs can be heavy to the patient ſoul, for pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whereſoever it is, it beareth all.</p>

As when a man hath a very dangerous wound in any part of his body, and a ſearching, drawing plaiſter, if applied unto it, to get out the corrupt blood, that may be made for the cure of the wound; there can be no comfort in the plaiſter, as it ſmarteth, yet comfort in it, as it giveth hope of a perfect cure: ſo in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,

                     <p>THe Particle [for] invites me to look back upon the verſes foregoing. The Apoſtle tells us, ver. 12. that <hi>Jeſus, that he might ſanctifie the people with his own blood, ſuffered without the gate</hi>: Then he exhorteth. ver. 13. <hi>Let us go forth therefore unto him without the Camp, bearing his reproach.</hi> Chriſt was figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Sacrifices under the Law; as the Beaſts were burnt without the Camp, ſo Chriſt ſuffered without the gate, being caſt out of the world as an accurſed thing: if Chriſt ſuffered without the gate, how ſhould the Saints be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to go out of the world, and bear
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:96928:102"/>
the reproach the world caſteth upon them, knowing that they ſhall be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly received, not only into the Camp of Chriſt, but into his Royal Court; the world ſhall not caſt ſo much ſcorn upon them, as Chriſt will ſhew them love and favour: it is better to be out of the Camp with Chriſt, than without Chriſt, at the worlds head Quarters. <hi>Moſes</hi> choſe to forſake all rather than not to follow Chriſt: So let us willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear the reproach of Chriſt, and know that he will willingly receive all thoſe that for his ſake are content to bear the reproach that the world caſteth upon them. This exhortation of the Apoſtle is directed</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>To the Jews</hi>; to bid an eternal farewel to all the Levitical Ceremonies and Ordinances, and to go to Chriſt who ſuffered without the gate: his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering there was to put an end to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-worſhip in <hi>Jeruſalem. Calvin</hi> thus paraphraſeth it;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Calvin</hi> ad loc.</note> Think not that God will now be pleaſed with this typical worſhip; but now he expecteth that you ſhould go to Chriſt, and ſuffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, baniſhment, and all manner of perſecutions for his ſake.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>To Chriſtians</hi>: to bid an adieu to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:96928:102"/>
the cuſtomes, to the faſhions, to the courſes, to the luſts of this world, and to reſolve to go forth to Chriſt, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, notwithſtanding the vile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, cruel mockings, that ever did, and ever ſhall fall upon all, both He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews and Chriſtians, who ſincerely follow and cleave to Chriſt: for the Ceremonious Jews did reproach ſuch as did ſhake off the yoke of <hi>Moſaical</hi> Rites, and obſerve the Evangelical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt: and the wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians do to this very day load ſuch with reproaches, who caſt off the yoke of worldly luſts and practiſes, and walk as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt: Now he that will go forth to Chriſt, muſt reſolve to bear his reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; which are better than all the magnificent Titles of Honour, the vaſt treaſures of wealth the world can give; and though they render us ignominious before the world, yet they render us as honorable before God.</p>
                     <p>My Text is a reaſon of the Apoſtles exhortation, or a ſtrong motive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to go forth to Chriſt bearing his reproach; <hi>For,</hi> or becauſe, <hi>we have here no continuing City, but we ſeek one to come:</hi> Wherefore ſlight the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches

                     <p>IN the words of my Text you have a Poſition, and an Oppoſition, or a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and a Concluſion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Poſition is; <hi>Here we have no continuing City.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Oppoſition or Concluſion is, <hi>But</hi> [or therefore] <hi>we ſeek one to come:</hi> for the preſent we have no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding City, but there is an abiding Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to come which we ſeek. This earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is no abiding City for
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:96928:103"/>
you Hebrews: this world is no abiding City for you Chriſtians. But <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> that is above, the heavenly City, the City of the King of Kings, that is an abiding City, that let us diligently ſeek after. This world is to believers, as the Wilderneſs was to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they were Pilgrims in it: So are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the world, ſtrangers and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims; they abode not long in the Wilderneſs, but paſſed through it to <hi>Canaan,</hi> there they made their abode: ſo this world is not a place for believers to abide in, but muſt paſs thorow it to an heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> that is an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Country, an abiding City, and there all believers ſhall abide to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>The general point of inſtruction to be drawn from hence is;<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that there is no abiding place in this world, ſhould forcibly move us to ſeek out for heaven. This was that which moved <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> thoſe renowned Candidates of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, to be as Pilgrims in the world, wandring from place to place, now ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing here, then ſojourning there, but abode no where; and whereſoever they went, they dwelt not in Palaces or
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:96928:104"/>
Fortreſſes ſtrongly built, but in Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, which they could pitch down, and take up, and carry them whether they pleaſed: and ſo they uſed to do, to mind them that there was no abiding for them here, but they muſt look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a City, wherein they ſhould abide for ever. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.9, 10, 14, 16. <hi>By faith</hi> Abraham <hi>ſojourned in the Land of Promiſe, as in a ſtrange Country, dwelling in Tabernacles with</hi> Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>the Heirs with him of the ſame Promiſe: for he looked for a City which hath foundations, whoſe Builder and Maker is God. They confeſſed they were ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth; for they that ſay ſuch things, declare plainly that they ſeek a Country. But now they deſire a better Country</hi> (than that from whence they came out) <hi>that is, an heavenly.</hi> Here ye have a full proof of the point; the Holy Ghoſt calling believers ſojourners, pilgrims, ſtrangers, what is it but to convince them, that there is no abiding for them in this world? this world is not their Country, their City, their home, their habitation; here they are not to place their hopes, to ſet their affections, to ſeek a laſting happineſs; but heaven is
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:96928:104"/>
their City, their Country, their home, their habitation: there all our hopes ſhould be placed, thither ſhould all our deſires aſpire, there we are to ſeek e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting happineſs, there we ſhall be ſure to find it, and to abide in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it to eternity.</p>

                     <p>FOr the better proſecution of this point, I ſhall draw from it two Propoſitions, and make uſe of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. That here is no abiding City. I need not ſeek proof for this, for there is none of us, but his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence evidenceth it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Take City here, for our houſes we dwell in; they are no abiding pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for us: death turneth every man out of his own doors, and carrieth him from his houſe to the grave; it turneth Princes out of their ſtately Palaces, and great men out of their ſtrong-built hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Caſtles, and poor men out of their Cottages. The poor mans Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the rich mans Houſe, and the Princes Palace, are of no continuance; how many ſtately Houſes, Edifices, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96928:105"/>
Caſtles have we ſeen in our daies to be made ruinous heaps, and conſumed to aſhes? your continual repairing them ſheweth them to be of no long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Take City, for the Towns and Cities wherein we inhabit with others, they are no continuing places for us to abide in for ever: See we not, how one Generation paſſeth, and another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? and the Generation that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is going: and though the Stages ſtand a while when the Actors are gone off, yet at length the Stages are taken down. What is now become of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and of thoſe famous Cities of <hi>Aſia?</hi> How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny famous Towns and Cities are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ruinous heaps?

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:96928:106"/>
evident from Scripture, that this fifth City was either overthrown together with the reſt; or a little afterward; but the contrary rather appeareth from the ſpeech of the Lord to <hi>Lot,</hi> Gen. 19.21. <hi>He ſaid unto him, ſee, I have accepted thee concerning this thing, that I will not overthrow this City, for the which thou haſt ſpoken.</hi> And mention is made of it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 15.5. where it is ſaid, that the <hi>Moabites</hi> being overcome by the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> ſhould flye unto <hi>Zoar, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and <hi>Nineveh</hi>; thoſe great Cities, are long ſince utterly laid waſte.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:96928:107"/>
look upon the things we are moſt apt to dote upon; our Cities, Houſes, are they not made of diſſoluble materials? though ſome continue for many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, yet either water, fire, or war, or if none of theſe, their age conſumeth them.

                        <p>I know it is a Diſpute among Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, whether there be a decay of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all creatures: Some ſtrongly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that yet there is no decay, but they are as vigorous now as they were in their firſt Creation. Others (and I think more truly) affirm, a decay in Nature, both in the Heavens and the earth; the Sun and the Heavens have not thoſe vigorous influences as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. What meaneth the curſe upon the earth; (thorns and bryars ſhall it bring forth) but a decay of its Nature? What is meant by vanity and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under which it groaneth, but their natural decay? Why are not the lives of men of that duration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as formerly? One reaſon given is, becauſe the fruits of the earth are not ſo nouriſhable and healthful as before the flood? A gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Deluge brought ſaltneſs and barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon the earth: ſo that now there is a gradual privation of the creatures of their original beauty, goodneſs, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, ſweetneſs, which they received from God in their Creation, by which privation they are rendered unable to

perfect the particular uſes for which they were created. The Sun, Moon and Stars, though ſtill they remain excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent creatures, yet it is ſuppoſed by ſundry Divines, they have loſt much of their Primitive ſplendour, and that they ſhine not ſo bright as at their firſt Creation: The Moon hath her ſpots; it is diſputable, whether ſhe had them from the beginning: Some Stars (though great bodies) yet are ſcarce perceptible by the eye: The ayr, the waters, have loſt much of their ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pleaſantneſs and clarity; the earth hath loſt much of her beauty; the herbs, plants, fruits, trees, have loſt much of their virtue; all the living creatures have loſt much of their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted goodneſs. All men ſee with what art, toyl and labour, the husbandman provokes the earth to its preſent fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, ſeeing the whole earth was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally propenſe to bring forth fruits of all kinds in great abundance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but for our ſakes it is ſubject to much barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; all the Heaths and wilder waſts in the world, are marks of this curſe of vanity on the earth: had not the ſoul of man become a Wilderneſs in reſpect of grace and holineſs, there had been no

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:96928:111"/>
any thing of long continuance, is taken partly from the love of God to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and partly from his wrath to the wicked. The wicked ſhall not have a continuance here, and nothing durable, becauſe God will put an end to ſin and ſinners, and clear the world of ſin and ſinners, wherefore he will diſſolve all theſe things. As long as wicked men live they will continue in ſin; ſhould a wicked man live a thouſand years, ſo long would he live in ſin; a drunkard would continue in his drunkenneſs, a ſwearer in his ſwearing, ſo long as there is any continuance of his City. Oh to what an height of wickedneſs would men arrive, if they and their Cities were of long continuance on the earth; they forget God already, and ſhould God lengthen out their time to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for ever, or for ſome thouſands of years, they would be ready to think themſelves were Gods, and not dying men: therefore the Lord doth not ſuffer ſinners nor their Cities to be of long continuance; and many times he cuts off notorious ſinners in the midſt of their daies: <hi>Bloody and deceitful men ſhall not live out half their daies</hi>; God ruineth their Cities and habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:96928:111"/>
they moulder away, and are not of long continuance.</p>
                     <p>It is likewiſe in love to the godly, that neither they nor their Cities ſhall be of long continuance here, becauſe God will quickly put an end to their ſufferings, their reproaches, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, their calamities, and deliver them from the body of death which makes them miſerable, and will ere long take them up to their deſired and expected happineſs, laid up in heaven for them. In a word; God will have no long laſting worldly City, or other worldly thing, that the miſeries of his children may be ſhort, and their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be of eternal duration; and that the joy and proſperity of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may be ſhort, and their ſorrow and torment may be eternal.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:96928:112"/>
looks upon them, but he looketh ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the mark; his eye ſtaieth at, and is fixed upon the mark: now the mark that the Apoſtle profeſſed hee looked at, was Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil</hi> 3.14. <hi>I forget that which is behinde, I preſs toward the mark for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> I conceive he alludeth to thoſe games and acts of hoſtility uſed among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> where there was firſt, a mark, ſecondly, a price; a mark which they look'd at, a price which they aimed at, in their exerciſes of ſhooting, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, running on foot, or on horſe-back, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Apoſtle, he had his mark that he aimed at, that was the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that hee might know him, and be found in him, and be made conformable to him: and the price that he ran for, was the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus, the Crown of eternal life and glory, that high price to which Chriſtians are called of God in Chriſt Jeſus. Now on the contrary, the Apoſtle ſheweth, that theſe viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and temporal things were not the mark that he aimed at, that was but a poor low thing, in compariſon of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory.

                     <p n="1">1. In a City there be divers ſtreets, divers houſes in thoſe ſtreets, wherein
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:96928:120"/>
ſome are bigger, ſome are leſſer; a City is large and ſpacious; ſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, <hi>In my Fathers houſe</hi> (the City of the great King) <hi>are many Manſions, Joh.</hi> 14.2. It is a moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent City, no greatneſs in the world can be compared with the greatneſs of it; it is the Royal Palace of the great God, who inhabiteth Eternity, whom the Heaven and the Heaven of Heavens are not able to contain, there he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth to dwell, and in a moſt glorious manner to communicate himſelf to his Angels, and his Saints.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Heaven is populous as a City: If you deſire to know the number of the Inhabitants of this City, S. <hi>John</hi> will tell you, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.9. that he ſaw in Spirit ſuch a great company of bleſſed Saints (that no man was able to reckon them) gathered together of all kinds of Nations, people and tongues, which ſtood before the Throne of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and of the Lamb, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrelled in white garments, and with Triumphant Palms in their hands, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing praiſe unto Almighty God. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto doth that of the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> agree, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Thouſand thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten thouſand-times

                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is full of glorious riches as a City: It is ſaid of <hi>Tyre,</hi> that the Merchants thereof were Princes; ſo all the Inhabitants of this City are No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſonages, there is no one among them of baſe Lineage or extraction, foraſmuch as they be all the Sons and Daughters of the Lord God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and inſtated into a rich and glorious Inheritance.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is a City compact, and at uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty within it ſelf: We muſt not think that the greatneſs of the number of theſe Citizens cauſeth any diſorder among them; for there the multitude is no cauſe of confuſion, but of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter order; there muſt needs be good agreement, there being none but God and good company there; there is no matter of diſcontent or diſcord among the Citizens; for theſe commonly ariſe about partition and diviſion either of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors or offices; <hi>here is ambition</hi>: or elſe of goods or poſſeſſions; <hi>here is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs:</hi> Now neither of theſe ſhall ever come there; for heavens happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs ſhall not be diminiſhed, nor any whit impaired by reaſon of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſharers in it; for as S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                        <pb n="225" facs="tcp:96928:121"/>
tells us, the glory of heaven ſhall be, <hi>Tanta ſingulis, quanta omnibus,</hi> ſuch to every one in particular, as it ſhall be to all in common; and although there ſhall be <hi>diſpar gloria ſingulorum,</hi> yet there ſhall be <hi>communis laetitia om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi>; they all live ſo lovingly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they are all as it were one heart, and one ſoul. All the Citizens of heaven live ſo harmoniouſly and peaceably together, that the very City it ſelf is called <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Viſion of Peace. Although all the Saints ſhall be like Chriſt in glory, yet one Saint will exceed another in glory. God will cloathe all his children alike, yet their garments ſhall be made propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to their ſtature; all the Saints ſhall be Veſſels of Mercy, yet one Saint ſhall be a larger and a more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious Veſſel than another.

Granting that ſome ſhall ſit at his right hand, and others at his left in his Kingdome, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth, that there ſhall be degrees of glory, to ſome more, to others leſs; they all ſhall have the ſame glory and happineſs, <hi>Ratione objecti faelicitat is &amp; gloria non ratione participationis:</hi> In
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:96928:122"/>
regard of the object of happineſs (God in Chriſt is the object of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) they ſhall all enjoy God; but in regard of the participation of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, one may and ſhall ſee him more clearly than another. <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many Manſions,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. <hi>Patris Domus,</hi> the Fathers Houſe is put for one and the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of glory: <hi>Pluralitas Manſionum</hi>; there be many Manſions, that ſheweth there are divers degrees of glory, ſaith <hi>Aquinas.</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. The end of building Cities was, that people might be free from the fear of their Enemies abroad, and live qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly among themſelves at home: Now this heavenly City is too high for any Adverſary to approach to, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore free from being aſſaulted with any Forreign Enemy: There is no Enemy can ſhoot an arrow into this City, nor ſcale the walls, nor incamp againſt it, nor make any battery in it, nor ſet it on fire, nor ſo much as draw a line about it; great is their peace, and nothing ſhall offend them.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It is a City in reſpect of its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: A City is a Corporation of men enjoying the ſame priviledges, living under the ſame Government.

what is there to be ſuppoſed of all the reſt, that is there reſerved for the ſight of immortal eyes? And if certain works of mortal men are made here ſo beautiful and ſightly, that they do even amaze the Spectators; what a work then muſt that be, that hath been wrought by the immediate hand of God himſelf, in that Magnificent Houſe, that Royal Palace, that City of joy and comfort, which he hath built for the glory of his choſen Ones?

You ſee by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that we are not to abide for ever in this world; neither are men, nor any creature of long continuance; your health, your ſtrength, your life, your eſtate, your houſes, your Lands, your City, your Country, are of no duration; your pains, your aches, your weakneſſes, your ſickneſſes, your Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals frequently before your eyes, do preach that we are not to continue here.

                        <head>SECT. I.</head>
                        <p>Now ſeek after this heavenly City.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It ſuppoſeth a ſenſe and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that we have loſt heaven: we were driven out of heaven, when we were driven out of Paradiſe; loſing Communion with God we loſt heaven: Sin hath made a wide Gulf between every ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> and heaven: now till men are under conviction of this loſs, they will never ſeek after heaven. When the woman in the Parable was convinced of the loſs of her groat, ſhe made earneſt and diligent ſearch after it. The Pſalmiſt tells us plainly, that men ſeek not God, becauſe they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not, they do not underſtand they have loſt him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.2. Many a poor creature never cometh to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their loſs of heaven, till they have loſt both heaven and their ſouls
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:96928:126"/>
for ever; and their firſt entrance into hell, is the firſt tidings of their loſs of heaven.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It implieth a trouble of mind for the loſs of heaven: it is the fear of hell that puts men upon the diligent ſeeking after heaven; if men were not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the loſs of any thing, they would never ſeek after it: Let it go, ſay they, we care not for it: If a man be not troubled for the loſs of a friends favour, he will never ſeek to regain it: This is one reaſon why ſo few ſeek hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, becauſe few are troubled at the loſs of it. Oh where is the man that ſigneth and crieth out, woe is me, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, for I have loſt heaven, and am in danger of hell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I can lay no claim to heaven, but hell layes claim to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Where is the man that is troubled in ſpirit, that he is without God, without Chriſt, without hope? therefore it is that this heavenly City is ſo little ſought after: it is only the troubled ſpirit that is an heaven-ſeeking ſoul.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It ſuppoſeth a knowledge of the worth and neceſſity of the thing we ſeek for: No man will ſeek for a thing of no value; let it go, will men ſay, ſuch a thing is not worth a ſeeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96928:127"/>
we can do well enough without it; but when men are once convinced of the worth and neceſſity of a thing, which they cannot be without, they will earneſtly ſeek after it: Now if there be any thing worth ſeeking for, it is this heavenly City: Who can be without heaven? Is there any thing more precious than God? Is there any poſſibility for our ſouls to be happy without enjoying God? Is not eternal life of unſpeakable worth? What more precious in this world than life? Is not life eternal in heaven moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious? O who can ſuffer the pains of eternal death? That man will never be perſwaded to ſeek heaven, who never thinks it worth the having and enjoying.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It implies vehement deſires of heaven: what a man deſireth not, that he ſeeks not: earneſt longings will put us upon ſeeking for every thing: in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things deſires are not ſeekings; but in ſpiritual things, earneſt deſires of God and heaven, are ſeekings of God and heaven: For, what are heavenly deſires, but the reachings of the ſoul after heaven, purſuings after God? <hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee: my ſoul thirſteth for thee;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96928:127"/>
my fleſh longeth for thee; my ſoul fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth hard after thee, Pſa.</hi> 63.1.8.</p>

                        <p>In the ſecond place I will ſhew you, wherein this ſeeking doth conſiſt.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It conſiſteth in an earneſt enquiry after the way to heaven. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.6.<note place="margin">Qui qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, vult ſcire, aut obtinere. <hi>Lamb.</hi> in <hi>Plaut.</hi>

                           <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found</hi>; the word in the original ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, <hi>quaerere interrogatione &amp; verbis,</hi> to ſeek by words and interrogation; as a wandring traveller will be enquiring of all he meeteth the way to ſuch a City: So they who ſeek after this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is to come, they will be very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive about the way to heaven, very deſirous to be directed in the right way. How did divers perſons come to Chriſt, <hi>Good Maſter, what ſhall I do to inherit eternal life? What ſhall I do to be ſaved? O that my feet were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected into the wayes of thy teſtimonies,</hi> ſaith <hi>David:</hi> The greateſt fear of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, is, leſt they ſhould be out of the way; therefore none more ſcrupulous and leſs confident than they; none ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of holy doubts than they, and more frequently putting forth holy que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. Uſually men are very confident
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96928:128"/>
that they are in the right way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, therefore they never ſeek out after it: It vexeth them very much, when they are put to the queſtion; are ye ſure that ye are in the right way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? I know not any thing in all the world, wherein the generality of men are more contentedly cheated, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their ſtate of Grace, and their ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to Heaven, few there be who have a care to buy gold tryed in the fire.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It conſiſteth in a diligent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious application of our ſelves to the uſe of all appointed means leading and directing us to this heavenly City: He that diligently prayeth, diligently ſeeketh heaven: he that diligently hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Word, diligently ſeeketh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hence in the New Teſtament the Goſpel is often called <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> and ſeeking God is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put for the worſhipping of God: Gods Ordinances are a <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, the top whereof reacheth to heaven, though the foot thereof be on earth; for by it we ſcale heaven: The Miniſtery of the word are a light and a Lanthorn to our ſteps, to guide our feet in the way to heaven: God hath ſet up the Miniſtery as way-marks to direct Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96928:128"/>
in the right way; thoſe that neglect Gods faithful Miniſters, do neglect the ſeeking heaven. Take this rule or caution; when you come to Gods Ordinances, make heaven and ſalvation, and ſeeking God the end of your coming to them, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 42.1, 2. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God, when ſhall I come before God. i. e.</hi> To enjoy God in his Ordinances; ſeek not ſo much the enjoyment of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, as of God in them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It implies an application of our ſelves to an holy and heavenly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: An holy life is the ſtrait way which leadeth to heaven; heaven is the reward of an holy and heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; it is not every foul dog with his ſoul feet that ſhall tread upon the pure pavement of the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>: He that doth not ſeek holineſs, doth not ſeek heaven; heaven is to be ſought for in an heavenly manner; heaven is a City hard to be won, the righteous wil ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſaved; hell is prepared for unholy perſons, <hi>forus canes,</hi> without ate dogs.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It conſiſteth in a conſtant uſe of all means, all holy duties, without faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or deſiſting, until you have found a title, and obtained a claim to heaven.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:96928:129"/>
The woman in the Parable did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from ſeeking, till ſhe had found her groat; and the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> never gave over ſeeking Chriſt, till ſhe had found him whom her ſoul loved: He that is ſlothful in ſeeking, may never find heaven.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. It conſiſteth in an early and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeking; begin to day while it is called to day: The greateſt part of the world do but play with Religion, they think it an eaſie thing to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and that to ſeek God and heaven is at the next door, and that they will be found at any time: No, no; the fooliſh Virgins loſt heaven by ſeeking it too late: Many do eternally loſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by delay of ſeeking. I make no doubt, but all do deſire heaven, nor do I make any queſtion but all or moſt of us do purpoſe to ſet ſome time apart to ſeek heaven: Why then not preſently? who knoweth what a day may bring forth? who knows how ſoon death may arreſt him? heaven is not eaſily found, it is not gotten with a few words or faint wiſhes.</p>

                        <p>Conſider, I beſeech you,<note place="margin">Mot. 1.</note> your conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance here is but ſhort: By what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant compariſons doth the Scripture ſet forth the ſhortneſs of mans life: it is but a vapour, ſaith S. <hi>James</hi>; it is but a dream, it is but the ſhadow of a dream, ſaid an Heathen: It is as graſs, or as a flower; it is as a tale, as a thought, as a bubble, it is but a Race, but as a Weavers Shuttle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle moment, all which things are of a very ſhort continuance. Have we not need then to day, while it is called to day, without delay to ſeek heaven, and life which continueth for evermore? But the miſery of man is great upon him, becauſe we flatter our ſelves with a kind of immortality: none ſo ſick and weakly, but hopeth for a recovery, none ſo aged, but thinketh he ſhall live a while longer.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. How long you ſhall continue here is uncertain; who knoweth when and how ſoon he ſhall depart hence? It may be to morrow, it may be this night, or this hour, who can tell? We do not <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">

Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture death and damnation.— The preſent time is thine only, this hour, this Sermon, this opportunity, this call from heaven, this very exhortation to ſeek heaven preſently.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Or ſuppoſe our continuance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth to be long, even as long as <hi>Methuſaleh</hi> continued; ſuppoſe thou hadſt the Reign of Time in thy hands, and couldſt ſlack the pace of Time at thy pleaſure, yet there were no conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance for thee alwayes here, but die you muſt, and die you ſhall: But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly you have not Time at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; you cannot command the Sun of Time to ſtand ſtill one moment, nor to go back fifteen degrees; time is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable if it be loſt: Loſt money may be recovered, but occaſions neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected are irrecoverable, and will never return again.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Conſider that properly we have no continuance here, becauſe our lives do not ſtand at a ſtay, but like <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 word">

                           <pb n="243" facs="tcp:96928:130"/>
we are continually going to our graves, as faſt as the wings of Time can carry us: No motion more ſwift than that of the Sun; our lives do run away as ſwift as the Sun it ſelf. The Sun (that is the meaſurer of time) once ſtood ſtill in <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s daies, and returned ten degrees in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s ſickneſs, yet time it ſelf ever paſt forward, and did never ſtand with the Suns ſtanding, nor return with his returning.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Conſider what is the reward of our neglect of ſeeking heaven; even an eternal abode in hell? For as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is a continuing City, ſo hell is a continuing Fiery Dungeon; theſe flames are of eternal continuance; theſe Chains of darkneſs are everlaſting Chains; there is the Worm that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dies, the Fire that never goes out; there is everlaſting deſtruction. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.33. <hi>Tophet is ordained of old.</hi>] Hell is as old as ſin; God made hell, as ſoon as the creature became ſinful: He hath made it deep and large] here is the vaſtneſs of this priſon: <hi>it is large</hi> enough to hold all wicked men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: <hi>it is deep,</hi> there is the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of eſcaping, of getting out of it; it is ſo deep, that it hath no bottom,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:96928:131"/>
therefore it is called the Bottomleſs Pit: <hi>the Pile thereof is fire and much wood</hi>; there is the ſuper-abundance of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the extremity of torment; <hi>and the breath of the Lord, like a river of brimſtone doth kindle it.</hi> Here is the Eternity of torment, while God breathes, the fire of hell ſhall burn. Now if you will eſcape hell, ſeek hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven while you may find it: we are all haſtening to a continuing City, or to a continuing priſon, to an everlaſting heaven, or an everlaſting hell: this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious City, and that burning Priſon, will ſhortly divide the whole world of men and women between them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of too earneſt ſeeking riches, they have wings, and will flee away from you; ſeek not houſes and Lands, for they will not abide for ever; let not your inward thought be,<note place="margin">Pſa. 49.11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

worth finding, worth enjoying, it will make amends for all your toil and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; heavenly ſeeking is a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kind of life, there is no comfort like that which is to be found in ſeeking heaven: What comfort will it yeeld to a Chriſtian in the hour of death, who can ſay, I have ſought, and I have found heaven? and what horrour will it be to a dying ſinner that hath neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to ſeek after heaven, when he ſhall cry out, O I have loſt heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I neglected to ſeek after it, I might have found it, had I ſought it: Oh what a fool was I, ſo willingly to deprive my ſelf of this endleſs glory for a few ſtinking luſts, and periſhing vanities!
