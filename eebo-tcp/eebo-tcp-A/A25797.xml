            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>Humbly Shevveth,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat however your Majesties most humble Petitioner, during the troubles of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and sad affliction of the Royall Family, hath often had eminent share in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement
of affairs, and may have many times failed, and been involved in divers
guilt common to many others. And however it hath been your Petitioners misfortune
to have acted in severall occasions, in matters and wayes, that were very obnoxious
to misinterpretations, and hath almost all along never wanted passionate Censurers;
yet as for many things committed by him, he hath recourse to your Majesties Royall
Clemency: So in many others he is confident he shall make it appear, that his actions
have not alwayes deserved the Censures, that have been put upon them, by some that
could not know the intimate Reasons, and true Motives, and carriage of things,
and others that were either not studious to be informed, or not unwilling to go along in
whatsoever might heap a disrepute upon your Petitioners Person or Actions.</p>
            <p>And however your Petitioner may have been traduced, as guilty of the most horrid
and unpardonable crimes, of accession to the execrable murther of your Royall Father, (whereof he hath already purged
himself by Oath in your Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi>) and hatred of your Majesties Sacred Person and Government: That your
Petitioner wisheth to be no freer from the deepest torments reserved for the most heinous sinners, then he is of the one, and
the other: whatsoever may have been the aspersions thrown upon him, and the outward appearance of many inevitable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
and transactions of late.</p>
            <p>That the nature of your Petitioners concernments, and condition being singular, and as he humbly conceiveth such, as
the consideration of them, will most properly fall under your Majesties own cognisance, in almost every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>That the Royall Clemency, by which your Majestie hath made way to your Reestablishment upon your Throne, doth not
only most powerfully attract your Peoples hearts, and cements to you, but will render your Majestie most glorious, and
formidable abroad, as being one of the noblest Beams sent down from the Father of lights, by which Kings resemble most
the King of Kings, with whom Mercy rejoyceth against Justice, and is over all his works, as that wherein he most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligheth.</p>
            <p>That seeing your Petitioners case is an object of compassion, and his Family hath for many Ages, not only been untainted
with the least shadows of disloyalty, but most signally serviceable to your Majesties most Royall Progenitors in their great
difficulties, and times of intestine, and forreign Warrs, and troubles.</p>
            <p>That seeing your Majesty hath both seen, and acknowledged the usefulness of some of your Petitioners faithfull endeavors,
to serve you in matters that concern'd you nearly, not many years ago.</p>
            <p>And seeing your Petitioner is perfectly resolv'd to acquiesce in, and submit to whatsoever your Majesty shall be pleased
to determine concerning him, and willingly undergo, or do whatsoever your Majesty shall be pleas'd to lay upon
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore your Majesties most humble Petitioner, doth most humbly beg your Majesty may be pleas'd graciously to accept of this
your Petitioners humble Submission, and pardon all his guilt, weaknesses, and failings. And if so be your Majesty require
any further clearing in any thing concerneth your Petitioner, your Majesty may by spetial Commission appoint such persons as
you shall think fit, to let him know in what points it lyeth most upon your Petitioner to clear himself, and then your Majesty
having weigh'd all, may your self speedily pronounce, whatsoever you shall think meet to determine concerning your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he shall not faile as long as he liveth to pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
