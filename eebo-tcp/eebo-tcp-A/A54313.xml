            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat this annexed Petition fairly writ, was preſented at the Bar of the Lords Houſe the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Inſtant.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioner is at a vaſt Charge in keeping his Witneſſes in Town, waiting for an Order, and a Day appointed, according to the prayer of the ſaid Petition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He therefore prays, That your Majeſty would be graciouſly pleaſed to call for the ſaid Petition, and cauſe it to be Read; and that a ſhort day may be appointed, that a fair Hearing may be had, to find out the Truth, and that Juſtice may be done accordingly: And let it not be ſaid in</hi> England, <hi>that the Innocent are puniſhed, and the Guilty go free: But call to mind how merciful God hath been, in Reſtrring your Majeſty; Even ſo in pity Reſtore your poor diſtreſſed Subject.</hi>
            </p>

               <signed>And he ſhall ever pray, &amp;c. JAMES PERCY.</signed>

            <postscript>
               <p>This Petition was preſented into his Majeſties Sacred Hand, <date>the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1680.</date>
               </p>
               <p>To loſe ſuch an Opportunity as offered on <hi>Thurſday</hi> laſt, and now to trouble ſo good a King ſo oft, doubles your Petitioner's ſorrows.</p>
               <p>And that which adds to your Petitioner's miſery, is, that he cannot diſpose of his Witneſſes, till a poſitive Order be had; for which he humbly prays.</p>

            <head>Note theſe three following Preſidents.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THe Lord of <hi>Newport</hi> begg'd the <hi>Percies</hi> Land of the King, for the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> when the Duke was in <hi>France:</hi> but at the Duke's return,<hi>Percy</hi> the Claimant waited upon the Duke, to know his pleaſure; and told him, That my Solicitor had betrayed me, for the <hi>Percies</hi> Lands were begg'd without the Claimant's conſent or knowledge. Then the Duke replied, <hi>Mr.</hi> Percy, <hi>you ſhall have a fair Tryal at Law:</hi> And moreover he did promiſe he would not ſtand upon Priviledge: but when <hi>Percy</hi> was ready for a Tryal, then Trumpt up Priviledge. And Mr. <hi>Roſſ</hi> the Duke's Agent ſaid, the Duke could not ſet aſide his Priviledge: But the Duke ſaid, if <hi>Percy</hi> proves himſelf Heir, I have no Right; and forthwith ſold his Intereſt for an inconſiderable Sum of Money.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 9 -->2. The Lord <hi>Ogle,</hi> that married the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Percy,</hi> would have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the name of <hi>Percy;</hi> and put in a Bill to be made an Act to ſettle the Lands upon him by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And it is reported that the Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi> deſired that ſome of thoſe Lands might be ſettled upon him by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>By this account the Lands are yet unſettled: <hi>Ergo</hi> then great reaſon it is, that the true Heir-Male of the <hi>Percies</hi> Bill ſhould be made an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſettle the Name, Title and Eſtate together again, according to the firſt ſettlement confirmed by his Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>Now your poor diſtreſſed and oppreſſed Petitioner humbly and freely offers, for the obtaining of Juſtice, and for the full ſatisfaction to the Kings moſt Excellent Majeſty, and the Right Honourable Lords Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and thoſe Honourable and Worthy Members of the Houſe of Commons in Parliament aſſembled, (if it be required and thought convenient, he being very unwilling to offer any thing that might give the leaſt offence, but rather ſubmit to their grave and mature Wiſdoms) theſe Propoſals following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James Percy</hi> the Claimant and Plaintiff, will pay into the hands of any Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees that ſhall be appointed to receive the Money in Truſt for Mr. <hi>John Blake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>'s Coſts, provided he likewiſe lay down the 90 <hi>l.</hi> taken by ſurprize out of Court before the Tryal was ended.</p>
            <p>And Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tting</hi>'s Coſt likewiſe ſhall be paid, for what Sir <hi>John Coppleſton</hi> claims; provided likewiſe that Sir <hi>John Coppleſton</hi> pay the 10 <hi>l.</hi> down, which he got when he ventured the Breach of Priviledge of Parliament: provided the whole Merits of the Cauſe may have a fair Hearing and Determination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords: And if the Plaintiff and Claimant <hi>James Percy,</hi> doth not prove himſelf to be the right true and next Heir-Male in Blond of the <hi>Percies</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> then let them take all the Money, and the Plaintiff will freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit his Claim for ever, and remain till death a Loyal Subject, and <hi>James Percy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although his Witneſſes be diſpers'd, a Weeks time will bring them to Town again, upon the ſight of an Order.</p>
            <p>For the Claimant <hi>James Percy</hi> (by Birth) ought to enjoy the Place, Seat and Priviledge of his Anceſtors, Earls of <hi>Northumberland;</hi> but now he dares not appear, till an Order be had.</p>
            <p>Therefore he moſt humbly prays, That a fair Hearing may be had, and that a true deciſion of his juſt Cauſe and Claim may be made, according to Juſtice: ſo that the Innocent may be preſerved, and that the fraudulent practices not juſt may march off with ſhame: For Heroick Actions glorifies God, Honours the King, and makes all the people ſhout for joy.</p>
            <p>God hath been pleaſed to make a true deciſion himſelf, which may be a preſident; for he ſent the Claimant from his Mothers Womb with a Creſcent into the World, which is Gods Enſign of Truth, and the very Badge belonging to the <hi>Percies</hi> Earls of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> In witneſs to this Truth, I have ſet to my Hand and Seal, this 3d. of <hi>January,</hi> 1680/1.</p>
