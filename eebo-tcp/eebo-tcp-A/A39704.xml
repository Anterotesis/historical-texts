            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis <hi>Comedy</hi> is taken out of several Excellent Pieces of <hi>Moliere.</hi> The main plot of the <hi>Damoiselles</hi> out of his <hi>Pretieusee's Ridiculee's;</hi> the Counterplot of <hi>Sganarelle,</hi> out of his <hi>Escole des Femmes,</hi> and out of the <hi>Escole des Marys,</hi> the two <hi>Naturals;</hi> all which like so many <hi>Pretieuse</hi> stones, I have brought out of <hi>France;</hi> and as a Lapidary set in one Jewel to adorn our <hi>English Stage:</hi> And I hope my set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, and giving them an <hi>English</hi> foyle, has nothing diminisht of their native luster. And I have not only done like one who makes a posie out of divers flowers in which he has nothing of his own, (besides the collection, and ordering them) but like the <hi>Bee,</hi> have extracted the spirit of them into a certain Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of mine own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:52960:4"/>For the Language of the <hi>Pretieuse,</hi> it may be wondred that I durst attempt the <hi>Englishing</hi> it (so often attempted by our best <hi>English</hi> wits, and as often despaired of) it being a Language even new unto the <hi>French</hi> themselves, and so little understood by most of them, as they are forc'd to make a Dictionary for it apart; which notwithstanding I have done, and I hope with that success, as I have not only made the Language of the Author, <hi>English,</hi> but even the spirit, life, and quickness of it too.</p>
            <p>For my Printing it before 'tis Acted, 'tis only to give the Auditors their Bill of Fare before hand; so far from taking away their Appetites of seeing it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as (on the contrary) if they like it, it increases it but the more; and if every one who writes for the Stage wou'd but do the like, there wou'd not be so much deceit in it as there is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor do I it to render it more publick, but only more legible, (few having patience to read more then a Letter in written
<pb facs="tcp:52960:4"/>
hand) and I may well say I have found out the secret of Printing, since <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> Copies communicated to many, and <hi>Printed</hi> only to few, are secrets alike.</p>
            <p>For the Acting it, those who have the Governing of the Stage, have their Humours, and wou'd be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and I have mine, and w'ont in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them; and were all Drammatick VVriters of my mind, they shou'd wear their old <hi>Playes</hi> Thred-bare, e're they shou'd have any <hi>New,</hi> till they better understood their own Interest, and how to distinguish betwixt good and bad.</p>
            <p>Mean time I suppose 'twill not be difficult for all who read this <hi>Comedy,</hi> to comprehend, how the VVorld's a a Theater, every place a Stage, all vvho read and understand, Actors
<pb facs="tcp:52960:5"/>
and Auditors, and there may be as good Playes now a daies <hi>not Acted,</hi> as <hi>Acted,</hi> at our Theaters, and by our Actors here.</p>

               <l>IN these sad Times our Author has been long</l>
               <l>Studying to give you some diversion;</l>
               <l>And he has ta'n the way to do't, which he</l>
               <l>Thought most diverting, mirth, and Comedy:</l>
               <l>And now he knows there are inough i'th Town</l>
               <l>At name of Mirth and Comedy will, frown,</l>
               <l>And sighing say, the times are bad what then?</l>
               <l>Will their being sad &amp; heavy better them!</l>
               <l>Or rather won't their sad and heavy cheer</l>
               <l>Make these our times worse then they ar appear?</l>
               <l>Sadness for Physick may be sometimes good;</l>
               <l>But cheerfulness shou'd be our daily food;</l>
               <l>Without whose most delightful seasoning,</l>
               <l>Even life it self were an insipid thing.</l>
               <l>'Tis a great happiness when men are sad,</l>
               <l>Divertisments may any wayes be had:</l>
               <l>And we do hope our Comedy to day,</l>
               <l>May so divert you, as you all shall say,</l>
               <l>Whilst every one some Recreation has,</l>
               <l>The best and most delightful ones, are Playes.</l>
