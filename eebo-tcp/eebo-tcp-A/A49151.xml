            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

forbear in the night time,
to deplore his servitude.
Sundrie <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and
principally those of
the sect of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi>
are pleased to give them
their Liberty: and many
good <hi>Anchorits</hi> have in
that imitated them.<note place="margin">Mendes, Pint. c. 98.</note> Yea

            <p>No man can denie but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62537:15"/>
wee have oftentimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
living Creatures pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
out of anguish, and
dispaire, after the losse of
this precious <hi>Liberty.</hi> And
certainly it is no wonder,
that they should all be so
passionate to retain it, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the very elements
themselves, whereof they
are composed, cannot, but
with great difficultie, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the least Constraint.
In vaine doth any man op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
himselfe to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations: For as <hi>Aire</hi>
and <hi>fire</hi> cannot be hindred
from aspiring, the Earth
alwayes searches the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the Course of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62537:15"/>
Waters will be so free,
that there is no resistance,
which to obtaine it doth
not surmount. By this it is
evident how essentiall a
thing Libertie is to our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
part. Now if wee
consider the superior that
informes us, and by which
we tearme our selves rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
we shall then no
longer wonder at this
common aversion of all
men living against ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude.
For without so
much as touching the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
of our <hi>free will,</hi>
and of that which is one
of the most frequent
Conceptions of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62537:16"/>
to wit, <hi>that the
spirit cannot be compelled
farther then</hi> (as after a sort)
<hi>it doth consent unto;</hi> wee
know by the example of
the <hi>Angels,</hi> that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall
substances are those which doe most of
all research the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</hi>
Was it not that
which moved the most
haughty of them all to
covet an elation even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Clouds, that he
might therby render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
like to the <hi>Almighty?</hi>
in effect,<note place="margin">Sum. par. 1. qu. 63. ar. 3.</note> (as saith <hi>Aquinas</hi>)
there was no appearance
to believe, that <hi>Lucifer,</hi>
and those of his Party had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62537:16"/>
ever any intention to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
themselves intirely
like unto God; the most
inferiour of men, infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with common sence,
would never imagine a
thought so extravagant:
how then should we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
it unto <hi>Intelligencies,</hi>
so pure, so illuminated as
those were (of whom we
speake) before their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace?
doubtlesse it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
from having af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to possesse from
their owne selves, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently,
the Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
which they onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
from the hands of
<hi>God.</hi> And hence it is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62537:17"/>
that the <hi>Devill</hi> is named
in holy-Writt <hi>Belial,</hi>
               <note place="margin">D. Hier. s. c. 4 ad Eph.</note> as
who should say, one that
desired to shake off the
Yoake, and depend no
more upon any. Now
since we thus naturally
seeke to be Free, and so by
consequence fly Servitude,
not onely like the rest of
Animalls, but much more
in respect of that whereby
we are distinguished from
them; and for that which
we communicate with the
Superiour <hi>Intelligencies,</hi>
it implies that man ought
to be the most free of all
sublunary Creatures. And
yet, notwithstanding all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62537:17"/>
this, it is possible, that
there is generally, and
in all respects, no greater
slave than man himselfe.
But of this we shall better
inform our selves if in the

            <head>In what our Liberty and our
Servitude doth
consist. CHAP. II.</head>
            <p>THere is a double li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
to wit, that of
the <hi>Bodie,</hi> and that of the
<hi>mind;</hi> whereof there is a
third composed, which is
mixed of these two; the
Doctrine of <hi>Contraries</hi>
would have us constitute
so many different <hi>species</hi> of
Servitude. As touching
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62537:18"/>
the corporall liberty, it is
lost by the law of nations
at what time any have been
superiour in warre, and
who instead of putting all
their enemies to the
Sword, reserved some unto
whom life hath been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
This Reservation
made the first Servants,
or Captives, if we credit
the <hi>Latine Grammer:</hi>
and the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plato l. 6. de leg.</note> have affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that <hi>Iupiter</hi> tooke

whether it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62537:19"/>
were so or not, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is contrary to that
antient Privilege of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
whereof we have
have newly spoken; and it

Philosophers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">.2. Hist.</note> of whom <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi>
speaks, to prohibit by

<hi>Servants.</hi> I know very well
that <hi>St Augustine</hi> maketh
sinne to be the Authour of
this kind of servitude;<note place="margin">.19. de Civit. dei. c. 15</note> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
that there was no
such thing in the world
before the crime of <hi>Cham,</hi>
what time he derided his
Father,<note place="margin">Gen. c. 9.</note> who threw so great
a malediction upon all his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62537:19"/>
               <hi>Posterity.</hi> But since
Warres, and discords have
no other <hi>Origin,</hi> than only
Sin it selfe, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the Latine Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
(of which we speak)
which doth not very well
accommodate with the
Text in <hi>Genesis:</hi> We are
onely to observe, that
<hi>Christianity</hi> hath extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it out of most Places,
where the Corporall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude
hath been well
knowne, retaining very
few <hi>slaves</hi> within all her
extent; besides those,
whom the inormity of
their Crimes have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
such. Thus hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62537:20"/>
liberty been reesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
which Consists in
being absolute master of
ones Proper Person, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that which the most
miserable amongst us may
in some sort attribute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himself, if their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
have not engaged
them into the hands of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidells.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Liberty of the <hi>mind</hi>
consists in the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or in the will: if these
two faculties do not joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
possesse it according as
the most Part of <hi>scholasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi>
affirme. Tis by her,
that the <hi>demy-Gods</hi> of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
have vaunted
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62537:20"/>
themselves of being free,
even in the midst of Irons,
and chaines; Fortune hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no dominion over the
Operations of our Soules;
and all the Puissances of
the Earth find themselves
too impotent, to make it
suffer the least violence.
For although it appeares
that this Liberty consisteth
in being, or not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to apply these two
parts of the spirit indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
upon all things; yet
that is not absolutely true:
for certaine it is, that our
understanding cannot all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
impedite it selfe,
that it should not <hi>Acquiesce</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62537:21"/>
at the Conclusion of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative
<hi>Syllogisme,</hi>
having before compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the first and second
<hi>Propositions.</hi> Our Volunty
cannot (after some sort)
embrace the evill, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it as evill, but doth
it alwayes, when it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
to be masked under
some appearance of Good.
And yet for all this, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
obligeth us to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that our Spirit doth
no way hinder us, but that
we may possesse a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and intire freedome;
because, should these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
import in them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
exception, this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62537:21"/>
absurdity would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
that <hi>God</hi> himselfe
should not be perfectly
free, who knowes, and
loves himselfe, necessarily,
and by the universall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of all divines. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
this is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime
stated in <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
that the naturall Powers
never exceed the Limits
of their formall object, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
cohibiting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
within those Bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds,
which <hi>God</hi> hath prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto them: Now we
must know that our <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi>
hath no other object
certaine, nor formall, than
the Conception of that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62537:22"/>
which is true; from
whence it comes to passe,
that they named <hi>verity, the
sweet food and refection of
our Soule;</hi> nor hath our will
any other certaine, and
fixed <hi>butt,</hi> then to unite it
selfe with that which is
good, naturaly abandoning
what soever repugnant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. It follows then (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reversing the order of
nature) that our <hi>Spirit</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
otherwise act, then as
we have already spoken;
and which indeed doth no
way ruine it's Libertic, as
by a morall reason wee
shall suddenly explicate,
according to which we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62537:22"/>
shall find, that to serve <hi>God</hi>
is to reigne, and to obey
the just lawes of nature,
passes for a Species and
kind of Liberty. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we doe not imagine,
that a <hi>Bird</hi> should be lesse
free to fly, wher he listeth,
for not having power to
doe it under the waters;
nor that a terrestriall ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall,
should be lesse free
(in order to his walking
up and down according to
his fancy) because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
mount up into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
supposing him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a desire so irregular.
The same reason ought we
to frame, touching our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62537:23"/>
spirituall freedome, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is
wholy uninteressed, seeing
the will cannot be joyned
to evil, nor the intellect
be satisfied with that
which is false, if neither of
these two parts be deluded
by the appearance of good
and true, for as much as it
is wholy repugnant to
their nature.</p>
            <p>These exceptions deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
it is very evident, that
humane liberty cannot
consist in any other thing,
than the independency of
our Actions, as well those
of the body, as those of the
mind; since we ought not
to render an accompt to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62537:23"/>
any, but unto <hi>God,</hi> and our
owne Selves, that is to say,
to this eternall reason,
from which we all derive
a beam of illumination, at
the very instant of our
Production into this of
the world; it was therefore
very necessary to know
(that so we might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be able to examine that
which followes) whether
there be any one who can
vaunt himselfe of being
truly free.</p>

by this my sterious

long as he had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to depend solely of

ground themselves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
upon the value and
sweetnesse of this <hi>Liberty,</hi>
when they affirme that the

pleased, and is in effect,
more in the Object where
she loves, then where she
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62537:25"/>
informes and animates;
for that there is nothing
besides meere necessity
which retaines her in this

conveighed by
inclination, and a certaine
voluntary movement, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the person where
she hath placed her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
But if <hi>Liberty</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that we thus esteeme
of her, is it not a thing
most strange, that we find
so few men who are free?
or (to say better) that the
whole <hi>Vniverse</hi> should be
so desperately plunged in
<hi>Servitude,</hi> that (to take it
well) there is no difference
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62537:25"/>
between us who beleeve
our selves to be exempted
from it, and the very <hi>slaves</hi>
themselves, than accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the proportion of
<hi>more and lesse?</hi> For let us
now be but as attentive
here, as indeed the subject
doth justly merit, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
weigh this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
point but as equitably
as Philosophy requireth
we should doe, in all that
which concernes her;
where shall we find any
kinde of Life, which doth
not assubject those that are
addicted unto it? what
profession shall we find,
which hath not her chains,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62537:26"/>
and tyes whereby thee
doth even captivat those
whom she imployes? One
would think that the most
vile estate of life were
the most exposed to the
miseries of Servitude; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there she appeares
as it were all naked and
with a very little qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
should we yet farther
examine other qualities
of life, and but a little lift
up the deceiptfull maske
which disguises them, we
should then easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne,
that there were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
no condition of life
whatsoever, which did not
oblige us to a so much the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62537:26"/>
greater subjection, by
how much the more it is
elevated above others, and
which hath not its fetters
in this, more rude and full
of affliction, by how much
the more precious they
appeare. The manacles
of <hi>Astyages</hi> were not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the lesse weighty, and
paynable, for being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of gold or silver;
<hi>Reniego de grillos aunque
sean de oro,</hi> sayes the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
proverb; and in effect,
there is no kind of great
constraint more insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
then that which
attends upon great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
and which is found
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62537:27"/>
mixed as it were with the
most absolute power, by
reason of the opposition
of contraries, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
their qualities the
more active. Thence it is,
that they very properly
cal dignities <hi>charges,</hi> their
weight augmenting, with
the prize of their exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
&amp; may be said to be,
(admit them more esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable

the lives, &amp; goods of their

of Kings to their

(in good <hi>Philosophy</hi>) <hi>if the

Caesar, Caesar belongs much
more to the Republique.</hi> Let
us therefore consider a
little how many there are
who precipitate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
without any obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
thereunto, into a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62537:28"/>
voluntary <hi>servitude.</hi> Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
is the number of those
who sell their <hi>Liberty,</hi> to
acquire oftentimes so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
a matter,
that they would not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
have purchased it
with their very <hi>Counters.</hi>
They thirst after a slight
reward, or some other tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall
favour, and for which
we should be sorry that we
had given the least parts of
our goods, causes us abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly
renounce all our own
wills to follow that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Nay, we are so stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,<note place="margin">Epist. 42.</note> sayes <hi>Seneca,</hi> that it
should seeme wee doe not
perceive, how in so doing,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62537:28"/>
there remaines nothing
more sordid and vile than
ourselves, even by our own
confession; seeing we va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
our selves of lesse
esteeme, than our monyes,
and the rest of that which
we possesse.</p>
            <p>But beyond all these
servitudes which perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
hold us under sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
from without,
there are likewise servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
interiour, from
which happily there is no
man living can affirme
himselfe to be truly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt.</p>
            <p>Who is he that is not a
slave to his passions? and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62537:29"/>
where is the man that doth
not at some time or other,
experience the tyrann yof
these rude <hi>Masters</hi> of whom
<hi>Diogenes</hi> reproached <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander?</hi>
One serves loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his <hi>Ambition,</hi> another
is importun'd with <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice;</hi>
This man dresses al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
to <hi>Fortune,</hi> That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<hi>Gluttony</hi> to dominier
over him; and there is, who
suffers himselfe to be
transported by the rage,
and violence of Love. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there is no servitude
so difficult, as that which
we are constrained to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
under such merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Tyrants, nor is there
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62537:29"/>
any man who can boast of
being free whilst he shall
be compelled to live under
their domination. What
if we should here intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Arguments of
the Stoicks, who prove
that vice is such an enemy
to freedome, that they are
two things altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible:
it wil then be
easy to discerne how far
we are deviated from this
liberty; seing the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
amongst us is so deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engaged into it.<note place="margin">Arr. l. 2. c. 1. &amp; 26. &amp; l. 4 c. 1.</note> There
is not a man (say they) who
deserves to be reputed
free, but he only that lives
according to his owne
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62537:30"/>
pleasure: now it is very
certain that no man would
live in Vice, or that (at the
least) desires the world
should take notice of him
for a vicious person, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a thing the most unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
&amp; shamefull in the
World. It followes then,
that in good reason we
ought not to call any man
free but such onely as have
utterly abandoned Vice,
and then we shall easily
perceive whether there be
any who of right may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to themselves the
quality of free men. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictetus</hi>
very pleasantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided
the <hi>Nicopolitans,</hi> who
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62537:30"/>
used to sweare by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of <hi>Caesar</hi> that they
were in full possession of
their <hi>Liberty;</hi> seeing the
very naked tearme of their
Oath, did evidently demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
that they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the absolute power
of the <hi>Emperour.</hi> But there
is a great deal more reason
to laugh at those who would
passe for the most free of
the World, because they
doe indifferently prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,
and obey their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
apetites, &amp; for that
they deny nothing, even
not to one of their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
it being from thence
whence one may most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62537:31"/>
dently derive an absolute
argument of their misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
slavery; there being no
<hi>servitude</hi> more base, and
dangerous, than that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Vice doth ingage us.
Therefore be it that we
discourse of the liberty of
the <hi>body,</hi> perhaps those
who are in Chaines are not
yet the most abject; or
regard we the freedome of
the mind, there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
which doth not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
some <hi>species,</hi> &amp; kind
of constraint. Is there any
man that can deny but
that all such as are found
living in an erronious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,
and without the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62537:31"/>
light of our true <hi>Religion,</hi>
be not as so many Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
soules that are daily
forced to admit of false
principles, or beleeve a
thousand absurdit yes? But
if the humane liberty be
a composition of those of
the body, and of the <hi>mind</hi>
together, there will not be
found a man who ought to
esteem himself free, which
doth not equally possesse
both the one and the other.
Thus it is they justifie by
so many considerations,
that there is likely no man
who can truly affirme
himselfe to be free. And
because if this proposition
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62537:32"/>
received the least excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it cannot otherwise
proceed than from those
who professe to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a Liberty <hi>Phylosophique.</hi>

            <p>ALthough it appears
by our precedent
discourse, that one might
well affirme of all men,
as heretofore of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
to wit, that they are

to servitude; some <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
themselves having

for certaine presa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the captivity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we are to live the rest
of our dayes; yet there
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62537:33"/>
were some amongst them
who attributed unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a prerogative (like
so many <hi>Spartans</hi>) solely
to possesse an entire, and
absolute liberty. It is in
order to this opinion,
that <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Iew</hi> hath
composed a treatise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely,
to shew that every
honest, and vertuous man
is undoubtedly free; and
this it was which caused
the <hi>Stoickes</hi> to affirme, that
besides their <hi>Sage</hi> there was
none who was truely a
<hi>King;</hi> as indeed according
to their mode, he was the
onely man that might
(with reason) be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62537:33"/>
               <hi>rich, faire, happy, loyall,</hi>
and <hi>magnanimous;</hi> The rest
of men not retaining for
their share, other than
shadowes and deceivable
appearances of al these at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes;
this wise man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in all so far above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, that he might
justly glory of being equall
to the greatest of the <hi>Gods;</hi>
In that <hi>Dion</hi> was nothing
inferiour to him,<note place="margin">Plutar. des com. conc. contra les Stoiq.</note> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Paradox of
<hi>Chrysippus.</hi> Nay, and when
it so pleased these proud
<hi>Philosophers,</hi> they have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
had the boldnesse to
assert, that there <hi>wise man</hi>
was more considerable
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62537:34"/>
here than <hi>love</hi> himselfe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Iupiter</hi> was neither
free nor happy, but by the
excellence and priviledge
of his nature; whereas
their <hi>Sage</hi> (such as they
imagin'd him to be) enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his liberty as well as his
felicity, by the vertue of
his mind, and might have
yet bin otherwise than he
was, had he not elevated
himselfe to a degree so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent.
<hi>Seneca</hi> (as a <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icke</hi>)
hath in many places
repeated this <hi>maxime;</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that <hi>Iupiter</hi> himselfe
never exceeded his wise
man, but in this sole poynt
(to wit) that the first was
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62537:34"/>
free, and happy by a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
duration of time, than
the other; which thing
(sayes he) renders it not a
whit the more perfection,
seeing (on the conrrary) it
is alwayes to be esteemed
a great artifice, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
much in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
compasse. Now to
the end it should not
be imagined that it was
onely the <hi>Stoickes</hi> which
had declared themselves
with so much presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
touching the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
liberty; you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in <hi>Iamblychus</hi> (who
has writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the life of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>)<note place="margin">c. 35. de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Pyth.</note>
how he and his <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:62537:35"/>
persuaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that they were as so
many <hi>Gods</hi> upon earth,
where they had right to
excercise an absolute em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
over the rest of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
and therefore it is
well known they have
affected the soveraigne
command in all places,
where they have been able
to establish themselves;
and that they might exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
this power with the
more freedome, they held
by tradition, and by a <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
confirmed amongst
them, that all such as were
not admitted or (according
as they then used to speak)
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62537:35"/>
initiated into their myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
ought to be respected
&amp; used but as meer beasts;
to which purpose they had
so frequently in their
mouths that verse of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
where <hi>Agamemnon</hi> is
called a <hi>Pastor of the people;</hi>
to intimate (according to
their words) that they
ought to treate them like
the rest of Animals; and
that he which commanded
them, might dispose of
them, as best him seemed
good. In fine we gather
both from the <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Roman</hi> histories, that to
speake of <hi>Philosophers</hi> in
generall, they would live
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62537:36"/>
so freely, and so farr ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the liberty of their
profession, that <hi>Athens</hi>
(the most free City of all
<hi>Greece</hi>) could not endure
them; and that the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
constrained to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
them out of her <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories.</hi>
For I will say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi>
nor of K. <hi>Antiochus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simachus;</hi>
who entertained
them not a whit more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorably;
because one may
perhaps presuppose, that
the martial humour of the
first, and the small incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
which these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
had to the <hi>Sciences,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:62537:36"/>
importuned them (without
any other consideration)
to despise, and neglect men
of a life purely conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
The History of those
who retired themselves
into <hi>Persia,</hi> under the
raign of <hi>Cosroes,</hi> is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
to this purpose:
behold what I recollect
from thence. In the time
of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> the greatest
<hi>Philosophers</hi> within all the
extent of his dominions,
highly disgusted the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
manners of their age;
but especially (as <hi>Agathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
observes)<note place="margin">L. 2. hist.</note> the opinions
at that time received in
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, touch|
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62537:37"/>
touching the Divinity.
To the end they might
be more at Liberty, and
have nothing which might
importune them in their
fashion of living, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in poynt of their
<hi>Religion,</hi> they tooke their
refuge into <hi>Persia.</hi> A very
short time after made
them acknowledge how
much they had mistaken
themselves; finding there,
neither that innocence of
life, no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> yet that repose w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
they so fully expected to
meet withal. And altough
<hi>Cosroes</hi> received them with
all possible humanity, and
courtesie, endeavoring by
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62537:37"/>
all meanes to retaine
them; yet they esteemed it
for the greatest favour hee
could doe them, that he
would grant them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
to returne back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to the place from
whence they were fled; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse
(according as
this Historian observes)
their journey was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
inutill; for <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes</hi>
calling them to mind
a little after their Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in a treaty of peace
which he contracted with
the <hi>Romans,</hi> stipulated by
expresse article (of which
he had very great care)
that none of those <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:62537:38"/>
should in the least
manner be violated, nor
constrained to abjure the
opinions unto w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered,
&amp; embraced as the
best. This story puts me
in mind of the insolent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
which once, a most
impious <hi>Portuguese</hi> made
at <hi>Lions</hi> unto <hi>Henry the
third:</hi> to wit, that it might
be permited him, not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
any other <hi>Divinitie</hi>
in his dominions, save
that only of the Sun: for
without doubt, there may
be both an excesse, &amp; a sin
too, in desiring a liberty
so extreamly unconcern'd,
as that should neither sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62537:38"/>
it selfe to the lawes of
heaven, nor to those of
reason. The transcendent
indulgence of so great a
freedome (to use <hi>Plato's</hi>
owne expressions) is the
source,<note place="margin">8. de Rep &amp; ibi. Fic.</note> and fountaine of
an extreame servitude;
because it renders us slaves
unto our owne selves, and
proper passions: and the
greatest <hi>libertine</hi> of all the
<hi>Philosophers, Epicurus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
hath accknowledged,
that to return truly to on's
self, and be perfectly free, a
man should submit to the
ordinances of <hi>Philosophy.</hi>
And in truth,<note place="margin">Paulus 2. ad cor. c. 3. v. 17</note> we learn out
of a much better passage;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62537:39"/>
that wheresoever the spirit
of <hi>God</hi> is found,<note place="margin">Paulus 2. ad Cor. c. 3. v. 17</note> there it is
where we find an absolute
freedome indeed. But thats
to be understood of a <hi>filiall</hi>
liberty, which alwayes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
accompanyed with an
extreame reverence and
respect, &amp; such as is known
by its opposition unto
that servile fear, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
quits, nor forsakes the
<hi>Vngodly.</hi> For we know in
another place, from a text
which was dictated by the
selfe same spirit of <hi>God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob c. 11. v. 12.</note>
that there remaines onely
man alone, whome vanity
hath so farr deprived of
judgment, that he glories
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62537:39"/>
of being borne so free, as
that he imagines he hath a
right to live according to
his owne fancy; and who
beleeves that it were an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
of violence towards
his person to prescribe
him <hi>Lawes</hi> or make him
submit unto any sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
what soever. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he is compared to
those young foales which
endeavour to shake off
their yoake, not having
as yet bin accustomed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; and his brutality
is admirally well repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to us by that of the
<hi>wild Asse,</hi> whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
running through
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62537:40"/>
the desarts without bit
or bridle. And albeit we
receive from <hi>Seneca</hi> all
these lofty sayings of the
<hi>Stoiques</hi> which we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
produced; yet hath
he in a thousand places
confessed that there was no
true Liberty, which did
not acknowledge the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of <hi>Reason.</hi> If thou
wouldest submit all things
unto thy selfe<note place="margin">Ep. 37.</note> (saith he in
one of his Epistles) make
it thy profession to obey
this <hi>Daughter</hi> of Heaven:

that the most essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall

consists, in willing
that which is the good
pleasure of his divine <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</hi>
And seing the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
which the same

him affirme elsewhere,<note place="margin">

one of the <hi>Antonines</hi> be
true,<note place="margin">Iul. Capitol. in Ant. Pio.</note> that neither <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>

ever have the power to

we ought not then
adhere to the affirmative

nothing more in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,

lofty swelling words, more
proper to pusfe and swell

<hi>Diogenes</hi> is represented us
(in the conference which
he had with this great
<hi>Monarch</hi>) discoursing with
him as with his inferiour.
Being once a slave, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
his <hi>Master</hi> who
was to sell him (unto him
that offered most) to
demand <hi>whether in stead
of a servant any body had
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62537:44"/>
need of a Master:</hi> boasting
himselfe to be no more
a <hi>Captive</hi> at that time,
than an enchained <hi>Lion;</hi>
who alwayes makes his
<hi>Keepers</hi> more afraid of
him, than he apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his <hi>Keepers.</hi> For all this
it is possible that we may
on the one side be free, and
and yet in slavery on the
other: Thus one thinkes
himself free from <hi>ambition</hi>
who is basely enthrall'd to
the passion of <hi>Love,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice;</hi>
and the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is, to find out whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our humanity be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to enjoy by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62537:44"/>
so free and independent,
as they are used ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to decipher us out in
the <hi>Schooles.</hi> But to speake
soberly concerning this
matter; it appeares this
<hi>free man,</hi> which Shee
represents us under the
name of <hi>Sage,</hi> to be rather
an <hi>Idëa</hi> of that which may
be the scope of our desires,
than any thing in good
earnest: our Jmagination
for the most part formes
unto her selfe a subject
which she takes pleasure
to embelish with such an
equipage of rare qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
to render it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished,
that its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62537:45"/>
the ordinary power
of <hi>Nature</hi> to render it a
true <hi>existence.</hi> And there
is much reason to beleeve,
that this <hi>wise man,</hi> or this
free person (of whom the
<hi>Phylosophers</hi> speake) is not
lesse difficult to find out,
than the <hi>Orator</hi> of <hi>Cicero,</hi>

all this I beleeve

passe for perfect <hi>copyes</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished

which the ages past

that we may well number
them amongst the most

particular of the <hi>Divine
munificence</hi> (whensoever it
pleaseth him to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
himselfe here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath)
that there is farre
more reason to adore the
bounty of <hi>God;</hi> than to
imagine it the least me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of the <hi>Creature.</hi> In
effect, what is more
strange than these great

This great man

which those of their <hi>Sect</hi>
made profession of. His

have bin communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto us by the same
<hi>Arrien,</hi> who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
foure bookes of

them in writing, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Painter</hi> uses to

of a <hi>Soule,</hi> by so much the
more free, &amp; heightned, as
his adverse fortune endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored
(it should seeme) to
suppresse it. This was a
<hi>Ball</hi> which rebounded
towards heaven, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably
to the force
wherby it was cast against
the earth. In effect, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he saw himselfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the hard conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Servitude, and to be

heard no lecture

that the generosity and
liberty of the Soule, which
<hi>Epictetus</hi> made alwayes to
appeare notwithstanding
his corporall servitude,
and of which he hath left

precepts in writing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
him such a repute,
that the very <hi>lamp</hi> of earth,

was sold for three thousand

            <p>I could yet let you see by
sundry other examples,
that which these already
prove touching the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophique

to the intent he might
procure this freedome, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
quitted his <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
to him that would
accept thereof. Liberty
caused <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Prometheus,</hi> to resigne
their Scepters into the
hands of their brothers.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62537:54"/>
And <hi>Empedocles</hi> renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the government of a
<hi>Monarchy</hi> (which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
him) for the love
he bare unto her. I might
add that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> made
almost the same reply to
<hi>Hiero; Diogenes</hi> to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater;
Zeno</hi> to <hi>Antigonus;
Stilpon</hi> to <hi>Ptolomy; Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,
Ephorus,</hi> and <hi>Mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi>
to <hi>Alexander,</hi>
which <hi>Socrates</hi> did unto
<hi>Archelaus:</hi> but I suppose
to have sufficiently cleared
<hi>two things;</hi> the <hi>one,</hi> that
this liberty is not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
intire; because she
is oftentimes only <hi>intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall;</hi>
the other, that she
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62537:55"/>
is so rare, because of her
solutive faculty from

very well indulge those

There is nothing to which

and a fairer bait ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
the poore fish to

the passion which all these

that which they most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
is not comparable to
the desires of <hi>Courtiers,</hi>
who bequeath the fairest
dayes of their life, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
renounce their

beliefe which they have
to bee one day able to
satisfie the uttermost of
their desires: For albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62537:58"/>
experience hath taught
the world, that the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>great men</hi> is like

those who plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into this vast Ocean
of the <hi>Court,</hi> ever arrive
at their desires, and can
boast themselves of having

so the good

occasion may offer it selfe
(another time) to proclame
the vertue thereof, and to

            <p>For my part, I doe not
beleeve that any (except

the <hi>Court,</hi> or so much as
heard speake of the aire,

can be ignorant of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
personall subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he is obliged to
render day and night, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those men whose favour
he desires to obtaine.
There is no body in that
<hi>Country</hi> but ought to be
even ready to mutilate,
and dismember him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
like <hi>Zophyrus,</hi> that
by so doing hee might
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62537:61"/>
insinuate, and serve to the
advance of what he there
searcheth; Not, that where
the service of ones <hi>Prince</hi>
is concern'd, a man should
not be obliged even to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
both his life, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
for a subject so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:
all Nations have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimosly
consented to
this politique principle
(<hi>to wit</hi>) that there is no
death more glorious, more
meritorious, than that
which is received for the
affection to his <hi>Souveraign</hi>
and love of his <hi>Country:</hi>
Notwithstanding, there is
a great deale of difference
betwixt the actions which
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62537:62"/>
have so noble an object,
albeit they cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than testifie a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary

whereof we shall here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<hi>Examples,</hi> which have
for their foundation no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an infamous

to weare a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
by reason of a wound
which he had received on

of those of his <hi>Court</hi> come
abroad with the like, as if
they had all of them had
the same occasion. His
son <hi>Alexander</hi> contracted
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62537:62"/>
this ill habitude to carry
his head awry, which was
the cause that there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not a man in all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage,
but such as incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their necks likewise
to the same side. The
Young <hi>Dionysius</hi> was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
pur-blind, and the
wine which he loved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively
did much shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
his sight; by and by,
all his <hi>followers</hi> feigned
themselves blind, every
man jossling his fellow,
and stumbling at every
foote:<note place="margin">1. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

also to sit in the place
where the King used to
spit upon them, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the like sordidityes,
which it were a shame to

blindnesse puts me
in mind of that which one
writ of the Emperour
<hi>Hadrian:</hi> the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
love which he had for
<hi>Antinous</hi> (whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his exquisite
beauty; or for that he
offered himselfe a <hi>Victime</hi>
at the <hi>sacrifice</hi> which was
celebrated for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longation
of the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi>

sooner declared himselfe
thereupon, but immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
those of his Court pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
(contending who
should first bring the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings)
that they had seene

is, that besides this shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

captivity of all the

in his owne power, that
(to take it rightly) he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth
it not but as a thing

having engaged the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
which he possessed
there. For (without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

which consume even

he should expose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62537:65"/>
almost every moment)
the sole complaisance doth
sometimes cause him as it
were out of frailty to
deprive himselfe even of
a part of his body. <hi>Lucian</hi>
tels us that the Eunuch

did the same, and volunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
deprived themselves of
that, which onely rendred

might not lose their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations,
and continue

shall suffice to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
how great the servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the <hi>Body</hi> is.</p>
            <p>It will be needlesse to
insist much upon that of
the mind; seing this is
the most common of all
other <hi>Maximes</hi> of the
<hi>Court;</hi> never to have other
will, than that of <hi>great
mens;</hi> nor to judge of
any thing whatsoever (if
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62537:66"/>
there be any meanes to
avoyde it, untill they have
first passed there opinion;
that so nothing may be
spoken which may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
There is perhaps
no religious <hi>vow</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that exacts of us any
so entire a renuntiation of
all the actions of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>will,</hi> as doth the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of the <hi>Court,</hi> and the
designe of making a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
there. From thence

this is a thing universally

that the <hi>Court</hi> is a place
of perpetuall dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where one allwayes
walkes with the visage

unlesse it be that by which
we embrace a voluntary
<hi>servitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as touching the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
of the <hi>Intellect,</hi>
they are in Court so much
the more subject, as the
prostitution of this part
is effected without much
violence, in those who
make all other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
whatsoever, to give
place to those of profit;
such is the most frequent
custome of the <hi>Court,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that a man is never so
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62537:67"/>
little engaged in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments
of this <hi>Circes;</hi>
and verily, I lesse wonder
at some men, who indulge
themselves this liberty,
to represent the terrestrial
<hi>Gods</hi> rather such as they
ought to be, than such as
really they are. These (I
say) are not the most cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ble
(although sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

content themselves in sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
their <hi>vices,</hi> imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Virtues,</hi> and discover
every day goodly names
which serve for coverture
unto all their defaults.
But this is a thing altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deplorable, having
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:62537:68"/>
respect to the liberty
whereof we speake, when
we submit even unto the
basenesses of the mind, and
to flatterings so enormous
and ridiculous, that one
even appeares to have
made bankrupt all manner
of judgement. <hi>Alexander</hi>

to heare one of those
infamous cajolleries,<note place="margin">L. ib. 6.</note> when
one of his court (whom

thunder so loud. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>

are conformable
those words of <hi>Hesychius,</hi>
touching the impiety of

we know also, that at an

entry of <hi>Demetrius</hi> into
<hi>Athens,</hi> one told him, there
was none other <hi>God</hi> save
himselfe; or that, if any,
they were busie in sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

is, that crimes so easily

               <hi>Herodotus</hi> (whorelateth

furnish us with another
upon the same subject:
<hi>Cambyses</hi> having placed
for his butt or marke,
the heart of a young <hi>boy</hi>
which he transfixed with
a dart in the presence of
his <hi>Father,</hi> demanded of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62537:70"/>
him, what his opinion
was of the shot, to whom
the father answered,
that he did not beleeve e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>Apollo</hi> himselfe could
have levelled more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Truly I am of <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca's</hi>
judgement, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the cruelty of the

At the least no
man can deny, that these
are not examples suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
pregnant, to shew
what may be expected
from the liberty of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62537:71"/>
judgements of the <hi>Court;</hi>
where we ought to resist
even the most just, and
sensible movements of
nature, to the end we may
say nothing which may
displease such as are fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and adored there. If
<hi>Alexander</hi> will be taken
for one of the <hi>Gods,</hi> the

the rayes of the deity, and

It seemes that he would

the Position which they are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:62537:73"/>
same manner as every man may
when he writes, make such, or such
a letter of the <hi>Alphabet</hi> precede,
which best him pleaseth; <hi>Kings</hi>
are in possession to bestow the
principall places of honour, and
authority within their states,
unto those whom some particular

time, whatsoever may be (for <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi>
makes it evident that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
is not alwayes equall) we
ought not lesse to submit our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,

the Soveraigne himselfe; for that

at the houres of his retyrement,
and private divertisments, may
easily enough make, or marre, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
or retarde the most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
affaires. And therefore it is,
we see in the <hi>Acts of the
Apostles,</hi> that those of <hi>Tyre,</hi>
               <note place="margin">c. 12.</note>
and <hi>Sidon,</hi> desirous to be reingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
with King <hi>Herod</hi> (who
was offended at them) addressed
themselves unto <hi>Blastus,</hi> Prime
<hi>Groome</hi> of the Privy Chamber,
by his meanes to make their
peace. And I well remember upon
that, of a <hi>Persian</hi> tale, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
is no jot inferiour in subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to any one of those which the
Antients have attributed unto
<hi>Aesop.</hi> A <hi>King</hi> (says the fable) have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made proclamation that they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62537:74"/>
should assemble all the beasts of
burthen which could possibly be
found, to serve in the Warr that
he undertooke; the <hi>Fox</hi> was no
sooner advertised thereof, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
he flyes; that he might
avoide the perill of so unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
an employment; by and by he
meets the Wolfe, who (instead
of imitation) derides him, that he
did not conceive that the <hi>ordinance</hi>
onely respected those beasts, who
were proper for burthen, from w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
they were altogether exempt; Do
not you rely upon that, replyes the
<hi>Fox,</hi> for (I tell thee) that if those
which be about the <hi>King</hi> once take
the <hi>caprice,</hi> that we may serve as
well as the rest, we shall likewise
be compelled to goe, or, at least, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
suffer, before his <hi>Majestie</hi>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:62537:74"/>
can be rightly informed of our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to the contrary. It is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
matter to extract the sence of
this ingenious <hi>story,</hi> and so judge of
what importance the favour and
Authority of those (wee speake
of) doth concerne us. This is it
which doth infinitely multiply the
servitude of the <hi>Court,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> renders
the subjection much more insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
&amp; that which makes it be
numbred (as I conceive) amongst
those felicities which the
<hi>Ecclesiastique</hi> reckons up;<note place="margin">c. 25.</note>
even the happinesse, not to have
our liberty engaged unto those <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
who deserve not the least sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
unto them.</p>
            <p>The goodnesse of that gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
under which we live, giveth
me the hardinesse to explaine my
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62537:75"/>
selfe with a liberty worthy the
reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Iust;</hi> As he is one
of the greatest <hi>Monarchs</hi> on Earth,
and the most worthy to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
he is likewise the best of all,
and such a <hi>Prince,</hi> that there is no
imaginary liberty, which can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be so sweet, and advantagious
unto us, as the obedience which
wee render him. After his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the greatest of his <hi>Court,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
an authority so well mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
that I do verily beleeve to
be able without danger (as well as
without fear) to report the defects
of others, and say in generall, that
which was almost continually
blamed in the <hi>Palaces</hi> of other <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
The <hi>theame</hi> which hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
adduced me hath too far ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
me from <hi>flattery,</hi> to adde
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62537:75"/>
any thing which doth so much as
approach it. And I know the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious</hi>
of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and of those
who have the most power about
him, to be so averse from those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate,
&amp; false praise (of which
we have but newly spoken) as by
that only, I should feare to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
odious, and blame worthy,
were I but so inconsiderate as to
make use of them. Truly there is
nothing which the most glorious
<hi>Potentates</hi> ought so much to detest,
as a flatterer, which ascribeth to
them such extravagant, borrowed
<hi>Encomions,</hi> when as they merit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but such as are proper, and
veritable. And therefore it was
that <hi>Lysippus</hi> boldly affirmed, he
had more honoured <hi>Alexander,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
him holding a speare
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62537:76"/>
in his hand; than <hi>Apelles</hi> who had
painted him brandishing &amp; fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
the <hi>lightning,</hi> like <hi>Iove</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
And indeed we read in the
History of this great Conqueror,
that he laughed at a certaine <hi>Artist,</hi>
who had the vanity, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the Mountaine <hi>Athos,</hi> to
carve our the figure of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
if hee would but have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him commission; as also,
how on a time he cast the booke
of <hi>Aristotle</hi> into the river, which
he passed, as unworthy, because of
some ridiculous, and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
exploits,<note place="margin">Lucian de scrib. hist.</note> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he writ
that <hi>Alexander</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in a <hi>duell</hi> against <hi>King

the like resentment, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62537:76"/>
to the fire, in <hi>Pavia,</hi>
the verses of a certaine <hi>Poet;</hi> for

he had derived it from
so farr, till he extracted his descent
even from the immortall <hi>Essences</hi>
themselves. And verily they had
(in my opinion) good reason so
to treate them. For my part, I
esteeme modesty to be one of the
most essentiall parts of <hi>Praise;</hi>
nor should I beleeve I had yet ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

            <p>BEhold here, <hi>Melpoclitus,</hi> what
hath so often traversed my
thoughts, and of which I verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
my selfe, the meditation
will not be altogether fruitlesse,
in the necessity which sometimes
engageth us to accommodate with
the nevitable subjections of life:
For, if it be true, that to affirme
ones selfe <hi>free</hi> we ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
from all kind of eorporall,
and Mentallc servitude; if there be
no man who may challenge a right
of attributing that liberty solely
to himself; since very <hi>Kings</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
be not enfranchised from
certaine duties which doe most
strickly oblige them to their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62537:77"/>
If those <hi>Philosophers</hi> who
would be esteemed (in this respect)
Paramount all <hi>Crownes,</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demes,</hi>
have rendred themselves
slaves to <hi>vanity,</hi> as wel as other men
are of their <hi>Passions;</hi> If (I say) the
servitude of the <hi>Court,</hi> diametricaly
opposite to the <hi>Philosophique liberty,</hi>
captivate such a world of people
(accordingly as we are compelled
to demonstrate) may we not then
well conclude that there is not
any Person, who is absolutely free?
which thing being so, every one
ought to satisfie himselfe in that
condition of life, to the which he
findeth himself engaged, or (it may
be) attached unto; although (happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he therein find likewise some
species of subjection, since (that
in fine) <hi>we are all obliged quietly to
