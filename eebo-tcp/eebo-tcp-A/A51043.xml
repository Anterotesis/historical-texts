            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Find now too certain what was reported, of that Meeting of Ministers at Edinburgh, their allowing by Vote the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples giving that Bond of surety for the Minister, required in the Proclamation, and have also got a double of the Bond it self. I hear the Meeting had severall communings and tampernigs, with the Members of the Councill, anent this busniess, by some of their number, whom they appointed to wait upon them from time to time for that purpose. What was the matter of their Communing, or to what end, I cannot well tell; However when at last the Brethren, who were appointed, returned, the meeting after some sort of Conference among themselves upon the present Favour (as they terme it) granted by his Maj. bearing a liberty for Presbyterian Ministers to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their Ministry, did generally Conclude (and that ere ever they had seen the Bond) That <hi>they found no Reason why the People might not give security at this time for a Ministers peaceable behaviour.</hi> And upon an other day afterward, it is again Concluded as followeth: <hi>The meeting having considered the bond o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> security as now presented by the Councill, find nothing therin to alter their former determination</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mativÃ¨. I hear there were severall and these of the most eminent who endeavoured to prevent this determination &amp; were for the negative when ti <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ame to be voted. Sir, my charity toward many of these Brethern would scarce suffer me to beleeve, That ever they would have tabled such a question to be debated in so publick a Meeting, far less affirmatively determined it. But finding it now (as I said) too certain; and this being the thing wherin you desire advice, I have the more fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Alas! is it come to this in the Church of Scotland? That so many wise men, and who by Office are seers to the Church, did see no reason why such a Bond might not be given to these who now require it, and that as a signe of the

Could these Brethren suppose, that the passing such a Vote would indeed satisfy all the rest of the Non-conform Ministers &amp; Church of Scotland? or that their determination <hi>affirmativÃ¨</hi> would (or ought) also determine all the rest? Was there nothing to be found, in yeelding to give this Bond, that might occasion both Ministers and Ministry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Was there nothing in it of a dangerous preparative, of wreathing &amp; continuing a yoke of bondage, upon the necks of Christs free Ambassadours, unto the generations to come; &amp; a bad copy to all other Magistrates to impose the like Bond, upon faithfull Ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.

As also no publick dissent or Protestation entered against thesame. In the mean while I am not a litle refreshed by this, that it is not as you &amp; I heard at first, That few Ministers in Scotland would be against that Vote; for after tryall there
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96183:3"/>
will be found, I hope, rather few to approve therof, yea some of themselv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> who then aggreed, do already wish that it had never been tabled in that Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. And before I proceed, I must tell you that severall wanted not their feares, that not a few of that Meeting, as it was then constitute, would be ready enouugh to declare themselves for such a Bond, whenever they should have occasion for that effect; and there was too good ground for this, Considering 1. How we have provoked the Lord, by our former cedings &amp; unfaithfulnes, to give us up to walk in connsells of our own. 2. How Ministers &amp; their Ministry have been brought under so much subjection, to the Civill Magistrate already, by closing with &amp; imbracing the two first Indulgences. 3. That so many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in Scotland had laid themselves aside, from the publicke exercise of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry declining &amp; shifting to preach under the Crosse, these many years past. 4. What secret grudgings, emulations &amp; whisperings, now &amp; then vented by some, in sharp &amp; bitter Invectives against their Brethren, for supplying the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate parts of our Church, by transient visits, in this disturbed state; being neither willing to labour themselves, or that others (though upon their perill) should supply their defect; but rather with the Common Enemy despising &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching their persecuted Brethren, as dis-orderly walkers fosterers of the people in an ignorant zeall, leaders of them into separation &amp; fomenters of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and too often decrying, extenuating &amp; undervaluing all the glorious &amp; signall appearances of the power of God, at these meetings, &amp; the singular blessed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, wich were produced by the right arme of the Lord in the Ministry of their Brethren, who were despised in the eyes of the world, &amp; too much also in theirs. 5. How these generall Meetings were called together since the late dool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; sorrowfull dispensation, which was at first by a few, and these such as had litle concerned themselves in the desolations of the Church, during the time of the bypast persecution, till the late Proclamation for this new liberty or Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. 6. How the leaven of the two first Indulgences hath wrought till it had neer leavened our whole lump, that severall who profest once to be clear &amp; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory against it, &amp; some who then had the offer, and refused to accept, of late were become favourers of &amp; pleaders for it. 7. What eager longing too many had after some new Indulgence, as hath been manifest from the expressions &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of some, which did clearly shew their readines to imbrace the first offer that might come in their way. <hi>Lastly</hi> if we consider the Constitution of the late mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting who past this Vote, That it was for the most part made up of Indulged, avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Applauders of the Indulgence, or under-hand Approvers &amp; favourers of the same: yea and some of them vigorous  Contenders for these old publick Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, which was a signall step of the Church of Scotlands declining, and who were active persecuters of their dissenting Brethren at the time of that tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I say an impartial Reflexion upon these &amp; the like Considerations may make it seem lesse strange, that such a Vote did so easily passe at that Meeting. But seing you desire to have an account of my Thoughts anent this new Liberty, &amp; the method prescrived to Ministers for entering to Congregations by petitioning the Council &amp; giving this Bond of surety, And whither the people may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in calling Ministers who will enter this way, I dare not shun to communicat what light I have therin, though most unfit of many, and as averse as any from enter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing

into a Contest wherin I am necessitat to differ from so many Reverend Brethren, whom I highly honour in the Lord, &amp; who have deservedly been esteemed in the Church; yet I cannot but bear my Testimony against what sin &amp; snare I see in this, as I would not partake of other mens sin; And shall in obedience to your Desire (if it may be of any use for futher information to yow or others who are carefull to keep themselves from the Contagion of this current Defection) speak alitle to this sad subject, and hold forth what Reasons do at present occurr to me against the giving or allowing to give that Bond for Ministers to obtain this new Indulgence: And in order thereto, I shall propose this method; 1. I shall lay down some Generalls previously to be considered; 2. a word to the Liberty granted to Ministers by the Civill Magistra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>. 3. Some things by way Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bond. 4. Propose the state of the Question, &amp; draw forth some Reasons for the negative. 5. Answer briefly to some Objections. And <hi>lastly</hi> for obvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Mistakes, I shall point at some of our Principles anent the Civill Government.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>First,</hi> I shall touch only upon such generall Considerations as are most conducible to my present scope of arguing against giving this Bond in the present Case. <hi>And</hi> 1. Let us reflect upon some Positions of the Reformed Government of our Church called Presbyterian, as: (1) This Government is not of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or Civill nature, but purely spirituall, and to be exercised <hi>modo spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>uali</hi>; and consequently, (2) It is a Government specifically distinct from &amp; indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon the Civill Government, and neither to be confounded therewith nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat thereto, either in the power or exercise of the power. (3) This Government is not Monarchicall, save only in the Head Christ; Not Hierarchicall, or prelaticall; not Democraticall; not Magistraticall, nor Magisterial; but <hi>Ministeriall,</hi> &amp; to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xercised in an immediate subordination to Christ as sole Head, King &amp; supreame Governour of the Church &amp; Instituter of this Government. (4) That this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church is to be exercised by a plurality of Compresbyters, or as wee use to say <hi>Communi consilio &amp; consensu Presbyterorum,</hi> not by any single person (it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>iven <hi>Unitati non uni</hi>) nor at all by the Civill Magistrat. (5) That the tryall &amp; jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Qualifications &amp; fittedness of men for the Ministry, as also the power of Conveying a Licence to Preach, or the potestative Mission to the Ministeriall function (being acts of Ecclesiastick order and Jurisdiction) belong only to Church Officers in their Classicall or Synodicall Meetings. (6) As the tryall &amp; judgin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> of a Persons sittedness for the Ministry in generall, so the tryall &amp; judging of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Qualifications &amp; sittedness for the exercise of their Ministry, to the best edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in such or such a particular Charge or Congregation belongeth only to these Church-Officers. And therefore (7) the power of transplanting or loosing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters from one particular Charge &amp; fixing them in another, is proper only to Church-Officers as an intrinsick act of the power. (8) As the power or office of the Ministry is given authoritatively from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>esus Christ alone, who ascended on high and gave gifts to men, &amp; this great gift of the Ministry unto the Church, to be conveyed by the Presbytery; so by the same Conveyance, he gives them the exercise &amp; liberty to the exercise of the Ministry, (for it is frivolous in this case to distinguish between the Exercise &amp; Liberty to the exercise, at least as to their Rise and Conveyance, as some doe) and therefore neither the office, nor the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96183:4"/>
exercise of the Office, nor liberty of the exercise therof dependeth upon, and so are not subordinat to, nor to be begged from the Civill Magistrat. (9) That the Magistrat hath not a power or right to prescribe to, or impose upon Ministers (who are the Ambassadours only of Christ) Instructions, Rules, Restrictions or limitations, to regulate them in the exercise of their Ministry, especially when these Impositions proceed only from, &amp; are founded upon the Magistrats assumed pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er &amp; supremacy in Church-matters, &amp; have no other ground or reason wherupon they can challenge Ministers their obedience &amp; subjection thereto. And therefore (10) That Ministers are not accountable to the Civill Magistrate in the exercise of their ministeriall function, or in the administration of affaires purely spirituall &amp; ecclesiastick, formally and <hi>primÃ¢ instantiÃ¢.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A II. Generall consideration we may reflect upon, is: The supervenient En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements &amp; Obligations to God which ly &amp; specially upon us of the Church of Scotland, by our solemnly sworn Covenants, for the maintenance &amp; defence of this Presbyterian Government, &amp; the rest of the work of Reformation in all the principles therof; And, that we shall without respect of Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ons endeavour the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of Popery, Prelacy &amp;c. and <hi>whatsoever</hi> is contrary to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ound doctrine &amp; the power of Godlines; And that we shall assist &amp; de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>end all these that enter in to this Covenant, in the maintaining &amp; persuing therof, and shall not suffer our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves directly nor <hi>indirectly,</hi> by what soever Combination, perswasion or terror, to be divided or withdrawn from this blessed Union; but shall all the dayes of our li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e <hi>zeallously</hi> &amp; constantly continue therin, against all opposition; &amp; promote the same according to our power against all letts &amp; impediments whatsoever; and what we are no able our selves to suppresse or overcome, we shall reveall &amp; make known, that it may be timely prevented or removed: &amp;c. All which we shall do as in the sight of God. Which Covenant hath frequently been renewed in this Church, and the breach therof often publickly acknowledged, and we solemnly engaged again to the duties therin contained; as may be seen particularly in that Paper cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>A solemne Acknowledgment of sins &amp; Engagment to duties,</hi> wherin we are expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely engaged, amongst other Errors, against <hi>Schisme, Scepticisme</hi> &amp; <hi>Erastianisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A III. <hi>Generall</hi> to be Considered, is: The manifold Encroachments, Invasions &amp; Usurpations made by the Civill Magistrat upon the Royall prerogatives of Christ, the Intrinsick previledges of his Church &amp; the just freedom of his Ambassadours, by many iniquous Lawes, Acts &amp; Edicts, especially of late, together with all their vigorous endeavours by open force &amp; subtile Insinuations, to putt these lawes in execution, and to advance this designe of bringing the whole Ordinances of Christ, &amp; Officers of his House in subordination unto, &amp; under the Check, Censure &amp; Regulation of the Civill Magistrat, and so put themselves in actuall possession of what is assumed and settled by law. Many Instances of their endeavours to this effect might here be given, especialy these late years by past; and of their too successfull prevailling by Church-mens ceding thereto, wherof I shall for present only give these following: the First relating to the Prelates<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> as (1) their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the Church-Government from what it was by Christ's Institution &amp; the practice of the pure primitive times into a Government of Humane Invent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>on &amp; Lordly domination over the Lords Inheritance contrary to the word of God.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96183:5"/>
(2) The Prelats were sett up &amp; established, &amp; the power of Ordination is conveyed unto them from the King, as having right by his Royall Office to all the externall Government of the Church. (3) The Kings giving them their Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ents impowering them to exercise that pretended Church-Office, making them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable in all their Ecclesiastick Administrations to himself as supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Church. A <hi>Second</hi> Instance we have in reference to Presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, as: (1) Turning them out of their particular Charges for not taking Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation from the Patron &amp; Collation from the Prelates: and for this Cause by Act of Parliament declaring their Churches to be <hi>ipso jure</hi> vacant. (2) Discharging them absolutely to exercise any part of their Ministeriall function within this Church. (3) Raising &amp; dissipating all their Church-Iudicatories of Presbytries Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods &amp; Gen. As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>emblies. (4) In the matter of the two Late Indulgences to Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Ministers, wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>in we may take notice of severall grievous encroachments upon Christs prerogative &amp; his Churches priviledges, as: (1), this Indulgence is granted and deduced from the Kings supremacy in Church-affaires, &amp; convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Councill; as is clear from his Maj. Letter to the Councill wherupon the Indulgence is founded, and as the Narrative of the Warants given to the first Indulged, doe bear in these words, <hi>In pursuance of his Maj. Commands signified by his Letter of the 7 of Iune</hi> 1669, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2.) The King by his Conncill doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat &amp; elect according to his soveraign pleasure certain of the outed Ministers, as were judged by them most fitted &amp; qualified, to be appointed, or readmitted to the exercise of their Ministry, and by that same power &amp; pleasure excluding or passing by the rest as unworthy and unqualified for receiving that power or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, interdicting them any exercise therof under all highest pain. (3) By this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence he fixes or admitts them to exercise the function of their Ministry in what particular flock &amp; paroch he pleaseth to assign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>, though under the notion of a Confinement. (4) He restricts them in the exercise of their Ministry to these particular Paroches, inhibiting them to preach else where in the Church. (5) With these Restrictions he gives them also severall Canons or Rules, to regulate &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them in exercising their Ministeriall office. (6) All this is done without either advice or consent of the Church, or any of her Lawfull Officers, but at his Maj. sole pleasure as supreme in all Causes. (7) The Indulged Ministers have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called &amp; conveened before the Councill, to give an account, How they had observed these Injunctions which they had received from them, &amp; severely rebuked, yea &amp; some of them sentenced, by being silenced &amp; deposed for allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged disobedience to, or non-observance of the same; And this is done according to the tenor of the foresaid Letter, as in these words <hi>To turn them immediatly out in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se &amp;c.</hi> A <hi>Third</hi> Instance we have in all these severe acts &amp; cruell Executions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therupon, against many other Ministers, for presuming to exercise their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry (though in a case of so urgent necessity, &amp; upon so earnest Calls of the People) without that licence or warrant which was granted to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged.</p>
            <p>A IV. <hi>Generall</hi> previously to be considered, is: The faithfull, zealous, laborious &amp; constant wrestlings &amp; contendings, by manifold Testimonies, Protestations, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations &amp;c. of our faithfull &amp; worthy Predecessors, in defence of their foresaid
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96183:5"/>
Principles of Presb. Government, and their peremptory withstanding any thing which they perceived might in the least tend to bring the Government or Ministry under a subordination or accountablenes to the Civill Magistrat, faithfully &amp; cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously witnessing their resentment of any attempts tending that way, by their frequent dissentings &amp; protestations against any acts or Conclusions insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such Attempts in Corrupt Assemblies, &amp; against the very Constitution of some of them upon that account; &amp; by their frequent presenting of Grievances to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>he King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> Councill &amp; Parliament, yea &amp; somtimes entering Protestation at the Cross of Edinburgh against proclamations declaring the King to be supreme Iudge in Church-matters, &amp; that none should appeall from him &amp; his Councill. Many such Instances may be produced: Neither have we wanted witnesses in our own time, both at the breaking up of the last Reformation from Prelacy, and also since the late Revolution &amp; overturning of the work of Reformation, who have protested &amp; given testimony against all such encroachments &amp; usurpations: And though alas! we cannot produce any joynt Testimony under our hands, against all the horrid Invasions made upon our Royall Masters prerogative &amp; his Churches Righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s, since the last overturning; yet some have adventured to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness practically &amp; pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>icularly against these usurpations &amp; testified their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of their Ministeriall freedom, who with blessed success under manifold hazards &amp; hardships, have often ventured upon the publick exercise of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry both in houses &amp; fields, contrary to all these Law-Interdictions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any licences or Indulgences from the Civill Magistrat, or coming under bonds to him; not out of any contempt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his authoritie, but meerly out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science they had o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> an indispensable duty, That they might make full proof of their Ministry, in such a crying necessity of the Church, and that thereby they might also witness they held their Ministry from Jesus Christ alone their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord &amp; Master, and their dependence only on him, both as to their office, ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rcise of the office, &amp; liberty to the exercise therof.</p>
            <p>Thus having laid down these few Considerations, to be reflected on; it would seem to me, that any who would be at pains duly to ponder the same, needed no further argument to make the very name &amp; notion of whatsoever Bond of surety required b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if the Granter have a bad design &amp; prejudicall to the Gospell in tendering this liberty, then either this wicked design is made known to the Accepter (whether the granter discover the same by his words, or declare it by his practice) or it is not: If the former, then either the effectuating of that evill design hath a necessary &amp; inseparable Connexion with the accepting of the liberty, or the evill designe therof is such as may be prevented or removed by the Accepters: If the former, then I cannot see how such a liberty can without sin be embraced or bargained for, though otherwise never so warantable, and a protestation in this case would be but <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria facto</hi>: If the latter, then I conceive that the Accepter's protestation against that evill design, together with a practicall endeavour to defeat it, might in such a Case be a sufficient salvo to the Accepter's Conscience, the liberty being othewise lawfull. But if this wicked design of the Magistrat (the Imposer) be hid &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the Accepter, then I see not how he can refuse a liberty (otherwise sinless) upon this only account, That the Magistrat who grants it is suspected to have some evill design in granting it, when no such design is made apparent; for in such a Case I suppose it sufficient, that the Accepter endeavour what in him lyes to obviat &amp; dissappoint whatsoever wicked design can be pretended or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, &amp; particularly that which the Granrer is suspected to have in granting it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As this liberty relates to the Persons of the Ministers, it may be Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either as it is extended to all without exception, or as it is denyed to some: If it be denyed to some (as in our case it is to many) and these too who have been most faithfull, usefull &amp; successefull in the work of the Ministry in the Church,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96183:6"/>
and upon which very account they are deprived of it, because they have been such; then I humbly apprehend that the tampering for, or accepting of it wold be an active concurring with the wicked design of the Excepters, in debarring such use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Instruments (though never so few in themselves, or despicable in the eyes of others) from the free exercise of their Ministry to the manifest detriment of the Gospell, &amp; consequently sinfull: an active concurring I say, because an active con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to a bargain made up of such sinfull Conditions, whereof this is one That so many Eminent Ministers must be debar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed from the foresaid Liberty; and it is to be judged an active consenting, in so far as the termes &amp; conditions are accepted, the bargain actually complyed with &amp; acquiesced in by the Accepter, without any Protestation against the depriving of others of this liberty, &amp; the evill design thereby intended (which yet wold seem to be but a Protestation contradicting the practice, 1. Because all these sinfull Conditions &amp; Restrictions are insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably interwoven with the liberty granted in the Proclamation, unto which the Bond must be conform. 2. Because ther is no obtaining of this present Liberty, but as it is tendered by the Councill, that is, as it is complex of all these sinfull Restrictions, of which the forementioned is one) for in this case he is to be holden a Consenter that is not a Contradicter, as is clear from the like Numb. 30:14. Where the Husband confirmes his wise's vowes by holding his peace, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting and protesting against them. If this Liberty be extended to all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters alike, then let it be considered</p>
            <p n="4">4. As it relates to Places; and thus it is either extended to all &amp; every place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Magistrats Dominions, or it is restricted to some only: If to some only, then it is clear that it ought upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>his very account to be refused, in as much as the good of the whole, though attended with some externall hazard &amp; Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (as in our cafe) is alwayes to be preferred to the good of a part only, which may be obtained without that hazard or inconvenience. If extended to all places alike, then it is either with a confinment of evry Minister to a particular parishonall charge, or it is without such a Confinement; If with this confinement, then it is sinfull to accept of it, &amp; that for two Reasons chiefly: (1) Because although all the faithfull Ministers in Scotland (&amp; Licentiates too) were every one of them fixed &amp; restricted to a paroch, I suppose that notwithstanding therof, many paroches should be vacant of such pastors. (2) Because thereby Ministers would be utterly debarred from the exercise of Church-discipline by Presbyteries &amp; Synods, as also incapacitat for ordaining a succeeding Ministry. If this liberty be extended to all places without any such Confinement, Then</p>

And whether a Liberty in this last sense ought not more properly to be termed a slavery, &amp; bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage then true Liberty, let the un-prejudicat determine from what hath been already, &amp; shall afterward be said.</p>
            <p>I come now to speak of this particular Bond for Ministers which is required by the Councill, and allowed &amp; voted to be lawfull by the late Convocation of Ministers. (But by the way I cannot pass, how that it hath been by severall obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (not without Reason) That the Imposers of these Bonds do scarse let one year pass without imposing some engagments or other upon the presbyterians, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are more obviously gross, sometimes more seemingly smooth, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are tendered more generally thorow the Kingdom, sometimes impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon particular shires; And all this is carried on sometimes by Craft &amp; cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, sometimes by force &amp; Cruelty: Doubtless it is not the least part of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, hereby to make Oaths &amp; Bonds become a triviall &amp; common thing, &amp; by frequent renewing of them to make the presbyterians, men of as capacious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences as themselves; And it is sadly to be feared, or rather regrated, that they have gained too much of this design allready) And lest ther may arise any mistake about the termes therof or that it should be represented either to the better or to the worse, I have thought fitt to give you here the just &amp; genuine double of it, which is as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We â€” for as much as upon an humble petition given in to his Maj. Privy Councill by â€” they have granted to them â€” to preach and administer the Sacraments in the Paroch, ofâ€” conform to his Maj. Proclamation of the 29. of June last; and a Line under his Royall hand upon the 11 of July last Upon their giving Caution to the effect underwritten That is to say Wee â€” bind &amp; oblige us conjunctly &amp; severally our Heirs &amp; successors that the said â€” shall live pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably. And in order thereto we bind &amp; oblige us to present him before his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Privy Councill when we shall be called so to do And in case of failzy in not presenting him we shall be lyable to the summe of six thousand merks.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There are other Copies also of this Bond, which in stead of the terme <hi>granted</hi> (that is here used in this copy) some of them have <hi>allowed,</hi> some <hi>given Licence</hi>; and withall they make mention of the Proclamation as <hi>gracious,</hi> which how truely it may be termed so, may justly be doubted, if there be any truth in the received maxime, That <hi>Bonum oritur ex integra Causa malum vero ex minimo quoque defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu.</hi> But seeing this which I have here inserted is the just double of that which was presented to the Ministers at the foresaid late Assembling, and upon which the Vote did pass I shall hold my self by it.</p>
            <p>This Bond may be taken up in these two 1. The Narrative, 2. The Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory part. In the Narrative are mentioned 1. an humble petition given in to the Councill by the parishoners for such a Minister as they have called to such a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roch. 2. The Councill's Granting of the said petition, which Grant consists of these five. (1.) they grant the Minister. (2.) to preach &amp; administer the Sacraments. (3.) in such a particular paroch. (4) conforme to his Majesty's proclamation &amp; Letter. (5) upon their finding of Caution, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As for the Petition, it seemes chiefly to import 1. That the people's calling of the Minister, their petitioning of the Presbytery, &amp; their obtaining him from

(2) Ane absolute Interdicting of any such Meetings for the future under highest pain.

            <p>In the <hi>Obligatory</hi> part of this Bond, I find the Cautioner is obliged to four things in reference to the Minister: 1. That he shall live peaceably: 2. In order thereto, he shall present him to the Councill when called so to do: 3. In case he failzie, he shall be lyable to 6000 Merks: And 4. he obliges (with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) his Heirs &amp; successors to all these. In all which we may observe this in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, That there is here not only a reall or virtuall, but a formall, yea explicit Compact or Transaction between the Magistrat on the one hand, &amp; the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster &amp; his Cautioner on the other; each of the two Parties to performe something to the other, but with this difference, that what the Magistrat is to perform, he pretends to do it out of mere condescendence or indulgence to the other party; and therefore challengeth to have the termes of the bargain in his own framing &amp; proposing; wheras the Minister &amp; his Cautioner being subjects to the Magistrat, are presumed to performe their part as a duty, which they owe to their Magistrat, and are bound by the word of God to perfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> thing then that the Cautioner is obliged to by this Bond, is, <hi>That the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister shall live peaceably,</hi> or (as it is exprest in the proclamation to which the Bond is said to be conforme) <hi>That he shall not preach Rebellion, schism nor Heresy.</hi> Now though the te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It must either be Generall &amp; indefinite, and so abstracted from all, &amp; restricted to no particular &amp; determinat sense. Or 2. it must be Universall &amp; Absolute, &amp; so comprehensive of all &amp; every sense that the termes are capable of. Or 3. It must be understood in some particular, determinat &amp; limited sense. The first it cannot be, Because <hi>To live praceably</hi> is here enjoyned in such a sense, as therin it is possible to give obedience; but it is altogether impossible to live peaceably abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly from, &amp; without having a respect to some particular sense or other; Therefore to live peaceably is not enjoyned by the Councill in such a generall, indefinit &amp; metaphysicall sense as excludes all &amp; every particular sense. If the 2. then, besides that it is sinfull to engage in such a Bond (as afterward is proven Arg. 4. of the 1 Head) it is ridiculous &amp; absurd to enjoyn peaceable living in such a sense, and as absurd to engage thereto in that sense; Because the termes thus taken are capable of, &amp; lyable to senses, both contrary to, &amp; utterly inconsistent with one another. But 3. If this peaceable living be enjoyned in some particular, determinat &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited sense (as it must needs be, if it be not nonsense) then our next enquiry is to know what is that particular &amp; determinat sense of the Councill or Imposer: and this we may easily know by their sense of Rebellion, Schism &amp; Heresy (for the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96183:9"/>
termes are equivalent, viz. <hi>not to preach Rebellion, Schisme nor Heresy,</hi> as in the Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and <hi>to live peaceably,</hi> as is exprest in the Bond; this being a compendious positive of the other negative) which they have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>lways declared, both by their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick Acts &amp; Proclamations, and also by the whole series of their procedour against the Presbyterians, to be such as thereby they directly condemne many points to be Rebellion, Schism &amp; Heresy which the Pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>yterians hold to be necessary Duty, &amp; sound doctrine, such as these: 1 To preach the iniquity of the Parliaments De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration &amp; other the like Bonds imposed upon Presbyterians, or to assert the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall obligation of the Covenant, &amp; the breach therof to be perjury in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree both against God &amp; man. 2. That we are bound every one of us in our capacity &amp; station to adhere to, &amp; defend all the Articles &amp; heads of these Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants. 3. To assert the divine right of Presb. Government, &amp; the unlawfullnes of prelaticall &amp; Erastian. 4. That the prelats &amp; their Curats are manifest Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp; tyrannically obtruded upon other faithfull men's labours without the Churches advice or Consent. 5. That it is lawfull &amp; a necessary duty for outed Ministers to continue in the exercise of their Ministry, and that it is the peoples duty to hear &amp; own them for their only lawfull pastors, and that notwithstanding of all the Law-Interdictions to the contrary. 6. That Jesus Christ is the alone Head &amp; absolutely supreme Governour over the Church in all causes spirituall &amp; Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That all the persecution which hath been inflicted upon the presbyterian Ministers and Professors these 17 or 18 yeares, for witnessing their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the work of Reformation &amp; refusing to comply with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Because it is scarce imaginable that the Rulers or any rationall man should impose a Bond (&amp; that by way of favour) upon Presbyterian Ministers, the termes wherof are known to be contrary to their Presb.

            <p>
               <hi>Answer</hi> 1. If this Consequence be valide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As to the Acts made against Presbyterian House-meetings, there is ane expresse suspending of the execution of them, and that by virtue, of a power reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to his Maj. by 5. Act. sess: 2. Parl. 2. Wheras touching other acts made against many of the Presbyterian Principles or preaching of them, there is no such suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as yet obtained, neither doth any of them reserve to the King such a power, and so he cannot in law doe it without a parliament. But 3. I suppose what may be said here as to Presbyterian Ministers their liberty to preach their Presbyterian Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the same might have been said also of the Liberty g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the proclamation for this new Indulgence, there comes forth another July 27. containing ane Indemnity to these who were at the late Rise; In which procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation (after many exceptions from the said Indemnity) it is injoyned as ane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presss Condition of enjoying the benefite of the said Indemni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

preaching of Presbyterian Principles in opposition to these will not be allowed nor tolerate. But 5. &amp; chiefly I wold gladly understand in what sense Schism (which Ministers by this bond are ingadged not to preach) is to be taken, if thereby be not meaned a separating, or keeping our selves a distinct body from the prelatick &amp; Erastian party then which nothing is more consonant to presbyterian principles; For that by this Schism is understood a separating from popery or any other sect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ffirme also that they are no friends to the protestant Cause &amp; Interest. To the 2. Reason of this Objection, <hi>It is scarse imaginabile</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I Answer</hi> 1. Whither it be imaginabile or not to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me who are byassed or blinded with self-interest or prejudice, yet it is very palpable to the most seeing &amp; serious That the termes of this Bond as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the Councill is contrary to Presbyterian Principles, as shall afterward at more length appear. 2. Although he Magistrat when he imposes this Bond, doth not expressely declare that his sense of the termes therof is contrary to Presbyterian Principles, or that he requireth obedience in that sense; yet it is true &amp; undenyable, that the termes therof doe admitt of, and are commonly taken in a sense contrary to Presb. Principles, as also that that sense is the sense of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate (though not declared by him to be such at the imposing of the Bond, yet <hi>alibi</hi> it is, as might be made out particularlie by produceing such <hi>acts</hi> &amp; <hi>procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> as have been made against the presbyterians, &amp; are not as yet legally suspended) yea, &amp; that that sinfull sense of the Imposer is also the sense of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadger, as shall further appear in the Arguments adduced against this Bond And therefore 3. The Imposers of this Bond doe coutch and cover the same under such generall &amp; ambiguous termes as may admitt of a sound eneugh sense even according to the Presbyterians themselves; wheras if they had roundly declared their own sinfull sense therof at the imposing of it, it is probable that the Presbyterians had more universally startled at it: And herein the meanest Capacity may ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ily discover the deceitfull designe both of the Imposer &amp; Ingadger; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> the Imposer, to lead the poor Presbyterians into a snare, by the generality &amp; ambiguity of the termes, &amp; by a baite busked up with smooth &amp; plausibe words make them swallow down hooke &amp; all; and of the Ingadger, in that whenever he is justly impeatched, as relinquishing his Presbyterian Principles by this Bonding, he may be alwayes ready to make his Retreat to this (viz. that the termes are generall and admitts of a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se consonant enough with his Presbyterian Principles, &amp; that he hes ingadged only in that sense) as a Refuge &amp; Cloak to cover his Anti-presbyterian Complyance.</p>
            <p>Having thus cleared what the Councill's sense of <hi>peaceable living</hi> and of <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion Schism &amp; Heresy</hi> in reference to the Presbyterians, is; as also that that sense of theirs is to be known by such <hi>Acts</hi> &amp; <hi>Edicts</hi> against the presbyterians as are not legally suspended, I shall indeavour nixt to make it appear that the termes of this Bond are to be understood only in the Conncill's sense, &amp; shall for present satisfy my self with this one Argument: <hi>Rebellion Schism</hi> &amp; <hi>Heresy</hi> (&amp; on the contrare <hi>peaceable living</hi>) which Ministers by this Bond are ingadged not to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96183:10"/>
preach, is to be understood in that sense wherin the Ministers have formerly been guilty therof; But only in the Councill's (or Magistrat's) sense have the Ministers been formerly guilty of <hi>Rebellion Schism</hi> &amp; <hi>Heresy</hi>; Therefore only in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill's sense is <hi>Rebellion, schism, Heresy</hi> &amp; <hi>peaceable living</hi> to be understood; and by Consequence, this Bond doth oblige the Ministers to live peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, or not to preach Rebellion Schism or Heresy only in the Councill's sense, of which more afterward Arg. 7. of the 1 Head.</p>
            <p>The 2 thing in the Obligatory part is the Cautioners binding him self in order to the Ministers peaceable living. <hi>That he shall present him when called so to doe</hi>: Where we see 1 That he binds absolutely for the Ministers peaceable living, for in order thereto he obliges himself to present him when called, which is nothing else but to give the Councill full assurance That he shall live peaceably. 2. That he is bound to deliver up the Minister to the Councill when called so to doe, though the Minister live never so peaceably; for it does not run thus. <hi>That he shall present him when it shall be verified that he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h lived unpeaceably,</hi> but thus <hi>That he shall present him when called so to doe.</hi> 3. That this obligation is imposed by the Councill on the Cautioner as a terror &amp; aw-band both to Cautioner &amp; Minister; for the Councill will easily suppose That ere the Cautioner should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall in persecuting his Minister by presenting him or before that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster putt himself in hazard of falling into their hands, both Cautioner &amp; Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster will rather doe all they can to live peaceably according to the Bond, &amp; so prevent the Councill's displeasure and their own paying of the penalty.</p>
            <p>The 3 thing in the Obligatory part of this Bond is, <hi>That the Cautioner shall be lyable to the payment of the soume of</hi> 6000 <hi>Merkes in case he failzie &amp; not present the Minister when called for.</hi> Where observe That the two last obligations are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborative of the first: 1 The Cautioner is absolutely ingadged that the Minister shall live peaceably. 2 In order thereto (or for corroborating therof) shall present him when called. And 3. in case of failzie (or in Certification that he shall no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> faill, but shall certainly present him when called) he shall be lyable to 6000 mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. As for Instance, If the Magistrate should require me to ingadge to performe some Civill duty unto him which I am bound in my station &amp; capacity to doe, I therupon offer my self absolutely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>o ingadge upon my honest word to performe it (I suppone also that the Magistrat's defigne is to have me absolutely ingadged thereto) But because he layes no weight upon, nor gives any credite to my bare word &amp; promise (having possibly offended him formerly by alledged delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) and so apprehends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>hat he hath no security or assurance that I shall performe the said duty (which duty he will by no meanes dispense with my non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of) Therefore in order thereto that I may not cheat him, but performe what I'm so absolutely ingadged to, for a Corroborative &amp; Assurance therof, he enjoynes this for a Certification, That in case I failzie (or lest I faill &amp; not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme my Ingadgement) I shall be lyable to a great penalty. Will any Lawyer or Divine call this ane Alterna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ive Bond? So in out present Case. If it be said that the Cases are not parallel, because in the one the principall obligation is lawfull, in the other (viz. to present <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

&amp; a duty of the Ingadger as to the Imposer, and he imposes it as such, and so it is not Alternative as to him, nor imposed by him as such. 2. If the Ingadger look upon it as unlawfull &amp; alternative, then (1) he doth at best but juggle wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>h the Imposer &amp; cheat him. (2) He thereby confesses That he takes ane Alternative Bond wherof one of the Alternatives is unlawfull; both which to be sinfull shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward be proven.

That the Cautioner doth not oblige himself absolutely to pay the penalty, I grant; but that Therefore this Ingadgement, to pay the penalty is Alternative, I deny: Because, it is neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Absolute nor Alternative, but merely <hi>Conditionall,</hi> as the very termes <hi>In Case</hi> (or on Condition) <hi>he failzie</hi> &amp;c. doe hold forth.

               </gap>incipall part therof, &amp; is only a secundary &amp; subordinate obligation in respect of the principall, and to have place only upon Condition of the breach therof; wheras Alternatives as such are not subordinate the one to the other, but both equally proposed by the Imposer, neither is the one imposed as a punishment for non-performance or breach of the other. But 2. Howsoever it may be supposed That to present the Minister or pay the penalty is Alternative upon this account, That the Cautioner by performing of the one is thereby free from the obligation of the other; yet (besides that it is questionable in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Case, whither the Cautioner by paying the penalty, shall be <hi>eo ipso</hi> liberate from his obligation for the Ministers peaceable living &amp; presenting of him when called) sure I am that this Bond is not proposed formally &amp; explicitely in Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native termes (&amp; so not to he understood such, nor ingadged unto as such) if w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The 4. &amp; last thing to be noticed in the obligatory part of this Bond is, That the Cautioner doth <hi>bind</hi> his <hi>Heirs</hi> &amp; <hi>Successors</hi> together with himself to the fulfilling of all these 3 parts already mentioned &amp; explained.

It is a sin to ingadge in a Bond, wherin the matter ingadged unto is held forth in such generall &amp; ambiguous termes as admitts of various, yea &amp; contrary senses: But that this Bond is held forth in such termes, is cleared already in the Explication, &amp; is obvious to the meanest capacity. And therefore it is a sin to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadge in such a Bond. Now for a man to ingadge in a Bond, the termes wherof (as they are proposed) are lyable to a sense contrary to &amp; inconsistent with the known sense of the Imposer, and yet not to signify to the Imposer in what deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat sense he ingadges, or that he does not ingadge in a sense inconsistent with that of the Imposer, what is it else but to juggle &amp; deceive? But more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Seeing the termes of this Bond (<hi>to live peaceably</hi>) are acknowledged to be so generall &amp; lyable to various &amp; contrary interpretations, then he who thus ingad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96183:13"/>
does either ingadge <hi>to live peaceably</hi> in a generall, abstracted &amp; metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call sense, or <hi>to live peaceably</hi> in some particular &amp; determinat sense. The former it cannot be, for that is not intelligible, yea altogether impossible, viz. to live pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aceably abstractly from any particular Consideration of, or respect to particular persons, Actions, manner of peaceable living &amp; other Circumstances. If the Latter (as indeed it must be, seeing a determinate sense of words is the very soul &amp; substance of words) then by this Bond he is either obliged to live peaceably in the Imposers which is the sinfull sense (as is formerly cleared) or in another sense in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with that of the Imposer If the former, then questionlesse it is sinfull to ingadge in such a Bond: If the Latter, then it must be deep dissimulation (&amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently sinfull) in him who thus ingadgeth &amp; a manifest abusing of the Imposer with his dis-ingenuity, in as much as the Imposer requireth one thing by this Bond, and the Binder doth oblige himself to the quite contrary of what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him, and in effect bindeth himself to nothing at least as to that which the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser requires of him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If it be sinfull to give Bond for Absolute &amp; universall peaceable living with any man, then to give this Bond is a sin: But that the former is true, I prove: That which is proper &amp; due unto God only, cannot (<hi>jure</hi>) be given to any man or mortall; But a Bond for absolute paceable living is proper &amp; due to God only: <hi>Prob.</hi> If absolute obedience, or ane absolute Ingadgement to such obedience be proper &amp; due to God only, then absolute peaceable living, or absolutely ingadging thereto (which is a part of that absolute obedience which is due only to God) is proper and due unto God only. That absolute Ingadgements or absolute obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce are proper &amp; due to God only, is hence evident, Because he &amp; he only is the absolute &amp; supreame Authority, and whose law only can be our absolute &amp; infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile Rule. And if this argument be valide against giving Bond for absolute peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able living with any mortall because fallibile &amp; subordinat to the absolute &amp; sole supreame authority; much more then must it militate against the giving of such a Bond to these who are stated &amp; avowed Enemies to Christ's royall prerogative, to his people &amp; work of Reformation; yea wold not such a Bond be rather ane Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation &amp; Combination against the Lord? That this Bond (as it is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) ingadgeth the Minister to live peaceably in ane universall &amp; absolute sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se is clear from the indefinitnes of the termes <hi>To live peaceably</hi> And it is known, that ane indefinite, generall &amp; illimited proposition is aequivalent, to ane universall or absolute.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is a sin to give such a Bond as by vertue of the obligation therof tendeth to bring the Ministry of the Gospell &amp; Ministers doctrine immediatly &amp; <hi>prima instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÃ¢</hi> to be cognosced &amp; judged formally &amp; authoritatively by the Civill Magistrate; and the reason hereof is, because it belongeth properly to the Ministeriall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, formally &amp; authoritatively (though ministerially) to judge &amp; determine, &amp; that <hi>prima instantiÃ¢</hi> (i. e. previously to any determination of the Magistrate or any otheir Judicature thereanent) by the Scripture, of which Ministers are the only Interpreters <hi>ex Officio,</hi> what is Orthodoxe or Heterodoxe, what is Schisme or Heresy, these being matters purely spirituall &amp; ecclesiastick, and so determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable only from the Scriptures.

               <p n="2">2. It is Inconvenient on this account; That it becometh a great temptation to the Cautioner to persecute the Minister by presenting of him; especially if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that the Minister hath needlessely done or spoken that thing or word, for which he may be charged by the Councill as ane unpeaceable liver (which may very readily fall out) or if he be unable to pay the summe, or if he be so wickedly sett, that he will rather venture the Ministers neck then to pay such a penalty himself for not presenting of him, or if he be in some hopes &amp; expectation to bring the Minister faire off though he present him &amp;c. I say this is very Inconvenient, and therefore ought to be avoyded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hereby is occasion given (if not a reall ground laid down) not only for the Cautioner or Councill to persecute the Minister, but also for any malevolous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who carries the Minister or his Cautioner at ill will, to pitch a quarrel with him, by gathering either from his Doctrine, deportement, or ordinary discourse, any thing which may have the least shadow in law That he hath broken the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce whereto he is ingadged, or though they can catch nothing in the Ministers carriage wherat they can carp, yet they may either out of their own malice, or by the bribery perswasion or instigation of others swear to his prejudice, and so by delating him get him delivered up to the lust of these whose tender mercies are cruelty, or else the Cautioner to pay the penalty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The giving of this Bond is a bad preparative &amp; exemple for incouraging all Magistrates both at home &amp; abroad, present &amp; to come, either to require &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the like Bond from Ministers, when ever they take up the least jealousy or prejudice against them (though probably without any ground) or else to put them from the peaceable exercise of their Ministry, and to debarr others also (not admitted) from accesse to the exercise therof, untill such a Bond of surety be found &amp; given for them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Bond is very Inconvenient whereby the Binder doth inevitably bring upon himself or others either sin, scandall or suffering: But by this Bond the Binder doth incurre the necessity of bringing some or all of these upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or others, as may be particularly evinced from what is above said: <hi>Ergo</hi> such a Bond is most Inconvenient.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This bonding will at least occasion other Ministers, who either cannot find
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96183:19"/>
clearnes in their Conscience to give, allow, or suffer any such Bond to be given for them, or who possibly cannot get any who will venture to bind for them (fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring perhaps they may be too rackless (<hi>aliÃ s</hi> too faithfull) in their preaching) or these who are particularly exempted in the proclamation from this Liberty; It occasions, I say, all such Ministers to be exposed as the only butt of the malice &amp; persecution of the Rulers, if they shall presume to preach without their warant &amp; Licence.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This Bonding is very Inconvenient, That thereby the Cautioner &amp; Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoners are tempted to give to their Minister carnall &amp; sinfull advice (<hi>viz.</hi> that he utter nothing which may irritate the Rulers, or may be interpreted unpeaceable Living &amp;c.) the Cautioner out of fear, least he be put by the Councill to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent him, or else pay the penalty; the People, lest they be deprived of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister: and thus the edification both of people &amp; Cautioner is marred &amp; obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: But this is such a Bond: Therefore.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is Inconvenient also upon this account, That the Cautioner doth <hi>bind</hi> his <hi>Heirs &amp; Successors</hi> together with himself: for 1 they may be either Children or fools. 2 They may be unable to underly so great a summe. 3 They may be of an other or contrary Judgement anent this Bond. 4 Though they be once of the opinion that there is no sin in it, yet they may afterward (as also may the Cautioner himself) alter their judgement and see the evill therof, &amp; be made to smart for it, as many have done in the like cases, for doing things of far less im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, &amp; having less appearance of evill then the giving of this Bond. But the truth is, it is as impossible to make a full enumeration of all the evills &amp; Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences that are either wrapped up in, or may follow upon this way of bonding, as it is to number or foretell all the particular occurrents &amp; circumstances that shall afterward come to pass in reference thereto.</p>
               <p>In a word, it is <hi>Sinfull, Scandallous &amp; Inconvenient</hi> to doe or allow to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne that which hes but the <hi>appearance of evill</hi> in it, which this Bonding cannot be denyed to have.</p>
               <p>I shall now indeavour to obviat or remove what some doe alleadge in defence of the lawfulnes of giving this Bond; as.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>the Scripture expressely commands what is required by this Bond.</hi> viz. <hi>to live peaceably</hi>; as may beseen particularly in these Rom. 12:18. Heb. 12:14. Ps. 34:14. 1. Pet. 3:11. 1 Thess. 4.11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Tim. 2:1, 2. Rom. 14:19. Jer. 29:7. &amp;c. Therefore such a Bond ought to be given when required. <hi>Answer</hi> 1, Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these Scriptures doe command absolute peaceable living, and illimitedly as to times, places persons &amp;c. or they doe not: If they doe, then how shall that Scripture hold (for the Scriptures here adduced command us to live peaceably not so much with Magistrates as with men in generall) Eccles. 3:8. <hi>There is a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of war &amp; a time of peace</hi>; or that, Luk. 22:36. <hi>He that hath no sword let him sell his garment &amp; buy one</hi>; and the like? If they doe not, either then they say nothing to the purpose in hand, or else the Objectors are holden to prove that they are parallel to, &amp; so conclusive in our present circumstantiate Case. 2. suppose that these forecited Scriptures (commanding to live peaceably) were held forth in as generall &amp; indefinite termes as this present Bond (which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly

But if you should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer here That though that particular passage of scripture doth not characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ze nor discriminate what sort of evill we are to resist &amp; what not, yet many other parallel places doe: Even so say I, that although one particular passage of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re may command peaceable living in generall absolute &amp; indefinite termes, yet other parallel scriptures doe expressely qualify &amp; restrict the same; so that the former axiome will not alwayes hold unless it run after this manner <hi>where the Scripture</hi> (viz Complexely considered as to the whole, &amp; collatively as to particular passages therof)<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed Scriptures made any mention of the qualifications &amp; Conditions of peaceable living, yea suppose all the Scriptures of the Bible relating to peaceable living (except one particular passage) were so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally &amp; indefinitly exprest, as that indeed they seemed to command absolute peaceable living without any limitation; yet though there were but one passage in the whole Scripture, that either expressly mentions, or so insinua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es these qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications and restrictions of peaceable living, as therupon we have good ground to qualify and restrict the same, I say that even that one passage is to be the rule &amp; standard by which all the rest (indefinitly so exprest) are to be interpreted &amp; understood in reference to peaceable living; not contrariwise. 4. It is not so much the generality &amp; Indefinitnes of the termes (to live peaceably) that makes us hate &amp; abhorre this Bond, as it is the sinfull &amp; sinistrous sense that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill hes put upon it; neither will it follow, That because the Magistrate doth not expressely declare in the Bond it self, or at the imposing of it, his sinfull sense therof, therefore no where else hath he declared it, or that the Bond is left ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary to our sensing; no more then it will fol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(which is more) although they were never so expressely Scripturall, yet when once the right sense &amp; meaning therof comes under debate, or a sinistrous is suspected to be either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But 6. Even these very Scriptures adduced against the Refusers of this Bond are so far from commanding us to live peaceably in such a generall &amp; indefinite sense as is insinuate by the Objectors, or in such a sinfull sense as required by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers, that on the contrare the express qualifications &amp; Conditions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in these Scriptures (both in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he Text &amp; Context) doe exceedingly favour the Refusers, yea &amp; which may serve as so many Arguments for them against the Objectors, as may appear thus: Rom. 12:18. <hi>If it be possible, as much as in you lyeth, live peaceably with all men</hi>; from which we may gather That if it be not possible for us simply, or if not possible with a good Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce (as in our case it is not) we are not to live peaceably &amp;c. So Heb. 12:14. it is commanded that we <hi>follow peace with all men</hi> (but remember what is conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with it) <hi>and holines. Ergo</hi> we are commanded to follow peace only in so far as holines goes along with it. Also Ps. 34:14. &amp; 1 Pet. 3:11. we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>seek peace and persue it</hi> (but what sayes the former part of the same ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se) <hi>depart from evill &amp; doe good.</hi> Likewise 1 Tim. 2:1, 2.

that they should quietly submit to, &amp; rest satisfied with their captivate lot till the time appoynted, and in the mean while to build houses, plant vineyards take wives &amp;c that they might be increased there; and so they are to seek the common peace &amp; preservation of the City or Incorporation where they lived, &amp; wherof by Gods dispensation they were made members. Hence (3) the Reason why they were to seek the peace of that City is, not because they were thereto Commanded or required by the King of Babylon or his Councill (as it is in our Case) but the Reason therof is given to be this, <hi>for in the peace therof</hi> (sayes he) <hi>shall ye have peace</hi>; and so they did no less then what the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(2) Because thereby they are qualified &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricted not only in the externall exercise but also in the very Essentialls of their Ministry. 3, I deny that either Ministers or other subjects ought to give Bond for peaceable living in such absolute termes as this Bond is held forth in.</p>

upon these Bonds (for <hi>ejusdem est exponere cujus est imponere</hi>) they please, &amp; require obedience only in that sense, &amp; judge of obedience or dis-obedience according thereto; in the other Case between Subject &amp; fellow-subject it is not so. 2. In the one, the Magistrate is both Iudge &amp; Party; in the other, neither of the parties is Judge to the other, but the Magistrat is ane indifferent Judge to both. 3. The King &amp; Councill have declared their sense of the termes of this Bond to be so sinfull &amp; sinistrous, that no Presbyterian can engadge therin without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching his presbyterian principles; in the other, it signifies nothing what be the sense of him who requires the Law borrows, as to any prejudice his fellow-subject can sustain thereby, seeing he hath neither the termes in his own framing or sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, nor is the other bound to give obedience in his sense any further then as it is the sense of the Magistrate. 4 Law-borrowes are ordinarly (at least ought to be) exprest in so full, plain &amp; particular termes as both parties may easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand in what derterminate sense obedience is required; in our Case it is far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise as to this Bond. 5, Ministers being the subjects &amp; servants of a King who is above all mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
