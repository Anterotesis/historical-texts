            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It Imports their loſing, as it <hi>were the very uſe of their Reaſon.</hi> This is one of the marvellous Things God threatens to do to his Enemies, <hi>Iſaiah 29. 14. The Wiſdom of the wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of their prudent men ſhall be hid.</hi> It's written, ſays <hi>Paul, I will destroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and bring to nothing the underſtanding of the prudent,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 19. They ſhall be Confounded, they ſhall not have ſo much as the uſe of their Reaſon. And indeed, this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105165:5"/>
is verified in our Enemies this day: Have they not manifeſted their Madneſs; witneſs Sir <hi>John Friend</hi>'s Prayer. It's no Wiſdom to Plot; He is a wiſe Man in my Opinion that Plots not: That is true Wiſdom not to Plot.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may Import alſo even <hi>the loſs of their Tongue.</hi> That they who not long ago were ready to ſay, <hi>Our Tongues are our own, who is Lord over us,</hi> Pſal. 12. 4. Is it not juſt and right that they ſhould now be put in that caſe as they ſhall not know what to ſay? <hi>Then ſhall the Seers be aſhamed, and the Diviners confounded; yea, they ſhall cover their lips, for there is no anſwer of God,</hi> Micah 3. 7. This holds out, that Confuſion and Speechleſneſs as it were go together.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It Imports <hi>ſhame in their Countenance, Carriage,</hi> and <hi>Deportment,</hi> Pſal. 109. 29. <hi>Let mine adverſaries be cloathed with ſhame, and let them cover themſelves with their own confuſion as with a mantle:</hi> Oh! Shame and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion go together.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Confuſion may Import an <hi>Incapacity of any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Action.</hi> Oh, When the Lord ſends Confuſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Churches Enemies, they muſt quit the Building of their high <hi>Babels,</hi> as they did long ago, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 8, 9. Our Enemies this day are they not rendred incapable of Plotting and Contriving any more?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Confuſion may Import, (eſpecially as it is applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Enemies of God's Church) no <hi>leſs than ruine it ſelf, and a going to naught,</hi> as it were, <hi>Iſa. 41. 11. Behold all they that were incenſed against thee ſhall be aſhamed and confounded, they ſhall be as nothing, and they that ſtrive with thee ſhall periſh.</hi> There you have the Expoſition of their Confuſion ere all be done.

               <head>Second Propoſition.</head>
               <p>What are the Influences, (the ſeeing of theſe marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Things, the Lord doth and ſhall do to his Church and People) they can or ſhall have upon the Enemies of his Church and People, ſo as to Confound them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Nations ſhall ſee and</hi> be confounded, ſays the Lord.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A ſurpriſing Influence.</hi> So far contrary to their Expectation. They hoped God would never ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for his Church and People, and now they are all ſurpriſed and diſappointed, and ſo they begin to be Confounded like that, <hi>Job. 6. 20. They were confounded becauſe they had hoped.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O, How did the Duke of <hi>Berwick</hi> carry over that joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful News to <hi>Lewis</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> that all Things were well in <hi>England,</hi> and they hoped to bring their Curſed Deſign to an effectual Iſſue: But now, How are they ſurpriſed? How are they diſappointed?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A convincing Influence.</hi> O, the Lords marvellous Works are able to convince the ſtouteſt Adverſaries he hath, <hi>Acts 4. 16. For indeed, that a notable miracle hath been done by them, is manifeſt to all them that dwell in Jeruſalem, and we cannot deny it,</hi> ſaid the Rulers, Elders, and Scribes. There is the Finger of God, could the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105165:6"/>
in <hi>Egypt</hi> ſay, when their Inchantments failed. Now of neceſſity, <hi>Lewis</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> they muſt ſee and acknowledge the evident hand of the Lord in this great Deliverance, wrought for his People and Church in theſe Nations, and they cannot help themſelves in it, and no wonder it encreaſes their Confuſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The marvellous Things the Lord Works for his People, hath an <hi>incenſing influence upon them;</hi> they are uſually put in a rage by them, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 17. They were filled with Indignation at the wonderful Things and Miracles done by their Apoſtles. Oh, How are they this day inraged at the wonderful Things done by God to his Majeſty King <hi>William,</hi> to his Church and People here?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The wonderful Things that God doth for his Church and People, puts <hi>them out of their wits as it were,</hi> for fear, ſo as that they know what to do, or what ſhift to make for themſelves. <hi>Pſalm 48. 4, 5, 6. For loe the kings were aſſembled; they paſſed by togeither: they ſaw it, and ſo they marvelled, they were troubled and haſted away: Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.</hi> O, hath not <hi>Lewis</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> two wicked Kings, ſeen this this; and do they not marvel? Doth not this Deliverance, that makes us Rejoyce this day, Trouble them and make them Cry; Oh, What pannick Fear hath ſeized and taken hold on them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In a Word, God's marvellous Workings <hi>purſues them to their ruine,</hi> and never leaves them till it drives them to the utmoſt of their Confuſion; even to that as you have it, <hi>Asts 13. 41. Behold the deſpiſers, and wonder and periſh;</hi> as it is cited out of <hi>Habbakuk,</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:105165:7"/>
2. Another Effect as a ſpecial ingredient of the Enemies Confuſion, is, thar it ſhould <hi>be at all their might:</hi> Which Phraſe may admit of a twofold Senſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all the Might of Adverſaries, were they never ſo Potent, ſhall not be able to hinder their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, when the Lord's time of doing marvellous Things for his Church and People comes about; no, no. O, <hi>There is no wiſdom nor underſtanding, nor counſel againſt the Lord,</hi> Prov. 21. 30. and ſo no might either: The very Nature of their Judgment will clear this; you ſee its Confuſion, which in effect will take away Reaſon, Courage, and Judgment from them; and what ſhall all their Might avail them then?</p>
               <p>The Nature of the Things which God promiſes to do for his People ſpeaks this; You ſee they are marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Things, and what can poor ſinful men's Might do againſt the Lord's Wonders? <hi>Aarons reed you know ſwallowed up the Magicians rods, Exod.</hi> 7. 12. And hath not the marvellous Things of the Lord ſwallowed up the marvellous Policy, Iniquity, Plottings, Strength and Might of our Enemies this day?</p>
               <p>The way that the Lord takes to encounter the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of his Church, as he is pleaſed to expreſs it himſelf, may put this above all doubt, <hi>Iſaiah 47. 3. I will take vengeance, ſays the Lord to</hi> Babylon, <hi>and not meet thee as a man.</hi> If they had only to do with men, men might meet men like themſelves: O, But how ſhall they, how can they, and wherewith ſhall they meet God?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will bear this Senſe alſo, That the Enemies of God, when they are at the height of their Power,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105165:7"/>
even at the higheſt pinnacle of their Might, then is the time when the Lord brings Confuſion upon them: O, then it is they begin to think themſelves Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that there is no reaching of them. Now the Lord is concerned there; as you may ſee, <hi>Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah</hi> 3d and 4th verſes. Then it is readily they are and muſt be at the height of their Pride, and Pride <hi>you know goes before deſtruction, and a haughty ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a fall, Prov.</hi> 16. 18. Then they begin to truſt in very Wickedneſs it ſelf, and to take ſuch ways and courſes as are wicked, <hi>Iſaiah 47. 10, 11. For thou haſt trusted in thy wickedneſs; Thou haſt ſaid, none ſeeth me, thy wiſdom and thy knowledge it hath perverted thee, and thou haſt ſaid in thine heart, I am and none beſides me: Therefore ſhall evil come upon thee, thou ſhalt not know from whence it ariſeth, and miſchief ſhall fall upon thee thou ſhalt not be able to put it off, and deſolation ſhall come upon thee ſuddenly which thou ſhalt not know.</hi> O, then it is the Lord hath (ſo to ſay) the beſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity both to magnifie his Power upon them, and to get a full ſtroak of them; For when they are at all their Might they uſe to be gathered beſt together, as at the Red Sea. When <hi>Phoraoh</hi> and all his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots and Hoſt were together, then did God drown them all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 17. Even for this purpoſe, O <hi>Lewis</hi> the Great, hath God raiſed thee up, that he might ſhew his Power in thee, and that his Name might be declared throughout all the Earth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third Influence which the marvellous Things of God ſhall have upon his Enemies, is held forth in theſe two Symptoms.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:105165:8"/>
1. <hi>They ſhall lay their hands upon their Mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And their Ears ſhall be deaf:</hi> That is, in effect, they ſhall lay their hand on their Mouths in ſilent Admiration; their Ears ſhall be made Deaf with the noiſe and fame of God's marvellous Works done to and for his Church and People. O they, who not long ago did boaſt and brag of their Underſtanding, Quickneſs, and Sagacity: Now, when the Lord ſhews his marvellous Things for his Church and People, they appear very blockiſh, and can neither ſpeak nor hear. O, How can they ſpeak when their Hearts are filled with carnal Grief? When they ſee that they are like to loſe for all their Might; That Tyrannical Power they were wont to uſe and exerciſe over God's Church and People, and that without hope of recovery. O, How can they hear that have received ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſtroak from God upon them, as a piece of their Judgment, to make them ſo much a ſpectacle to the world of his Diſpleaſure?</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth effect of the Influence that God's mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Things for his Church and People hath upon his Enemies, is in this Similitude.
<q>They ſhall lick the duſt like a ſerpent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>VVhich Similitude denotes their Subjection, ſuch as it is. This is an Alluſion to the cuſtom of the <hi>Eaſt-Countries,</hi> where they uſe in their ordinary Salutations (eſpecially to Perſons of Note and Reſpect) to Bow themſelves ſo low as if they ſeem'd to lick the duſt: So the Scripture tell us, <hi>Jacob bowed to Eſau,</hi> Gen.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105165:8"/>
33. 3. <hi>He bowed himſelf ſeven times to the ground;</hi> And <hi>Abigal</hi> to <hi>David, 1 Sam. 25. 23. Abigal fell before David on her face, and bowed her ſelf to the Ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This denotes a Subjection with Homage as it were. O, They who a little while ago would ſcarce caſt an Eye, or look on the Godly; now they are content to fall ſo low as if they kiſſed the Ground.</p>
               <p>They who formerly looked like cruel fierce Maſtiffs, are now fain to ſtoop like Spaniels: O great Change! O wonderful Alterations!</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another effect and Influence that the marvellous Works of God ſhall have upon his Enemies, is <hi>Fear,</hi> in this Similitude.
<q>They ſhall creep out of their holes like worms of the earth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Similitude ſeems to hold out their fear in theſe three Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It ſuppoſes they were fain to fly into their holes. O, they are moſt dark Creatures in themſelves, and ſo cannot endure or abide the light of his appearing, like thoſe Creatures ſpoken of, <hi>Pſalm 104. 20, 22. The Sun ariſeth, they gather themſelves together, and lay them down in their dens. And thou makeſt darkneſs, and it is night, wherein all the beaſts of the forreſt do creep forth.</hi> O, No wonder that theſe our Enemies, thoſe haters of Light, get them to their holes and hide themſelves in Priſons and Mad Houſes, under Beds, when the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſeth with healing under his Wings, leſt their Deeds ſhould be made manifeſt.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:105165:9"/>
2. This Phraſe <hi>ſuppoſes, though they have got into their holes, yet they dare not abide and ſtay there.</hi> O, Fear will not let them be ſecure there, even when they are in their holes; till they are forced to creep out again. O, an evil Conſcience goes with them go where they will, and you may be ſure where it is, Fear muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. O. they may Fear, even to be ſurpriſed and laid hold on, even in their Dens and Holes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Similitude ſuppoſes, that when they do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, it ſhall be in a moſt fearful manner; for <hi>they ſhall creep out of their holes like worms of the earth.</hi> O, they are readily ſure to be called to an accompt, and that cannot but make them affraid. O, they are ſuch, as are deſtitute of all juſt defence for themſelves; and that cannot but make them Fearful. Yea, which is worſt of all; they have no hope for another World, to counter-ballance all theſe Fears in this. And I am ſure, the Abſolution that Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> and Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Parkyns</hi> received by thoſe Papiſt Prieſts, (who for a cloak went under the Name of the Church of <hi>England)</hi> I am ſure, I ſay, they never carried it to Heaven.</p>
               <p>But thus much for the Doctrinal part.</p>
               <p>Now I come in the laſt place to the</p>

            <div type="application">

               <p>Is it ſo, that the Nations ſhall ſee and be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at all their Might? Then I infer, That many may get a ſight of the Lord's marvellous Works done to and for his Church and People, but ſhall never be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105165:9"/>

But let us contend for another ſight of God's marvellous appearings for his Church, His A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing King <hi>William,</hi> and his People this day, even ſuch a ſight as <hi>David</hi>'s was, <hi>Pſal. 106. 5.

               <p>Thus would theſe Enemies have bereft us of him whom God hath bequeathed us. They Deſigned and Plotted like <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> thoſe reſerved Enemies of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to Murther him in ſecret; and not like <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> thoſe noble Antagoniſts, to bid him Defiance in the Field.</p>
               <p>They deſigned, not like <hi>(Alcides)</hi> cruelly to Bite their Mothers Breaſt; but like <hi>Nero,</hi> to rip up her Bowels. Not only (like <hi>Tarquinius) Summa papavera amputare,</hi> lop off the Chieſtains of the Nations, but like <hi>Procruſtes,</hi> cut of the Feet too. This Deviliſh Plot was extended from him that ſat upon the Throne, to him that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured at the Plow. And if we extend our Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the preparedneſs of their minds, had all that were Faithful in the Land no more than one Neck, theſe <hi>Caligula</hi>'s I allude to, had cut it off at one blow. Nay, in one Senſe they did it I may ſay: For the Head of the Parliament is declared by Law to be King, and the Parliament (we know) is a kind of a whole Nation Epitomis'd; and ſo to cut off, and Murther King <hi>William,</hi> was to Behead the Parliament; and what was that in effect, but to cut the very Throats of the Engliſh Nation?
