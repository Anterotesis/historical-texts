            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> Man would think the Brevity and the Nature of this ſmall Treatiſe, which is compoſed of nothing elſe but Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, Examples and Demonſtration, ſhould have ſaved me the trouble to prefix a Preface before it, which uſually being nothing elſe but an extract of what is moſt uſeful in any Work, it did ſeem ſuperſluous in this place; but becauſe, the Reader, at the first View, and before he hath read it quite over, might have found ſome things, defective in the Order, and the Nature of the Proofs I have made uſe of, I perceive my ſelf obliged to render a Reaſon of both in this Preface; as for the Order or Method it would, without doubt, have ſeemed more natural to begin theſe Proofs at the Holy Scripture, and to have continued them by Reaſons fetched from the Law of Nature and of Nations, and at laſt to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the Teſtimonies of the learned in all Ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. I have taken a Courſe quite contrary; and the Reaſon of it is, that the Holy Scriptures having determined nothing poſitively nor preciſely touching this matter; but hath left the Law of Nature and that of Nations in full force and vertue, without meddling with, or infringing them, which I intend to make appear in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing the Reaſons which thoſe of a contrary Opinion, endeavour to draw from them, under pretence that they every where teach hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and patience. Now every one knows that the refuting of an Adverſaries Proofs ought evermore to follow, and not to precede the <hi>Theſis</hi> which one maintains. I have alſo made the Teſtimonies and
<pb facs="tcp:94815:3"/>
Examples to go before the Arguments, as being proofs, much more obvious and more popular than thoſe of meer ſpeculation, being very ſure that what hath been always believed and practiſed, is generally the mind and ſentiment of all Mankind, and not that of ſome particular Perſons. I have alſo had another reaſon for doing this, which is that finding ſome examples, in ancient Records, running exactly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel with what hath ſo lately happened in great <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now a word or to do muſt be ſpoken touching the Nature and Validity of the Teſtimonies which I have related. At firſt ſight a Proteſtant may be againſt thoſe Teſtimonies the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> brings in, either by her Counſels, or by her particular Doctors, nay, and if he have but a pique againſt, and be but never ſo little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content with the alterations that have been made in this Country, he will preſently cry out againſt ſuch like Authorities, and will not be able to endure, that the Reformed ſhould make uſe of them; his impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is rather an effect of his paſſion, then of a right diſcerning of the Truth; and for to convince him that it is ſo, he needs do no more but to make theſe Obſervations with me upon the Councils which I have alledged. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they did not conſiſt of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Perſons alone, as do thoſe of the later Ages; but of all the States of that Nation wherein they were aſſembled, and that all their determinations and deciſions (more eſpecially in State Affairs) derived all their Power and Authority, from the Power politick; their Decrees for the moſt part being publiſhed under the King's Name, who almoſt ever aſſiſted at it, in Perſon; Together with the Grandees of the State, as may appear by the Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> I have quoted. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Although there was already a great many errors and abuſes in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, yet for all that, it was then the true viſible Church, being it made uſe of no other Creed but that of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and the <hi>Nicene,</hi> as one may ſee in the National Counſels of <hi>Spain,</hi> and eſpecially in that of <hi>Toledo,</hi> where they rehearſed always the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed as the Foundation and Arbidge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Faith of the Church; and by the way, that I may ſpeak my thoughts what has given the Mortal blow to the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, I think it has been the Addition which <hi>Pious</hi> the <hi>IV.</hi> made of his own profeſſion of Faith to this Creed, for that very time, thoſe who had tender Conſciences or any ſence of Chriſtianity, could not diſgeſt their being obliged by Oath to believe all thoſe impious and profane Additions, ſincerely, and firmly, as the Fundamental Truths of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94815:3"/>
The <hi>3d.</hi> Obſervation that we are to make, is touching the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church; which, as well as its Doctrine were not by far ſo much corrupted as they were in the Ages ſucceeding: Although the Peopes, <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the two firſt of that Name, did very much enlarge the Philacteries of the <hi>Roman</hi> High Prieſt, Yet, had they not ſet themſelves up for Sovereign Arbitrators, and Umpires of Divine and Human Rights; beſides, the Opinion of the Infallibility, had not then ſo much as entered into the mind of Man, ſo that theſe determinatons and definitive Sentences of the Counſel, are much more juridical and more ſuiting with the Order God hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in his Church, and indeed deſerve a great deal more reſpect and conſideration then thoſe of the Counſels of the laſt Ages. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, ſince the firſt <hi>Oecumenique</hi> Counſel of <hi>Lateran,</hi> wherein things began to be regulated only according to the Phantaſie of the Popes, and not according to Scripture, nor Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Now as for the particular Doctors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, I have not pretended that they ſhould be a Rule to the Reformed in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but only indirectly, that is to ſay, I do make appear by that, that all Chriſtians have held the ſame Principle, for one cannot deny but that the Reformation may have been ſettled upon this Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that the Power of Princes over their Subjects, is not Abſolute, neither in Spirituals or Temporals, there having been ſeveral People who have ſhaken off the Yoke of their old Masters for the ſake of Religion, and not any People but would have done the ſame, if they had but had power ſo to do, at ſuch time as they had to do with a Sovereign, who went about to oppreſs them.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking my mind ſincerely and freely as I have done of the Power of Sovereigns, and of the Rights of the People, I have made no incroachment or attempt upon the lawful Power of Kings, God forbid I ſhould, there is not a Man in the World more convinced, or more fully perſwaded of the preheminence and excellency of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Government above all others then my ſelf, at ſuch time as it confines it ſelf within its juſt limits. No Man of judgment will ever condemn any ſort of Government whatſoever, when is it ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, and is agreeable to the Humour and Genius of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>What I have advanced that toucheth them the moſt to the quick is taken from a Sermon, that <hi>Gerſon</hi> Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> Preached before King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>VI.</hi> and the <hi>Dolphin</hi> who found no fault with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94815:4"/>
If I have defended the Conduct and Proceeding of the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of <hi>England,</hi> it is becauſe they have changed the Governor only, but not the Government; and that it had ſubſtituted in the room of an Oppreſſor, a pious, juſt, and wiſe Prince. Nay, and a Prince too, who was rightful Heir to the Crown, whom they went about to diſpoil and deveſt of his Rights, by a certain fraudulent way never heard of in any Age.</p>
            <p>Some may be apt to ſay, that this Treatiſe would have come more ſeaſonably three Years ago, then now, I grant that, but I had not then the opportunities and helps I met with ſince, which were abſolutely neceſſary for me, nay, I muſt confeſs I had not ſo much as thought of it, had it not been for an inſipid and impudent <hi>French</hi> Book which hath made a great Noiſe in the World; 'tis call'd, <hi>Advis aux Refugiez,</hi> the impertinent Scribler of this Libel, by eſtabliſhing Abſolute Power in a groſs manner, which ſmells more of his Penſion, then of Love for Truth, hath wickedly charged all thoſe of his Nation of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, who did not blindly obey the Will of their King, and involves the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation in the ſame, if not in a greater for loving its Religion and its Laws. I was moreover confirmed in my Deſign, by the reading of a poſthumons Piece of <hi>Richer</hi> Dr. of <hi>Paris,</hi> which was publiſhed the laſt Year, as well as the other, and upon the ſame Accunt. I have in compiling this Piece, been more ſolicitous about things, than words; and that is the Reaſon why one will ſcarce find in it any Ornaments, but ſuch as do naturally ariſe from the ſubject Matter: whether I have ſucceeded well in the Deſign, I have propounded to my ſelf, I leave that to the Readers judgment; I will aſſure him only that I have been exceeding faithful in whatſoever I have reported from the Authors I have quoted.</p>

            <p>NExt to the Queſtions that are converſant about Faith, there is not any one of greater conſequence we meet with, that falls under debate, than that Queſtion touching Regal Power; for it highly concerns the Publick to underſtand whether or no it be limited and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by humane Laws, or is to be accounted ſupreiour to them all. It will be therefore worth our while, eſpecially in this new unexpected Conjuncture and change of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that have ſo much aſtoniſhed the World, to attempt ſome diſcourſe of it exactly and ſuccinctly. But now to decide each Controverſie that may ariſe concerning Regal power, as well by <hi>divine</hi> as <hi>humane Rights,</hi> nothing ſeems more to the purpoſe, than to begin with the Authority Eccleſiaſtical, tempered and allayed with the Civil, for ſince it conſiſts of both Rights, it deſervedly holds the firſt place, and amongſt humane Authorities is lookt upon as the greateſt.

               <p>Nor after what manner the <hi>Capetians</hi> were by conſent of all the <hi>French</hi> ſubſtituted in the Room of the <hi>Carlovingians;</hi> and how <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh was ſurrounded with thirty ſix Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, without whoſe Advice he could not govern the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, as known to all, we omit.</p>
               <p>But what on this Subject is beyond all exception, and may ſtop the Mouth of the Patrons of Tyranny, is the Conſent of all the Chriſtian Princes in the Convention of <hi>Arras:</hi> The buſineſs thus, <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh, whilſt he was but yet <hi>Dolphin,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>John,</hi> Father to <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> traiterouſly to be aſſaſſinated, thereupon a bloody War aroſe between the two Princes; but at length by the mediation and procurement of the Counſel of <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Pope Engenius,</hi> a Council was called, and held at <hi>Arras</hi> for compoſing Differences, whereunto the nobleſt part of <hi>Europe</hi> had reſort. It was ſaith <hi>Mezeray</hi> the nobleſt and greateſt of that Age, thither did all Chriſtian Princes (except King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who diſputed the Crown of <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Charles,)</hi> ſend their Agents and Plenipotentiaries, and <hi>Eugenius</hi> his Ambaſſadors: A Peace being once clapt up between the two Princes, it was covenanted and agreed upon, that if either of the two Princes ſhould not ſtand to their words, but violate the Articles of Agreement, that then his Subjects, abſolved of their Oaths, might lawfully ſend Succours to another Prince againſt the breaker of the Covenant: here you may plainly ſee that all Princes do unanimouſly agree in abſolving Subjects of their Oaths of Allegiance; beſides you may ſee that a Vaſſal doth covenant with his Lord upon equal Conditions, for <hi>Philip</hi> was Vaſſal to <hi>Charles:</hi> So much the more is the ſimplicity of thoſe to be laught at, who dare affirm that Princes are not ſo much

The <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Hiſtory likewiſe furniſheth us with a long ſeries of Examples of this Nature, but too great a Prolixity, eſpecially in matters of themſelves, otherwiſe plain and evident, is tedious and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: Let one therefore, and that very conſiderable in its ſelf ſuffice, which is this: <hi>John</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Sans terre,</hi> or without Land, King of <hi>England</hi> and Duke of <hi>Brittain</hi> ſtanding excommunicate by Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the III. and his Subjects abſolved from their Oath of Allegiance, the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> was devolved upon <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Now <hi>Philip</hi> relying upon this donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Pope, having fitted out a huge Navy, was juſt ready to fall upon and Invade <hi>England;</hi> when <hi>John</hi> by his ſubmiſſion and obſequious compliance, regained the Pope's favour. Neither did <hi>Philip</hi> for all that deſiſt from his enterprize, for he gave his Conſent, that the Nobility of <hi>England</hi> ſhould chooſe <hi>Lewis</hi> his Son, Husband to <hi>Jone</hi> K. <hi>John</hi>'s Niece for their King, and ſhould Crown him in <hi>London</hi> accordingly; the Matter proceeded to Suit and Tryal before the Pope, ſtill a great favourer of <hi>John:</hi> the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Lewis</hi> who ſolioited his Cauſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged that <hi>John</hi> was never Leige King, becauſe he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Peers of <hi>France</hi> to have his Head cut off, for the Murder committed on the perſon of <hi>Arthur</hi> his Nephew, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that if he were a King, yet that he had notwithſtanding forfeited his Crown, by turning a Tyrant, and that it was Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, as they ſaid, to ſubvertand deſtory the Regal Power, the death of <hi>John</hi> ſtops the Proceedings, and ends the Difference, and his Son <hi>Henry</hi> placed in his ſtead: Pray let the <hi>French</hi> take ſpecial notice of this Paſſage, who are out of humour and ill ſatisfied at the laſt Revolution and Change of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and if they are wiſe, let them take warning whilſt they may, by their own conſeſſion. Tyranny quite overthrows Kingly Power, and it evidently appears by their own Example,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94815:8"/>
that the Throne of a Tyrant may juſtly and lawfully be poſſeſſed by another, and in truth it was but juſt, that the Parliament ſhould ſerve <hi>James</hi> the II: with the ſame Sauce as the Peers did <hi>John,</hi> not coming at all ſhort of him in deſerving to be dethroned, then again <hi>John</hi> did not go about to ſubvert the Eſtabliſhed Religion then in Force, nor did he ſorſake the Kingdom and fly to the ſworn Enemies of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, add hereto, that <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> had much a better Claim and Title to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> as being Heirs preſumptive, then ever <hi>Lewis</hi> had, who was no preſumptive Heir.</p>
               <p>I can hardly forbear the adding to this Example, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Authority of the Parliament by <hi>Richard</hi> the II, in his ſolemn ſurrender of his Crown upon their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: I refer the Reader as to this point to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, more eſpecially to <hi>Henry Knighton,</hi> Canon of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> in his Book <hi>De Eventibus Angliae,</hi> who hath at large and exactly inſiſted upon this dreadful depoſing.</p>

               <p>WE have produced but too many illuſtrious Examples, and grave weighty determinations to overthrow the Abſolute Power of Princes, yet peradventure, ſome may deſire that we would impugn and oppoſe it by Arguments deduced from the Law of Nature and Nations; we ſhall not think much to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their requeſt, for there is a vaſt company of Arguments do continually flow from the very Fountains of Nature it ſelf, wherewith as by ſo many battering Rams, the ſtrong hold of Tyranny may be battered and levelled with the Ground.</p>
               <p>It might perhaps ſtand us upon in this place, to enter upon a Diſcourſe concerning the Riſe and Origin of Powers, but ſince, that is ſo long and tedious conſidering our preſent deſign, we are willing to leave that task to your Civiliars; it will ſerve our turn to have only touched curſorily upon ſome of the chief Points which conduce to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>'Tis believed by all true Chriſtians, that if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood and perſevered in his primitive Integrity, his Poſterity would never have ſtood in need either of Laws or of Magiſtracy; Man being of unblamable life and upright converſation, would have been a Law to himſelf, and would have acknowledged no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that of reaſon only.

               <p>Now if any imagin he hath hit the Nail on the Head, if he ſay Abſolute Power is an App<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Neither will I deny, but that Kingly Power, as alſo all Magiſtracy is the Appendix and effect of Sin, for I have ſo ſtated the buſineſs before, but nothing can be inferred ſrom thence, which may in the leaſt favour Abſolute Power, for ſeeing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94815:12"/>
the whole Human Nature is contaminated and polluted, and even over-run with ſin; Princes themſelves, as Men, are born Servants to ſin, and are the Vaſſals of death as well as the meaneſt Peaſants, all mens conditions upon that ſcore are equal, whence any one may eaſily infer that by the Law of Nature whether intire, or lapſed, no right can be aſcribed to one Man over another, abating the right that Parents have over their Children.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Nor can Abſolute Power call any thing more to back and aſſiſt it out of the Law of Nations, becauſe the Law of Nations is in a manner common to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Amongſt thoſe who approach neareſt to Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power, if they be narrowly ſifted and examined, they will be found to diſcard and deſtroy Abſolute Power; nor indeed are we to paſs by in ſilence, that the firſt Form of Government inſtituted by God himſelf immediately was abſolutely Democratical or Ariſtocratical, wherefore its very plain and evident alſo, that Abſolute Power and Dominion is quite cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ary to the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as never having been ordained any where that we can learn. There remains ſtill the Civil Law, under which it may ſeem to ſeek ſhelter and borrow pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage; but now what that Law is that juſties out and deſtroys the Law of Nature and Nations, I cannot conceive, unleſs it be plain down-right diſhoneſty and injury.</p>
               <p n="3">III. If Abſolute Power were allowed upon Earth, then the right of God, the moſt juſt Creatour and wiſe Governour of all things, would not differ about temporals <hi>intenſione</hi> as they term it, but <hi>extenſione,</hi> from that created power, which is for the moſt part blinded by covetouſneſs, which is moſt impious to think.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The whole is bigger then its parts, and a Prince is but a part of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Common-wealth is greater than the Prince: This demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſtrongly backt from the conſideration, that a Common-wealth is a whole, ſtanding in need of a Prince <hi>nec ad eſſe, nec ad bene eſſe, ſed tantum ad melius,</hi> neither as to its being, nor well-being, but only to its better being; now when a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is well and cannot be better; none but a perfect ſlave to Tyrants will deny, but that it highly concerns the Common-wealth to look about them and provide for their ſafety.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It is confeſt by all hands, that Laws were enacted for the reſtraining of Mens inordinate Luſts and Deſires, whence it is moſt clear that whatſoever power tends to the favouring Man's covetous Deſires is altogether an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power; as modern experience that I may not rake into the records of Antiquity ſufficiently makes out: <hi>It is an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Lipſide Conſtan. Lib. 2. Cap. 29.</note> But now Abſolute Power doth favour the unruly deſires of Princes, therefore is unlawful.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. All power is ordained by God for the benefit of Society, now Abſolute Power is the Calamity, bane and deſtruction of Society, therefore it is not ordained of God.</p>

but Regal Power derives its riſe and beginning from the People, therefore ought Regal Power to be ſubject to, and depend upon the People; the uſual Anſwer to this Argument is, that the firſt Propoſition is not always true, as for example, that the Pope is elected by the Cardinals, yet is he not ſubject to them after his Election; but this anſwer is vain and nothing at all to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <note place="margin">Salmatius Edmund Riche<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>VIII. Beſides there was ever a great difference between Subjects and Servants, Subjects are always looked upon in the Scripture as Sons and Brethren, but Servants are accounted as the vileſt and moſt abject of Mortals, now then if <note place="margin">

If Monarchical Government were Abſolute, it would be the leſs noble then the Democratical, for Democracy is the Dominion over Free-born Men, for it implies a contradiction for a People in the ſame reſpect both to rule and obey; but a Monarchy if it be unlimited is the ruling over Servants, but now the Government over Freemen is a great deal more noble, then that over Servants, even as the Authority and Power of a Father over his Son, doth far excel the Power of a Maſter over his Slaves: It makes not at all againſt us that God's Power over his Creatures is Abſolute, for I acknowledge that there can be no certain concluſion gathered from God to his People, by reaſon of the vaſt diſproportion and immenſity between his Nature and Power, and theirs.

XVIII. Regal Right in all Nations is the ſelf ſame as to its Riſe and Origin, if ſome Nations parted with more then they needed to have done to their Princes, that produced from their ill-bred diſpoſition knowing no better, or from their want of skill in their own and the Nations Right. I will make it clear to the meaneſt Capacity: Regal Power ſometimes falls to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the Pandors of the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who wonderfully extols her Authority above that of Kings, do not deny, but that a Pope may, and ought to be depoſed for Hereſie: Therefore according to all theſe Doctors a Tyrant may, and ought to be depoſed, for that the Pope, whoſe authority is above, or at leaſt equal to Regal Authority, may, and ought, whenſoever he ſhall turn Heretick, be removed from holding the Reigns of Church-Government.</p>

               <p n="21">XXI. In all Chriſtian Kingdoms there are certain Orders of Knighthood, by which the moſt illuſtrious and renowned of the Subjects, together with the King, are uſually dignified and diſtinguiſhed; the Sovereign of theſe Knights is the Prince, who is equally bound, and even takes an Oath to obey the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Order, as well as the reſt of the Members of that Order. Now if the King in this Ceremony obliges himſelf by Oath, much more is he bound by that Oath he takes at his Coronation, becauſe this laſt Oath is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, <hi>neceſſitate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We look upon it as a needleſs piece of work, to diſtinguiſh between the Rights of one Kingdom and another; 'tis all one, for there are but two Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Kingly Power, <hi>viz.</hi> Force of Arms and Election; Chriſtians are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Lots, the Heathens ſeldom, or never made uſe of them; if a King, win a Kingdom by force of Arms, yet for all that, he muſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel his Subjects to things unjuſt and contrary to the Law of Nature and of Nations, if he do force them upon ſuch things; why, then indeed, when occaſion ſerves, and when their ſtrength permits, Subjects may have recourſe to their right of reducing the King to his juſt Limits of Government, conformable to that celebrated Axiom, <hi>vim vi repellere licet.</hi> It is lawful to repel force by force, for what was taken away <hi>nolens volens</hi> mny alſo be recovered by force; if Election could take place, yet we ſhould have the better of it however, becauſe there is no Election without Obligations

and Conditions, whereunto as well Princes as People are to be equally bound and obliged; both Nature and Religion do alike will and require it: For aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as God himſelf (as we but juſt now hinted) hath bounded himſelf by his Promiſe, ſo ought a man, how eminent in vertuous Qualifications ſoever he may be to exerciſe Humane Dominion over other men, as by no means to aſpire to 'Divine Honours; who finds himſelf no whit better than his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and muſt not take too much upon him, nor ſo demean himſelf amongſt his fellow Creatures, as if he had attain'd to a degree of Divine Perfection; for men create Idols, but do not create Gods. The right of inheritance has no greater Right than the Law of Arms, or the Law of Election, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Succeſſors Right and Power are entailed upon him by vertue of his Predeceſſors; And Right is what the Subject granted and yielded to, and not what Princes uſurped to themſelves. A Prince 'tis true, by inheritance obtains the right of taking upon himſelf the Government of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, before any other of the ſame Nation, but that Right doth not procure for him, as I may ſo ſay, ſo large a Power, and ſuperlative a Government above others; for it was not the Peoples intent and deſign, when they honoured one Family with ſuch high Dignity, that it ſhould thereby become prejudicial and more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to them, but rather that they ſhould find the Family ſo much the more gracious and bountifull, by how much they had, upon ſeveral accounts, obliged it to them: 'Tis true indeed, it is ſomewhat an hard task to alter the Form of Government, which are obtained by Inheritance, becauſe Regal Power in one Family by long poſſeſſion, and confirmed by cuſtom, pleads pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, yea, and hath muſtered up all its Forces to ſtrengthen and uphold its Dignity; but notwithſtanding it doth not thereupon follow that by Law or Right, their Power is fuller or more valid, than if they were beholden to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection for their Authority; in as much as it derived its Pedegree and Original from the Peoples bare conceſſion. It is confeſſed by all men, that the Almighty did out of a tender regard to his People, grant them the liberty of making choice of what Form of Government they thought moſt convenient, and moſt ſuitable to their manner of living: It will be therefore agreeable to reaſon, to conclude, that God did alſo grant them the liberty of changing the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Magiſtrates, as by themſelves ſo conſtituted, eſpecially if they abuſed their Power, and ſwerved from the true way conducing to the end propounded, that is an happy and peaceable Life: For ſince Princes were ordained for the benefit and advantage of Civil Society, it is more ſuitable and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Goodneſs and Wiſdom of God, that Princes ſhould depend upon the People, who can never be wanting to themſelves, than that the People ſhould depend on Princes, who out of a certain innate Principle, incident to all men living, being all for their own ends, and for what they can get, oftentimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get themſelves, and their Duty towards the Common-wealth, and ſpoyling all by forgetting the true end why they were ſo highly promoted to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, make ill improvement of the Regal Dignity, and of the end for which it had been conferr'd upon them, uſe it for their own, and not for the Publique Advantage.</p>

               <p>Our Adverſaries produce that remarkable known Paſſage in the Hiſtory of King <hi>Saul,</hi> the ſubſtance of which we thus comprize: The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> now grown weary of the Government of Judges, require a King of God, like unto the Kings of other Nations; they don't forthwith obtain their deſire, nor was it convenient they ſhould; but before God would comply with their requeſt, he forewarns them by his Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> of thoſe things Kings would do, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; contra officium,</hi> beſides and contrary to their Duty, and not altogether without precedent; yet they did not for all that alter their mind; at length God wearied by their improbrious Demands, granted them <hi>Saul</hi> for their King.

               </p>
               <p>But the chief Maſter-Piece of Fawning-Courtiers, on which they lay the greateſt ſtreſs, ſeems to be this; that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> never ejected, or ever called any of their Kings to an account, in a Court of Judicature, although the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of them were very diſſolute, wicked, and idolatrous; but what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is not according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſenſe, always expedient. It is the part of a wiſe man when he deſigns to ſet about any buſineſs of concern, to have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial regard to time and circumſtances, leaſt contriving unwarily, and not time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it aright, he loſe himſelf, and fall ſhort of his expectation. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were but rightly ſerved, if they underwent greater puniſhments then others, who had ſet over themſelves a King, as it were againſt the will, and even in deſpite of God: They were even fain to ſmother and diſſemble with their grief for very ſhame, who had made a Rod for their own back. 'Tis alſo well known, that the Law hath not its force in time of war, nor can that people defend their Laws, when ſurrounded on all ſides with potent Enemies. Moreover it is not in every reſpect true, that Kings were never any where by the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> thruſt from the Throne, for the revolt of the Ten Tribes from <hi>Rehoboham,</hi> and their election of <hi>Jeroboham,</hi> is plain down right abdication and depoſing.</p>

He that was not yet a King to threaten thus, what would he have done if he had once gotten the Crown on his head.</hi> I and after the <hi>Jews</hi> had mightily fallen away from their priſtine glory and renown, yet would they not reſign up, or be deprived of the priviledge of creating their Leaders: For the Writer of the Book of <hi>Macchabees,</hi> Lib. 1. cap. 13. gives us a relation of the Election of <hi>Simon</hi> the valiant, <hi>Aſſoon as the People heard theſe words their ſpirits revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and they anſwered with a loud voice, thou ſhalt be our Leader inſtead of</hi> Judas <hi>and</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan <note place="margin">

               <p>HAving thoroughly ſifted and diſcuſſed all the Succours that reinforce their Cauſe, out of the Old Law, Let us now ſee whether or no the New-Law be more favourable to them than that: They judge that Precept of our Saviour's, <hi>Give unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſar's,</hi> as the moſt material, and all in all, in this their Cauſe. But if I underſtand Chriſt's meaning, this famous Oracle of his doth rather make againſt our nonreſiſtant Paraſites than for them: For our Saviour doth not ſay all things are <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, but before he would anſwer this nice and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Demand, he thought it beſt to look upon the Inſcription of the Medal; nor is there any queſtion to be made, but that if the Image and Superſcription had been <hi>Herod</hi>'s, (ſuch was the exactneſs of his Juſtice) he would have commanded to render unto <hi>Herod</hi> the things that were <hi>Herod</hi>'s: Wherefore if the things that are <hi>Caeſars</hi> are to be rendered to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> Now if <hi>Caeſar</hi> exact thoſe things for his own, which are not ſo, by the Precept of Chriſt, or at leaſt the Precept ſtanding good and in force, they may be denied him; but the Honour, Life and Eſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are not <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s: The Subjects are liable, in ſome reſpect in duty bound, to maintain his Dignity and Prerogatives with all theſe. They are therefore obliged not to grudge venturing their Life and Fortune, but it is to be at the diſpoſal of the Nation, and not as the Prince pleaſeth,</p>
               <p>But now the reaſon why we are commanded in the Holy Scriptures to honour Kings, and even to obey them in ſuch things as are harſh, and croſs our Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I would fain know if any one can deny but this is alſo due to Democratical Government; it is a thing granted by all Chriſtians in general, that all Honour and Reverence
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94815:19"/>
is to be paid to Princes, even to bad ones, ſo long as they ſway the Scepter, provided they do not incroach upon the Rites of God Almighty, nor meddle with the Spiritual Concerus. But herein lies the main ſtreſs of the Queſtion, and turns upon this Hinge; Whether or no Princes, not uſing their Power as they ſhould do, and not adminiſtring the Common-wealth aright, may forfeit their Regal Power; if they do ſo forfeit, as we have before ſufficiently cleared, we do contend that they may incur the Penalty of being diſcarded, and we do readily conſent with the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> in the ſame, <hi>Cui piae non predeſt correctio, debita ei non parcat ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciſſio;</hi> to him whom pious correction does no good, let not a deſerved cutting off ſpare him, if ſo be it be once by the States of the Nation declared, that they have forfelted their Government; but I do not think it fit for any private Perſon, nor lawfull for divers particular Perſons together to paſs this Sentence, even as it is not lawfull for any private Perſon to introduce a new form of Government into the Common-wealth; but it is generally allowed by all, that this belongs to the whole Nation, or at leaſt to the better part of it.</p>
               <p>But to the end we may cut off all means and occaſions from our Adverſaries, of expecting any relief for the future from the New-Teſtament; thoſe Precepts by which we are inſtructed in our Duty towards Princes and Magiſtrates, are to be explained by three Obſervations. 1ſt. Thoſe Precepts as we obſerve, are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended and enjoined to all who are in Authority over others, without exception. Now the Authority of thoſe that bear rule, is not one and the ſame in all Nations; therefore the Laws of every Nation ſtanding in full force and vertue, holy men would introduce their own Laws without prejudice to the other. 2ly. The Apoſtles Rules reſpect particular men, not the whole Lump and Maſs of any particular Nation: For at ſuch time as they were delivered, the Church did not compoſe any body politick, nor did compoſe any, till a long time after; nay, even the Apoſtles Authority was odious, and ſuſpected by all Nations. 3ly. The Apoſtles had nothing to do to determine what Laws every Nation were to make uſe of; for our Bleſſed Lord would not have it, that his Church ſhould make us any politick particular Government; for ſince it was to be propagated through all parts of the world, which according to the various diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and humours of the People, the forms of Government do very much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, nay, and ſometimes are quite contrary one to another; it was but conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that the Apoſtles ſhould leave the adminiſtration of Government to it ſelf with this proviſo, that it ſhould not contain any thing in it that might ſeem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Tenure of the Goſpel.</p>

numerous Church, as a well Diſciplined Army: Moreover I deſire you, to take Notice of one thing more, which puts this Truth beyond all exception, and that is this, that the Chriſtians of the firſt three Centuries, did never ſuppreſs Hereticks by force of Armes; but after they had once got the management of Supream Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in their own Hand, they ſoon ſuppreſt, not only Hereticks, but even Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks too by Armes.

               <p>It does therefore evidently appear, that the Chriſtians of the Primitive Church, ſuppoſing the Power of the Sword annexed to Magiſtracy, did forbear uſing it, whilſt they were deſtitute of a Chriſtian Magiſtracy; but when once they were Subject to a Chriſtian M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And now methinks, we have abundantly evinced, both by the Decrees of the Councils, and by conſtant uſage and practice, as well as by the Laws of Nations, by the determinations of the Doctors, by the confeſſion of Emperours and Kings, and laſt of all by the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <head>The Appendix to this ſmall Treatiſe.</head>
            <p>WHen I had quite made an end of this ſmall piece, I accidentally met with the poſthumous Work of <hi>Edmond Richer,</hi> Doctor of the faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> no obſcure perſon, touching Eccleſiaſtical Power in Temporal Matters, it was publiſhed at <hi>Cologne Anno</hi> 1691. wherein he makes as if he would lay ſome foundation for the abſolute Power of the King, but defends it with ſuch ſorry piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Arguments, that altho he had a mind to ſacrifice Truth to Regal Power, yet

in ſpight of his Teeth, Truth (for it's ſtronger than any King) will bravely hold up its Head againſt Error: nor would I have you take my word for it; let him have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> hearing, bringing in his Evidence for Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the Second Doubt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I grant that every Commonwealth ſtandeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its own Legs, and is ſufficient for its ſelf, by Divine and Natural Right ſhould it be either a Republick or a Monarchy, ſo it be done by a free Conſent of the Eſtates, and the Publick Peace kept, for by what Right it doth by the undnimous conſent of all, chuſe freely a Prince, by the ſame Right alſo may it abrogate and diſown that Prince, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that in ſo abrogating, the Publick Tranquility and Peace be not diſturbed; for if the Publick Peace ſuffer thereby, it is far the wiſer courſe to reſt ſatisfied, and endure the Grievances and Tyranny of one ſingle perſon than of many, conformable to that Precept of our Bleſſed Lord, not to plu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>k up the Tares with harm to the Wheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Theſis, <hi>Richerius</hi> does not only ſettle and maintain the Right inherent to the People to depoſe ill Princes, but does alſo mightily approve of the late change that happened in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> affairs as lawful: For <hi>Charles</hi> the Second dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lawful Iſſue, it was in the Parliaments Power, either to elect or refuſe <hi>James</hi> the Second, by reaſon of his great averſeneſs to the True Religion, it was therefore in the Parliaments Power to eject him; but they ejected him as one who did not adminiſter aright; neither was the Peace and Tranquility diſturbed in ſo abrogating him, neither were there more Tyrants placed in his ſtead, but the true rightful Heirs to the Crown <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary;</hi> and by rooting up the greateſt part of the Tares, no damage to the Wheat enſued; yea it becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e more pure and clean, therefore <hi>Richerius</hi> could have deſired nothing more in this Revolution.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the ſaid <hi>Richerius</hi> tells us, that as well Reaſon as the Practice of the Primitive Church do confirm, that it is altogether unlawful to ſhock the Peace and Quiet of the Publick, only upon the acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt of a Princes oppreſſing or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the Religion profeſſed and eſtabliſhed by his Predeceſſors, unleſs at the ſame time he injure the Peace, with the State of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>We have before lookt into the reaſon it ſelf, and conſtant practice of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church; but for all that, <hi>Richerius</hi> muſt needs confeſs that it is Lawful to reſtrain one that does injury to publick Tranquility. But this great <hi>Pariſian</hi> Doctor uſeth a ſtrange kind of diſtinction, <hi>Except it ſo fall out,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that he violate or corrupt the Peace, together with the ſtate of the Kingdom:</hi> He ſeems to make ſmall account of Religion, who ſuppoſeth that the Religion of a Kingdom may be ſuppreſt, and that yet the Peace of the Kingdom may not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> diſturbed and deſtroyed; the good man knows that Religion is one of the tendereſt things in the World; and thus you ſee how Truth uſes to compel the Maintainers and Abettors of Falſhood to acknowledge her; and even, whether they will or no, to extort an evidence for her againſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>Give me leave now to finiſh this Appendix with <hi>Richerius</hi>'s own Words, <hi>We muſt conclude then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that it is one of the greateſt Miracles that can poſſibly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
