            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
                  <p>OF all Arts in the World, none is so
Ancient, so Vseful, and so Admirable,
as that of Speaking and Writing well;
and it deserves to be esteem'd so much
the more, that it is peculiar to Men, and is the
only Knot of Society and Conversation.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the importance of this Art, has
seem'd so great to Men of Knowledge in all Ages,
that many Eminent Wits and Philosophers, and
even Princes, Kings, and Emperours, have not
thought it below their Dignity, not only to Learn
its Precepts, but to make Remarks and publish
Treatises upon it; To which, may be added, that
no Science or Liberal Art in the Common-Wealth



<pb facs="tcp:54097:7"/>
of Learning, has produced so many Books as this,
in all polite Countries.</p>
                  <p>Since the French-Tongue is arrived to that pitch
of Reputation, as to become the General Language
of all Courts, and one of the chiefest Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of accomplisht Persons in <hi>Europe,</hi> there is scarce
any thing to be seen every where, but French-Grammars.</p>
                  <p>It is beyond my purpose to say any thing of
those that have been Printed in other Countries:
But, I must confess, that among the great number of
those we have had in <hi>England,</hi> I find none but
what are imperfect, and which among many good
things have considerable defects, either in the
Subject Matter, or in the order and disposition
of it.</p>
                  <p>The small Credit which many of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars
have gotten in the World, saves me the
trouble of enumerating their defects; and confines
me to speak of that, which Fifteen Editions have
proclaim'd the best. And indeed, if any Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Reader does but examine it without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
he will soon be convinced, that it is but
a confused heap of fragments, and scraps of other
Grammars shuffled and jumbled together without
Method: There you will see most Rules of the
<hi>Latin</hi> Tongue promiscuously used for the <hi>French,</hi>
as if the Picture of a Young Aiery <hi>Daughter,</hi> was
like to be well drawn, by that of an Antiquated



<pb facs="tcp:54097:7"/>
                     <hi>Mother;</hi> and if every Language had not a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<hi>Air</hi> and Character that distinguish it from all
others. There you will see many things essential
to Grammar, either superficially hinted, or
wholly omitted, when at the same time, you will
be tired by the tedious particulars of many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant
Niceties.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>M</hi>—it seems, had been sensible of the
faults of former Grammarians, and had given us
the hopes of redressing them; but his cure has
proved worse than the Disease, and forgetting the
fair promises of his Preface, when he comes to
the Execution, he falls into such prolixity of
Precepts, Rules, and Exceptions, as would create
in the most patient and laborious Reader, a disgust
for the very Name of Grammar.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis time for me to give an Account of this
Book, to let the Reader judge, whether the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
answers to the Title, and whether it be
free from those faults I reprehend in others.</p>
                  <p>I call it, <hi>The Compleat French-Master,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I make bold to say, that it comprehends in a
manner all that is necessary for the attaining of
the French-Tongue; and that too, with such a
pleasant and delightful variety, as renders it the
most proper that ever was made in this nature, for
<hi>Ladies and Gentlemen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:54097:8"/>
It is divided in three Parts, of which, the first
is a short and plain Grammar, which contains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what is essential, and that too so Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
(I had almost said so Geometrically) disposed,
that one may see, as it were, at a view, the true
situation and coherency of the <hi>Parts</hi> for the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the <hi>Whole;</hi> the Declensions of Nouns,
and the Conjugation of Verbs Regular and Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
the two most intricate things in other Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars,
tho' the most important, are made so plain
and so easie in this, that I presume to say, that
nothing can be added to it.</p>
                  <p>The Second Part contains, first, a large Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulary,
more Copious and Regular than any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
and which besides that, excels above the
others by two additional Collections, one of Nouns
Adjective, the other of Verbs. 2dly, A good
store of Familiar Dialogues upon all Occasions, and
for all manner of Persons. 3dly, A Collection of
most of those Phrases, in which the nicety of the
French Tongue consists; and Finally, twelve
Discourses by way of Conversation, both upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and delightful Matters; as, Religion, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Exercises, Manners, Travels, Pleasures,
Love and Friendship.</p>
                  <p>The Third Part is that, which may be term'd
the <hi>Recreative,</hi> for besides a Collection of the best
Iests and Repartees of several Eminent Persons,
both Modern and Ancient, and some pleasant



<pb facs="tcp:54097:8"/>
Stories, it contains a Second, of choice Letters
upon Gallantry and other Subjects, a Third, of the
properest Proverbs; and lastly, a Fourth, of
French Songs, upon the finest Tunes, either French
or English.</p>
                  <p>Now in the Spelling and Expressions, my chief
business has been, to follow those Authors who are
now in the highest Reputation in the Court of
<hi>France,</hi> and as for the Dialogues, Iests, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have endeavour'd to set them in
that free easie Stile, as may suit best with those,
whom chiefly I design to please.</p>

to give in this, a plain and brief Account of all
those difficulties that use to discourage them from

to be ignorant of it.</p>

                     <p>THE Grammar in general, is the Art of Speaking
and Writing well a Language, and consequently,
the French-Grammar Teaches one how to Speak
and Write well in <hi>French.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first Principles of Grammar are Letters, which are
twenty two in French, all which together, are called <hi>Alphabet</hi>
or <hi>Abece,</hi> and are thus written.</p>
                     <p>A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H,
I, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S,
T, U, <hi>or</hi> V, X, Y, Z.</p>
                     <p>Or thus.</p>
                     <p>a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, l, m,
n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, <hi>or</hi> v, x, y, z.</p>
                     <p>

                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54097:11"/>
And which in general may be thus pronounced.</p>
                     <p>Aw, Bé, Cé, Dé, Ea, Ef, Gé,
Aush, Ee, Ell, Em, En, O, Pé,
Qu, Er, Es, Te, U, Ex,
Ee <hi>Greac,</hi> Zed.</p>
                     <p>The Letters of the first row are called Capitals, and those of
the second Common.</p>
                     <p>Capitals are used in the beginning of a Sentence and of a
Verse, of Proper Names, of Names of Office and Title, and
of an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> thing of Note.</p>
                     <p>Letters are divided into Vowels and Consonants.</p>
                     <p>The Vowels are five, <hi>A, E, I</hi> or <hi>Y, O, V,</hi> and are so
called, because they form a <hi>voice</hi> or <hi>sound</hi> by themselves.</p>
                     <p>The rest of the Letters are called Consonants, because they
cannot make a sound, or be pronounc'd, without the help
of a Vowel either before or after, <hi>as, bé, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>é, em, en,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now the joining and mingling of Vowels and Consonants
together, make Syllables, Syllables make Words, Words make
Phrases or Sentences, which last make up a Language.</p>
                     <p>A Language is the way of expressing ones Thoughts, which
may be done, either by word of Mouth or in Writing.</p>
                     <p>Therefore there are two chief things required to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<hi>viz.</hi> True Pronunciation and Spelling; the former is
attainable in some measure by Rules, but the other, only by
frequent and diligent Reading.</p>
                     <p>* I shall in the next Chapter, give you some few Rules
about the French Pronunciation; tho at the same time I
must needs tell you, that it is impossible to arrive to any
perfection in that, without the help of an able Master, and
the Conversation of those that Speak good French.</p>

a Proper Noun is the particular Name of any single thing; as,

Noun, signifies all things of the same kind; as, <hi>Vn Homme</hi>

Singular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Plural.</p>
                           <p>The Singular speaketh of one single thing, as, <hi>le Iour</hi> the

                           <p>The Plural speaks of more than one, as <hi>les Iours</hi> the Days,

                           <p>The Plural Number is formed in French as in English, by

same in the Plural; as, <hi>le Bras</hi> the Arm, <hi>les Bras</hi> the Arms.
<hi>Vne Noix</hi> a Walnut, <hi>Des Noix</hi> Walnuts. <hi>Le Nez</hi> the Nose, <hi>les
Nez</hi> the Noses.</p>
                           <p>† 2. Most Singular Nouns in <hi>Al</hi> or <hi>Ail,</hi> make their Plural in

                           <p>THe Gender or the form of Verbs is that which shews
their nature and proper Signification; and is of five
sorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Active, Passive, Neuter, Common, and Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal.</p>
                           <p n="1">

                              <pb n="26" facs="tcp:54097:23"/>
1. An active Verb expresses an action that passes from
one subject to another; as, <hi>Dieu aime les Hommes,</hi> God
loves Men. <hi>Elle mange une Perdrix,</hi> she eats a Partridge.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. A Passive Verb expresses the suffering or reception of
the action; as, <hi>Ie suis batu,</hi> I am beaten. <hi>Vous étes loüe,</hi>
you are praised.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. A Neuter Verb expresses an action which remains in
the subject that produces it; as, <hi>Ie suis,</hi> I am. <hi>Ie Cours,</hi>
I run. <hi>Ie palis,</hi> I grow pale.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. A common Verb is that which is sometimes Active,
and sometimes Neuter. As, <hi>Engraisser,</hi> to fatten, or, to grow
fat. <hi>Rougir,</hi> to make red, or to blush.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. A Verb Reciprocal reflects the action upon the subject
that produces it, and so all Active Verbs may be turned
into Reciprocal; as, <hi>Se dorloter,</hi> to pamper ones self. <hi>S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer,</hi>
to admire ones self. <hi>Se tuer,</hi> to kill ones self.</p>

                           <p>A Mood is an Accident of Verbs that shews the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ways and manners an action may be done by.</p>
                           <p>There are properly but four Moods, <hi>viz.</hi> Indicative, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative,
Conjunctive, and Infinitive.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The Indicative expresses the action directly and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely;
as, <hi>Ie mange,</hi> I eat. <hi>Ie mangerai,</hi> I shall eat.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The Imperative commands or forbids the doing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
action; as, <hi>Mange,</hi> eat thou. <hi>Qu'il Mange,</hi> let him
eat.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The Conjunctive is so called, first, because it is most
commonly used with Conjunctions before it, such as, <hi>Que</hi>
that. <hi>Affinque</hi> that, <hi>or,</hi> to the end that. <hi>Pourveuque,</hi>
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided



<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54097:23"/>
that. <hi>Pleut à Dieu que,</hi> would to God that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Secondly because it never makes a sence, except it be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Indicative, either before or after; as, <hi>Ie, sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haite
que vous m'aimiez,</hi> I wish you love me. <hi>Ie vous assure,
que vous m'obligeriez beaucoup,</hi> I assure you, that you would
greatly oblige me.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The Infinitive has an indetermined Signification,
and expresses the action without any Circumstance either of
Number or Person; as, <hi>aimer</hi> to love, <hi>avoir aimé</hi> to have
loved: And it is Construed with the other Moods, by which
only it is determined; as,</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ie veux aimer</hi> I will love, <hi>allez dormir</hi> go to sleep, <hi>je vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drois
savoir</hi> I would fain know.</p>
                           <p>There are three Prepositions which are commonly joyned
with the Infinitive, <hi>viz. De, A, Pour,</hi> which are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                           <p>Where you must observe, That the Conjunctive borrows
all its Tenses from the Indicative, except the Future.</p>
                           <p>* The English in imitation of the Greek, do conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
sometimes their Verbs with the Auxiliary, <hi>To
be,</hi> through all its Moods and Tenses, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiple
present of the Verb to be conjugated, and so
they say, <hi>I am loving, I was loving, I have been
loving, I had been loving, I shall or will be loving,</hi>
&amp;c. but this is nothing to our purpose.</p>
                           <p>Now (being as you have seen before, that the French
have seven Tenses in both Moods,) in the Indicative, the
Imperfect in English answers to the Imperfect and Preter
Definite in French, and the Pluperfect to both Pluperfects;
as,

                                 <item>
                                    <hi>J'aimois,</hi> I loved, or, I did love.</item>

                           </p>
                           <p>And in the Conjunctive Mood, the Imperfect in English an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to both Imperfects in French, and the Pluperfect to
both Pluperfects; as,

                           <p>No Verb of any of these four Conjugations, can be conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
through all its Moods and Tenses, without these two,
<hi>Avoir</hi> and <hi>Etre,</hi> which upon that account are called Auxiliary,
or helping Verbs, and which must be learnt before one ingages
himself into the Conjugation of others.</p>
                           <p>* Some Grammarians reckon a third Auxiliary
Verb, viz. <hi>Devoir,</hi> To ow, or, To be to, because it is
often joined with the Infinitive of other Verbs through
most of its Moods, Tenses and Persons, to signifie an
Action, that must or shall be done in this manner.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ie dois aimer,</hi> I am to Love, or I must Love, <hi>Vous devriez
emplir cette bouteille,</hi> you should fill that Bottle. <hi>Elle ne devoir
pas avoir été si cruelle,</hi> She should not have been so cruel.
<hi>Devant aller demain à la campagne,</hi> being to go to morrow into
the Country.</p>
                           <p>But I don't take it to be an Helping Verb, no more than
many others (which are joined to the Infinitive, through all
their Moods, Tenses and Persons, such as <hi>vouloir,</hi> to will,
<hi>Faire,</hi> to do, <hi>commencer,</hi> to begin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) because Verbs can
be Conjugated without them.</p>

to the Auxiliary Verb <hi>Etre,</hi> through all its Moods, Tenses,

*1. Note that in these Verbs, as in the Passive,
the Participle varies according to the difference of
Gender and Number, except when it comes before the
Infinitive of any Verb, where it remains still the
same; as,</p>

                              <p>A Verb Reciprocal, is commonly nothing else, but a Verb
Active, used with these Pronouns, <hi>me, te, se,</hi> in the
Singular Number, <hi>nous, vous, se,</hi> in the Plural; but so that
all its Compounds, Tenses, are Conjugated as the foregoing
Neutral, by the Verb <hi>Etre.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>'Tis true, that some Verbs are always Reciprocal, and those
are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> known by the Infinitive Mood, where the Pronoun <hi>se</hi>
goes ever before them; as, <hi>se repentir,</hi> to Repent, <hi>se moquer,</hi>
to Laugh at.</p>

                              <p>A Verb Impersonal is so called, not because it expresses to
Person at all; but first, because it is used often to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
Natural Actions, which have no relation to any Man's
Person; as, <hi>il pleut,</hi> it rains, <hi>il fait chaud,</hi> it is hot; And

only.</p>
                              <p>Of Verbs Impersonal some are absolutely such; as, <hi>il <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                              <p>There are two Particles in French, <hi>viz. Il</hi> and <hi>On,</hi> which
commonly go before the Verb Impersonal; <hi>Il</hi> is used some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with the Verbs that signifie a Natural Action; as,
<list>
                                    <item>
                                       <hi>Il pleut,</hi> it Rains. <hi>Il tonne,</hi> it thunders.</item>
                                 </list>
                              </p>
                              <p>And sometimes with those that have relation, either to the
Manners or Actions of Men; as,
<list>
                                    <item>
                                       <hi>Il faut,</hi> one must. <hi>Il me souvient,</hi> I remember. <hi>Il sied,</hi>
it becomes.</item>
                                 </list>
                              </p>
                              <p>But <hi>on</hi> is only used in this last Notion, and keeps the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the word it derives from, <hi>viz. Homme,</hi> Man;
and being joined with any Verb, renders it Impersonal,
through all its Tenses and Moods, except the Infinitive; as,
<list>
                                    <item>
                                       <hi>On dit,</hi> they say, <hi>or</hi> 'tis said. <hi>On fait,</hi> they do. <hi>On croit,</hi>
they believe, <hi>or</hi> 'tis believed.</item>

                              </p>
                              <p>The Letter (<hi>L</hi>) is often put before <hi>on,</hi> when the word that
goes before it, ends by a Vowel; as,
<list>
                                    <item>
                                       <hi>Si l'on veut,</hi> if they will. <hi>Ie veux que l'on m'ecoute,</hi> I will
be listen'd to.</item>
                                 </list>
                              </p>
                              <p>

                                 <pb n="59" facs="tcp:54097:39"/>
But when the word that comes next after the Particle <hi>on</hi>
begins by an <hi>l,</hi> then <hi>on</hi> must be without it; as,
<list>
                                    <item>
                                       <hi>Si on l'estime,</hi> if they have an esteem for him.</item>
                                 </list>
                              </p>
                              <p>* Some Verbs Impersonal, distinguish the Persons
both in the Singular and Plural Numbers, by the
means of Personal Pronouns; as,</p>

3. Now when there is an Interrogation with a Negation
together, <hi>ne</hi> goes before the Verb, and <hi>pas</hi> after the Verb
and the Pronoun; as,</p>
                              <p>

pas?</hi> doth she not speak? <hi>Ne pleut il pas?</hi> does it not rain.</p>
                              <p>But the Particle <hi>ne</hi> is sometimes left out, especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Verbs beginning with a Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<list>

                                       <hi>Le Roi veut il faire cela?</hi> will not the King do that?</item>
                                    <item>

                              </p>
                              <p>* Note that the Imperative Mood cannot be used with an
Interrogation, but in the Negative it may; as,</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>Ne parle pas,</hi> do not speak; <hi>Quelle ne dise rie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                                    </gap>,</hi> let her
say nothing.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. As for the two Particles <hi>en</hi> and <hi>y</hi> they come between
the Person, and the Verb, where the Verb is used without an
Interrogation; as,
<list>
                                    <item>
                                       <hi>I'en parle,</hi> I speak of it; <hi>Elles en parlent,</hi> they speak

                                    <item>
                                       <hi>Tu y vas,</hi> thou goest thither; <hi>Vous y irez,</hi> you shall go
thither.</item>
                                    <item>But in the Imperative Mood they run thus.</item>
                                    <item>
                                       <hi>Parles-en,</hi> do thou speak of it; <hi>Vas y,</hi> do thou go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</item>
                                    <item>
                                       <hi>Qu'il en parle,</hi> let him speak of it; <hi>Qu'elle-y-aille,</hi> let her

                                 </list>
                              </p>
                              <p>If the Negatives come in with these Particles, then they
must be placed as followeth;</p>

formed from Nouns Adjective of the Feminine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
by adding</hi> ment; <hi>as,</hi>

                           <p>† 1. If the Noun Adjectiue be of the common Gender,
the Adverb is formed by adding <hi>ment</hi> only; as, from <hi>Iuste, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi>
just, useful, comes <hi>Iustement, utilement,</hi> which have always
an (<hi>e</hi>) Feminine before <hi>ment,</hi> except these which have an
(<hi>é</hi>) Masculine.</p>

                           <p>† 2. If the Nown Adjective ends by an (<hi>é</hi>) Masculine,
by an (<hi>i</hi>) or by an (<hi>u</hi>), the Adverb is formed of the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine,
and not of the Feminine; as, from <hi>Assuré, joli<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

resolutely.</p>
                           <p>† 3. Nouns Adjectives ending in <hi>ant</hi> or <hi>ent,</hi> form their
Adverbs by changing <hi>nt</hi> in <hi>

prudently.</p>
                           <p>† 4. Finally Nouns Adjectives ending in <hi>ment;</hi> as <hi>Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

                        <p>A Preposition is a part of Speech which goes before the
other parts to explain their various Signification.</p>
                        <p>Prepositions are divided into <hi>Separable</hi> and <hi>Inseparable.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A separable Preposition is commonly separated from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
words, and signifies something by it self; as, <hi>Dans</hi> in,
<hi>Avec</hi> with.</p>
                        <p>An inseparable is never found but in Compound words,
and signifies nothing of it self; as, <hi>Ad-mettre,</hi> to admit,
<hi>E-taller,</hi> to shew, <hi>Im-poser,</hi> to impose.</p>
                        <p>* Most of these Compound words deriving from the
Latin, to shew the true nature of inseparable Preposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
it would be requisite to consider each of them
singly, and to dive into the Latin for their Signification,
but that being quite out of our purpose, and besides
of no use, I shall give you the List of the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>

Or,
The Construction of words, called,
Syntax.</head>
                     <p>HAving explained in the foregoing Chapter, the nine Parts
of Speech, each by it self, I come now to the Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tax,
which is the Construction of them together, into Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
according to right use.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that a great deal of this has been already
treated of, in the Exposition of the parts of Speech: But
because something more may be said, of no small use,
I shall give you the following Rules.</p>

                        <head>1. Rule.</head>
                        <p>The Article, the Noun Adjective, the Pronoun, and the
Participle, agree with the Noun Substantive, both in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and Gender; as,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Le grand lit,</hi> The great bed; <hi>La grande table,</hi> The great
table; <hi>Les beaux hommes, les belles femmes,</hi> The handsome
men; the handsome women; <hi>L'homme blessé,</hi> The wounded
man; <hi>Vne femme aimée,</hi> a woman loved; <hi>Vn Prince char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant,</hi>
a Charming Prince; <hi>Vne Princesse charmante,</hi> a
charming Princess; <hi>Mon Prince &amp; ma Princesse,</hi> My Prince
and my Princess.</p>
                        <p>

                           <pb n="119" facs="tcp:54097:69"/>*But Note, that in the use of these Pronouns Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessive,
<hi>mon, ton, son,</hi> the French mind less the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Rule, than the sweetness of the Language;
And so they say, <hi>Mon ame,</hi> my Soul, <hi>Ton Epée,</hi>
thy Sword, <hi>Son amie,</hi> his or her friend, altho' <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
epée, amie,</hi> be of the Feminine Gender, and
<hi>mon, ton, son,</hi> of the Masculine.</p>

                        <head>2. Rule.</head>
                        <p>Two or more Nouns Substantive in the Singular Number
being joyned together by a Conjunction, are as good as a
Plural Number; and therefore if a Verb and an Adjective
come after them, both these must be put in the Plural
Number; as,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Le Pere &amp; le fils sont malheureux,</hi> The Father and the
Son are unfortunate; <hi>La mere &amp; la fille sont également

                        <head>3. Rule.</head>
                        <p>If one of the Substantives be of the Masculine Gender,
and the other of the Feminine, the Adjective Plural that
goes along with the Verb, will be also of the Masculine;
as,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Les hommes &amp; les femmes sont mortels,</hi> Both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

                        <head>4. Rule.</head>
                        <p>But if there comes no Verb after two Substantives of
a different Gender, then the Adjective agrees with the
last, both in Number and Gender; as,
<list>
                              <item>I' ai le coeur &amp; la main ouverte pour vous recevoir.</item>
                              <item>My heart and hand are open to receive you.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>* Note that these two words <hi>Quelque chose,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
tho' of the Feminine Gender, will have the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
that comes after, relating to them, in the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine
Gender; as,</p>

Remarks upon the Construction of the Parts of

learn much sooner how to Construe Words into Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
by the frequent reading of good Authors, and
by an assiduous Practice, than by a cluster of Rules,
which most commonly do but over-burden ones memory,
without instructing the Understanding.</p>

                        <p>The Distinctions proper to Vowels, are three, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>

                        </list>
                        <p n="1">1. The Accent (which is as the Soul of Words) is an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
or rising of the Voice in one of the Syllables of a
word.</p>
                        <p>The Accent is threefold, <hi>viz. Acute</hi> thus marked (á), <hi>Grave</hi>
thus marked (à), <hi>Circumflex</hi> thus marked (â).</p>
                        <p>The Acute shews the elevation of Syllables; the Grave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
their falling or depression, and the Circumflex, both the
rising and falling of the Syllable, which therefore ought to
be a long one; as,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Autél,</hi> Altar. <hi>Vertù,</hi> Virtue. <hi>Impôt,</hi> Tax.</p>
                        <p>* The Greek have been strict observers of Accents,
in which they were in a great measure imitated by the
Latin; but in all Modern Languages, the right use of
them is little or not all understood.</p>
                        <p>

                           <pb n="124" facs="tcp:54097:72"/>
The Acute in French, is peculiar to the Vowel, <hi>e.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. When the <hi>e</hi> is Masculine; as, <hi>Pieté,</hi> Piety. <hi>Epée,</hi>
Sword.</item>
                           <item>2. When an <hi>s</hi> is left out because unpronounced; as,
<hi>étre,</hi> to be, <hi>émouvoir,</hi> to move, formerly spelt <hi>estre, esmouvoir.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Grave is peculiar to the Preposition <hi>à,</hi> to, and to the
Adverbs <hi>là,</hi> there, and <hi>où,</hi> where; only for distinction sake,
<hi>à</hi> from <hi>à</hi> hath, in the Verb <hi>avoir; là,</hi> from <hi>la</hi> the, a Feminine
Article and Pronoun; and <hi>où</hi> from the Conjunction <hi>ou,</hi> or.</p>
                        <p>The Circumflex is put upon any of the five Vowels, <hi>a, e, i,
o, u,</hi> when any Vowel or Consonant is left out in the same
Syllable, which the French do often in their new way of spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
as,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>âge,</hi> age. <hi>Aûne,</hi> yard. <hi>Bâton,</hi> stick. <hi>Pân,</hi> Peacock.
Formerly spelt <hi>aage, aulne, baston, paon;</hi> and likewise,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quêque</hi> for <hi>quelque,</hi> some; <hi>Niêce</hi> for <hi>Niepce,</hi> Neece; <hi>Prêtre</hi>
for <hi>Prestre,</hi> Priest; <hi>Conoître</hi> for <hi>Conoistre,</hi> to
know; <hi>Nôtre</hi> for
<hi>Nostre,</hi> our; <hi>Coûteau</hi> for <hi>Cousteau,</hi> knife; <hi>bû</hi> for <hi>beu,</hi> drunk; <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>û</hi>
for <hi>Col,</hi> neck; <hi>foû</hi> for <hi>fol,</hi> fool; <hi>genoû</hi> for <hi>genouil,</hi> knee; <hi>fenoû</hi>
for <hi>fenouil,</hi> fennel.</p>
                        <p>II. By the division, I mean those two little points which are
sometimes met with on the top of the Vowels, <hi>e,</hi> and <hi>i,</hi> to
shew that the Vowel so marked, belongs not to the same
Syllable, as the Vowel that is before it; as,
<list>
                              <item>Jouër, jouïr, <hi>to play, to enjoy.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
which words consist of these two Syllables, jou-er, jou-ir.</p>
                        <p>III. An Apostroph (') is an inverted <hi>c,</hi> shewing that there
is a Vowel wanting, and two words made into one, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
when of two words, the first ends in one of these
Vowels, <hi>a, e, i,</hi> and the next begins with any Vowel; as,

                        <p>Vous pouvez remarquer qu'il
fait quelques fautes, &amp; qu'il

Cela n'est pas impossible;

                        <p>How old is the eldest?</p>
                        <p>He is but eight years and a
half old.</p>
                        <p>He is very tall for that
age.</p>
                        <p>He is very handsom.</p>
                        <p>And He has the Gate, the
Air, and the Manners of a
Man of twenty.</p>
                        <p>Does he speak good <hi>French.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He comes off pretty well of

I assure you, I wonder at it,
He has a good accent, he speaks
very well.</p>
                        <p>You may take notice that he
makes some faults, and does not
know some words.</p>
                        <p>That comes partly because
he speaks with no body but me,
and so he cannot learn the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Expressions which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises
by speaking to several
people.</p>
                        <p>And besides, most part of the
words he does not know in
French, are those whose signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
he does not know in
English.</p>
                        <p>But as soon as he shall begin
to get into Companies, he will
soon get the facility of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
himself.</p>
                        <p>For I may say, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands
Historys, Plays, and
Romances pretty well.</p>
                        <p>Have you begun to teach
him Latin.</p>
                        <p>Yes, Sir, he has some smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of it.</p>
                        <p>And he understands besides
a little Geography.</p>
                        <p>He is very forward.</p>
                        <p>He has made great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress.</p>
                        <p>He cannot but become a
good Scholar under so good a
Master.</p>
                        <p>I assure you, without any
flattery to him, that his good
nature, his wit and docility do
contribute to it more than I.</p>

                        <p>Yes, Sir, and he reads it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently.
But he is full of
roguery.</p>

I'll do what you please, but
methinks 'tis best to go in
the Pit,</p>
                        <p>Why?</p>
                        <p>Because we may pass the
time away in talking with
some body, before the Curtain
is drawn:</p>
                        <p>What do you say of that
Symphony.</p>
                        <p>Methinks 'tis very good.</p>
                        <p>Don't you take notice of
that Hoboy that sounds so fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
among the violins and harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secol.</p>
                        <p>The Boxes are full already.</p>
                        <p>And as you see we are very
crowded in the Pit.</p>
                        <p>I never saw the house so
full.</p>
                        <p>There are a great many fine
People.</p>
                        <p>I love as much as the Play
the sight of those fine Ladies,
who grace the Boxes.</p>
                        <p>They are very finely drest,
(or in a fine Garb)</p>
                        <p>They join the Beauty and
Charms of the Body to the
Richness of the Attire; and to
the brightness of their Iewels.</p>
                        <p>Do you take notice of that
Lady, who sits next to the
Princess.</p>
                        <p>Yes, I see her, she's pretty,
she's handsom.</p>
                        <p>How pretty? You should say
that she's a perfect beauty.</p>
                        <p>Do you know her?</p>

                           <pb n="208" facs="tcp:54097:114"/>
Yes, I know her.</p>
                        <p>She has a fine easie shape.</p>
                        <p>Have you took notice of her
Complexion.</p>
                        <p>'Tis the finest Complexion
in the World.</p>
                        <p>The whiteness of her bosom
(or neck) and the Vermilion
of her face, wrong the Lilies
and the Roses.</p>
                        <p>She has teeth as white as
snow.</p>
                        <p>I think that she has a great
deal of wit.</p>
                        <p>Beauty may be seen, but not
wit.</p>
                        <p>Had she as much wit as
Beauty, one might say, that
she is an abridgment of all
perfections.</p>
                        <p>But the Curtain is draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

to the Sentiments I embrace.
But because my knowledge is

you will infinitely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige
me, to apply to my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper

I make no doubt of your Cure,

since I find in you all that
can most contribute to it. The
Being of a God, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality

you to a necessity of a Religion;
the Example of your Parents,
and your good Education, have
prepared you for it; and you
are free from the bad Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which are the greatest
hindrance to it, in persons of
your Age and Quality. And
indeed, My Lord, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for Errours to trouble ones
Heart, and to start up super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
Fears; so does true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
suppress our Agitations;

                              <p>The chiefest Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of true Religion, and
which distinguish it from the
false ones, are, the Five follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                              <p>I. True Religion ought to
oblige one to love God intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and above all Creatures.</p>
                              <p>II True Religion must
know our Nature; for the
true Nature of Man, his true
Happiness, true Virtue, and
true Religion, are things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable.</p>
                              <p>III. True Religion must
know, that Man is the most
excellent of all Creatures,
and at the same time the most
miserable.</p>
                              <p>IV. True Religion ought
to teach, that Man's Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
consists in being capable of
God, and Vertue; and that his



<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54097:141"/>
misery lies in his Concupiscence,
and in the Corruption of his
Nature; which makes him
both unworthy of God, and
unable to acquire Virtue.</p>
                              <p>V. Finally, true Religion
must shew the necessity of a
Mediator, between God and
Men.</p>

great kindness to make that
examination before me, that I

I shall save you the trouble of
telling me any thing about the
Heathenish Religion; for I am
sufficiently convinced, that it
is but a superstitious Worship
of Idolaters, or an human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention

rule Men. But for the Jewish,
since by the general consent of
all Christians it was the true
Religion, till theirs came up,

                              <p>The difficulty you
start, will only serve to put a
brighter gloss upon Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
For you must observe, that
this Religion which consists in
believing, that Man is fallen
from a State of Glory and
Communication with God,
into a State of baseness and
separation from God, but that
he would be restored by the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> was always upon
Earth. The promise of this
<hi>Messiah</hi> was first made to
<hi>Adam;</hi> it was repeated to
<hi>Noah,</hi> and then to <hi>Abraham,
Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi> God being
afterwards willing to make to
himself a People Holy, which
he would separate from
other Nations, and deliver
from its Enemies, chose the
Posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then
in Bondage in <hi>Egypt;</hi> from
which he freed them by the
Ministry of <hi>Moses.</hi> After that
he kept them under a severe
and ceremonial Law, not so
much to distinguish 'em from
other Nations, as to make them
sensible of their Miseries, and
of the necessity they had of a
<hi>Messiah,</hi> to free them from
the Yoke of Sin, and of the
Law. The Time and Manner
of this <hi>Messiah</hi>'s coming, was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times foretold, by those
Prophets<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God raised from time
to time among the <hi>Iews.</hi> The
Prophecies have at last been
fulfilled in the consummation

many Arguments you have

in my Opinion, it is impossible
not to acknowledg the Truth

blindness of the <hi>Iews,</hi> in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking

                              <p>I'll tell you the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of it: God having brought
them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with all
those great Miracles he made
for them; carried them into
the happy and frui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54097:142"/>
a magnificent Temple: All
this drowned the <hi>Iews</hi> into
Earthly and Carnal Thoughts.
They expected their <hi>Messias</hi>
would be a great Temporal
Prince, that should make them
Masters of all the World; so
that seeing in him nothing but
Mean, most of them scornfully
rejected him. There were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
some few Spiritual <hi>Iews,</hi>
who searching into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
saw that there were two
comings of the <hi>Messias</hi> foretold
by the Prophets, one of Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Humiliation, of which
the Time is mark'd out for fear
it should be mistaken, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Exaltation and Glory, the
Time of which is not mark'd,
because it will be so signal, so
notable, and so plain, that his
very Enemies will acknowledg
him.</p>

                              <p>'Tis enough to read
the History of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to
be convinced that he is a mere
Cheat. For what Character has
he, but any one may have,
that will take upon himself
to be a Prophet? He was
not foretold; he has no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
but his own; which he
never proved by any Miracle.

His <hi>Alchoran</hi> swarms with Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities;
nor was his Doctrine
ever establisht, but by force of
Arms, and by killing others;
when that of Jesus Christ was
establish'd by Humility, and
suffering its Professors to be

that if <hi>Mahomet</hi> has taken the

Jesus Christ has followed that

I would advise one to joyn that

the Language of the

have drawn their Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>

                              <p>As for <hi>Living
Languages,</hi> I would have one
first to be Master of his Mother-Tongue,
to know its different
Ways and Delicacies. It is not
enough for one to be born in
<hi>France</hi> to speak good <hi>French:</hi>
Nor had Sir <hi>Roger L'Estrange,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> and some others,
ever got so much Reputation by
their Pen, had they never learnt
<hi>English</hi> but at their Nurses.
Next to ones Mother-Tongue,
one ought to know that which
is most in Vogue in that Age
he lives in; for you must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that Fortune exercises
her Caprichio's in Languages,
as in other human Things. 'Tis
about Thirty Years ago, that



<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54097:145"/>
the <hi>French Tongue,</hi> by a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising
Revolution, is become
the general Language of all
Courts, and Gentlemen in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
and so you see how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it is for one to understand
it well.</p>

                              <p>As far as I see, the
<hi>French</hi> have a great advantage
over other Nations, since they
need not be troubled to learn
any other Language, but their
own.</p>

However most Courtiers and

their business to speak <hi>Italian</hi>

                              <p>With all my
Heart. The Word <hi>Philosophy</hi>
is Greek, and signifies, the
Love of Wisdom. This was
formerly the first of all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
or rather, it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
them all. Philosophers
among the Antients, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
the Worship of the Gods;
they prescribed the Laws of
Society; they studied Nature,
and were in so great esteem,
that in many places Statues
were erected to them. Since
the World has been enlightned
by the Gospel, Philosophy was
confined within narrower Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits;
and it is now little used,
but to direct the Mind in the
Inquiry of Truth, and the

in the enquiry of
Truth.</p>
                              <p>II. <hi>Metaphysick</hi> treats of

because of the great use it may
be in all the rencounters of Life;
but I could wish it were taught
in an easier, shorter, and
plainer Method than it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly.
As for <hi>Metaphysick,</hi>
it is too painful, if not above
the reach of our capacity. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Philosophy</hi> is too uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to be worth our applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and my Advice upon this
matter is, that one should read,
as an History, the Abridgment
of the Opinions of the most
eminent Men that have treated



<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54097:147"/>
of it, scuh as <hi>Plato, Aristotle,
Zeno, Epicurus, Descartes,
Gassendi:</hi> For then he will see
that they agree upon nothing,
and he will admire how any
thinking Man can spend his
Life to seek after unprofitable
Things. As for <hi>Morals,</hi> no
question but they are very
necessary, since they aim to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
us towards Happiness;
but those of Philosophers are no
true <hi>Morals,</hi> because they only
draw their Principles from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
when the Morals of
Christians ought to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not only upon Reason, but
also upon the Will of God,
revealed in his Scriptures.</p>

Actions and Enjoyments, its
Demonstrations seem very dear
to me. One must be a great
lover of Truth to purchase it
at that rate; and after all, I
think it is enough for a Man

the Inventions of others;

'tis in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the fault of those who

that they may be rendred so
easie, as not to breed any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust.
But suppose there were
some difficulty, it is always
counterballanc'd by the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and bountifully reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

fit than Philosophy to form

to render it piercing, capacious,

that they draw one from
pleasures, 'tis the strongest of

study of them to young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
were it but to fill up

prevent Vice to take possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                              <p>Yes, no doubt.

to be observed, both in the

                              <p>I suppose first,
that a Gentleman has a Tutor,
who from his tenderest years
makes him often read in the
Bible, and that he reflects so

                                 </gap>uch on it, as to take notice
of the most considerable
Changes of the People of God.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. I would have him at the
same time, and as it were by
way of Recreation, read the
Fabulous History; from which
he would draw a great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
towards the understanding
of Poets.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Next to Poetick History,
I would give him a smattering
of the History of <hi>Assyrians,
Persians, Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p n="4">4. When his mind would be so
strong as to be able to look on
several things at a view, then one
might let him read an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Universal History
from the beginning of the
World, until our times.</p>
                              <p n="5">5. After such a preparation
perform'd, under the Eyes of
an able and understanding Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
the Gentleman might of
himself study particular Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
especially that of the
Roman Empire, and of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country.</p>
                              <p n="6">6. Finally, it would be much
necessary for him to study, with
a special application, the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the Changes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in the States, and the
greatest Familes of <hi>Europe,</hi>
from the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi>
the Fifth's time unto ours; for

by those alterations it is, that

the Politicks and Interests of
the Princes of this present time.</p>

The first is indeed so

                              <p>I am extremly
glad, dear Nephew, to
see you have succeded so well
both in your Studies and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
since thereby you have
rendred your self capable of
the most important Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
However, because one
that enters the World, must
be very careful that the first
Impressions be to his Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
and that one seldom
comes from Colleges and Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies
without a certain air
of Pedantry and Coursness,
very unpleasant; I advise you
to make it your particular Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to study <hi>Politeness,</hi> (or
<hi>Genteelness),</hi> for that only will
qualifie you, to appear with
Honour in Companies, and to
ingratiate your self with the
Prince.</p>

                                 <hi>Politeness</hi> is a
mixture of Civility, Decency,
Discretion, and Complaisance,
accompanied with a gentle

                              <p>Of the several

there are but the two
first, upon which Maxims may
be given: The others are
seldom learnt but in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of the World, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the company of Ladies;
for whether Women be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
more Polite, or that to

discreet, complaisant, gentle

you send me to a School
so pleasant, as the Company of
Ladies, to learn the last parts
of <hi>Politeness:</hi> In the mean
while you will infinitely oblige

must observe in the Two

                              <p>You know there
are a great many Rules to
follow to be Civil: We
must, for Example, not only
shew our Respect and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to our Betters; but
we must too, if possible, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Civilities of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals,
and be Courteous to
our Inferiours. We must
give the Right-hand and the
Wall to Ladies, and Persons
of Distinction; and yield
them, in general, whatever
is most convenient. Your
Judgment prescribes you to
do it; and 'twould be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to add any other Maxim
but this, That every thing
must look Natural in a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman:
For it is not enough
to practise exactly the Rules
of Civility, except it be done
in a delicate, free, easie way,
that savours nothing either of
Art or Affectation; which
render most People, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Country 'Squires, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and unpleasant.</p>

                              <p>Decency consists
in fitting ones Words and
Actions according to one's
Sex, Age, Quality and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
in observing the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Times and Places;
and above all, in a Character
of Modesty in one's Face and
Manners. And indeed, if my



<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54097:155"/>
Lady—is so cry'd down at
Court, 'tis because she flies some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
into a Passion like a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
My Lord—is the Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-stock
of others, by his
Affectation of Talking Baw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
like a Town-Crack. And
Sir—makes himself ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
when among the
Ladies, he forgets his Age,
and sets up for a <hi>Beau,</hi> as a
Young Man at Twenty.</p>

                              <p>One thing that
seems very troublesom to me,
is, To know how one must
use what they call Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or Ceremonies.</p>
                           </sp>
                           <sp>
                              <speaker>Courtier.</speaker>
                              <p>My Opinion in
that Matter, is, That one
must not be either too nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardly
or too prodigal of
them: If one makes too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
he is look'd upon as Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly;
if too much, he
is Troublsom. So that the
general Rule which Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
gives us in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Occasions of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is, to use those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions
which Decency
prescribes; to observe the
Age and the Quality of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and the Condition they
are in. Men of War, or
Magistrates, do not love to
waste Time in useless Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies:
A Great Lord would
think a petty Tradesman who
would use Ceremonies, no less
insipid, than his Man should
be ridiculous to proffer him



<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54097:155"/>
his Service. And if one finds
the Persons he makes a Visit
to, either Sick or Busie, the
more Ceremonial he is, the
more Troublesom: He ought,
upon such Occasions, to be
short, and signifie his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
rather by some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectful
Action, than by ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
Complements.</p>

                              <p>He must make
it his Business to know the
Government of the Country
he travels in, its Policy, Laws,
Customs, Religion and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
its Pretensions; its
Forces both by Sea and Land:
to know the Names and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of the Ministers of every
Court; to enquire into the
Antiquities; and to know
exactly the Situation of Places,
and the Course of Rivers.
A Man that Travels in this
manner, will reap a great
Advantrge from it: He will

Judgment; and when he

                              <p>As for Conversation
it is, in my mind, the most
agreeable enjoyment of Life;
'tis the knot of Society; 'tis
by it that Minds communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
their Thoughts to one
another; that the Hearts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
their Affections, and that
Friendships are both begun
and entertained; Finally, if
Study increases the Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

that uses and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishes
them.</p>

                              <p>Comedies are, you

the ordinary life, according
to the variety of Humours:
and if the different Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters

you about <hi>Musick,</hi> I am very

my Ears are always tickled
with delight by good Voices
acd Instruments; but as for
Gaming, which you reckon
among your Recreations, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
'tis a very dangerous
one; Anger, Passion, and
Quarrels do commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it; it disturbs many a
Night's rest, and at the long
run, puts always one to hard
shifts; And besides, a Man
must always be upon his
his Guard to prevent being
Cheated, and 'tis a very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom

as if it were, upon an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's

very true, when a Man plays
deep, and sets up for a Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
For my part, I seldom
Play but for a small matter,
most commonly out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance,
and always in a
Company of Men of Honour,
who never Play but for diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
sake: And so you'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
see upon our Faces either
the greediness of winning, the
fear of losing, or the grief
of having lost. and as no body
Plays foul, so no body is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of being Cheated.</p>

<hi>Love</hi> simply, is the first

a secret Sentiment of
Complacency in him that
loves, which becomes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a Passion towards the
object loved. To <hi>Burn,</hi> is a
violent Condition, liable to
Disquiets, Troubles, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Despair. To <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,</hi>
is the finest of Love's
motions, it is the effect of a
pure and clear flame, which
consumes us insensibly, 'tis
a dear and tender Disease,
which makes us hate the very
thought of being cured: one
keeps it secretly in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom

comes to be discovered, the
Eyes, the Silence, a neglected
Sigh, an unwilling Tear, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it better than all the

one may say, That this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
a great Merit, with

to that, a Lover must endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to get in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of their Inclinations;
he must flatter all their
freaks and humours; Make
them jealous to see what
progress his love has made;
feign, or really be jealous
himself, to shew his love. If
nothing of that leads him to
their Heart, he must win
their Mind by Praises and
Courtship, and cunningly

make the best Advantage of
all that's lovely in them; for

arises in us a Sentiment of

Friendship, but the Cause

Sentiment we feel for the

wish him well; and after
that, the mutual Esteem and
resemblance of Humour tie
the Knot of true Friendship;

Pleasures and Troubles; by

approving of it, that I think
that nothing is so troublesom
as having too many, let them
be never so honest and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screet;
besides, one cannot rely
but weekly upon those who are
for a great many Friends. A
Heart that's divided, can't but
love by halves: And, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
I may apply here the

la vraye Nature de l' Homme,
son vray bien, la vraye Vertu,

&amp; en même tems la plus mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                              <p>IV. La vraye Religion doit
enseigner, que l' Excellence de
l' Homme, consiste à étre capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
de Dieu, &amp; de la Vertu;

                        <p>AN Old Noble-man fell in Love with a young
Gentle-woman that waited upon his Wife. The
little stock of Virtue which is commonly found in
Waiting-women<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being happily supported by the defects of
the old Dotard was strong enough to resist his Sollicitations;
She told her Lady of it, and confirmed by a shower of Tears,
those proofs of her Chastity. I can't by no means, Madam,
said she, bear it any longer: Who does he take me for?
and how can he have the Thoughts that I am capable to do
any thing against my Duty, either to your Ladiship, or to
my Honour? If he continues, I beseech you, Madam, to
give me leave to go away: The good Lady, as much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
against her Husband, as satisfied with her Maids ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
told her; Child, let it never come into your thoughts
to leave me, being so assured as you are of the kindness I
have for you. Then, Madam, be so kind as to deliver me
from my Master's Persecutions; Well, said the Lady, I
think of an Expedient very fit for that purpose; You must
dissemble a Kindness for him, and give him in the Night an
Assignation to your Room; I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Madam, cry'd the Waiting-woman,
give an Assignation? Listen to the end what I have
to say to you; After you have appointed him the hour, and
left the Door open to let him in, I will go in your stead
into your Bed, and you shall slip into my Room; and then
when he comes I'll shame him out of any thoughts
of tormenting you. The Waiting-woman executed with
Care her Lady's Orders. The Night being come, the Old
doting Fop crept into the Waiting-woman's Chamber, and
eagerly went to that Bed where his Wife staid for him. She
did not think fit to quarrel him at first; But seeing this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
was more chastly performed, than she had expected;
she was tir'd with it, and resolved to give her Tongue its
liberty: <hi>Is it but for all this,</hi> said she, <hi>that you have taken so
much pains?</hi> The Husband acknowledging his Error, by
his Wife's Voice; <hi>I Vow, Madam,</hi> said he, <hi>my Body has

nothing; begg'd of him her Absolution. I cannot give it
you, said the <hi>Fryar,</hi> for I am no Priest: You are no Priest?
said the Lady, both Surprised and in a Passion, No, Madam,
answered, coldly the Fryar, Well, quoth she, I'll go and make
complaints of you to your Superiour for hearing my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession:

Majesty calm enough, offered to kiss her hands, as she used
to do, but was received by the Queen with two great boxes
on the Ears, The Confusion of that haughty Woman, upon
so sensible an Affront can hardly be exprest, she went out in a
Passion, and gathering all her kindred and Relations, she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
her self to the King, with a Train of Four Hundred
Ladies, and was so importunate with him for the reparation
of her Honour, that he was fain to come and ask the Queen
her Reasons; Sir, replied readily, that ingenious Princess,
<hi>It was but to save a Woman's longing;</hi> do you then think
two enough? Madam, answered the King, else, pray, let
her have two Dozen, And as one misfortune comes upon

                        <p>I Thought indeed you had a little kindess for me, but I
never durst flatter my self you had so much, as to write
me so obliging a Letter, as that I received this Morning;
and I confess that I am so puzzled to find out Expressions
to Counterbalance your Civilities, that I could wish almost
that I had not received your Letter, to be rid of the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Answering it. This is the reason still, that has kept
me silent all this while, but I must be so no longer, for fear
you should ascribe it to a wilful negligence. I therefore
venture this Letter, not as an Answer, but only, <hi>Sir,</hi> to
give you a Testimony of my thankfulness, and to beg of
you the Continuation of your Friendship. As for what you
say in yours, I wish it were true; and that I had something
worthy to be communicated unto you; if I had, you may
be sure I would send it you with all speed, were it but to
know your opinion of it, which I would prefer to many
others, and even to my own, I have not forgotten the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem,
I promised you before you went away, but I have not
been able to go about it, for want of a Sector: If I don't
receive very speedily that which I expect from <hi>Holland</hi>
I'll endeavour to get one from another place, to satisfie your
desire, mean while, I am without Affectation:</p>

                        <p>THE bad Weather which robs me of the pleasure of
your Company, would be extreamly grievous to
me, were I not happily recompenced of that Loss, by
the charming Letter you have honoured me withal, for
I do see you there, such as you are, that is, full of Wit
and Genteelness. I cannot but admire the free, easie
way of your Expressions, and the admirable knack you
have of settting out things, which savours much more
the Gentleman and the Courtier, than the Pedantick way
of ordinary Schollars; your Reflexions are extraordinary
exact; and one may see every where the Character of a fine
Writer. But give me leave to break off there, to speak
of Madam <hi>C</hi>—, you know as well as I, that she is
a Person, who besides her Birth, is Eminent above the
rest of our Young Ladies by a thousand Accomplishments,
how could I then, after I had the Honour to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with so lovely a Person, have neglected the Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to see her, and enjoy the Advantages of her sweet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany?
Therefore, he you judge whether I am guilty of
the Crime that is laid to my Charge: Be pleased to make
her my Complements, and tell her, I hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

love seldom to receive any; But no matter, I am
too much concerned for your Beauty to forbear telling you
how much you shall wrong it, if you chance to set off
your self on the Princesses Birth-day. Leave Ornaments
to others; Finery is a borrowed Beauty which is to them
instead of a natural, and we are obliged to them for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Eyes something that's more agreeable than their
Persons. We should not have the same Obligation, to
your Ladiship, every Ornament you put on, hides a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
every Ornament you take away, renders you a Grace,
and you are never so well as when we see in you nothing
but your self. Most Ladies are advantageously lost under
their Attire; some look very well with their Pearls, that
would look very ill with their Neck: The finest Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
in the World would yield an ill Effect upon yours,
it would occasion some Alteration in your Person, and
no Alteration can be an advantage to what is Perfect.
Let, Madam, let others lavish their Money upon Jewels and
Cloaths; Nature has lay'd out for you all that you lackd.
You would be ungrateful and we unskilful, were we not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contented with the Liberalities she has bestowed on you.

But I am in a Condition that Excuses me from keeping any
Measures: The just Horror I have of a Marriage, which

I thought I had better chuse you than despair: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

Decency obliges our Sex. It will be long of you if I am

But above all, remember that the time is short, and that a

delicate and regular; The Complexion so clear, so
fair and so lively, that all your trivial Similes of Lillies
and Roses come very short of expressing it; Large sparkling
Black Eyes, thick and well parted Eye-brows; Teeth
white and even; Fresh incarnate Lips; An Alablaster Neck,
the Hands and Arms so smooth and so well framed, that
one would take them to be artificially turn'd. In fine, she
is such an accomplisht Beauty as would serve to finish that
Picture of <hi>Venus,</hi> which <hi>Apelles</hi> left unperfect; to which
you may add, what is past any Painters Skill to represent;
I mean, her noble, but gentle Carriage; her modest, but

Freedom and Decency.</p>

But Nature designing M. P—for her Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
has bestowed on her the Perfections both of Mind
and Body to the most eminent Degree: In Conversation she
knows when to speak and when to be silent, she says no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with Study or Affectation, and yet nothing at random;
Her Thoughts are lively, exact, and delivered with all the
delicacy of Expression; She is quick at Repartee, she rails
finely, but without Malice, and though she have a great
deal of Wit, no body had ever reason to wish her less;
She understands the Rules of Civility and good Breeding,
and practices them without being troublesom to her self or
others; she is a passionate lover of Freedom, but what
Honesty most Women receive from the fear of Shame,
she has by natural Innocence; and to finish by what ought
to be considered before all the rest, she discharges all the
Duties of Religion without either indifferency or Superstition.</p>

any spark of your past Affection, you'll find reasons enough
to reconcile the seeming Contradictions of my Letter, and
to justifie the unreasonableness of my Demands, You tell
me, you wait for my Answer, which is this, That except
you restore me my former Ease and Calmness of Mind, by
shewing me the same Friendship you did before, I am fully
resolved to go for <hi>Flanders,</hi> where, I hope, I shall put a
period to that Life, which your Infidelity has rendered so
unfortunate.</p>

                        <p>I Cannot express how sorry I am to hear of the Aversion
you shew to Matrimony; I never discommended a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Reluctancy in our Sex, because it is commonly reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Men's eagerness, but I fear you are a little mistaken
in the use of it, and that your Coyness will prove at last to
quench Master <hi>C.</hi> Love, when it should only be manag'd
as a Trial of his Affection. I therefore thought fit to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
unto you, those Reasons which my Reading and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
make me think most powerful to Conquer your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
Shyness.</p>
                        <p>

                           <pb n="98" facs="tcp:54097:187"/>
And first, <hi>Madam,</hi> be pleased to consider, what a Holy
and Commendable State Marriage is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both by the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it by God himself in the Earthly Paradise, and
by the end it aims at, <hi>viz.</hi> the Propagation of reasonable
Creatures. To which you may add, that it was at a Wedding
that our Saviour Signalized first his Miraculous Power; and
that Matrimony according to the Apostle is the Figure of
Christ's Union with his Church.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Marriage is the most Honourable of all Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
since by it we bestow continual Presents both on
Church and State. In so much esteem was it among the
<hi>Iews,</hi> and so eminent above Virginity, that barrenness was
accounted a kind of Disgrace and Reproach. And among
the <hi>Romans,</hi> those that had been often Married, deserved
the Honour of Coronation, and appeared in their publick
Festivals, with Laurels and other Marks of Victory, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
no less than the Emperours to the Grandeur of
their Empire. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> of another side, Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>A Yearly Solemnity,</hi> where unmarried People, above five
and Twenty, were publickly Scourged by Wise, Grave and
Lusty Matrons. To all which, 'twill not be amiss to add,
the Precedent of one of the <hi>French</hi> King's Proclamations,
(and this is the only thing I could ever find Commendable in
him) Whereby the Parents of Ten Children are not only
freed from all manner of Taxes, but also Recompensed for
their Labour with a considerable Pension.</p>
                        <p>But besides, Matrimony is no less an happy and blissful
State, than it is Holy and Honourable. For since it made
the greater Felicity of our first Parents in the State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
no question, but it is now the greatest Supporter
of our Human Miseries, and the Sweetest Refreshment of
the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

by its Circle, that as Rotundity is Infinite, the same is the
Contentment of Married Couples? Thence it is, that among

                        </opener>
                        <p>I Have been so taken up by the Company we have had at
P—P—that I have often try'd in vain to discharge
the promise I made you before I went away, to send you the
particulars of our Journey; and now when I thought to
make amends by a long Letter, the Affliction which fills
this house, so overcasts my mind, as to render it very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to give you a pleasant entertainment.</p>
                        <p>But, let's make an attempt; and let Affliction tho' never
so just disappear for a moment; For when all is done, it is
not reasonable for me to give that heart over to grief, to
which you have so great a claim.</p>
                        <p>On Monday or Tuesday (or any other day of the Week,
you please, for <hi>I</hi> forgot which) we set forth from <hi>Ritskens</hi>
at break of day; betwixt Eleven and Twelve at Noon, we
came to <hi>Ailsbury,</hi> where Mr. <hi>C</hi>—and Mr <hi>Sp.</hi>—had
waited for us about an hour, they shewed at first a great
deal of joy at our arrival, but their gladness was soon turned
into sorrow, when they heard you was not in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
especially Mr. <hi>Sp</hi>—both by his Looks and Speech
seem'd to be much griev'd for your absence.</p>
                        <p>Two hours after, the rest of the Ladies being come with
Sir <hi>B</hi>—, We sit at Table, we Dine: About Three of
the Clock, we get in the Coach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and about nine we arrive
safely at <hi>P—P</hi>—</p>
                        <p>During the four or five first days of our being there, the
illness of my Lady <hi>B—t</hi> occasioned such a grief amongst



<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54097:190"/>
us all, that we had little or no other Diversion, than that of
going to see the magnificent House and fine Gardens of Sir
<hi>W—F</hi>—and even that was troubled by a small
accident that befell our Coach.</p>
                        <p>My Lady <hi>B—t</hi> being well again, every body seem'd
to recover with her; our enjoyments were brisker than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
Mr. <hi>Sp</hi>—Sung; Mr. <hi>C</hi>—Drunk and smoak'd;
Mr. <hi>L</hi>—entertained Mrs. <hi>W</hi>—with amorous Nonsence:
As for Mrs. <hi>D</hi>—and I being in some conformity of Destiny,
we stole often from the Company, and went upon the
Terrass-walk, to enjoy the delight of talking of you and
Mr. <hi>C.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The briefness which ought to be observed in a Letter, will
not let me give a Discription of a famous Rejoicing we had
at Mid-Summer-Day; of our private Dancings at home, of
a Visit we made to Mr. <hi>C</hi>—and of my going with Mr.
H—to my Lord <hi>S—s</hi> Country-House, and to <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>At our return from this last place we heard the News of
Miss <hi>B</hi>—being ill; fatal News which cut off all our
joys; prevented a Hunting-Match we had made for the next
day; and precipitated our going away.</p>
                        <p>There you have a Summary account of our Journey into
<hi>Northampton-shire;</hi> I hope to give you the particulars of
it, at our first interview after which I continually sigh.</p>
                        <p>Tho' you have been at <hi>Ritskens,</hi> I cannot forbear telling
you, that it is one of the finest Seats in <hi>England,</hi> and where
Nature seems to have framed a thousand charming Solitudes
on purpose either to complain of the cruelties, or to receive
the favours of a Mistris. I am sincerely.</p>
