            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE INHABITANTS OF THEOSEBIA.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <p>HAVING lately met with Several affectionate as well as Elegant Invitations to unity; having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the incline of the <hi>Theosebians</hi> to look more that way now then ever; and being sensible that nothing but the want of this can hinder it from being the invincible as well as happy Island: Therefore it is, that I not only conclude this to be the proper time, to reduce our <hi>Ierusalem</hi> into that pleasing state of being as a City at unity within it self; but, led with a desire to propagate the publick welfare as earnestly, as every honest Man would be assistant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Extinction of a dangerous Fire, do now throw in my <hi>Simbolum;</hi> which though not so Considerable, yet being well meant, may be acceptable I hope to those who mean well.</p>
               <p>That little then which I have to propose I humbly desire may be directed.</p>
               <p>1. To the Pastors themselves.</p>
               <p>But here I must take some pains to reconcile my Readers pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. How (you'l say) can it consist with Peace of the Church, to make reflections upon the Church-men. To which I can with safety answer, that what I am about to speak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds neither from Envy nor Derision, and therefore will no ways I presume darken their Lustre I should be glad to enhance,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97416:5"/>
because the end of my animadversions is, to remove that which may make their Lights more Cleer, Nor shall I commit any thing to paper, but that which any Friend of theirs I doubt not will allow of.</p>
               <div type="observations">
                  <head>
                     <hi>I.</hi> Observation.</head>
                  <p>To allow them then all the respect that is due unto their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred function, to suppose them Illustrious in parts as well as Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, you will allow with me I hope that they are but Men, and as Men, their very constitution exposes them to frailties, nay real errors, since <hi>Nemo sine crimine vivit,</hi> is St. <hi>Iohn's</hi> Doctrine as well as <hi>Cato</hi>'s, and an offence may come by <hi>Ionas</hi> as soon as any of the Passengers.</p>
                  <p>2. And as offences may undoubtedly come among these, so there is great difference among these offences. Those which I am to take notice of, do not arise so much from the defects of the Head as the Heart; but in their nature, are perhaps much worse then the faults of the other place, because whosoever has industriously sought Knowledge, and is found amiss in his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, goes with great Labour up-Hill, and with shame Tumbles down again.</p>
                  <p>3. Nor need we any other Satisfaction of the Mischiefs that attend Learning without Constancy, then the Divisions of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebia</hi> and her Church. For notwithstanding the Government thereof is Episcopacy, and obedience to this is sworn unto, by all that have Preferment or Imployment in that Church; yet even this Church is as a House divided against it self. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which I cannot otherways Comprehend, then by casting my Eyes upon those who being Educated in the Principles of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> or a <hi>Buchanan,</hi> have littel more in them it is to be feared of the Church of <hi>Theosebias</hi> Essentials, then their Livings, Gowns and Cassocks.</p>
                  <p>How comes it to pass else, that those who have taken these orders, those oaths decry the same Episcopacy; as if they were thrust in on purpose to ruinate the Government, from whence comes else the first part of the Naked Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whence the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97416:5"/>
Black-nonconformist, from whence <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Reconcilers, but from men in Orders, and of such Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. And what was the design of them, but to be as standing Batteries against the Church.</p>
                  <p>The first of these endeavours to Ridicule, the next to Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate her Constitution. The Last<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeed describes her one while as the Mother of Cruelty, and presently as an Angel, or Daughter of Peace.</p>
                  <p>4. Here then it is that I again presume you will with me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it is Expedient, that these Men should be what they pretend to be, renouncers of their former Opinions, and lovers of that Church they are now Members of, because their Levity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becomes the occasion of great Scandal.</p>
                  <p>For I pray consider. When the weaker brethren look upon the great ones with an humble, modest, prudent intent to make them their Examples, when they experience here great Learning but no fidelity to God or the Church, when they shall mock both, to advance their interest, what must these think or do. How must they think, that such like <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> love the Patrimony and not the Church, as he did the Emperor, and not <hi>Augustus.</hi> How must this be the inlet to worser Consequences, even those of Scepticism, Atheism, and Rebellion. For when those whose understandings are so great, and ought with modesty to be submitted unto, shall in their Practise thus Equivocate, this makes one to boubt all is but a juggle when they deny a God as it were, by slighting their oaths in his presence, this emboldens another to think there is none at all.</p>
                  <p>When the guides of the Church are not firm in their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, others are more easily Loose. Nay I pray consider once more, when they themselves have no fixt Love for their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how apt do they stand to be invited to part with it, and more then that, having no true Principle of Morality as well as Religion; how fit they are to become themselves instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal towards that Chance. And should you consult the confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church at any time, from <hi>Arrius,</hi> to <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> from him to <hi>Ferguson,</hi> there have been such as those who assisted the alteration. Thus then it is but reasonable I hope to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97416:6"/>
our wishes, that there may be no more Examples like that of the Protestant Reconciler, who inso short a time, can make the same thing to be as a trifle, and of the greatest moment. Who so solemnly calls God to be a Witness; that what he has discoursed in the following Papers, was his fixed judgment; which he has taken up upon Irresistable Convictions, that through which he thinks he might do good service to his God, to the Religion of his Saviour, and to the Church as well as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, if he could but prevail with others to embrace the same Opinion, and yet in Page the 5. of the second part blast all this with the same breath, and leaves the Reader to Conjecture very Probably from this inconstancy, that neither his God, nor his Religion are really such things in his Eye, as he would have others think them to be; since the same Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, the same scrupled Liturgy, he before declares ought not to be imposed by Superiours, are now such he confesses as ought to be submitted unto by Laymen, and that they are liable to the Censures of the Church who refuse this.</p>
                  <p>And this ought to be done the rather, because the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church, are such, and nothing else, but what have been required by the Church of Christ in all Ages. Nor may it be Impertinent to wish again, that there may be in the Church of <hi>Theosebia,</hi> no more besides these instances, whose former Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, whose downright Antipathy to the Church, whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent dissatisfaction in the Government, they doubt of, not to say deny Episcopacy to be <hi>jure divino;</hi> whose tang in the Nose and Throat, whose Predestinarian Doctrine, whose curtailing the Common-prayer, and other things, may truly hint, that they have much of the Old Man in them, and little of the New. May Omens act by contraryes. The unlucky birds be tokens of good luck. And all these things I have mentioned have no sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications in them but of their reality. And notwithstanding these, may they all think the same thing, cry up the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, in the Pulpit and out of it, and methinks, when they are thus all of one mind, it must be a likely way that there should be no divisions among us. Now then, were they thus agreeing in their minds, we might conclude they would the sooner agree in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97416:6"/>And this also I presume you will allow (my Reader) is a thing necessary among them. For certainly if it be pleasant to see any brethren, it is to see these live together at unity. Those therefore who are become our Brethren, may they as Children of the same Parent Love their Mother the Church, and part with that little interest of theirs which may advance hers. But by no means ought they to encourage her Enemies for their own advantage, lest interest alone be thought their Deity.</p>
                  <p>However, should they be unwilling to part with their <hi>Diana</hi> to do the Church service, methinks they might let go that cheaper part, and Love those of the same Order, the same Faith they now publickly profess in a better, at least, equal degree, then the avowed adversaries to all this. It may perhaps pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend something ill, when the Strictness of our opinion shall not only be resented ill by them, but the discourse, the designs of the fanatique party prefered to ours, and by Subteraneous ways, mannaged against us, and us against our selves. When nothing we can do, can heartily oblige them to us, what can this be, but the effect of the old cause, <hi>Invisum mihi Genus est.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Policy may teach them to speak superficially, they are but inwardly those Wolves whose natural repast it is to prey upon the Lambs.</p>
                  <p>This mixture of Love and hatred, (might we be worthy to advise) ought rather to be turned into that entire Liquor of Life, cordial affection. For such inward grudges, are but the source of those waters of strife, which run into the veins of other men from their example, and threaten, what once they swell'd into, a pernicious deluge.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, unless they do resolve that their actions may speak their love for the Church as well as their tongues, unless they forbear to be one thing in the Face and another in the Heart, prudence will suspend our Charity, and we shall not be afraid to say, that tho they are come into the Church and call her Mother; they are but those Vipers who creep there to eat her Bowells out.</p>
                  <p>Not that we refuse any converts, nor require at their prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, long may they enjoy them, but that they would really

be, what they pretend to be, further the interest of the Church they are Members of; pursue those Principles they have sworn to approve of, and not like him in <hi>Iustin,</hi> come over to us with a design to deliver us into the hand of the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>And until those waters are healed, and there be this unity in your own Family, neither the present advocates for Union, nor any other, can hope to have influence upon those I next desire to speak unto, <hi>viz.</hi> The Laity to reclaim them if possible from that inveteracy they so closely harbour against those of the Episcopal opinion.</p>

                  <p>HAving thus ended our Memorandum to those who want no knowledge may we accost them, who want that as well as consideration. The rancour of their disposition toward us, we shall according to promise make apparent, if we may have leave to recount how partial they are in their Judgements between our actions and their own; what delight and pains they take to deprive us, not only of our Reputations but our Hapiness. For altho they are men of the like passions, and perhaps more faults then any body. Yet when they take a veiw of their own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories: so strangely do they dote upon themselves or volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily Shut their eyes in the Inquisition, that no blemish can be found, they are at Spotless as the Snow, and the devout man is placed in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Porch, of greatly wondering at his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency. But turn the prospect upon us, and then he startles, beholds nothing but Leopards, and in his horror cryes out to Satan and the wicked to depart from him, nay rather then their sight shall be called in question, though nothing but what might be pardonable among better Christians then himself can be laid to our charge, He or they, will invent something that shall, and then with a Multiplying faculty they have, they will make it of one, seem to be innumerable crimes.

               <head>Of the <hi>Fanatique's</hi> Behaviour towards King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, both as to their Words and Actions.</head>
               <p>WHoever has conversed with the <hi>Chronicle</hi> of <hi>Theosebia,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Ignorant that King <hi>Charles</hi> the first (of blessed Memory) had, with his Crown, many troubles entail'd unto him, not only upon the account of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that War he engaged himself in for the Preservation of the French Prostestants. How zealously he desired to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Faith, even among our Neighbours abroad, as well as those at home, if any are unacquainted with it, let them repair to his affectionate, pithy, and eloquent speech to his two houses upon this subject, and that will satisfy them. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, his imploying the subsidies, (he at any time prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for) to their proper use, (the service of that business) gives evidence thereof in his actions. But not withstanding his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were fixt upon so commendable an object; yet how hardly did he meet with supplyes to his desires; since the Eloquence, nay the prayers almost and intreaties, as well as sincerity and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of that pious Prince, left them too oft immoveable. And at length, so it was, that the Emegency of this, and some other affairs, threw that good King into new exigencies. And here was the time, they first began to play their Pranks with Him; preparing of him for his following scene of disasters by this one observation they gave him occasion to make, that his Enemies were they of his House. Nothing was more wanting to the King then Money, nothing less obtained by him, nor more pleasing, (to the factious party in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons) then that want. For, (as if they had been the only Trustees of the Nation, as if they had Money ordered them by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97416:8"/>
the people to turn Merchant Adventurers with, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it to the best advantage for them,) no Money could be had from them, without interest given unto them from the King, and such interest as made it look like a design in them, to ask that, which in time they presumed, would eat out the Principle of the Mortgage, and bring the Crown into the Bankers Hands. So strict were his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's necessities, they cunningly observed that Money must be had; and so exacting were they, that like Bread in time of a Famine, he must pay dear enough for it.</p>
               <p>First they requested Priviledges, afterwards they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached upon his Prerogatives; next, they could not be satisfied unless they had something of his Possessions; and by degrees, from whetting their Appetites, they arrived to insatiable humours, which not only with the Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leech, did cry, Give, give, but with <hi>Cerberus</hi> the Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper of the House of Devils, would devour those that fed them not. Now then, in plain <hi>English,</hi> nothing less then three Kingdoms would serve their turn. And should we take our Estimate of such People from the result of this Story, we must conclude them to be made up of deceit and cruelty, and that we are to avoid them with the same care we would refuse to go betwixt two Mill-stones actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally grinding, because, if they once lay hold of you, they will crush you to Death.</p>
               <p>For thus, to accomplish their ambition, they betake themselves to that course, they are famous in; not go foolishly to work, and openly attempt that which carries Scandal along with it, but pretend that which may be plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible with the Multitude, and under this disguise, carry on barbarity, and any Villany. They therefore strongly give it out, that the King was a Papist, a betrayer of their Liberties and Priviledges, and would deprive them of their Religion. And this they do (with Sighs and Tears, Pity, and Compassion, as they were men of tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences) declaring themselves, as obedient subjects to his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97416:9"/>
Majesty as the world could afford, or their duty, could require them to be. But in regard, that their All, their Religion that is and their God, next to these, their Rights of Liberties, and Priviledges, were more dear to them than their Prince; therefore it was, that with swords in their hands, they thought it requisite, and their bounden duty, to defend those, though they unwillingly fought against him, for the defence of them. So that this was no violent Opposition, no Rebellion against their Sovereign; but a Pious care of the Reformed Religion, and worship of God, a faithful pursuance of those Oaths they took to preserve the Rights of the people; and a Moderate way they had to bring the King to his right mind again; that he might serve God, and Govern his people as he ought to do, at least as they would have him; And in all this, as it was once said of <hi>Iob</hi> (in a truer sense) they vainly contended to have been thought such as did smite. And how did the Plot take. O, Admirably well? And even so as it was to be expected. For as Hay heated, and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Sun, soon takes fire, so the People who were naturally inclined to repinings, as well as discontents, and from these, to Insurrections, were easily moved to this, when they were summoned unto it, upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their Religion and Liberties being in danger. For, though Religion, (truly so, is the Least in their thoughts) and as little in their understandings, yet such a confused affection they have toward the name of it, that nothing shall sooner Command their assistance then to save the life of this, and though their greatest liberty they make use of, is to destroy the Liberty of their Prince, and despise Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, yet when it is stiled their Property, this also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently provokes them to come into its aid. The declaring the King then to be so much an Enemy to his People, was the likely way to make his People Enemies to him, and upon the first Alarum, they were immediately in Arms against him, and greedily hasten to the Camp of the Lord
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97416:9"/>
of <hi>Host</hi> to fight his Battel. And here they fight against their Sovereign, as much by Slander as force, since the first, encouraged men to joyn in the Last. To satisfy the Reader in this, pray once more break open his Cabinet, and let it be seen, what they publickly and falsly asperse him with, until from a wound in his Name, they bring him to his Sepulcher. Thus, as Mr. <hi>Symonds</hi> testifies in his vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, <hi>Page</hi> 35. They one while with strange Malice report him as one that did sit in the Seat of the Scornful, to remain (that is according to their own interpretation) for ever in the highest Throne and degree of wickedness, that man or Devil could reach unto: And as specimens of his wickedness, they in <hi>Page</hi> 177. are manifested to charge him, as one, who hated his Protestant Friends, purely for being Protestants, (though they loved him, nay in <hi>Page</hi> 179. They undauntedly say, that Idolatry was set up by his Authority, in contempt of God and true Religion. And in <hi>Page</hi> 193. (that they may make him compleat in all that is Ill) they say that the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland</hi> was managed by the Kings Influence. And nothing is more certain than at the last, they laid, (that unnatural War, which themselves occasioned amongst us) to his charge, who most shun'd it. Here then observe the Exquisite malice of their false accusations.</p>
               <p>For notwithstanding, He was a known <hi>Pater Patriae, &amp; Defensor sidei,</hi> a true nursing Father to the Church, and Indulgent Parent to his People: Though he parted with every thing he had, unto his life it self, to preserve the true Religion, to please his Friends and appease his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yet even him they would render as a <hi>Caligula</hi> or Monster of Men, who, rather (in respect of his Vertues and Candor, ought with <hi>Vespasian</hi> to have been styled and honoured as another <hi>Deliciae hominum,</hi> or delight of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And what use they made of these aspersions I need not tell you, since from these, there arose such an aversion to his Royal person, as could not be taken away, but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97416:10"/>
with his Life? But betwixt this and the Grave, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour towards him was with the most remarkable inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. And as a prelude to this, take notice if you please of the Agony his Majesty underwent through a sense of the effects of the killing Slander. If I had not my own Innocency and God's Protection, it were hard for me to stand out against those <hi>Stratagems</hi> and conflicts of Malice, which by falisies seek to oppress the Truth, and by jealousies to supply the defect of real causes, which might seem to justifie so unjust Engagements against me. And indeed, the worst effects of open hostility come short of these designs: For I can more willingly lose my Crown then my Credit; nor are my Kingdoms so dear to me, as my Reputation and my Honour. Those must have a Period with my Life, but these may survive to a glorious kind of Immortality, when I am Dead and Gone: a good name being the Embalming of Princes; and a sweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating of them to an Eternity of love and gratitude among posterity. But this was not all? Those foul and false aspersions were secret Engines at first employed against my Peoples love of me: that undermining their Opinion and value of me, my Enemies and theirs too, might at once blow up their Affections, and Batter down their Loyalty. However, he thanks God, that the detriment of his Honour was not so afflictive to him, as the Sin and Danger of his Peoples Souls: whose Eyes once blinded with such Mists of Suspitions, they are soon misled into the most desparate Precipices and Actions: wherein they do not only consider their Sin and Danger, but glory in Zealous adventures; while I am rendred to them so fit to be destroyed, that many are Ambitious to merit the name of my destroyers; Imagining they then fear God most, when they least Honour their King.</p>
               <p>And in this the King was his own Prophet, for what he foresee and fear'd did come upon him. For a Civil War did quickly break out upon these jealousies, so those were
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97416:10"/>
not so soon Laid. Though by Treaties he endeavoured so far as Honour or Conscience would give him leave, to put an end to these strifes, yet nothing could prevail, until the Sword deciding the business, he was driven of two Evils as he thought to chose the least, and fly from the Rebels in <hi>England,</hi> to the subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by whom he was sold as a slave, and by these made one. First, a Prisoner in <hi>Holmby,</hi> and then in the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> where the loss of his Chaplains, or rather denial of them, was more Irkesome to him then the loss of his Liberty or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. This was the highest piece of Barbarity, not used towards the meanest Malefactors, as the Law aims not at once to destroy their Bodys and their Souls.</p>
               <p>After this, what was the sense of their vote of Non-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, but that none should come from his Majesty to the Parliament, with overtures of Peace, nor have any opportunity to ask it of them. The sense of their own guilt and his Right as a King, resolved upon this course, as he was now doomed to be led like a Lamb to the Slaughter, whereas, were he once dispatched, his Letters nor his person would be any Eye-sore to their Consciences or Impediment to their designs, but the way must be open to their Ambition, when they had once satsifyed their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. And this construction of their thoughts in that action, His Majesty gives as well as I, laying of it down as a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im that there are but few steps between the Prisons and Graves of Princes. And since they prohibited any Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers to come unto them, from his Majesty, His Majesty had a prospect of some dreadful Messenger who would be sent to him from them, insomuch that <hi>Now,</hi> sayes he, <hi>I have cause more then enough, to meditate upon and prepare for Death.</hi> It was Gods indulgence he confest which gave him the space, but mans cruelty that gave him the sad Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of those thoughts. For alas, it was not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon burthen of mortality that was grievous unto him, but he had laid on him the heavy load of Mens Ambitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:97416:11"/>
Fears, Jealousies, and cruel Passions, whose envy or enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against me, makes their own lives seem deadly to them, while he enjoyed any part of his.</p>
               <p>But what need we doubt of that which is too certain. Behold him led from <hi>Carisbrook</hi> to <hi>Westminster-hall.</hi> And as they would not let him speak unto them by others, so now he must not speak for himself. A Traytor they tell him he is, though against whom they cannot tell.</p>
               <p>A Murtherer, and Publick Enemy, and therefore was Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to be put to Death, by Severing his Head from his Body.</p>
               <p>Guilty he is therefore in this, and many other things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he must be so. Dye he must, and did. Led once more into his Palace-Yard, to suffer the Tortures of their derision and cruelty, and dye the Death of a glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Christian. And now he left them to carry on that <hi>Babel</hi> they builded with the bones, and cemented with the blood of their King. Which (with thanks to God) had its confusion. And He, whose Right is was now sits upon the Throne.</p>

               <p>HAving thus Misused the Father, let us see how they will use the Son: But, being heir to the Crown, He must I doubt be heir also to their Cruelty.

That which was his Right, they endeavoured by all the stratagems of Fraud and Malice, might never be his real possession.</p>
               <p>And to this end was that Act from a Mock-Parliament set forth in <hi>March</hi> 17. 1648. <hi>That whereas</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>was justly condemned for many Treasons, Murthers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Issue and Posterity, and all others pretending title under him, are become uncapable of the said Crown.</hi> And not only did they discharge all people to pay any fealty or Allegiance to <hi>Charles</hi> the second, but (to add Cruelty to their Cruelties of Regicide, and usurpation) they likewise Enact, that if any persons should by any means, so much as comfort, or assist the King, as well as attempt to revive

And further, they not only banished him as and seised upon from his countrey, but became robbers an <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> his Inheritance. For in <hi>March</hi> 23. 1648. It was then ordered by the Commons, that Commissioners should be appointed to make Sale of the Kings, Queens, and Princes Personal Estate, upon inventory and appri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, and it was done accordingly. Thirty Thousand pound was to be taken out of it for the use of that Summers fleet. Then it was to be referred to 40 <hi>Hogon Mogons,</hi> or <hi>Council of State,</hi> what they thought fit to be sold, and the rest to be reserved for the use of them and their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. The Kings House, Parks, and Honour of <hi>Eltham,</hi> were given to Serjeant <hi>Bradshaw; Greenwich</hi> to <hi>Bostrode Whitlock; White-Hall</hi> afterwards was seised on for Monsieur <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s apartment, and other things, in other manner bestowed as they pleased.</p>
               <p>And having thus laid hold of the Inheritance, they wanted nothing but to kill the Heir. Which the sense of these words likewise intended, and the reason why they did not kill him, was, because they had no opportunity for it. And as if it was not sufficient to exercise their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty against him, they torment him in the Punishment of his Friends, Maliciously contriving against Thousands of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97416:12"/>
Innocent people for his sake. Insomuch that they imposed an Engagement as Effectual as a Massacre (as the History of Independency informs us) namely to be true to the Commonwealth as Established without a King and House of Peers, under the penalty of being totally deprived of the benefit of the Law. The effect of which was, to have their Lives, Liberties, and Estates Exposed, to put the Outlawry into the Souldiers Hands, and bid them plunder and destroy the Non-engagers.</p>
               <p>Whilst thus much then is contained in their words, what could have been said more than this, (to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of his Majesty) which would have taken away his Life and Fortune, Liberty and Reputation (if they could have done it) amongst his People, altogether. These were the undoubted Marks of their inveteracy against King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, presently after his Fathers Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and both their faults were; The First was, This ought then to have Reigned King of <hi>Theosebia.</hi> And in this high pitch of cruelty did they continue their rage against him.</p>
               <p>For when the <hi>Scots</hi> had yielded Allegiance to him, these denied it, and opposed him, to the destruction of many Thousand Lives, whatever befel the Souls of their own, who died as Rebels. They forced him to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities of Dangers and calamities. Exposed his Head to sale, and drove him to a Second Banishment, which he through difficulties attained.</p>
               <p>Many were the disturbances he fed upon in the time of his Banishment, being hurried from one Court to another, in the midst of contempts, fears, and conspiracies against him. And thus his Life was as it were a living Martyrdom. And when through the indulgent providence of God, He was at last remembred, they yet could not forget their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but soon entred into projects, which time has disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be the fruits of their disaffection.

sensible, and what we could, not otherwise so well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, this Kng himself has told us in his Declaration. From which you may be assured, that notwithstanding he laboured for Peace, they still were studious of Battel. The things which should have composed the differences of the Nation, which should have united it in a Solid tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and rendered his Majesty formidable to his Enemies as well as glorious in the eyes of his Friends, they most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. And so seriously did they design the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries to his Majesty, that, (lest he should be able to do himself or his People any good,) lest he should act like himself and get renown, or maintain his grandeur among his Subjects, they therefore vote it unfit for him to have any Money given him; nay that is not enough, it was fault said I, yes Treason against the Common-wealth to lend him any, tho he gave his Royal security for it. And to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their worser intentions, which since with thanks to the knower of secrets (have been discovered) what asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions were scattered up and down, to insinuate into the people a belief, that his Majesty was too much a Friend to the <hi>French,</hi> too much a Friend to some other Religion, that the Peers were their Enemies also, and none but those true Trouts, their Friends, in the House of Commons preserved their Rights.</p>
               <p>All which was but to endear them unto the People, and set the People against the King. For at length, where did these things center but in a design (which Heaven has detected) to kill the King.</p>

of their own Ambition and dreadful inventions. For, (to irritate the Popular against him) they drest him up in Hideous Characters. Declared him to be a Papist, and implacable in his disposition; And therefore that he would infallibly be their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or Man-killer, since he will thirst after blood, not like <hi>Cyrus</hi> in an Heroick, but Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious appetite, which would make our destruction, like the burning of <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Nero,</hi> seem Musical unto him. Now to prevent all this Mischief, it is thought very good Religion, to cut off the Successors Entail, and rather then fail, his Head. And this they were mightily encouraged unto, by one of their Chaplains who was Author of that Famous piece of Roguery, <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostate.</hi> In which book it is uncertain, whither he shews himself more Fool or Knave. For in the description of <hi>Iulian,</hi> he was, (this Author says) Impious, Cruel, and an Apostate. And because he was so, he concludes that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> is, and necessarily will be the same in all circumstances. But what a pretty way of arguing this is, by which we may fit the worst Character to the best man, and take away any mans Life or Estate by it, should they proceed against them according to his advice.</p>
               <p>And to retort it upon himself, pray let's see how he would like it. For thus after his example we may likewise say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iudas</hi> was a Clergy-man, an Apostate, and a Traytor to his Master the King of the Jews.</p>
               <p>The Author of this book was a Clergy-man, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Apostate, a Traytor to the King of <hi>Theosebia, ergo,</hi> he ought to be condemned, and executed according to his own Law, and then he need not take the pains to Hang himself, another will do it for him, and at that rate, like <hi>Phalaris,</hi> he may quickly die by his own Inventions.</p>
               <p>Nay further, should the Laws be prosecuted (as he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects) upon Supposition only, then the Lives and Estates of all Dissenters must be forfeted and taken away, as these
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97416:14"/>
are likely persons to destroy that Government, which their Principles do so Fundamentally and Earnestly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>But this he informs them may lawfully be done against the Duke.</p>
               <p>Or, (should they not prevail by fair means to court the King and his Honourable Peers out of their senses) this may then be their remedy, That they should watch the breath of our Sovereign, and as soon as that takes leave of his Royal Corps, then with a prepared Army, step betwixt the Throne and the Tomb, and bid the Successor go seek his fortune in another Country. But, should they unhappily fail in this device also. Should he climb the Throne and demand Allegiance; yet if he commands unjust things, it is very just he says to kill his Messengers, and save their Money, much more their lives; and should they not do this, they would be but their own Murtherers, in not preserving themselves so much as they could.</p>
               <p>And thus he has found out a way, to make Rebellion so far from the sin of Witchcraft that it would be but the manly, Christian fortitude of Killing, <hi>Se defendendo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And since (through the Providence of God bringing their designs to light, since the honest endeavours of some learned hands have likewise, not only refuted his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils, but enlightned the minds of a great many, and reduced them to the more clement Doctrine and disposition of Saints, they are I hope frustrated in this last Intention; how did their disappointments turn into fury; which in a sudden Eruption they presumed might have hastned the Enjoyment of their desires, in the utter dissolution of the King, the Duke, and Thousands more.</p>
               <p>But here by the way, since the injuries to this Prince are so unjustly accumilated upon him, since thy were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to disturb our Peace, and it may be a good step to it, to understand rightly what may be said for the Duke,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97416:15"/>
and the satisfying of those they would stir up to rancour and Rebellion; give me leave to insist on this, which I take in hand on no other Score than to relieve the abused reputation of so great a man.</p>
               <p>What his Opinion is, God knows, we are not to enquire after it, but this I know, that my own is altogether dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that which some may think inclines me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Advocate. Who he is, we all know, namely our Kings Brother. And therefore as a Neighbour, as a Prince, as the Brother of our Sovereign, he certainly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits our charitable observation.</p>
               <p>1. First then, consider his descent. Because, <hi>A Fortibus fortes, A Piis pii generantur,</hi> they say. And if the Maxim may be allowed the same favour here as at other times, there may be a probability, that (from a confluence of merciful blood descending to him from Grandfather and Father,) there may be some in his veins which may influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence him to the same candor: Especially when in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral issue his most sacred Majesty, there does to a Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy such a spring of Clemency inhabit. And indeed, his Patience in his late exile from Council and Nation, his calmness under the highest affronts to a Prince of his Blood, Spirit and Fortune, his weighty Service in <hi>Scotland,</hi> his inseparable love to his Royal Brother, and his Friends, do methinks plainly bespeak him, not to be made up of Serpents blood, or a compound of Monsters bearing Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy against Mankind, as they labour to have him thought to be.</p>
               <p>2. Nor Secondly, can we suppose it possible, that a Prince of his Known ingenuity, should so lose his Genius, his Education, his Understanding, as to delight in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of those who are at once a Princes glory and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
               <p>3. Besides which, Imagining him but to have as much na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affection for himself as other men have, we cannot but conclude, that he will like a Crown upon his own
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97416:15"/>
Head, as well as upon a stangers, and that a Prince of his parts, experience, and improvements, will not for a Frolick, dissolve three Kingdoms as a present to a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, why should we look upon such a Prince, as that Animal who was cut out for the Society of Beasts or Devils, meerly because they describe him so, who for no cause hate him. Can this conciliate his heart, to treat him with the malice of a Jew.</p>
               <p>Nay, where's their Love to our present King; since they thus consider him as if he stood in specie in <hi>Westminster-Abby,</hi> and not at <hi>White-Hall</hi> with the Scepter in his Hand. What Christianity is this, what love to us, to perswade one to turn Dioclesian, and the other to dye, whether they will or no.</p>
               <p>Having thus presented you with a view of their behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, towards King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, King <hi>Charles</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> having seen how exorbitant they were towards these, you may now possibly be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to think it probable that they may be such as we at first described them to be, namely too inveterate towards their inferiours or equals.</p>
               <p>But that you may not depend upon my observation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, give me leave to instance this also by one example of their deportment heretofore, and from what they actually have been, you may perhaps with certainty enough guess what they are or would be; and those are you'l find, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants in seed, though not in growth.</p>
               <p>For thus, from the History of <hi>Independency</hi> in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the two <hi>Iuncto's,</hi> Pag. 6. you may be assured, that they ordinarily turned well affected men out of their Free
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97416:16"/>
holds and Goods, imprisoned and beat their prisoners, nay murther'd them, without any charge, accuser or witness. Although they cry out of our cruelty in suppressing their seditious Meetings, they could find in their hearts one Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, <hi>Sept.</hi> 9. 1649. at the Church of St. <hi>Peters Wharf,</hi> what to send armed men into the Church, and whilst Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> was praying for the King, some were Shot, and mortally wounded, a great many, very much wounded, and others pillaged. And these are but particular examples of that Pile, which is impertinent for so short an animadversion. But as it is thus evidenced that there does so much invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy Lodge in the breasts of those who think themselves the best of Christians, whom (laying aside their mistake) we court into one body, so this antipathy must be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before they can firmly joyn with us. For there must be a Simpathy in the ingredients which are intended for this Compound.</p>
               <p>As we are willing to forget the deformity of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and injuries, so let them be as ready to forget their Animosities. Modestly think they have faults as well as we in their morals, and something much worse. And as to the final judgement of actions, let them leave that to the God of Heaven whose prerogative alone it is. In the mean time, our Charity becomes us better then censure. Let them conclude their Superiors in Church and State, ought to be obeyed, let them conclude our Divine service has no danger in it, and therefore cordially perform it. Let them be as kind to us as they would have us be to them; and then, both our Union and our Nation may be impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. But if they lay aside this affection (which is the essential part of Brethren) this will be but <hi>Cain</hi> to <hi>Abel,</hi> Brother in shew, and a Murtherer in the Heart.</p>

               <p>HAving thus shewn you what they have done, be pleased to compare further, what it is they teach, and the consideration of what the Church of <hi>Theosebia</hi> teaches, and the Doctrine of any Dissenter compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, you will find it a very equal thing I doubt not, that you should afford the same candor to us you do to them.</p>
               <p>The sense of our Doctrine then is according to that great command, to love our Neighbours as our selves, to do as we would be done by, and thus by mutual offices of good Neighbour-hood to promote the content of Living. Instead of which, the opinion of our adversaries has been and is, that none have Authority over us, but the Holy; none have right to the goods of this life but they; and as the Jndependents taught that they could be forgiven in the very act of sinning, so the rest teach that God allows them a particular liberty in sinning; as he cannot be throughly angry with those whom he has decreed to save. From which Principles, how must they be inclined to think high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of themselves, and to do injuries to those they esteem ungodly, and therefore have no right to anything but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contempts, poverty, or the gallows. Once more I say consider this, and you may be satisfyed that our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are much more fit for society, and that we as much or more deserve your affection, when you come to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

us and them. And this you will the sooner be won to do if you consider once more, that it is not impossible, but that some of these late disturbers of our <hi>Israel</hi> in the Pulpits themselves may have been, what heretofore some have been, hired on purpose to raise factions and divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Hist.

               <p>SInce then you have little to say to us, and nothing against the Church, make use of your judgments, and observe that the jealousies which they have raised in your minds, are but <hi>Chymera's,</hi> no more then Children's fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing strang sights, in the Air, and telling them to others. And we are not so much betwixt <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Charybdis</hi> as they contrive to make us conceit.</p>
               <p>Let then those Melancholly Mists, (which darken the mind, and force men to apprehend falsly, which foment uncharitable distrusts, despairs, and Torments; turning our Paradise into a Hell) be clear'd up by the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Light of Love and Peace as the issues of a diviner Spirit, from whence we may be armed at once with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and wisdom. That we may in the sweetness of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, enjoy our Lives and estates small or great; and from the unconstancy of these Tabernacles, pass into the Eternity of the Celestial mansions.</p>
