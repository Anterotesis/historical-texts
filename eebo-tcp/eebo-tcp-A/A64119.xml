            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have too often, in my own mind, cenſur'd others for Complementing themſelves (for as ſuch I took it) in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay's of this kind, when they pretended their unfitneſs for the undertakeing, and that they purely did it at the Requeſt of their Friends, to be guilty of the ſame Preamble. But if I miſtook their deſigns, and they only were, that they might be able to Charge the Defects of their Performances ſomewhere beyond themſelves, if they ſhou'd ſee occaſion, when they had expos'd their Capacities at the requeſt of their Friends. I have the moſt reaſon of any to Preface ſo to you, eſpecially conſidering that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to Reflect upon the <hi>French King</hi>'s <hi>Memorial to the States General, Containing his Reaſons for accepting the Late King of</hi> Spain<hi>'s</hi> Will <hi>in Favour of the Duke d' Anjou.</hi> It is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in a Caſe of this Importance, he has taken care it ſhould not be Jejunely done; and therefore employ'd the beſt Heads he had in this Afffair; and if I miſtake not, ſome who I think Judicious, nor they fail in their Opinions, it is ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worded; But Truth and Juſtice are Weapons not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily Parry'd; yet eaſily us'd by the Hand of the Unskilful, which is the only conſideration that enboldens my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>The deſign of this Memorial, I take to be, to ſooth the Commonalty wherever it comes, and is full of cunning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations of the French King's Inclination<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the Peace

of the Publick. I doubt not but all the Princes and States of <hi>Europe</hi> will very Candidly thank him for it, (as well as the States General) when they can be perſuaded he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring it, and really ſollicitous about it, tho' he ſhould not go ſo far as <hi>to prefer it to the advantage of his own Crown.</hi> But I think the only way to know, whether that is to be believ'd, or expected, is to look back upon that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's Practices in all preceeding junctures of Affairs of this (or ſuch like) nature; and then we ſhall ſee, which he would ſooner Sacrifice his Honour or his Intereſt, and when they drew two ways, which has always been the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent; and upon this conſideration, I cannot think the States General ſhould ſo much as ſeem to be ſurpriz'd at the <hi>French</hi> King's accepting the Will of the late King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſince he thinks it moſt for his Intereſt ſo to do.</p>
            <p>It is ſomething odd, that <hi>His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> ſhould in the Firſt Page of his <hi>Memorial</hi> ſo Ironically Treat and Burleſque the <hi>States-General</hi> as he does: He tells them, <hi>If they take time to examine with their uſual Prudence, the infinite Troubles, which the Treaty of Partition would produce, That ſame Prudence will oblige them to deſiſt from the Demand,</hi> &amp;c. What is this, but to accuſe them of a Precipitancy in the Treaty of Partition; and a want of Prudence, in not well weighing before hand the Conveniences and Inconveniences of it; and yet himſelf ſheer clear enough of that Charge: For by the Treaty of Partition, he added another Method to his Choice of diſpoſing of the Spaniſh Monarchy; and he knew the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>States-General,</hi> both in Honour and Conſcience, thought themſelves bound by, and would not recede from the Obligations laid upon themſelves by a Ratifyed Treaty, tho' he kept himſelf above all bonds but thoſe of his own advantage. It is certainly <hi>a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to abandon the deſign of a Treaty, for the ſake of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Terms of it</hi>; and I would be very willing (if I could) <hi>at this conjuncture to diſtinguiſh betwixt them</hi>; but I cannot ſee that the <hi>Deſign,</hi> and the <hi>Terms</hi> were any more U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59935:4"/>
when the King of <hi>Spain</hi> liv'd, then they are now: For the <hi>Deſign</hi> of that Treaty was not to take place in its effect till after the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Death; therefore that could make no difference betwixt them. On the otherhand, how far it is in the Power of a King of <hi>Spain</hi> by his <hi>Will,</hi> to diſpoſe of his Kingdom, and the Succeſſion of it; and cut off the Right of the next Heir, is not my Province to Determine; but I think, if we look into the 10th <hi>page</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> King's <hi>Memorial,</hi> we ſhall find he lays no ſtreſs upon it for the Duke <hi>d' Anjou's</hi> Right, for when he is pretending, <hi>There's a neceſſity, in order to preſerve the Peace, to make uſe of Methods different from thoſe that were propos'd at Signing the Treaty of Partition.</hi> He tells the States in the next Paragraph; <hi>The moſt natural, that which is moſt agreeable for maintaining the General Peace; and the only juſt Method, conſiſts in the Reſolution, taken by the King to</hi> Accept <hi>the Will of the late Catholick King</hi>: So that it plainly appears, that the Force of the <hi>Will</hi> lyes only in his <hi>Reſolution to Accept of it</hi>; and therefore we have very good reaſon to ſuppoſe, the <hi>Will</hi> of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould have been (with him) no <hi>Will,</hi> if it had croſs'd his inclinations, in ſettling the Crown upon the Arch-Duke; and there is no doubt, but then he would have deliver'd his Proteſt againſt it, ſtrenuouſly inſiſted upon the Treaty of Partition, and Challeng'd, upon their <hi>Guarranty,</hi> the Aſſiſtance of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>States-General,</hi> to have forc'd the performance of it. Then on the other hand, if the <hi>French</hi> King inſiſts upon the Duke <hi>d' Anjou</hi>'s Natural Right, the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Will, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (any more than his Death) make any difference betwixt the <hi>Deſign</hi> and the <hi>Terms</hi> of the Treaty, unleſs the <hi>French</hi> King means his own Private Deſign, which now, it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears <hi>muſt be abſolutely deſtroy'd, if the Terms ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59935:5"/>He goes on then, and tells them, <hi>The former</hi> (that is the deſign of the Treaty) <hi>maintains a General Peace, the latter</hi> (that is the Terms of it) <hi>cauſes an Univerſal War; and therefore the Deciſion, what Meaſures to take, ſhould be made by the Explanation of the Firſt Article of the Treaty,</hi> viz. <hi>To maintain the General Peace of Europe.</hi> I am very much afraid he'l prove a falſe Prophet, and if he does, may the fate of a falſe Prophet purſue him. I cannot think the <hi>Guarrantees</hi> of the <hi>Treaty of Partition</hi> will ſit ſtill, and ſee the Treaty broke, was it only upon Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio of Honour; and I think 'twill plainly appear to be too much their Intereſt to aſſiſt the Emperor, to expect they ſhould be Neutral: For ſhould the <hi>French</hi> King, (which joyn'd with <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp;c.) I don't ſee is ſo difficult to be done, to be too hard for the Emperor, and ſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Arms, or indeed otherwiſe engage them; they will make too Formidable an Enemy, to be thought not worth minding; and the ballance not ſo much kept in <hi>Aequilibrio</hi> as might be wiſh'd. And therefore the <hi>French</hi> King muſt greatly reflect upon the Conduct, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of thoſe concerned in the <hi>Treaty,</hi> in endeavouring to impoſe that belief upon the publick, That <hi>his accepting the King of</hi> Spain<hi>'s Will, Maintains a General Peace.</hi> Then on the other hand had the <hi>French</hi> King kept to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Treaty of Partition, I can't for my part ſee who could, or dar'd, attempt the diſturbance of the Peace of Europe upon that account; and therefore I ſhall conſider the difficulties he mentions as the Grounds of his ſpecious pretences.</p>
            <p>But firſt I think it may not be amiſs, to obviate the Objection made againſt the Validity of the Treaty, and the <hi>French</hi> King's being any ways bound by it: Becauſe, ſays he, the Emperor had not Accepted of the <hi>Partition</hi> before the Death of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; 'tis therefore void, and ceaſes to be Obligatory, the three Months being paſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59935:5"/>
which was allowed him for Acceptance. This is the ſcope of the Objection, which will be eaſily Anſwered; if we conſider, that by the ſecret Article of the Treaty the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was to have two Months more granted him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it, which were not determin'd; but ſuppoſe they were, the 7th. Article of the Treaty has made Proviſion for the Emperor's refuſal. It runs thus, <hi>Immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Exchange of this preſent Treaty, it ſhall be Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Emperor, who ſhall be invited to enter thereinto; but if, after three Month's time, from the Day of the ſaid Communication, and the ſaid Invitation, or the day that his Catholick Majeſty ſhall dye, if it happen before the Expiration of the ſaid three Months; his Imperial Majeſty, and the King of the</hi> Romans, <hi>ſhould refuſe to enter thereinto, and to agree to the Share aſſigned to the moſt Serene Arch-Duke</hi> Charles; <hi>The two Kings</hi> (of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>England) or their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and the States General, ſhall agree upon a Prince to whom that part ſhall be given: And in caſe, notwithſtanding the preſent Convention the moſt Serene Arch-Duke ſhall take poſſeſſion either of the part which might fall to him, before he has Accepted the preſent Treaty, or of that part which might be aſſign'd to</hi> Monſ. Dauphin, <hi>or to him who ſhall have the Dutchy of</hi> Millan <hi>in Exchange, as aboveſaid; the ſaid two Kings, and the States General, by Virtue of this Convention, ſhall hinder him with all their Forces.</hi> Now, I doubt not, but the <hi>French</hi> King would take very haniouſly, any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon his Care, or Conduct, in this Affair, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving agreed to he knew not what, (which, if he did, was his own fault) but then he ought to forbear that Plea for his Breach of the Treaty; leaſt it neceſſary ſayes a ſeverer Charge, and proves, that his Agreeing to the Treaty was purely a deſign to provoke the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> (or ſome, of the Grandees for him) to give the Kingdom by Will, (as far as that Gift will go) to a Prince of <hi>France,</hi> leaſt it ſhould be divided; and ſo the Treaty was broken (in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59935:6"/>
his Intention) before it was made. How well this agrees with what he ſays in the 11th. page of the Memorial: <hi>The high Dignities of Kings does not excuſe them frem conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whether the Wars they undertake be juſt. Then what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons could his Majeſty (who is known to be a juſt Prince) of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for reſuming Arms to divide a Monarchy, which is ſettled intirely upon the lawful Heir.</hi> And juſt before in the 10th. page: <hi>If any Prince have a Right to oppoſe the Diſpoſitions of that Will, there needs no more but to read them, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that this Right belongs only to the Dauphin.</hi> By the way, how the reading the Diſpoſitions of the Will ſhould convince of a Right to oppoſe them, is, at preſent, to me a Paradox: But put the Caſe the Right is in the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> was it not ſo when the Treaty of <hi>Partition</hi> was ratified, and was not the <hi>Dauphin</hi> a Party thereunto? (<hi>See the</hi> 4<hi>th Article of the Treaty,</hi>) and could not the <hi>French</hi> King then, as well as now, <hi>have obtain'd more conſiderable Advantages by his Arms, if he had deſign'd to make uſe of them (as now he does) than the Kingdoms of</hi> Naples <hi>and</hi> Sicily, <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of</hi> Guipuſcoa, <hi>and the Dutchy of</hi> Lorrain, <hi>&amp;c. which</hi> he ſays, <hi>he had no deſign to acquire by a Treaty:</hi> What then could he deſign by the Treaty, but to give the World one Inſtance more (of which we have had ſingular, in the Breach of the <hi>Pyrenean,</hi> and other Treaties) of his <hi>Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> (unleſs the <hi>Partition</hi> ſhould prove for his <hi>Advantage</hi>) and laugh in his ſleeve at thoſe that gave any Credit to his Promiſes, and ſtumbled at his <hi>Painted Trap Door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to conſider what he has Offer'd, for the Certainty of an univerſal War if he had ſtood by the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Partition. Firſt, the</hi> Milaneze, <hi>the Kingdoms of</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>and</hi> Sicily, <hi>the Provinces, the Places comprehended in the Partition, all of them put themſelves in a Condition,</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid Poſture, tho' that is not true) <hi>to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Union with the Body of the</hi> Spaniſh Monarchy, and a little lower. <hi>Thus the Arch-Duke becoming King of</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59935:6"/>
Spain, <hi>&amp;c. There muſt be a neceſſity in order to execute the Treaty, to Conquer the Kingdoms reſerv'd for the ſhare of the</hi> Dauphin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are very great Reaſons, ſhould it prove true, that the Places reſerv'd for the ſhare of the <hi>Dauphin</hi> were really in <hi>a Condition to maintain their Union with the</hi> Spaniſh Monarchy, againſt the united Power of the <hi>Guarantees.</hi> How comes the <hi>French</hi> King all of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to be ſo modeſt (tho' I believe we ſhall find him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by and by) or doubtful of his own ſtrength, (that uſe to Hector all <hi>Europe,</hi>) to ſuppoſe that <hi>France, England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in Union, ſhould ſpeak twice for the performance of the Treaty when there are none to withſtand it, but what might have been blown away by the Breath of their Guns; and they would have had more Wit, than to have flung againſt Six high, when they might part Stakes; and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> (I mean ſuppoſing the Arch Duke to have been ſo) would never have been <hi>reduc'd to thoſe great Extremities</hi> the Memorial ſpeaks of, before he would part with the Share of the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> ſince he muſt know 'twas impoſſible for him to withſtand the Arms of this <hi>Tripple League,</hi> tho' back'd with the Emperor's Aſſiſtance; and <hi>Savoy</hi> durſt not (tho' if he did, to no great purpoſe) turn his Arms againſt <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. on that Occaſion; neither would it be ſo much worth, for him to hazard his own ruin by being on the weaker ſide, conſidering the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies of his Title, which muſt not Commence, till after the extinction of the Heirs of the Princes of <hi>France,</hi> and the Arch-Duke.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral things more might be conſider'd, as the grand Reflection upon the <hi>States General</hi> in the 15th <hi>page,</hi> where he tells them, That, <hi>in truth, he is perſuaded, that they never had any deſign to obtain the effect of their laſt Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> and ſo goes on to banter 'em, and makes them worſe than Trifles. Then again, <hi>That they ſhould, in that their Memorial, have nam'd the Princes that were ready to joyn in

               <hi>The Troops for being the</hi> Guarrantees <hi>of the Articles of it: They ſhould have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd thoſe the Republick of</hi> Holland <hi>was to furniſh by Sea or Land.</hi> Truly I can't ſee what occaſion there was for the <hi>States-General</hi> juſt in that Memorial (which was, as I take it, only to put him in mind of the Treaty, when they found he was going to break it) to Name the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ready to joyn, (which he knew as well as they) ſince the 10th 11th and 13th Articles of the Treaty were ſo plain; and that all engag'd in that Treaty, (to him not unknown) were oblig'd to be ready ſo to do; neither could he expect, that they ſhould by that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial mention the Number they were to furniſh; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the 14th Article, all the <hi>Guarrantees</hi> were to agree what proportion each ſhould Contribute; ſo that 'twould have been very prepoſterous for them, then to have aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd <hi>their</hi> Number, without any ſuch agreement. He has one very pretty Turn I cannot paſs: After he had ſuppos'd upon his rejecting the Will, the Arch-Duke had enter'd upon the Regency: he ſays in his 13th <hi>page, He muſt have been oblig'd to attack a Living Prince, Proſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the Crown of</hi> Spain, <hi>and its certain that the Meaſures he had taken with the Allies, related only to the Diviſion of the Succeſſion of a Prince, whoſe Death appear'd to be very near.</hi> Certainly the <hi>French</hi> King muſt think he writes to very weak Heads, or he could never ſuppoſe thus to ſham 'em, Would not the Arch-Duke then have come in as <hi>Succeſſor</hi> to that King, whoſe <hi>Succeſſion</hi> the Diviſion related to; and did not he ſtand oblig'd to the Diviſion of that <hi>Succeſſion</hi> according to the Treaty? Ay, but <hi>the Emperor was all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59935:7"/>In the next Paragraph he does the <hi>Guarrantees</hi> the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to declare, that <hi>their deſign was Peace,</hi> That <hi>they ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated no particular Advantage to themſelves,</hi> &amp;c.

But this is brought as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That they having receiv'd no prejudice, ſhould not intermeddle. Surely there's the <hi>moſt Honour,</hi> in ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Treaty where there is the <hi>leaſt Intereſt</hi> to Sway; and in all likelihood will be the <hi>moſt Juſtice</hi> too; but where does all this end? Why, in the Old Story, with a a little addition: The Emperor had not Sign'd the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore, <hi>There was no Treaty, except with the Mediators</hi>; this needs no farther Anſwer, than to referr you again to the 7th Article of the Treaty, and what has been ſaid before.</p>
            <p>At length, Sir, we are got to conſider of the Renunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, by reaſon of the following Expreſſions in the 12th <hi>page</hi> of the Memorial. <hi>The Diſputes raiſed, as to the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the Renunciation of the late Queen, ſerv'd for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to this Accommodation. In effect, it had been of no uſe, if the Nullity of that Renunciation had been acknowledg'd as fully during the late Catholick King</hi>'s <hi>Life, as it is declared in his</hi> Will. Before I ſay any thing of it, I ſhall recite the Title of the <hi>French</hi> King, as I found it in the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a Relation of the <hi>French</hi> King's Expedition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Netherlands, in the Years, 1667 and 1668. <hi>page</hi> the 3d. of the Introduction.
<q>In the Year 1659 a Treaty of Peace was concluded between the two Crowns, (of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>) and together with a Marriage between <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. now King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Maria Thereſa, (Eldeſt Daughter to</hi> Philip <hi>the IV. King of</hi> Spain, <hi>and</hi> Elizabeth <hi>the Daughter to</hi> Henry <hi>the IV, and Siſter to</hi> Lewis <hi>the XIII. King of</hi> France, For whoſe Portion the King her Father, obliged himſelf to pay 500000 Crowns of Gold, and pretended Salick Law
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59935:8"/>
debars Females, from Succeſſion to the <hi>French</hi> Crown; as alſo to the end, that the two Crowns, being too Great and Puiſſant to be United into one Kingdom, all occaſions of ſuch a Conjunction might be avoided: It was Covenanted, (among other things) That neither the <hi>Infanta,</hi> nor her <hi>Children and Deſcendents, in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſoever,</hi> ſhould ever ſucceed in the Kingdoms, Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niories or Dominions, which do or ſhall belong to his Catholick Majeſty, as well within, as without the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> notwithſtanding any Law or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, which by this agreement (which is to continue in the full Force and Vigour of a Law for ever) Their Majeſties did aboliſh. This Renunciation the <hi>Infanta</hi> Confirm'd in theſe very Terms by an Oath, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Kings themſelves, the Princes of the Blood, and the Chief Nobility of both Kingdoms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that you ſee both Kings were engag'd in it, as well as the <hi>Infanta</hi>; (whoſe Oath I have not by me or elſe would inſert it) but I think it will not be amiſs to Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the very words of the Renunciation it ſelf, by which it will be more evinc'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Placuit utrique Regi pactione inſtar legis ſemper valiturâ ſancire, ne unquam ſereniſſima Infans Tereſa, aut poſteri ejus ulli, ad feros uſque Nepotes, quocunque gradu ſint, admittan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad ſucceſſionem ullam, ſive Regnorum, ſive Principatuum, Provinciarum, Ditionum, Dominiorum quorumcunque Regis Catholici, non obſtante lege ulla, conſuetudine, aut alio Jure in contrarium, cui utriuſque Regis authoritate pleniſſimè de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatur, contemplatione dictae aequalitatis, &amp; publicae utilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis quae inde emanatura ſperatur. It was to Conſented by both their Majeſties, and by them confirm'd, that neither the moſt Serene Infanta</hi> Tereſa, <hi>nor any of her Iſſue or Poſterity, in what degree ſoever, be admitted to ſucceed in any of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Dukedoms, Provinces, or Dominions of his Catholick Majeſty, any other Cuſtom, Conſtitution, or Law to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59935:8"/>
notwithſtanding: So that if any ſuch Cuſtom or Conſtitution were, it was by authority of both Kings abſolutely annull'd and deſtroyed. And this only to adjuſt the Dominion of both Crowns, ſo as each of them might receive an equal benefit by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Sir to me it plainly appears that the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Will cannot make void a Renunciation ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirm'd. We find, as the Heirs receive a Right from the Parent, it is in the Power of the Parent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it; but I won't pretend to be ſo much a <hi>Civilian,</hi> to argue, much leſs to determine, this Point. I will only obſerve, the <hi>French</hi> King but renounc'd the ever having a future Right, not a Right that he ever had; tho' I doubt not but his Civilians, knowing his Mind, have given him their Abſolution (which is not much to be wonder'd at, ſince, in a more curious Frame of Government than his Judges have been found, that would make the Will of their Prince Law) and ſhould a <hi>Qualm</hi> happen to overſhadow his Conſcience, the <hi>Sorbon</hi> too, muſt direct their Deciſion, by the <hi>Regal Nod</hi>; and there I'll leave him, till the firſt have got more Courage, than to ſubmit the Law to his Will; and the latter more <hi>The Fear of God,</hi> than to ſubſtitute the Sacred Oracles (which they pretend to unfold) to his unbounded Ambition. And I'll only ſay he that won't be ty'd by an Oath, will no more be ſecur'd by any other Bond, than <hi>Leviathan,</hi> when you bob for him with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Hair.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Sir, in the laſt Page his Majeſty is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily tranſported with the good Opinion he has of himſelf, and with what he would preſuade the World, the States General have, or ought to have, of him. When he had in the preceding Paragraph ſuggeſted, that the delay of the two Months for the Emperor's conſideration, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by their Memorial, might ſettle the Arch-Duke in the Throne, he tells them, that
<q>He is willing to believe that this was not their Deſign; they know too well that it's their Intereſt to merit by their Good Conduct
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59935:9"/>
the <hi>Honour of his Affection</hi> and the Continuation of his <hi>Good Will.</hi> And again he doubts not but they will change their Complaints into Thanks, and Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as ſoon as poſſible, upon his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Crown, and that they will endeavour to merit of the King the <hi>Good-Will</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> that they and their Anceſtors have receiv'd of his Majeſty and his Predeceſſors.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This ſhould have been his Language at the <hi>Treaty</hi> at <hi>Reſwick,</hi> and then he'd ſoon have had an Anſwer; and whoever conſiders how high he begun, and how low he ended; and the Haughty Spirit of that Prince, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuppoſe he'd have parted with ſo many Important Places, as he then did, had he been in ſuch a <hi>Protecting Capacity</hi> as he writes himſelf; or the <hi>Merit</hi> of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Affection</hi>; and the <hi>continuation of his Good Will,</hi> been ſo highly worth aſpiring to.</p>
            <p>Neither are the <hi>Dutch</hi> in ſo poor, and forlorn a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now to want his Aid, and Protection; and were they otherwiſe willing to condeſcend, to be of his Party, this is enough to rouze their Indignation, and incline them to ſhew him they ſtand not in need of his Favour.</p>
            <p>Indeed, when I think of the <hi>French</hi> King, he brings <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi> to my mind; He is Glorying in his Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; His Heart (for ought I know) is Merry, He is pride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in the Sacrilegious ſpoils of the Proteſtants, and TEKEL is his Charge. He lives as if there was none above him, The Spirit of Perſecution is reigning in him; and the Cryes of the Oppreſſed loud againſt him. I have nothing more to do at preſent, but to crave leave to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe my Self,</p>
