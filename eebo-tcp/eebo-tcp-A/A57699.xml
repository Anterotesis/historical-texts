            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Mr Speaker.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WEE have of late entred into the consideration of the Petition of Right, and the violation of it, and upon good reason; for it concernes our <hi>Goods, Liberties, and Lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is a Grant of higher Nature, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves for us far greater things; eternall life, our soule, yea God himselfe. A writ of <hi>Religion</hi> deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to us from the King of Kings, confirmed to us by the King of this Kingdome, enacted by Law in this place, streaming downe to us in the bloud of the Martyrs, witnessed from heaven by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and miraculous wonders, and deliverances. And this right, in the name of this Nation, I this day claime, and desire, that there be a serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration had of the violation of it: my desire is, that it may be considered, what new paintings are laid upon the face of the whore of Rabylon, to make her seeme more lovely, and to draw so many the more Suters to her. J desire it may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
<pb facs="tcp:50472:3"/>
how the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> doth eate into our <hi>Religion,</hi> and fret into the bankes and walls of it.</p>
            <p>The Lawes and Statutes of this <hi>Realme,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally since those Lawes have been made in manner by themselves, even by their owne treasons, and bloudy Designes.</p>
            <p>And since that Popery is a confused mist of Errour, casting down Kings before Popes, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of God, before the traditions of men, living and reasonable men before dead, &amp; senseles stocks and stones: I desire, that we consider the encrease of <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> and <hi>Errour,</hi> that maketh the grace of <hi>God,</hi> looke after the will of men: that maketh the sheepe to keepe the shepheard, and make a mortall seed an immortall God. I desire, that we may looke into the belly, and bowels of this <hi>Trojan Horse,</hi> to see if there be no man in it, ready to open the gate of <hi>Romish tyranny,</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Monarchy;</hi> for <hi>Arminianisme</hi> is the span of a papist, and if there come the warmth of favour, you shall see him turne into one of those <hi>frogs, that ariseth out of the bottomlesse pit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if you marke it well, you shall see an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian,</hi> reaching one hand to a papist, a papist to a Iesuit, a Iesuit one hand to the Pope, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the King of <hi>Spaine:</hi> and these men having kindled fire in our Neighbor-countries, now they have brought some of it over hither, to set on flame this Kingdome also.</p>
            <p>Yea let us consider, and search, whether these be
<pb facs="tcp:50472:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not the men, that breake in upon the goods, and <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties</hi> of this <hi>Common-wealth;</hi> for by this means, they may make way, for the taking away of our Religion. It was an old trick of the Divell, when he went to take away Jobs religion, hee began at his goods. <hi>Lay thy hand on all that he hath, and hee will curse thee to thy face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Either they thinke hereby, to set distaste be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Prince &amp; people, or to find some other way of supply to avoid, and breake Parliaments, that so they may break in upon our religion, and bring in their owne errours.</p>
            <p>But let us doe, as Iob did, hee held fast his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, &amp; then his goods were restored with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And if wee hold fast God and our religion, these things will be added unto us. Let us consider the times past, how we flourished in <hi>honour,</hi> when religion flourished amongst us: but as religion decayed, so the <hi>honour and state of this Nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the soule of a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is dead, the body cannot long over-live it. If a man meete a dogge alone, the dogg is fearefull, though never so fierce by nature: but if that dog have his Master by him, he will set upon that man, from whom he fled before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:50472:4"/>
This sheweth, that low natures being backed by higher, encrease in strength and courage: and certainly, a man backed with omnipotence, is a kind of omnipotent thing; all things are possible to him that beleeveth, and, all things being possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there is a kind of omnipotence in them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, now let it be the unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, as our resolution formerly was, to make a vow, and Covenant, from henceforth to hold fast our God, and Religion, and then shall we from henceforth, certainly expect <hi>Prosperity, in this our Kingdome, and Nation, and to this, let every one say,</hi>

            <head>A Correspondency of the Pope with our Bishops.</head>
            <p>THe Pope writeth himselfe Father, so doe they write themselves reverend Fathers. The Pope sells sin for money, so doe they, as the whole Kingdome, and their Officers can well tell; and doth nothing without money so doe they. The Pope forbiddeth marriage and meats, &amp;, which <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Doctrine of Divels, so doe they in the same manner, whatsoever they pretend. The <hi>Pope</hi> commandeth superstitions Idoll-dayes to be kept &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, contrary to the Commandements of God, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth the neglect of his Commandements more severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then the breach of the waightiest Lawes of God: so do the Prelates, as their Courts can witnesse; yea and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand men, and compell them as the Pope himselfe, to break the Commandements of God to observe vaine &amp; impious traditions. The pope selleth Licences for meat &amp; marriage, the Prelates do the same: the pope selleth <hi>Non-residences, pluralities, trialities, totquots,</hi> the Prelates doe the same, to the starving &amp; ruining of the soules of men. the pope ruleth and governeth the Church, by the cursed Canon-law, and popish Excommunications, the scalding of the Conscience, the prelates doe the very same, and the breach of their stinkingest Canons is more deeply puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in their Courts, then the violation of the Lawes of God and the King: the pope preferreth his Ceremonies and traditions before the Word of God, the prelates doe the same, as daily experience teacheth us: the pope per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuteth all godly preachers and people, that preach the Gospell in the purity of it, and desire in sincerity to serve the Lord, and would bring their <hi>brethren to the knowledge of the same, and to the purity and truth of the Apostolicall Churches,</hi> the <hi>Prelats</hi> do the like, as the whole Kingdome
<pb facs="tcp:50472:5"/>
knoweth well, and the Gaoles and prisons daily witnesse, and the silencing of so many learned and painfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: the Pope appoints his priests to stand at the Altar with the Deacon, apparell'd with his foppish and player<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like accutriments, those Babylonish garments, and to cry out <hi>Dominus vibiscum,</hi> the Deacon and Sub-deacon, with all the rest of <hi>Baals Priests,</hi> answering him as loud as they can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Bishops doe the same, saving onely that it is in English: the Pope commandeth adoration at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, crossing of children in Baptisme, demanding of the new-born Babes, <hi>if they will forsake the Divell, and all his workes, &amp;c.</hi> &amp; esteemeth the Font more holy then other places; injoyeth likewise purifying of women, and a thousand such like costly and chargeable vanities, which were too tedious to relate: and all these and more then these doe the Prelates in like manner: in all which, their Antichristian Authority with their Popish practises, are sufficiently manifest: so that there is little or no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene pope and prelates. And all Authority of doing this, they arrogate unto themselves <hi>Iure divine.</hi> Limbes therefore they are of Antichrist, from whom Dr. <hi>Pocklington gloryes,</hi> that they are lineally discended, in his impious pamphlet, entituled <hi>Sunday no Sabbath.</hi>
