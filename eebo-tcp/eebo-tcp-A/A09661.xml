            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N Wednesday beinge
the fourthe daye of
June, in the yeare of
our Lord. 1561. and in
the thyrde yeare of the reigne of
our soueraygne Ladye Elizabeth
by the grace of God, Queene of
Englande, Fraunce and Ireland,
defender of the faith. &amp;c. betweene
one and two of the clocke at after
Noone, was seene a marueilous
great fyrie lightning, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
insued a most terrible hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous
cracke of thunder, suche as seldom hath been heard, and that
by estimacion of sense, directlye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Citie of London. At which
instante the corner of a turret of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
steple of saint Martins Churche
within Ludgate was torne, and
<pb facs="tcp:5315:3"/>
diuers great stones casten down,
and a hole broken throughe the
roofe &amp; timber of the said church,
by the fall of the same stones.</p>
            <p>For diuers persones in tyme
of the saide tempest being on the
riuer of Thamys, and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
in the fieldes nere adioyning
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie, affirmed that thei saw
a long and a speare pointed flame
of fier (as it were) runne through
the toppe of the Broche or Shaft
of Paules Steple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the Easte
Westwarde. And some of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
of saint Martins then being
in the streate, dyd feele a maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
strong ayre or whorlewynd,
with a smel lyke Brimstone, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from Paules Churche, and
withal heard the rushe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stones
which fell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their steple into the
churche. Betwene .iiii. and fiue of
<pb facs="tcp:5315:3"/>
the clocke a smoke was espied by
diuers to breake oute vnder the
bowle of the said shaf of Paules,
&amp; namely by Peter Johnson prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Registrer to the Bishop of
Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who immediatly brought
worde to the Bishops house. But
sodeinly after, as it wer in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente,
the flame brake furth in a
circle like a garlande rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the broche, about two yards
to the stimacion of sight vnder the
bowle of the said shaft, &amp; increased
in suche wise, that within a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an howre, or litle more, the
crosse &amp; the Egle on the toppe fell
downe vpon the south crosse Ile.
The Lord Maior being sent for, &amp;
his brethren, came with all spede
possible, &amp; had a short consultacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as in such a case might be, with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
Bishop of London and others, for
<pb facs="tcp:5315:4"/>
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best way of remedy. And thither
came also y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord keper of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great
Seale, &amp; the Lord Treasorer, who
by their wisedom and authoritie
dyrected as good order, as in so
great a confusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could possible be.</p>
            <p>Some there wer, prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in warres, that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celed
the remanente of the steple to bee
shot down with Canons, whiche
counsel was not liked, as most pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
both for the dispersing the
fire, and destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of houses and
people, other perceiuing the steple
to be past al recouery, considering
the hugenes of the fier, &amp; the drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of the lead, thought beste to
geat ladders &amp; scale the churche,
&amp; with axes to hew down a space
of the roofe of the Churche, to stay
the fier, at the leaste to saue some
part of the saide churche, whiche
<pb facs="tcp:5315:4"/>
was concluded. But before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
&amp; buckets could be brought,
&amp; things put in any order, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
because the churche was
of such height, that thei could not
skale it, &amp; no sufficiente nomber of
axes could be had, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laborers also
being troubled with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> multitude
of ydle gasers, the moste parte of
the higheste roofe of the Churche
was on fier.</p>
            <p>Fyrst the fall of the Crosse and
Egle fired the southe crosse Ile,
whiche Ile was firste consumed,
the beames &amp; brands of the steple
fell down on euery side, &amp; fired the
other thre partes, that is to saye,
the Chauncel or Quier, the north
Ile, &amp; the body of the church. So
that in one howres space y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> broch
of the steple was brent downe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
battlementes, &amp; the most part of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:5315:5"/>
highest roofe of the churche, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
consumed. The state of the
steple &amp; churche seming both des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate:
my Lord Mayor was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
by one maister Winter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
admiraltie, to conuerte the moste
part of his care &amp; prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
the Bishops palace adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
to the Northwest end of the
church: least fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that house beinge
large, the fier might sprede to the
stretes adioyning. Wherupon the
ladders, buckets, &amp; laborers, were
commaunded thither, &amp; by greate
labor &amp; diligente, a piece of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roofe
of the Northe Ile was cut down,
&amp; the fier so stayed, and by muche
water, that parte quenched, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
said Bishops house preserued. It
pleased god also at the same tyme
bothe to turne &amp; calme the winde,
which afore was veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb facs="tcp:5315:5"/>
stil high &amp; greate in other
partes without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie. There wer
abouee .v. C. persons y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> laboured in
carying &amp; filli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g water &amp;c. Diuers
substancial Citizens toke paynes
as if thei had bene laborers, so did
also diuers &amp; sondrye gentlemen,
whose names wer not knowen to
the writer hereof, but amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the said M. Winter, &amp; one. M
Stranguish, did both take nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
paines in their own persons, &amp;
also much directed &amp; encouraged
other, and that not without great
dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euening
came the Lord Clinton, Lord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court at Grenewiche,
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Queenes maiesty assone
as the rage of the fier was espied
by her maiestye and others in the
court, of the pitifull inclinacion &amp;
loue that her gracious highnesse
<pb facs="tcp:5315:6"/>
dyd beare both to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said church &amp;
the citie, sente to assyst my Lorde
Mayor for the suppressyng of the
fyre, who with his wysdome, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
&amp; dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t trauayl did very
much good therin. About .x. of the
clocke the fyercenes of the fyre
was past, the tymbre being fallen
and lyinge brenninge vppon the
vaultes of stone, the vaultes yet
god be thanked) standynge vnpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished:
so as onelye the tymbre of
the hole church was consumed, &amp;
the lead molten, sauyng the most
parte of the two lowe Iles of the
Queare, and a piece of the north
Ile, and an other smal piece of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
southe Ile, in the bodye of the
churche. Notwithstandynge all
which, it pleased the merciful god
in his wrath to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and to enclose the harme of
<pb facs="tcp:5315:6"/>
this most fyerce and terrible fyre,
wythin the walles of thys one
church, not extending any part of
his wrath in this fyre vppon the
rest of the Citie, whiche to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and sence of man was subiect
to vtter distruction. For in
the hole city without the churche
no stycke was kyndled surelye.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding that in diuerse
partes, &amp; stretes, and within the
houses bothe adioyninge and of a
good distaunce, as in fletestrete, &amp;
newgate market, by the violence
of fyre, burninge coles of greate
bignesse, fell downe almoost as
thicke as haylstones, and flawes
of lead were blowen abrode into
the gardins without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie, like
flawes of snow in bredthe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>oute
hurt, god be thanked, to any house
or perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Many fond talkes goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode
<pb facs="tcp:5315:7"/>
of the original cause of this
fier. Some say, it was negligence
of plumbers, whereas by due
examinacion it is proued that no
plumbers or other workemen la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored
in the churche for sixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes
before. Other suspect it
was done by som wicked practise
of wildfyer or gunpouder but no
iust suspicious therof by any exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacion
can be founde hitherto.
Some suspect coniurers &amp; sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
wherof there is also no great
likelyhode. And if it hadde bene
wrought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> waie, yet could not the
deuil haue done it, without Gods
permissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to som purpose of his
vnsercheable iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, as appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in the story of Job. The true
cause as it semeth, was the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pest
by gods suffrance: for it cannot be
otherwise gathered, but that at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
said great &amp; terrible thunderclap,
