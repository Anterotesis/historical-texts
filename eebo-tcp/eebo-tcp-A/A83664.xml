            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas the Chambers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Studies, and Truncks of M. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Haſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rige,</hi> M. <hi>Pym,</hi> M. <hi>Hampden,</hi> and M. <hi>Strode,</hi> Members of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, upon Munday the 3. of this inſtant <hi>January,</hi> by colour of His Majeſties Warrant have been ſealed up by Sir <hi>William Kilegrey,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Flemen</hi> and others; which is not only againſt the Priviledge of Parliament, but the common Liberty of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Subject: Which ſaid Members afterwards, the ſame day were under the like colour, by Serjeant <hi>Frances,</hi> one of His Majeſties Serjeants at Arms, contrary to all former Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents and Priviledges of Parliaments demanded of the Speaker, ſitting in the Houſe of Commons to be delivered unto him, that he might Arreſt them of High Treaſon: And whereas afterwards the next day His Majeſty in His Royall Perſon came to the ſaid Houſe attended with a great multitude of men armed in warlike manner, with Halberts, Swords, and Piſtolls, who came up to the very door of the houſe, and placed themſelves there, and in other places and paſſages neer to the ſaid houſe, to the great terrour and diſturbance of the Members thereof, then ſitting, and according to their dutie, in a peaceable and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly manner, treating of the great Affairs of England and Ireland: And his Majeſty having placed himſelf in the Speakers Chair, demanded of them the Perſons of the ſaid Members to be delivered unto him, which is a high Breach of the Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament, and inconſiſtent with the Liberties, and Freedom thereof. And whereas afterwards his Majeſty did iſſue forth ſeverall Warrants to divers Officers, under his own hand, for the apprehenſion of the Perſons of the ſaid Members, which by Law he cannot do, there being not all this time, any Legall charge or Accuſation, or due Proceſſes of Law iſſued againſt them, nor any pretence of charge made known to that houſe; all which are againſt the Fundamentall Liberties of the Subject, and the Rights of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whereupon we are neceſſitated, according to our duty, to declare, That if any Perſon ſhall arreſt M. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur Haſlerige,</hi> M. <hi>Pym,</hi> M. <hi>Hampden,</hi> and M. <hi>Strode,</hi> or any of them, or any other Member of Parliament, by pretence or colour of any Warrant iſſuing out from the King only, is guilty of the Breach of the Liberties of the Subject, and of the Priviledge of Parliament, and a publike enemy to the Common-wealth. And that the Arreſting of the ſaid Members, or any of them, or of any othér Member of Parliament, by any Warrant whatſoever, without a Legall proceeding againſt them, and without conſent of that houſe, whereof ſuch Perſon is a Member, is againſt the Liberty of the Subject, and a Breach of Priviledge of Parliament; And the Perſon which ſhall Arreſt any of theſe Perſons, or any other Member of the Parliament, is declared a publike enemy of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all which we think fit further to declare, that we are ſo farre from any endeavour to protect any of our Members, that ſhall be in due manner proſecuted according to the Laws of the Kingdom, and the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament for Treaſon, or any other miſdemeanor, That none ſhall be more ready and willing then we our ſelves, to bring them to their ſpeedy, and due tryall, Being ſenſible that it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually imports us, as well to ſee Juſtice done againſt them that are criminous, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the juſt Rights and Liberties of the Subjects, and Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
