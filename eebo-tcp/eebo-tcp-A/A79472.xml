            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is ſaid <hi>Revel. 18.</hi> one of <hi>Babylons</hi> names is <hi>MY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STERY.</hi> It hath been an ordinary custom with Antichriſt, when he hath been unable to do his work in his own appearance, to put on a Diſguiſe. To that end the Romiſh Emiſſaries have ſeveral times come into the Reformed Churches, under pretence of being converted, ſome of them acting the parts of <hi>Arminians</hi> (as in the Low-Countreyes) to the almoſt ruine both of that Church and State: Some of other Sects, according to their instructions, and as their Deſign required, that they might widen the Breaches, and foment the diſeaſes of Proteſtant Churches, like <hi>Sanballat</hi> and his Complices, they pretend to joyn in the Building, that they may more effectually hinder it.</p>
            <p>Nor hath this Deſign been wanting among us, as is too too evident from their foot-ſteps. They have brought things to this paſſe, that Antichriſt is exalted by railing upon him; while the name is ſpoken againſt, but the thing hugg'd; divers Popiſh Opinions being already embraced by thoſe that would be called Proteſtants. As a skilfull Gameſter is willing to loſe a Pawn at Cheſſe, that he may take a Queen. And in this Deſign we believe many move out of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of their hearts, <hi>Like a Bird that haſteth to the ſnare, and knows not that it is for his life:</hi> In which rank we place ſome of thoſe with whom we have to do. It is not long ſince, a Book was made <hi>A Beacon fired to give notice to the State of divers Popiſh and Blaſphemous Books, printed and publiſhed in</hi> England. It was hoped and expected, that the work would not diſpleaſe any ſober Proteſtant, but rather that it would awaken all out of that ſtrange Security and Lethargy wherein they were. But behold there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome, yea of thoſe that have given up their Name to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Cauſe, that rendered us evil for good, and writ a bitter An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and took upon them to plead the Cauſe of the vileſt of men,
<pb facs="tcp:118194:3"/>
expreſly deſiring an <hi>Univerſal Toleration,</hi> and as it were making a Proclamation, <hi>Ho all ye Jeſuites, Blaſphemers, come into</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>preach, write what you will, we fear you not!</hi> There are ſome men it ſeems that hate <hi>Presbytery</hi> worſe then <hi>Popery.</hi> Thus what was thought to be a ſlander is now verified, <hi>That ſtrong endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours are uſed to tolerate Popery, Blaſphemy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and what not?</hi> It was ſtrange to us, that after the Parliament had appointed a Faſt, to direct them in the Suppreſſion of Errours, any of their ſervants ſhould plead for a <hi>General Toleration.</hi> When we firſt ſaw the Book, we ſtood amazed. But after ſerious conſideration we beheld and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the wiſdom of God, that hath brought ſecret things to light, and hath diſcovered the Deſign before it was fully effected; we hope in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that our Parliament may have the honour to prevent it, and that all the people of the Land may be the more wary. It was alſo another piece of Divine Providence, that ſo wretched a Cauſe ſhould be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with as much weakneſſe as could be deſired. We thought it our Duty, that ſuch a Text ſhould not want a Commentary, and ſuch a Deſign of Darkneſſe a Light, that all men may ſee the Myſtery and loath it, and Arm againſt it.

Theſe men would do as the Romane Emperours did: If any man forſwore himſelf by their <hi>Genius,</hi> they would be ſure to puniſh them; but let him forſwear himſelf by God, they would leave him to God to puniſh. So let a man blaſpheme God, dethrone the Lord Jeſus, call <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> Impoſtors, there are ſome <hi>Gallio's</hi> that care for none of theſe things: but let men ſpeak but a word againſt the Parliament, let him but whiſtle againſt the Armie, and theſe verie men would break him in pieces like a potters veſſell.

Our anſwer therefore is this: Things without life or ſence are not capable of puniſhment or pain, and ſo their ſufferings no matter of pity, further then in relation to the owners or uſers of them; and therefore when nineteen truths of God are tranſcribed or collected out of the perfect Canon of the Scripture, on purpoſe to put off (with them) one damnable errour that is ſhuffled in among them, it is no matter of pity to puniſh the ſpirit of errour, and preſerve people from infection, by burning all that paper and ink (Gods truth for all that as a fountain abides and is not diminiſhed) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the good were ſeparated from the bad and preſerved, and the bad rejected; which may be done no way but by that of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſing, which we deſire in our <hi>Beacon fired.</hi> Your ſelves will grant, that a book containing nineteen parts of excellent Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or Policy, having but the twentieth part ſeditious and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable againſt the Parliament or Armie, ought to be burned and ſuppreſſed with a witneſs. If a great mans picture ſhould be drawn never ſo well in reſpect of all the parts of it, except onely one of the members, and that ſhould be ſo ugly, as to preſent that great man a verie deformed man, were it any pity to burn that picture? What madneſs were it to ſuffer the people of a Town to uſe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted water, while there is enough pure water in the common Town-well or Fountain? And if there were true weight and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in what you ſay of your twentieth part of Popery, it would prove it pity and folly to throw away a roaſted apple that hath a dram, or a whole gile of beer that hath a gallon of ſtrong poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in it.</p>
