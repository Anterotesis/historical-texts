            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>AMongst all the stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, tending to the undermining of Religion, and the subversion of the souls of men,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106517:4"/>
though there cannot be any more unreasonable, yet there was never any more unhappily successful, than the creating and fomenting an Opinion in the World, That Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is an enemy to Government, and the bringing Sincerity and Zeal in Religion into jealousie, and disgrace with the Civil Powers.</p>
                  <p>It was by this jealousie, blown into the heads of the High Priests, and the Sanhedrim amongst the Jews, and of <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> that Christ himself (the <hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> the <hi>Autbor and Finisher of our Faith</hi>) was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, condemned, and executed on a Tree. By this the Apostles were haled before the Governours of Provinces, forced from one City to flee unto another: for this they endured bonds, and imprisonment, and sundry kinds of death. It was
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106517:4"/>
through this fancy, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, for three hundred years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, endured the rage of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperours; <hi>being destitutel, afficted, and tormented.</hi> Our Lord Christ was traduced as <hi>an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Caesar,</hi> a man refractary to the Roman Laws, and a Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist to the Religion, and Laws of his Country. The Apostles were charged as disturbers of the publick peace, with <hi>turning the world upside down.</hi> The Primitive Christians were accounted enemies to the Commonwealth, adverse, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent to the Empire: and the Christian Religion it self was bruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and surmised to have something in it offensive, and dangerous to the Civil Government; as appears not only by the Edicts of Healthen Emperours, but also by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106517:5"/>
Martyr, Tertullian, Athenagoras, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither was it thus only of old, before the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Christian, but even since the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> down to our Fathers days, nay to our own, we shall find the Devil still managing the same pretence, carrying on the same Antichristian mystery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which began to work in the time of our Lord Christ, and his Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Those, that prosess to know the <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> and publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim themselves to the World to be qualified for Molders of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, and Dictatours to Princes, are the Writers of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; <hi>Machiavel</hi> abroad, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nearer home: some of these, pretending discoveries of things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to all our Fathers, if they be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106517:5"/>
strictly analysed, will be found to resolve their whole mystery into this one pretence, That Religion, in the height and exaltation of it, is prejudicial to Policy; and that, to be a thorow-paced, a sincere and zealous Christian, is to be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the State.</p>
                  <p>As the remedy for which evil, they have thought fit and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to enervate the Principles of all Religion so far, as to remove the Doctrine of Good and Evil, the Immortality of the Soul, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments of the World to come; that so Religion may appear wholly to derive from Policy.</p>
                  <p>How destructive these Doctrines are, not only to the souls of men, in reference to the World to come; but to the interests of this life, (the regular and secure acquisition and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106517:6"/>
enjoyment whereof, are entirely derived from the great and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Ordinance of Government) I am not now called to speak. But surely it cannot be unnecessary to endeavour to state this Question, to search into the grounds of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, to examine thorowly from whence all this clamour, these fears and jealousies; whence all this mighty scandal hath arisen.</p>
                  <p>The Gospel of our Saviour is not like the Alcoran, which hates the light, and abhors a strict exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Principles whereon it stands. When the Jews con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with our Saviour, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed his Doctrine, he desired to bring the matter in question to a rational decision, <hi>John</hi> x. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion there was, Whether he were the Son of God? And he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds them this fair <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Verse
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106517:6"/>
37. <hi>If I do the works of my Father, believe me: if I do not, believe me not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I verily, as a Minister of Christ, (though the meanest of ten thousand) am bold in the power, and through the evidence of the truth of the Gospel, to say, Let the Adversaries of Religion search and look; let them employ their Wit, their Industry, their Logick, if any thing can be found in the Principles of Christianity, prejudicial to the power of just and lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates: Nay moreover, if it be possible for Men or Angels to state the Rights of Civil Government upon clearer and firmer Principles, to secure them by more powerful Obligations, to urge them upon men by more efficacious Motives of Rewards and Punishments, than those are, which the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106517:7"/>
of Christianity do expresly propound: then let the Gospel, and the Ministers of it, endure all that contempt and obloquy which these men desire to cast upon them.</p>
                  <p>And for the Foundations of our Religion; there are those, that tell us, that Christianity is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Cephas,</hi> (<hi>which is,</hi> indeed, <hi>by interpretation a Stone</hi>) but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tells us, (<hi>Ephes.</hi> ii. 20.) that we <hi>are built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone:</hi> wherefore by these the present Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is to be decided.</p>
                  <p>If any men, at any time, taking upon them the sacred name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> have swerved from the Rule of their Profession, and (acting contrary to the Spirit of Christ) have made that holy Name to be blasphemed; it is reason that they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106517:7"/>
be esteemed the utter enemies of Christianity, and that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should bear their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but to charge their exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancies upon that Profession which they have prophaned and injured, is such an injustice, as cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with moral honesty, or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical ingenuity.</p>
                  <p>So then, <hi>hîc Rhodus, hîc saltus.</hi> As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 14, 17, 20.) concerning the Resurrection of Christ, <hi>If Christ be not risen, our preaching is vain, and your faith is vain: — but now is Christ risen:</hi> so I; If, within the compass of those Foundations, which I have mentioned, be found any colour or shadow of license for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whatsoever, upon any pretence whatsoever, to entrench upon the power of lawful Magistrates; if any warrant at all for open Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106517:8"/>
or privy Conspiracies; for murthering or deposing of Princes, or absolving Subjects from their Allegiance: then let <hi>Kings</hi> cease to be our <hi>Nursing Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> to be our <hi>Nursing Mothers;</hi> let <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid look to his own house;</hi> let the <hi>Light of our Eyes,</hi> the <hi>Breath of our Nostrils,</hi> the Restorer of Religion, the Defender of our Faith, look ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther first to defend himself. It will then be reasonable to expect, that the <hi>Kings of the earth</hi> should <hi>stand up,</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. ii. 2</note> 
                     <hi>the Rulers take counsel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether against the Lord, and against his Christ,</hi> that they should <hi>break their bonds in sunder, and cast their cords from them:</hi> then <hi>our Preaching is vain,</hi> and <hi>your Faith is vain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now indeed the case is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, and that evidently. What the Laws of men could never do with all their Temporal Rewards
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106517:8"/>
and Punishments, <hi>in that they are weak;</hi> that Christianity, in the true Spirit of it, performs, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most height that is conceiveable.</p>
                  <p>The Foundation of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Obedience, is deeply and firmly rooted in the Foundation of our Religion. And, if <hi>the Scripture cannot be broken,</hi> if it be true, that <hi>Heaven and Earth shall pass away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one jot of it shall pass away:</hi> it is as true, that the <hi>Ordinances of the Sun and Moon</hi> shall fail, before this Ordinance shall be dissolved. For if by the Principles of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we are obliged to believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Books of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, that they have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>holy men of God, who spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost,</hi> 2 Pet. i. 21. then the holy Ghost hath said, <hi>By me Kings reign,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> viii. 15. If Christ be the Son
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106517:9"/>
of God, the Son of God hath said, <hi>Render to Caesar the things which are Caesars,</hi> Mat. xxii. 21. If the Holy Spirit did overshadow <hi>Peter,</hi> and the rest of the Apostles; then <hi>Peter,</hi> overshadowed and filled with the Spirit, commands us in the Name of God to <hi>submit our selves to every Ordinance of man,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 13. If Saint <hi>Paul</hi> were called to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle by the miraculous appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Lord Christ after his Ascension, and was by him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately instructed in the pure and genuine spirit of Christianity; then Saint <hi>Paul's</hi> Theory concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Government is an authentick Christian Theory, whereby the Doctrines and practises of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are to be judged: and that Theory is delivered in the seven first Verses of this Chapter; <hi>Let every soul be subject to the higher Powers,</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:106517:9"/>
&amp;c. <hi>And they that resist, shall receive to themselves damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I call it a Christian Theory of Government, because it is a brief and comprehensive Scheme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all Questions concerning Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Government, may, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christian Principles, he resolved.</p>
                  <p>The whole discourse of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle consisteth of two general parts;</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That to oppose by force is to resist, it is so plain, that I need not speak to it. We meet both the words in that sence, <hi>James</hi> iv. 6,7. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="3">3. And lastly, it signifies oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition by Words, as well as by Deeds. So <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,</hi> and <hi>to resist,</hi> are the same, <hi>Luke</hi> xxi. 15. and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> is <hi>to contradict,</hi> Acts vi. 10.</p>
                  <p>The words then do clearly and plainly comprehend all manner of resistance or opposition.</p>
                  <p>This hitherto concerns the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position taken materially: if we reflect upon the form of it, there will be two things to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                  <p>First, That the Proposition is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite, and equipollent to an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal; <hi>They that resist,</hi> that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>every soul</hi> (as in the first
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106517:12"/>
Verse) that resists, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of persons.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Act of Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is set down likewise abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely without any restraint, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of any pretences or causes. whatsoever. So that the sence of the words resolved, and expounded by the Scriptures, is this; Every Soul, which upon any pretence whatsoever, in any manner what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, shall resist the lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that is over him, <hi>shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to himself damnation,</hi> that is, he puts himself thereby into a state of damnation.</p>
                  <p>This I conceive to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghost in the words of my Text. I must acknowledge, that two things have been question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Proposition by the men of this unhappy, viperous, and adulterous Generation.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:106517:13"/>I. The first is, Whether <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ought to be interpreted so severely, as to signifie eternal damnation.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Whether that, which is said concerning all persons and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, can be made good upon the Principles of Christianity.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. As to the former of these, I shall only say, that the Argument brought against this interpretation doth, in truth, exceedingly confirm it.</p>
                  <p>The Allegation is, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is used in Scripture for Temporal <note place="margin">Object.</note> Judgment. The place produced is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 29. <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, damnation to himself:</hi> where the Apostle seemeth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by the following words, Verse 30. <hi>For this cause many are weak and sickly, and many sleep;</hi> viz. by Temporal Judgments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:106517:13"/>
                     <note place="margin">Sol.</note>And indeed this is true; but these things likewise ought to be observed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the same penalty is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the Gospel to those, who <hi>resist Authority,</hi> and to those, that are <hi>guilty of the body of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. xi. 27. and <hi>trample upon the blood of the everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 29.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That neither <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> nor yet the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> were by their Temporal Judgments exempted from Eternal.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And lastly, That seeing the great difference betwixt the Legal and Evangelical dispensation did consist in this, that the express Promises and Threatnings, under the Law, were Temporal; and under the Gospel, Eternal: if God shall, under the Gospel, besides Eternal punishments due to every
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106517:14"/>
sin, add moreover to some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sins the threatnings of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Judgments, let these men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what advantage they have gotten, and what can more be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised to contribute to the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of such a sin. I shall say no more to the first Question, nor to that part of the Text, which concerns the damnation of Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters precisely considered: but shall apply my self to the resolution of the second.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is impossible in half an hour, to speak concerning all those pretences for resistance of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates; which, being raised by Satan, and made use of by the children of disobedience, are falsly charged upon Religion. I shall single out some of the chief of them, and examine them by <hi>the Law and the Testimony,</hi> by the Old
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106517:14"/>
and New Testament; adding to them, as occasion requires, the judgment and practise of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians; and afterwards make a brief Application.</p>
                  <p>Those, which have given the greatest scandal, as having troubled the Christian World, and almost turned it upside down, are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to the two Heads of Religion, and Civil Affairs.</p>
                  <p>First, Those which refer to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are such scandalous Tenets as these:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That Erroneous (suppose Heretical or Idolatrous) Powers may be resisted; especially if they endeavour to force men to their own Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That Christian Magistrates have no power in matters of Religion: <hi>viz.</hi> None</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:106517:15"/>1. In religious Causes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Over religious Persons.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>By Orders.</item>
                     <item>By personal Gifts.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Secondly, Those which refer to matters Civil, are reducible to such as these;</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Harsh Administration.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Pretences of Competition of Power; and the like.</p>
                  <p>Now I shall not be afraid or backward to acknowledge, that if any one of these Tenets be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Principles of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or to the practise of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and purest Christians, who are to be presumed to have known the mind of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; then we are to admit, that there is reason in what is alledged to create a Jealousie upon Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:106517:15"/>For, 1. If Erroneous, Heretical, or Idolatrous Magistrates may be resisted, (because they are so, or because they join oppression of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men unto their errour in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion) how can any Kingdom stand? These are matters wherein every man makes himself a Judge; and it is not material, whether he judge righteous or unrighteous judgment, the matter once stated <hi>in Thesi,</hi> that in such cases men may resist, the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is easily made, and men let loose to act according to their proper apprehensions, or the pretences of those, who have power with them.</p>
                  <p>What shall be done, when, at the same time, a Prince shall be judged by one part of his Subjects Heretical and prophane, for depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Superstition, and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his power from unjust Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106517:16"/>
over it; while another part shall judge him to be Superstitious, and will never believe him to abhor Idols, so long as he will not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sacrilege? What shall be done, while some conclude him to be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious, because he will not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Images; others Idolatrous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he kneels at the Communion? and both esteem him an Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour, because he restrains their Zeal, and hinders them from that excess of Riot, which they pant after, to the devouring of one another?</p>
                  <p>Supposing this Tenet to be true, it is indeed evident no Government can be. But now what colour can there be, to charge this Tenet upon Christianity? Doth the Old or New Testament give any occasion to this Doctrine? Is it counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced (1.) by <hi>Moses,</hi> or (2.) by the Prophets? or (3.) by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour?
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106517:16"/>
or (4.) by the Apostles? (5) That <hi>Cloud of Witnesses,</hi> (the Noble Army of Martyrs) did they give Testimony to this Assertion, or to the contrary? I may not insist: a word to each of these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Moses</hi> was so far from the Doctrine of Resistance, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the hardness of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's</hi> heart, the cruelty of the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, the weakness of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by Plagues, the numbers of <hi>Israel,</hi> six hundred thousand, and three thousand five hundred and fifty fighting men above twenty years old; besides the Tribe of <hi>Levi:</hi> yet he would not lead them into the promised Land without <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's</hi> positive and express consent to their departure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for the Prophets; in the third Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> we find three of Gods Children put to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106517:17"/>
trial (the fiery trial) of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later, and a Tyrant, acting highly under both those Capacities toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They were cast into the fiery Furnace, because they would not worship the Golden Image which he had set up. And in the sixth, we find <hi>Daniel</hi> thrown into the Lions Den, only for praying to the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> Let us consider their Behaviour, did they resist, or mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, or labour to alienate, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, or (by denouncing threats or terrours) to discourage Subjects from Obedience? How had they been instructed by their Prophets? <hi>Jeremy</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxxvi. 13.) had taught them, that <hi>Zedekiah</hi> had turned from the Lord God of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> in rebelling against <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> who had <hi>made him swear by God:</hi> and that they ought to <hi>seek
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106517:17"/>
the peace of the City whither they were carried Captives, and to pray unto the Lord for it,</hi> Jer. xxix. 7. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the three Children in the third of <hi>Daniel</hi> only refer themselves to God for deliverance; and <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the midst of the Lions Den, prays heartily for <hi>Darius, O King, live for ever!</hi> Dan. vi. 21.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the next place, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the case of Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and see whether any such Tenet may be collected from their Doctrine or Practice, their Speeches or their Actions. As for what concerns our Lord Christ, I have had the Honour formerly in this place more at large to vindicate him from such aspersions. He paid Tribute at the expence of a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, <hi>Mat.</hi> xvii. 27. He submitted himself to all the Powers that were over him; to the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106517:18"/>
their Delegates, to <hi>Herod,</hi> to <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate:</hi> he submitted himself to death by an unjust sentence, even to the bitter and accursed death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross, <hi>Philip.</hi> ii. 8. This was his Practise: as for his Doctrine; He taught men to <hi>render to Caesar the things that were Caesars,</hi> Mat. xxii. 21. He acknowledged <hi>Pilate's power</hi> to be <hi>from above,</hi> John xix. 11. He rebuked <hi>Peter</hi> for smiting with the Sword; and told him, that <hi>Those that take the Sword, shall perish by the Sword,</hi> Mat. xxvi. 52. He taught his Difciples to <hi>pray for</hi> them <hi>which</hi> should <hi>persecure</hi> them, <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 44. And the utmost permission which he gave them, was, when they were <hi>persecuted in one City, to flee unto another,</hi> Matth x. 23.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As for the Apostles: They taught men to <hi>obey them that have the rule over them,</hi> Hebr. xiii. 17.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106517:18"/>
                     <hi>To submit themselves to every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 13. <hi>To do all things without murmuring or dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> Philip. ii. 14. <hi>To pray for Kings, and all that are in Authority,</hi> 1 Tim. ii. 2. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath told us, that such as <hi>despise Dominion,</hi> and <hi>speak evil of Dignities,</hi> are (in an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner) <hi>reserved to Judgment,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 9, 10. and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in my Text, that <hi>they shall receive dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Doctrine they Sealed with their blood. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> (according to Ecclesiastical Tradition) was crucified, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> beheaded, <hi>James</hi> the Son of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> slain with the Sword, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now, as for the Powers, to which all these Instructions and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours did refer, they were for Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and Tyranny, and Persecution, <hi>Humani generis portenta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:106517:19"/>If it be objected, That all these <note place="margin">Obj.</note> submitted, because thev were not able to resist: the Answer, upon Christian Principles, might be; <note place="margin">Sol.</note> That He, which restrained the Flames, and <hi>stopped the mouths of Lions,</hi> could have given his Servants power to resist; that Christ could have <hi>prayed his Father,</hi> who would <hi>have given him more than twelve Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 26. 53.</note> 
                     <hi>of Angels</hi> for his relief; that the Apostles, who wrought migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty signs and wonders, could have rescued themselves: had it not rather pleased the great Ordainer of Powers, by their submission, to ratifie and establish the Doctrine of Obedience.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But the belief, and practise of the Primitive Christians will satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this Objection even to common Sense and Reason.</p>
                  <p>The Instances in this kind are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106517:19"/>
where Christians, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in numbers, being in Arms, and abundantly able to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, have chosen, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their lives, to yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Idolaters, persecuting them for their Religion. I shall name but two Examples.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Apolog. § 37.</note> tells the Emperour, that his <hi>Cities, Islands, Castles, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Armies, Regiments,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies;</hi> the <hi>Palace,</hi> the <hi>Senate,</hi> the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Judicature were filled with Christians:</hi> and yet they submitted to persecution.</p>
                  <p>And we read that the <hi>Thebean</hi> Legion consisted of six thousand, six hundred, sixty and six persons, every man Christian, when they submitted to the Decimation of <hi>Maximinian</hi> for Religion.</p>
                  <p>I shall say no more to the first Pretence.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:106517:20"/>II. Now the second is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, alike prejudical to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; alike false, and scandalous to Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An House, or Kingdom divided</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. xii. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>cannot stand:</hi> and <hi>God is not the Author of Confusion, but of Peace;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. xiv. 33.</note> and that especially in Religion. If none have this power to order mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, there must be Confusion: if any other beside the Supreme Magistrate, there will be Division. The inevitable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of the exemption of religious Things, and religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, from the power of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, are abundantly set forth by such, as would improve them to the disadvantage of Religion. And, indeed, to go about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or to diminish the dismal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of such Pretences, were to endeavour to put out the eyes of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106517:20"/>
all the men of Reason, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in the world.</p>
                  <p>My present Duty is to enquire, what relation these Pretences have to the Principles of Christianity; and that</p>
                  <p>First, As to religious Causes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As to Ecclesiastical Persons.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As to holy, or gifted Brethren; as they style them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>Now, in order to a resolution in these Enquiries, I shall (as a Lemma) humbly propose one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>
                  <p>It is this, That, whereas there are two things, whereon all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical administration doth depend: 1. Concerning the Rights, and Bounds, and regulation of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Powers; 2. Concerning the Duties, and Obedience of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106517:21"/>
we find both Christ, and the Apostles, frequently labouring to settle in the Consciences of men that part, which concerns Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; but no where restraining, or limiting, or particularly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Office of Sovereign Powers; but leaving them to those general Rules, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Account and Duty of all men in their several stations, and to the terms, whereupon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God was wont to set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Princes, and Governours of the World. Let the rights of <hi>Caesar</hi> be what they will (in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Tribute, or other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) Christ will not determine them: This he will; those things, which belong to <hi>Caesar</hi> (according to <hi>Jus Gentium</hi>) must be rendered to him. He doth not examine <hi>Pilate's</hi> power, in case of Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106517:21"/>
or Treason; but acknowledges it, and submits. He falls not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sifting, or examining the power of the <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> either their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal power, or the power left them by the Romans: <hi>They sit in Moses Chair,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whatsoever therefore they bid you do, do it,</hi> Matth. xxiii. 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>And so likewise the Apostles, they seem to be unconcerned (as it were) in the governing part of Civil Policy. No word is found in all their Writings, enquiring into the Rights of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours (who were sovereign) or limiting the Exercise of their Power. Only thus much they take for certain, such, as they were, they were ordained of God. And they spend all their labour in founding deeply, and firmly establishing that other part, which concerns Obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:106517:22"/>From this Observation it will follow, That whatever Things, or Persons were not before the times of Christ, and his Apostles, exempt from the power of the Magistrate, are not by the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and Principles of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity exempted. (<hi>Non eripit mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia, qui regna dat coelestia.</hi>) And it will only remain for us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what was the manner of the Nations of the World, and of God's peculiar people, in reference to these Particulars, before, and at the times of Christ, and his Apostles. To which if we shall add the practice of the best, and most ancient Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, I know not what more can be desired to clear the present Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                  <p>I suppose it needless to put in a Caution, that while we speak
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106517:22"/>
of the Magistrate's power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der matters of Religion; we do not entitle him to the Priest's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice (the Spiritual Function) or the Execution of it, in preaching the word, administring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, exercising the power of Ordination, or of the Keys, &amp;c. Blessed be the Lord God of our Fathers, who hath put it into our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign's heart to be tender of the rights of the Church, as of the Apple of his Eye.</p>
                  <p>This is a Calumny insisted on generally by almost all our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, but it is too rude, and gross, to be spoken to in this place. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let us see whether the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns among all people, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, Jews, Christians, have not claimed, and exercised power in all Causes, over all Persons, as well Ecclesiastical, as Civil.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:106517:23"/>1. For Causes. The New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament sometimes divides the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles <note place="margin">Rom. i. 14.</note> into Greeks, and Barbarians; sometimes into wise, and unwise: according to which division the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans are, I suppose, reckoned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Greeks, from whence they were mostly extracted, and with whom they contended in Civility. Briefly, 1. the Greeks, 2. the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, 3. the Barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did always exercise such a power.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the greatest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Greeks, tells us, that <note place="margin">Polit. lib 7 cap. 8.</note> the first, and principal thing in a Common Wealth is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. And, accordingly, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the Fragments, which are left us, of the Laws of the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Grecian Common-Wealths, we shall find nothing so frequent, as the Ordinances concerning their Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:106517:23"/>2. Amongst the Romans, <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> (the wisest) saith, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is the Foundation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society; as in truth it is. To say nothing of the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Numa,</hi> the <hi>Jus Pontificium</hi> &amp;c. the Titles of the Twelve Tables are many of them concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) As for the Barbarous Nations, I shall not multiply Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, nor go beyond the line of Scripture. In the third of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> we find an Edict of the King of Babylon enjoyning all <hi>People, Languages, and Tongues</hi> to commit Idolatry; <hi>Vers.</hi> 4. 5. And, by and by, another Edict, that <hi>no man should speak amiss of the God of Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drach, Mesech, and Abednego</hi> Vers. 29. In the sixth we find <hi>Darius</hi> (the Persian) by the advice of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil signing a Decree, against <hi>peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106517:24"/>
(for thirty days) any God besides himself;</hi> Verse 9. and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly another, that <hi>all men should trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and fear before the God of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel;</hi> Verse 26. In the third of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> the King of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and his Nobles proclaim a publick Fast. In the first of <hi>Ezra, Cyrus</hi> puts forth an Edict to build the Temple at <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> In the fourth, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> reverseth it. In the sixth <hi>Darius</hi> re-inforceth it.</p>
                  <p>I suppose it is now evident, that Greeks, and Barbarians did exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise this power.</p>
                  <p>To think to elevate the force of these Instances, because all these were <hi>Strangers from God,</hi> and <hi>aliens from the Common-Wealth of Israel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes, ii. 12.</note> is to mistake the purpose for which they are alledged.</p>
                  <p>However, it was not thus among
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106517:24"/>
the Kings of the Nations only, but among the holiest, and wisest of the Governours, and Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Juda;</hi> who for abolishing false Worship, and ordaining the true, are often high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended by the Holy Ghost in the Scriptures. The time would fail me to speak distinctly, and particularly, of the Ordinances concerning Religion, which were made by <hi>Moses, Joshua, David Solomon, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, Manasses</hi> also, and <hi>Josiah:</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom the Scripture gives these Characters. <hi>Moses</hi> was <hi>the</hi>

                  <p>Now the Acts of every one of these concerning the Worship of God, and matters of Religion are recorded, and applauded in the Scriptures. For these all ordered, and regulated Services, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Covenants with God; they erected Altars and Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, and Temples, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated them unto the Lord; they destroyed Idolatry, reformed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses in Gods Worship, settled both the standing Worship of God, and occasional Thanks-giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Humiliations: to omit other matters.</p>
                  <p>The whole <hi>Aaronical</hi> Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which consisted in ceremonies, and Sacrifices, Typical, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

                  <p>The Tabernacle, and Temple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service (which, beside the Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Institutions, consisted of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual abiding Ordinances) was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by <hi>David:</hi> who, being <hi>the sweet Singer of Israel,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted more then ever any man (for ought appears) with the ways, and helps of listing up the Heart to spiritual intercourse with God, to that end appointed the use of Musick in the Church; and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of stinting the Spirit) he prescribed Set-forms of Praise, and Prayers for the use of the Temple; and ordered the service for every day. A Psalm, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partly of the one hundred and fifth, ninety sixth, and one

we find also <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Josiah,</hi>

                  <p>Thus stood the matter under the Law; the ordering of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion was not exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the. Supreme Power. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> varied from <hi>Moses</hi> his Law, and was blameless. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it otherwise in the best, and purest Times under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
                  <p>It had been but a slender invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the Emperours to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Christian; if, by submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Christianity, they must lose so considerable a part of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power enjoyed by all their Predecessours, and be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by exposed inevitably to Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Rebellions, upon every Frantick eruption of religious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. The primitive Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106517:27"/>
understood themselves other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and so did the Christians under them. I may not stand to recite the <hi>Annals</hi> of the Church.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Constantine</hi> had not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for the composing of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie, what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come either of Government, or Religion?</p>
                  <p>The drawing up of Canons for the regulation of Religion was by our Lord committed to the Apostles, and their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, the Bishops, and other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Persons: but, that these Canons should be enforced as Laws by temporal Penalties it, was by sanction of Civil powers.</p>
                  <p>In the second Oecumenical Council, the Fathers, assembled at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> beseech <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi> the Elder to ratifie the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of that Synod.</p>

                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:106517:27"/>Thus we find <hi>Justinian</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing <note place="margin">Novel.

                     </gap>, to be kept as Laws. Briefly, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine this Question, we need only to view the Titles of the sixteenth Book of the <hi>Code</hi> of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> the thirteen first Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in the <hi>Code</hi> os <hi>Justinian, Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius's</hi> Nomo-Canon, and the like.</p>
                  <p>The Pretence of exemption of Ecclesiastical Causes, so as hath been intimated, as it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Government; so it is also with the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thus much having been spoken concerning the regulation
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106517:28"/>
of Matters of Religion, it will be needless to enlarge concerning the second Pretence of the exemption of Ecclesiastical Persons.</p>
                  <p>This Tenet is equally dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous with the former, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the Principles of Christianity. It were to be wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that all men professing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Ministers were thorowly convinced of the Doctrine of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: otherwise, as they grow popular, they become dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. <hi>Sacerdotum quidam eo sunt ingenio, ut, ni pareant, territent.</hi> And Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> commenting upon <hi>every Soul, &amp;c.</hi> saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Both the Apostle, the Evangelist, and the Propher. Our Saviour was both Priest, and Prophet; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were Ecclesiastical persons: yet did not think themselves exempted.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106517:28"/>
Such persons were not exempted, either before, or after the Times of our Saviour; neither in <note place="margin"> Kings ii.</note> a Single, or <note place="margin">7. Ibid. 35.</note> Joynt capacity. <hi>From the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to Single persons under the Law, we find an Instance of the Exercise of the Sovereign power over an High-Priest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, in <hi>Abiathar,</hi> whom <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon thrust out,</hi> and placed <hi>Zadoc</hi> in his room.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to the calling of Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; before the Gospel-times, it did belong to the Supreme Magistrate. We find <hi>Moses,</hi> not <hi>Aaron; Joshuah,</hi> not <hi>Eleazar; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> not <hi>Abiathar; Solomon,</hi> not <hi>Zadoc;</hi> summoning the Priests, and Levites, to meet together. And</p>
                  <p>In the Primitive Times of the Christian Emperours, we do not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106517:29"/>
meet with Councils, or Synods called by the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor with Ministers, casting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into Classical, and Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Meetings; nor with As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of Divines, called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, or without the Prince's consent.</p>
                  <p>The indiction of Times, and Places, the convocation of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the Presidency, the order of Debates, the dismission of the Assemblies, the roboration of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons (as to making them Laws of the Empire) in the General, and provincial Councils, were all the work of the Supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. And</p>
                  <p>As for matters of Appeal, we find <hi>Paul</hi> appealing to <hi>Caesar: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius</hi> (from the Synod at <hi>Tyre</hi>) to <hi>Constantine;</hi> to whom three Appeals were likewise made
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106517:29"/>
in the Cause of <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> and <hi>Donatus:</hi> and many more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of this, and the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I should now dismiss this Head concerning Religion, did there not remain one Pretence more, and that so wild, and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, that it looks as if it were the last effort of the enemy of man-kind (<hi>ultimus Diaboli cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>) for it strikes at the Heart both of Government, and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It is this, that Saints, and gifted Persons, (as they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) are exempt from humane Laws: and in effect resolves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, that to reprobate others, and assume to themselves the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Godly Party, to talk of Reformation, and the Power of Godliness, of advancing the Kingdom of Jesus Christ &amp;c.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106517:30"/>
is to justifie Sacriledge and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and horrid Rebellion, and to qualify them for the Kings, and Priests, and Prophets of the world.</p>
                  <p>How far this Satanical mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hath prevailed, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of all things Civil, and Sacred; to the scandal of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the planting, and watering of Atheism, and Infidelity; I tremble to call to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
                  <p>If my present business were to refute the men, that have given this ofsence, how easie were it to examine their Gifts, and their Saintship, and how hard to find them. But as the woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> said to our Saviour, <hi>Art thou greater than our Father Jacob?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. iv. 12.</note> are they greater Saints, or better gifted, then <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106517:30"/>
the rest of the Apostles? He, that said, <hi>Let every Soul be subject to</hi>

                     <hi>the higher Powers,</hi> had been <hi>wrap'd up (whether in the body, or out,</hi> he <note place="margin">2 Cor. xii. 2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>could not tell) to the third heavens:</hi> hath any of them been carried higher?</p>

                  <p>But my present purpose being chiefly to remove these scandals from Religion; come, and let us reason together, What could Christ, and his Apostles have done more to prevent this scandal, then they have done? Their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and practice hath been already shewn; and the Danger, and Heinousness of the Sin of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106517:31"/>
Resistance (in all the kinds, and degrees of it) discovered; neither can any thing more be imagined, which might be desired to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate, and obviate this pretence, unless it be, that these things should have been particularly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, and the Persons (at least their Party and Sect) described; that the world might be forewarned of them.</p>
                  <p>Will it then satisfy the enemies of our Religion, . concerning the Truth, and Infallibility of the Scriptures, and the abhorrency of the Christian Principle from this damnable Tenet; if it shall briefly appear, that these things have been punctually foretold by Christ and his Apostles?</p>
                  <p>Christ hath given warning of <hi>grievous Wolves in Sheep's cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>

                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:106517:31"/>More particularly Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us, that <hi>in the last days perilous times should come</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now, if all this be not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, Saint <hi>Jude</hi> hath taken up this Prophesie of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and given us two clear Characters of these Persons, whereby they might be known. He tells us, <hi rend="sup">1.</hi> That they shall be Separatists from the Church, and <hi rend="sup">2.</hi> false-pretenders to the Spirit. <hi>These are they, which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate</hi>

                     <hi>themselves, being sensual, having not the spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall say no more to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106517:32"/>
relating to that Head which concerns the matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Neither shalll I enlarge upon that other Head referring to matters Civil, where I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced in two Pretences taken from,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Harsh Administration in the Magistrate.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Competition as to power in Subjects.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Neither the Time, nor the Design, which I have propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor (indeed) my Profession nor Abilities do allow me to enter into the depths of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, or to discourse of the limitations of Sovereign Powers. Thus much is obvious to every man.</p>
                  <p>That there is no Cruelty so great as laxness of Government,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106517:32"/>
nor any Tyrany in the World like the rage of Subjects let loose; and that <hi>the little Finger</hi> of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness <hi>is harder then the Loyns</hi> of the severest Laws, and strictest Government.</p>
                  <p>I shall briefly shew, that the Scripture, foreleeing the easiness (by reason of the Self-love, and partiality of men) of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and the danger of it, hath directly opposed it self against it.</p>
                  <p>I shall not mention particular Commands: let us have recourse to the main Foundations; the Body, and Substance of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, the MISHPATHAME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEK (the <hi>Jus Regium</hi>) the Fundamental Law of the Kings of <hi>Israel.</hi>

God, and that the Gospel is from God: but that all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Ministery of Christ, and his Apostles, were ordered by his Providence. Why then were the times of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula,</hi> and <hi>Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> (out of the Series of the Time spun out from the Creation) chosen, and selected for the promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Doctrine of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If harsh Administration of Power will exempt men from Obedience; at that time, when <hi>Claudius,</hi> or <hi>Nero</hi> was <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, why should the Holy Ghost move Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to write to the <hi>Romans, They that resist, shall receive to themselves Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> So much briefly for the Gospel.</p>

which two Instances (if the time would bear it) would take in the Substance of all, that may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in this kind.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is (I conceive) impossible to carry the first sort of Pretences higher, then they were stated in the Case of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Saul. Saul</hi> was at first declared, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted King by <hi>Samuel,</hi> acting in the Name of the Lord: and, when he had reigned two years, the same <hi>Samuel,</hi> in the Name of the same God, before the same people, denounces publickly, that his Kingdom should not continue; <note place="margin">1 Sam. xiii. 14.</note> and that God had sought <hi>a man after his own heart,</hi> because he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the Priests Office. After this, he limits a certain day, he tells him, <hi>This day the Lord bath rent</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Chap. xv. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>the Kingdom of Israel from thee, and given it to thy neighbour,</hi> because of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106517:36"/>
his rebellion against God in the Case of <hi>Amalek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The pretence of Failour, and Forfeiture can go no higher. Now for the pretences of <hi>David</hi> to step into his Government, and wrest it from him: He was anointed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> for ought appears, <note place="margin">Chap. xvi. 13.</note> without reservation for the life of <hi>Saul.</hi> He was qualified for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; <hi>a valiant man, a man</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. Vers. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>of War, prudent in matters, a comely Person, and the Lord was with him.</hi> He had received Testimony from God of his Election: the Spirit of God departed from <hi>Saul,</hi> and rested upon him. He had power in his hand, he was <hi>set</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Chap. xviii. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>over the men of War, accepted by all the people</hi> all <hi>Israel,</hi> nd <hi>Judah</hi> loved him. After all this, you know his Provocations, his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and his Behaviour; he
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106517:36"/>
durst not <hi>touch the Lords anointed;</hi> and, when another pretended to have done it at <hi>Saul's</hi> entreaty <hi>in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremis,</hi> he revenged his death, and lamented over him, <hi>Ye mountains</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. i. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>of Gilboa,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But that other Pretence, that after a lawful Sovereign is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished (according to the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of my Text, and my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) the power still remains in the people, (in the diffused body of them, or their Representatives) to alter the Government, as they please; it is in respect of Policy, and Government, what the Sin against the Holy Ghost is to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it destroys the foundations of the peace, and safety of men, and makes that to be the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of man, which is the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. How much God abhorred this Pretence, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106517:37"/>
in the Case of <hi>Corah,</hi> and his company. When God sent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to bring the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he sanctifyed him, and put his Name upon him; <hi>Thou shalt</hi>

                     <hi>be to him instead of God:</hi> and when he had brought them forth, he <note place="margin">Acts vii. 35.</note> made him a Prince and a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver over them. <note place="margin">Deut. xxxi i. 4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The supreme Power was in <hi>Moses,</hi> who called to his assistance a Senate, or Parliament, (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) consisting of the Heads of the Tribes of Israel. In this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Nature soon began to work, <note place="margin">Num. xvi.</note> some <hi>envied Moses, whom God had</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. cvi. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>chosen, and Aaron the Saint of the Lord. Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Eliab,</hi> Heads of Families, in the Tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> thought both the Civil Power, and (if that must be transferred, from the first-born, to one Tribe) the Priesthood also was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106517:37"/>
due to them, being Eldest Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Eldest Tribe. <hi>Korah,</hi> an eminent man amongst the <hi>Levites,</hi> was offended, that the High-Priests Office went beside him, and was settled upon <hi>Aaron,</hi> and his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>These were their secret griefs; for a redress whereof they make a party in the Parliament, they gain to them two hundred and fifty men, <hi>famous in the Parliament, men of renown;</hi> and, in order to their ambitious Designs, they remonstrate against <hi>Moses,</hi> Vers. 13. and their Declaration was this Pretence, which we are upon; that <hi>all the Congregation</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> were <hi>Holy,</hi> and that <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> had <hi>lifted up themselves above them;</hi> that is, that their power was a contrivance of themselves, not an Ordinance of God; that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106517:38"/>
what God had done to settle the Civil, and Ecclesiastical power, it remained still in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or their Representatives assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together. Now the Scripture tells us, that, since the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, God was never more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked, then upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; <hi>when he heard this, he was wrath, and greatly abhorred them;</hi> he invented <hi>a new thing</hi> in the world for their sakes; for the <hi>Earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered</hi>

                  <p>I have now done with these Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and my endeavour hath <note place="margin">Application.</note> been to vindicate Religion from the charges of unbelieving Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, and indeed to shew, that it is not a Spirit of carnal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, but the true, and genuine Spirit of Christianity, which runs through the Doctrine, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106517:38"/>
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> After what hath been spoken, I hope, I may presume to say with the Apostle, <hi>Do we now make void</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. iii. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>the Laws through Faith? yea, we establish the Laws.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have seen the Christian Theory; doth the Philosophical Theory provide better for the safety of Princes, and the estabishment of Government?</p>
                  <p>It tells us in effect, that Might is Right; that every thing is just, or unjust; good, or evil accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the pleasure of the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Force, whom we are to obey till a stronger then he cometh, or we be able to go through with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</p>
                  <p>That, in reference to this life, Obedience is a matter of Wit, and Prudence, and after life there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for us no Concernments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:106517:39"/>How stramineous is this The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory compared with the Christian Theory, which speaks in this wise, <hi>Let every Soul be subject to the higher Powers,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
                  <p>That this is the genuine Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Theory, hath in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure been demonstrated; so that indeed it may be wondered from whence these Prejudices have ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen.</p>
                  <p>But alas! that <hi>my head were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters!</hi> They have one grand Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, to which having spoken I shall conclude.</p>
                  <p>If this be the Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, how comes it to pass, that those, who pretend the highest to Religion, and profess themselves the onely Christians, (the Bigot, and Jesuited Romanist; the fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and transported Reformist) have been authors of the most
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106517:39"/>
horrible Treasons, and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
                  <p>On the one hand, what mean the Catholick Leagues? On the other, the Solemn League, and Covenant, forced upon Subjects, <hi>renitente Principe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On one hand <hi>what means</hi> (shall I say <hi>the lowing of the Oxen,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) the roaring of the Bulls, the thundring of Excommunications, the absolving Subjects from their Allegiance, the Actual Murthers of Princes, the attempts for blowing up King, Lords, and Commons at one clap? What is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the noise of the Bells, of the claps of Squibs, and Fire-works, which we hear? On the other hand what was the meaning of that black, and terrible dispensation, which will cause the ears of all Posterity to tingle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:106517:40"/>It is but a little while since the anointed of the Lord, the holiest, the wisest, the best of Kings, was taken in the snares of men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to reformation, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to the fury of men pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed by <hi>an evil Spirit from the Lord.</hi> He was <hi>offered as a Lamb that is dumb,</hi> or rather like the Lamb of God, to the rage of wild fanatical Enthufiasts.</p>
                  <p>It is but a very little while, since the Lamentation of <hi>Jeremy</hi> was in the mouth of all the faithful in the Land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Kings, and our Princes were amongst the Gentiles</hi> (provoked to <note place="margin">Lam. ii. 9.</note> serve other Gods) <hi>the Law was no more, the Prophets also received no vision from the Lord.</hi> And all these things were brought to pass by men pretending wonders in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:106517:40"/>And they would know the reason of all these Dispensations. But who art thou, O man! who pressest into the secret of Gods Pavilion? <hi>How unsearchable are his Judgments, and his ways past finding out; such knowledge is too wonderful, we cannot attain unto it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be, these things have been done, that the Sayings of our Saviour might be fulfilled, <hi>It cannot be but offences will come but wo be to them, by whom they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matth. xviii. 7. Ibid. Verse 6.</note> 
                     <hi>come;</hi> and, <hi>It were better, that a milstone,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It may be, the Gunpowder-Treason was permitted to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, that the disappointment might be had in everlasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and celebrated, as it is this day: <hi>Son of man, write the name of the day, even of this same</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. xxiv. 2.</note>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:106517:41"/>
                     <hi>day: the King of Babylon set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against Jerusalem this same day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be, God fuffered the late Rebellion to prevail, that he might not <hi>leave himself without witness,</hi> but shew forth his wonders in our days, in the miraculous restitution of our gracious Sovereign, and the Church. If he had not been driven out, how could he have been restored? <hi>not by might, nor by power, but by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be, this was done, that we might say no more, <hi>The Lord liveth, which delivered us</hi> from the Treason of pretended Catholicks: but <hi>The Lord liveth which hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi> us from the Tyranny, and blood rage of the wild Fanatical Enthusiasts.</p>
                  <p>Surely, all these things have been permitted, that the <hi>Stone which,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106517:41"/>
the Builders refused,</hi> might be made <hi>tried and precious,</hi> and that his Patience, his Piety, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy in Religion, his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Magnanimity being mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to all the World, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient <hi>desire of all Nations,</hi> he might become the <hi>head of the Corner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Surely, these things were suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that the Faith, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Loyalty of the Church of <hi>England</hi> might be made bright and glorious by the Flames of Persecution: and that in the day, when God shall have given our most Gracious Sovereign the hearts, or necks of all his Enemies, it may not repent him of the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he hath shewn to Religion, and Government, in lifting out of the dust the despised Head of that only Church, (for ought I
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106517:42"/>
know) which makes Obedience without base restrictions, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations, an Article of its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, these things, it may be, have been permitted, that by the Triumph of this day, and by the vengeance lately executed in the sight of this Sun, the Atheistical world might be convinced, that <hi>the Powers, that be, are ordained of God,</hi> and that, <hi>though the wicked do evil an hundred times, and God prolong their days;</hi> yet <hi>Vengeance is his, and he will repay it,</hi> and <hi>They that resist, shall receive to themselves Damnation.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>IN the verse preceding it is said concerning the Scriptures of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, that <hi>they are able to make a man wise unto salvation, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> (the Faith) is often by a Metonymy taken for the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106517:44"/>
which is the Object of the Faith of Christians. We read often <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 23. 3. 25.</note> of the <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Hearing of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 6.</note>

                     <hi>to the Saints</hi> (in the preaching of Christ, and the Writings of his Evangelists and Apostles) and so I conceive it is to be taken in this place. So that the meaning of the whole is this, The Old Testament understood and expounded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Analogy of the New, is able to make a man wise. And the Pen-men of the Canonical Books of the Old Testament (wherein <hi>Timothy</hi> had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) and of the Books of the New Testament (which except those of St. <hi>John</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant before the writing of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle) were inspired and directed by the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:106517:44"/>The words of the Text are an entire Proposition, asserting the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Canon of Scripture; and my endeavour shall be at this time to prove the truth of that Proposition. Wherein, that I may proceed with all plainness and clearness, I shall premise two words by way of
<list>
                        <item>Petition,</item>
                        <item>Precaution.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. By way of Petition, I suppose and take for granted;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The great principle of the power of God, and his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in governing the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That our Body of Canonical Books of the Old Testament, is the same with that which was in Use in the time of Christ and his Apostles, And our body of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the same which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently received in the Church.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106517:45"/>
So that what shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of those, is applicable to the Original Scripture used in our time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That those Books of New Testament whose Authors were not anciently question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were written by those Authors whose name they bear. And that those few others which were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times questioned by some particular Churches, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Universally receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, contain in them no one point of Faith or Manners diffentient from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of those Books which were never questioned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By way of Precaution and Admonition I must intreat you to take notice, that I shall not now meddle with the Controversies
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106517:45"/>
concerning Apocrypha, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations, <hi>Keri</hi> and <hi>Chetib,</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew points, various Lections, dubious Authors or parts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>But my endeavour at this time shall be to Assert the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the body and substance of the Original Books of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And this not in the way of common place, but in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Examination or Refutation of the most dangerous Opinions of the Antiscripturists, which are these:</p>

                  <p n="4">IV. Such as deny the truth of the Relation of matters of Fact in the New Testament, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence reject the whole Body of Scripture. Of these as briefly and plainly as I can.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The first Opinion is of those, who pretending to believe the Truth of the New Testament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Divine Authority of the Old Testament. The <hi>Severians,</hi> and the <hi>Manichees, Basilides,</hi> and <hi>Carpocrates</hi> of old: The <hi>Catabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> of later times, some <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, Antinomians,</hi> and other Fanatical Sectaries amongst our selves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:106517:46"/>In opposition to these, I shall shew, that supposing the truth of the New Testament, the Divine Authority of the Old Testament is to be acknowledged: Because the Divine Authority of the Old Testament is asserted by Christ and his Evangelists and Apostles in the New.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Next to the Redemption of the world, the great business which Christ had to do upon Earth, was to Convince men that he was the Messias, and so to assert his Legislative Authority. And the great Argument which he used for the conviction of the world was this.</p>
                  <p>All the Marks and the entire Character of the Messiah, and of his Actions and Passions, were prefigured and foretold by <hi>the Law and the Prophets, and the Psalms,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 24. 44</note>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:106517:47"/>
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Volume of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>And all things foretold or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured concerning the Messiah, were accomplished by himself.</p>
                  <p>So that though the great Works of Christ, and the purity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Doctrine, and of his Life, were of themselves suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to justifie the Introduction of his Law into the World, yet he was pleased to resolve (as it were) his own Authority into the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to make use of those other manifestations of himself, in a co-ordination with that principle.</p>
                  <p>And therefore we find him still pressing the <hi>Jews</hi> with this, that if they did believe the Writings of <hi>Moses,</hi> and their other Scriptures, they must of necessity believe him also.</p>

                  <p>In all his disputations with the Pharisees and Sadduces, the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and the Scribes, he makes his appeal to the Scriptures of the Old Testament. And lest any one should think that in all this he did only argue <hi>ad homines</hi> (that dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the Jews he only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded upon their own Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis) we find him in the course of his Ministration positively affert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106517:48"/>
that the Scriptures <hi>must be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled;</hi>

                  <p>And after his Resurrection he made a real demonstration that the Old Testament was given by inspiration of God; for on the day of his Resurrection, falling into company of two of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, going to <hi>Emmaus: He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at Moses and all the Prophets,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk 24. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>and expounded to them in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the things concerning himself.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And afterward when the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were come together, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation of this his method,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106517:48"/>
and that he might instruct his Disciples in it, he said unto them, <hi>These were the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Verse 44.</note> 
                     <hi>that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psams</hi> (in the Volume of the Old Testament) <hi>concerning me. He opened their understandings, and said, thus it is written, and thus it behoved:</hi> And as a short Idea of what they were to do, he tells them, and <hi>ye are Witnesses of these things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In pursuance of this method we find the Evangelists very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and very frequent in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the accomplishment of the predictions of the Old Testament, reciting sometimes the speeches of Christ, saying, that he did such, or such a thing, to the end that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106517:49"/>
the Scriptures might be fulfilled: <hi>I will not eat of the fruit of the Vine till all things be fulfilled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes in their own Persons observing the accomplishment of particulars, and noting either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular portions of Scriptures which were fulfilled, or the fulfilling of the Scriptures cited at large, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any particular Quotation. Thus the Evangelists writing of the Conception, Nativity, Name <note place="margin">Mat. 1 22.</note> of Christ, of his coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> dwelling at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration <note place="margin">Mat. 2. 15.

                  <p n="3">3. Lastly, the Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Old Testament is assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apostles: Whom we find every where in their Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, citing the Testimonies of the Law and the Prophets, and <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.

                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, the Apostles follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the way and method which their Master taught them; they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted that the Gospel was <hi>promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prophets, witnessed by</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, lest any place should be left for doubting concerning any part of the Old. Testament, the Apostles have expresly assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning the <hi>Law,</hi> that it <hi>is</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the sense of the New Testament concerning the Old Testament; supposing therefore the Truth of the New Testament, the Divine Authority of the Old Testament is to be acknowledged, contrary to the first Opinion of the Antiscripturists.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Second Antiscriptural Opinion is of those who pretend to believe the Truth, but they deny or doubt the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the New Testament, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106517:51"/>
of the whole body of the New Testament, or at least of that part which delivers the Speeches and Writings of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Of this sort there are said to be many, who by the power and influence of their Education are restrained from denying or dis-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Truth of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and yet through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity of corrupt conversation are fallen from that Veneration which is due to writings supposed to be of Divine Authority.</p>
                  <p>For the History of the New Testament they have the same respect which they have for <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> or <hi>Sallust,</hi> or some such other History; for the Mystery of the Gospel, the same which they have for some part of <hi>Plato,</hi> or rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical parts, the same which they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106517:51"/>
have for some parts of <hi>Cicero</hi> or <hi>Seneca,</hi> or <hi>Epictetus.</hi> All which writings they believe to be true, but no man believes them to be Divine. And some there are who pretend a great veneration for the speeches of Christ, but have a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er esteem for the words, and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>In opposition to these opinions, I shall shew, that supposing the words of Christ and the Apostles to be True, it will follow, that they are to be esteemed to be of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority.</p>
                  <p>Because Christ and the Apostles did profess and declare, that what they delivered to the world, was of Divine Authority.</p>
                  <p>And because our Lord Christ did undertake not only for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but for the Inspiration of his Apostles also.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:106517:52"/>1. In the examination of the next Opinion, I shall be obliged to lay before you some of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Divine Authority in Christ and his Apostles, here it is sufficient to produce their assertions of it.</p>
                  <p>The time of our Lord Christs ministration (betwixt three and four years) was spent in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and working, and his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was often questioned.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Luke 20. 1.</hi> and in the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel <note place="margin">Matth. 21. 23. Mar. 11. 27.</note> places, <hi>While he was in the Temple teaching the People, and preaching the the Gospel, the Chief Priests and the Scribes and the Elders came upon him, saying, tell us by what Authority thou dost these things</hi> (preachest to the people,) <hi>and who gave thee that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Knowing the perverseness of their minds, he was not pleased
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106517:52"/>
to gratifie them at that time with a direct answer, but confounded them with a question concerning the Baptism of <hi>John.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But at other times, upon other occasions, we find the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his teaching abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared and asserted by him.</p>

                  <p>Thus did our Saviour afsert the Divine Authority of his Words.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And so likewise the Apostles are very frequent in asserting the Divine Authority of the things which they delivered.</p>

                  <p>Of these there have always been too great a number, not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, who under a form of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity deny the power thereof, but generally all forts of Hereticks.

                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:106517:56"/>In Opposition to these I shall endeavour to demonstrate, that, Supposing Matters of Fact to be truly related in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is unreasonable to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the truth of any of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines delivered by Christ or his Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Amongst the various fancies concerning Religion, wherewith the whole world hath been always embroiled: Two things there are wherein all the Sons of Adam have agreed; namely, 1. That that is to be believed which hath received the testimony of God. And 2. That this Testimony is to be gathered from instances of supernatural Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power.</p>
                  <p>In the study of natural and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Theology, the <hi>Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivi</hi> amongst the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and other Nations, sought

after wisdom, (Reason, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.) But, to reduce the People to the forms of religious Rites and Sacrifices prescribed them, they were made to believe the Epiphanies of the Gods, and the manifestations of their Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Power, by Oracles and Works supernatural.</p>
                  <p>To these even <hi>Mahomet</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though his great Argument was from the Sword: and of the Jews I need not speak.</p>
                  <p>For a Foundation of Religion, and in our inquisition after that, short of this Testimony we ought not to stay; further we cannot go: And herein is the utmost of humane wisdom to consider well those Evidences upon which we adventure the interest of our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

                  <p>In the 4. of the <hi>Acts</hi> we find all the Apostles praying <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> that God would <hi>stretch forth his hand to heal, and that signs and wonders might be done by the Name of his holy Child Jesus. And immediately
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106517:62"/>
the place was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Gost, and with Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The particular Miracles of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons are recorded. In one word, they went and preached every where the Doctrines which are written in the Gospel; the <hi>Lord working with them, and confirming</hi>

                     <hi>tbeir words by mighty signs and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and gifts of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>This is the state of the matter of Fact, as it is propounded in the New Testament: I conclude therefore, that, supposing matters of Fact to be truly delivered in the New Testament, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to doubt of the Doctrines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by Christ or his Apostles, relating to faith or manners. And I come to the consideration of the last and extream Opinion of the Antiscripturists.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:106517:63"/>IV. The last opinion, is of those who deny the truth of the Relation of matters of Fact delivered in the New Testament, and in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence reject the whole body of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>I could wish there were no such as these, and that what I have yet to say were altogether needless for that reason.</p>
                  <p>But what mean then the publick Rumors which we hear? and whence is an Opinion gone into the world, that some great Philosophers and men of generous reason are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied concerning the truth of Scripture, and believe the Authority of it to be wholy derived from the Magistrate?</p>
                  <p>In reference to these I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Briefly, to shew that the ground upon which these Wisemen
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106517:63"/>
and Philosophers reject the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is contrary to the Reason of mankind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To evince, that the belief of the Divine Authority of the Scriptures is most agreeable to Reason.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for the Argument and ground of those (amongst us Christians) that reject the body of the Scriptures, I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to have heard of other than this.</p>
                  <p>They have often called upon Believers, Pastors perhaps, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in the Church, for a clear and undeniable evidence of the truth of the story of the Gospel, and they have not afforded it: therefore they conclude, the Scriptures are to be rejected.</p>
                  <p>But is this the reasoning of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wits? and men of mighty
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106517:64"/>
deeds in disputation, of men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the depths of reason and Philosophy?</p>
                  <p>To give a man a clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable evidence of any thing, there are but two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince either his Senses or his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; the former where of is to be done by experiment, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by demonstration.</p>
                  <p>Would they have now an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment whether such or such a thing were done 16 or 17 hundred years ago? Would they have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of particulars, in their nature indifferent to be done or not to be done, depending upon the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Causes?</p>
                  <p>Well were it for the world, if these <hi>Beaux Esprits</hi> would have the patience, and endure the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue of acquainting themselves with the ways of knowledge (Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106517:64"/>
and demonstration) it would not then be troubled with the dangerous impertinency of such Pretenders</p>
                  <p>Then these men would not call for Experiment in a subject unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it, and (being instructed that demonstration is only of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Propositions <hi>in materia ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaria,</hi> whose contrary Positions imply a contradiction) they would know, that to demand this kind of evidence of the truth of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Gospel, is to be absurdly injudicious, and to act contrary to the Reason of mankind.</p>
                  <p>For seeing we may not with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility suppose this principle to be advanced only for the destruction of Religion, and the ruine (or at least undeniable hazard) of the Souls of men; We ought to believe that these Philosophers intend this
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106517:65"/>
as a General Maxim; that (in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at least of moment) <hi rend="margQuotes">men ought not to adventure to act, but upon clear and undeniable evidence,</hi> and (speaking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) that <hi rend="margQuotes">wise men ought to believe nothing at all.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us suppose this for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral principle, and consider what will follow.</p>
                  <p>Setting aside the knowledge of the Affections of a few Lines and Numbers, is not all learning to be cast away? Must not the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil world of mankind be brought to swift confusion? must not man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind it self, in a few days <unclear>come</unclear> to an end?</p>
                  <p>Suppose a subject should not yield his Obedience, or a Tenant his Rent, till Titles be made out by Experiment or demonstation. Suppose the husbandman and the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106517:65"/>
Merchant, the Artificer, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, the Banker, and the Judge <note place="margin">Arist. polit. l. 7. c. 8.</note> should not adventure, but stay for the assurance of Experiment or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, would not the whole world be confounded?</p>
                  <p>Suppose men should not marry, nor take Physick, nor eat or drink till they should have clear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable evidence, that all these things are what they suppose, and shall succeed according to expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would not mankind quickly be spent, and brought to an end?</p>
                  <p>If the management of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane concernments, Political, Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomical, Personal, proceed upon the grounds of Belief and Hope, and rational (but not demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive) inference. If neither these Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers (if they would consider) nor any other Person, either ever did, or possibly could, perform any
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106517:66"/>
one action, upon such evidence, as these men require concerning the truth of the ftories of the Scripture; then to reject them for want of such evidence, is repugnant to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of mankind.</p>
                  <p>I proceed therefore to my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond assertion, that the Belief of the Divine Authority of the Scriptures is most agreable to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>That the Divine Authority of all the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, are undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably concluded from supposition of the truth of the Relation or Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of matters of fact in the New Testament, I have already shewn. And that the rejection of all History is against the Reason of mankind is evident, because all mankind receive some History or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: wherefore I shall briefly shew,</p>

any advantage above that of the New Testament.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the credibility of the Object, and Cognoscibility of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>The History that we speak of, pretends to no intrigues or Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listick Counsels, or Myisteries of State, but conteins it self within the limits of things Visible and Audible, things that were done or

                  <p n="2">2. As for Knowledge in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverers, I shall shew it by a brief Induction.</p>
                  <p>The whole New Testament consists of the Books of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Epistles, Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and the Gospels.</p>
                  <p>The Authors of the Epistles and the Revelation, in the Narrative parts of them, deliver the things done or spoken to or by themselves, and could not be ignorant of their own experiences.</p>
                  <p>The Book of the Acts contains some things done by or to the rest of the Apostles, but chiefly the concernments of <hi>Paul;</hi> and it was written by <hi>Luke,</hi> who was an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Companion of <hi>Paul,</hi> and intimately conversant with the rest of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:106517:68"/>For the things Related in the Gospel of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> he saith they were delivered to him by those who from the beginning were <hi>Eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> of the works, <hi>and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Word,</hi> and his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agrees with the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists.</p>
                  <p>The Gospel of St. <hi>Mark</hi> hath nothing which is not in St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> or St. <hi>John,</hi> and was dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Head of the Apostles.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Soon after this he was Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned and Beheaded by <hi>Herod,</hi> for reprehending him about <hi>Herodias,</hi> all which were matters of Fact, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easie, if false, to have been refuted.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Christ, his birth is stated to have been at a time the most remarkable that ever was, when the whole world was taxed by <hi>Augustus,</hi> in the days of <hi>Herod,</hi> when <hi>Cyrenius</hi> was Governour of <hi>Syria;</hi> the place easie to be enquired of, it was in a Manger, in an Inn, <note place="margin">Mat. 4. 6.</note> in a Town that was a little one <note place="margin">Mic. 5. 2.</note> among the thousands of <hi>Juda,</hi> easie to be examined.</p>
                  <p>When he was about 30 years old, he was Baptized of <hi>John,</hi> and <note place="margin">Luk. 3. 23.</note> within a few days after he called his Apostles; and in less than four yeears space he performed all his mighty Works, whereof I shall
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106517:72"/>
mention only some few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee</hi> he turned Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Wine, at a Wedding, where <note place="margin">Joh. 2. 1. 11. Mat. 9. 18.</note> was much company. He raised the Daughter of <hi>Jayrus,</hi> the Ruler of the Synagogue, there was but <note place="margin">Mat. 8. 6.</note> one in that place, she was his only Daughter, and about twelve years Old. He healed the Servant <note place="margin">Luk. 7. 2.</note> of that Centurion that had built a Synagogue. Can any thing be more particular?</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Bethany,</hi> fifteen Furlongs from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> a few days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Joh 11. 18.</note> his death, he raised <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> after he had been dead four days. Could any thing be more examinable?</p>
                  <p>His death was at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> at the time of the Passover, a time of greatest annual concourse in the world, and then it is said, that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106517:72"/>
the Sun was darkened, the Veil rent, the Rocks torn in pieces, the Graves opened. Can any thing be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futable than these things, if they had been false?</p>
                  <p>So likewise for the Apostles. The healing of <hi>AEneas</hi> at <hi>Lydda,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Act 9. 33. 40. 10. 1.</note> raising of <hi>Dorcas</hi> at <hi>Joppe,</hi> the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages with <hi>Cornelius</hi> Captain of the Band called the <hi>Italian</hi> Band at <hi>Caesarea,</hi> and many other acts of <hi>Peter.</hi> The increpation of <hi>Barje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">13. 6.</note> at <hi>Paphos,</hi> in the presence of <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> the Governour. The healing of a Cripple at <hi>Lystra,</hi> in <note place="margin">14. 13.</note> the presence of the Priest of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> besides many other acts of Paul, and the rest of the Apostles, are so cirumstantiated in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, that if false they might have been very easily contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>But besides all these, this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106517:73"/>
contains a Narration of things done and said, not only by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons well affected but by <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and the Roman Governours, by the Pharisees, the Scribes, the High Priests, and the <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> all of them Enemies both to the Historians and the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story; and if any of these things had had been convicted of falshood, would not the credit of the whole Gospel have (at once) been utterly overthrown?</p>
                  <p>I conclude therefore, that in respect of internal Arguments for belief, no History hath, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can have any advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the History of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for External Arguments, I can but name them. Though the whole world interessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against the story (so exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106517:73"/>
as you have heard) though the Books were extant, while the memory of things was recent, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> within seven years, <hi>Mark</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in eleven, <hi>Luke</hi> about twenty four, <hi>post mortem Christi;</hi> the Epistles of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> within thirty years, all the rest <hi>intra unius hominis aetatem,</hi> yet no man could ever convince them of falshood.</p>
                  <p>The stories were received by men of the greatest Wisdom, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and vertue amongst the Greeks and Latines. Many of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est passages were attested and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by Enemies and Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>

                  <p>In respect of all these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, internal and external, I might have justly said, that the History of the Gospel hath the advantage of any other History; but seeing there are some particulars where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the advantages are super emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, I shall speak a little of that distinctly by it self, and so conclude.</p>

conquer, not by the Spirit of the Sword, but by the Sword of the Spirit; the powers of the Earth, and the gates of Hell could not withstand it; it drove the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil away with all his Temples, Idols, Oracles, Priests, Sacrifices, Services, like lightning: So fell the Dragon, the old Serpent that deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the World, he was cast out with all his train.</p>

                  <p>For the Gospel like Leaven or Fire from Heaven, seised upon all that stood before it; it leaven'd Cities, Islands, Castles, Councils, Camps, the Tribes and Decuries, <note place="margin">Tert. Ap. 37.</note> the Palaces, Senate, Pleading-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>It took possession of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Wise, the greatest and noblest Wits of the Eastern and Western Nations: It raised up Philosophers to confound the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and noble Orators to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Rhetorick wherewith it was opposed.</p>
                  <p>Against <hi>Celsus</hi> it excited <hi>Origen,</hi> against <hi>Porphyrie Apollinarius,</hi> and <hi>Methodius;</hi> against <hi>Porphyrie</hi> and <hi>Hierocles, Lactantius</hi> and <hi>Eusebius</hi> (besides what was written <hi>sparsim
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106517:81"/>
Jerom, Augustine, Cyril, &amp;c.)</hi> It set up <hi>Chrysostom</hi> against <hi>Libanius, Prudentius</hi> against <hi>Symmachus</hi> and the Rhetoricians.</p>
                  <p>And as it spread it self large and high, so where it took possession, it took a deep possession, <hi>Quantum vertice—tantum radice:</hi> Those that received it truly, received it in the love thereof, it took possession of their hearts: It penetrated their spirits, and took its lodging in the inmost recesses of the soul. The Contents of these Books was their most precious Pearl, and they hid it in their heart. The Books them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were their greatest worldly treasure, and rather than they would deliver them to be burned, they chose to suffer the loss of Honour, Liberty, Estate, Wives, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nay even Life it self. When <hi>Di oclefian</hi> required the Scriptures that
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106517:81"/>
they might be burned, In one Province (<hi>Egypt</hi>) in one Month 17000 persons chose rather to dye than to deliver them: In compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison <note place="margin">Eus. l. 8. c. 3.</note> of these they counted not their lives dear to them; the love of them was stronger than Death, many waters could not quench it, neither could the flouds drown it. This was <hi>Testimonium Rei,</hi> and an advantage above all other Histories, or Writings in the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Moreover they had <hi>Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium Dei.</hi> Indeed all that is already spoken is an evidence of a Divine assistance: But more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God gave Testimony to these Books, by</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Their operation upon Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His co-operation with Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them.</p>

                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:106517:82"/>1. The Gospel which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein, was the power of God to every true Believer. That which no Institution in Philosophy, nor Initiation in the Mysteries of any <note place="margin">Vide Orig. C. Ceis. l. 3.</note> of the Gods, was ever able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish, that was every where atchieved by the belief of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, in a moment. Like a charm from Heaven, it stilled the passions, and mortified the lusts of men. What a Beadroll doth <hi>Paul</hi> reckon up in the <hi>Corinthans: But ye are</hi>

                  <p>Notwithstanding all the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies thrown upon Believers, and the <note place="margin">Lact. de fals. sap. l. 3. c 26.</note> prejudice wherewith they were loaded, the unpropitious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucting world were forcibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the Believers of these
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106517:82"/>
Books were effectually taught to <hi>deny ungodliness and worldly lusts,</hi> and <hi>to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world:</hi> through the cloud of ignominy wherewith they were encompassed, their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency broke forth as the light,</hi> and their <hi>just dealing as the noon day;</hi> the piety, loyalty, justice, charity, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, patience, meekness, and purity of believers of these Books, convinced the unbelieving world, that <hi>God was in them of a truth:</hi> for they <hi>taught as having Authority</hi> and Power, and <hi>not as</hi> the writings of other <hi>Scribes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But beside the operation of these Books upon the Believers, God was pleased to give testimony to them by his co-operation with them in signs and wonders, and mighty deeds.</p>
                  <p>The History of the Gospel tells
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106517:83"/>
us, that when Christ was even now leaving the world, he left this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy to believers for confirmation of the truth of the Gospel; <hi>These signs</hi> (said he) <hi>shall follow them that believe; In my name they shall cast</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now that this was made good, and that these signs (so long as there was need) were continued among Believers, we have as good assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as we can have of any thing beyond our own memory or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
                  <p>They have been delivered to us by a Cloud of Witnesses; by men of the greatest Wisdom and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Generations, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of such Integrity, that they
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106517:83"/>
laid down their lives in testimony of their veracity; delivered not by hear-say, but upon their certain knowledge; delivered in their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations with, and apologies to the Adversaries of Christianity, with a challenge to the examination of the truth, or a conviction of the falshood of them.

                  <p>Other Histories and Writings, and the Authors and Believers of them canpretend no higher than to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of men, these have the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God also: <hi>If we believe the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater.</hi> I conclude therefore; that there is greater Reason to believe the History of the New Testament than any other History in the world.</p>
                  <p>The sum of all is this, The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Scriptures is the great fundamental and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive Principle of Christianity, which being admitted it stands, and being removed it presently falls to the ground.</p>
                  <p>Against this therefore the great
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106517:85"/>
Enemy of Religion in these later days (under pretence of Reason and Philosophy) directs his Forces, and is said to have found a success very pernicious and deplorable.</p>
                  <p>I humbly conceive that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the belief of the Divine Authority of the Scriptures into the Decrees of Popes, or Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Councils with those who call themselves Roman-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, into private impulses and dictates of the Spirit with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasts, and into the Laws and Edicts of Princes and Magistrates with our new pretenders to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Philosophy, is that engine whereby the Devil hath prevailed to scandalize the world, and cast it into Antiscriptural infidelity.</p>
                  <p>It is for this cause that I have conceived it requisite (after many others who have done worthily)
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106517:85"/>
to have recourse (once more) to the Original Reason of things, and <note place="margin">Vide Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los. Essay.</note> the common grounds whereupon mankind doth proceed in matters of this nature.</p>
                  <p>Where (hoping that I have es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the absurdity of begging the matter in Question, discoursing in a circle, and the inconveniences of some other methods) I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to demonstrate: That sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the truth of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both 1. The Old Testament, and 2. The New Testament are to be received as of Divine Authority.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And supposing matters of fact to be truly related, the Doctrinal parts are to be believed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For the Historical Relation of matters of fact, that there is no ground to dis-believe it.</p>
                  <p>That for the reception of it, it hath 1. All the advantages
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106517:86"/>
whereof an History is capable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Far greater advantages than any other History.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I conclude, that <hi>All the Scriptures</hi> (i. e.) the Canonical Books of the Old Testament and the Books of the New Testament) <hi>were Given by inspiration of God. Quod erat demonstrandum.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I Shall not spend time in a disputation concerning the Author of this Epistle, <hi>viz.</hi> whether it were <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Barnabas,</hi> or <hi>Luke,</hi> or <hi>Clemens,</hi>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:106517:88"/>
or <hi>Apollos,</hi> &amp;c. but shall with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> suppose St. <hi>Paul</hi> to have been the Author of it.</p>
                  <p>If the Author of it be not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly known this ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from its Authority.</p>
                  <p>Most of the other Epistles have been acknowledged to be of divine Authority, because they were known to have proceeded from Apostolical writers.</p>
                  <p>This (on the contrary) hath been concluded to be an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Epistle, <hi>propter <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> Characterem,</hi> by reason of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Apostolical Spirit, which to those who have had their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses exercised, hath manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in it.</p>
                  <p>If it were lawful (in this sense) to <hi>compare spiritual things with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual;</hi> I should not fear to affirm,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:106517:88"/>
that this Epistle hath in it some pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar advantages, compared with some other of the Epistles. (Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, I mean, of usefulness, not of Authority, seeing all of them issued from the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.)</p>
                  <p>The design of it is General, Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, Comprehensive, not Private, Circumstantial, Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal: And it hath peculiarly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the Church two great treasures. 1. A Compleat Model, or Systeme, of Christian Divinity. And 2. the way of that Analogy, and manner of ratiocination where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the true Spirit, and meaning of the Types and Prophesies of the Old Testament is to be found out and applied.</p>
                  <p>It was directed to the Hebrews; That is, to those of the Jewish Nation, who had received the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106517:89"/>
and made a profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. And the main Scope and design of it, is to preserve the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of Christianity from Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy and Infidelity.</p>
                  <p>The means used to this purpose are partly Didactical, and partly Protreptical; Demonstrating the truths of the Gospel, and then urging the professors of those truths, to be stedfast in the faith, and to beware of Infidelity.</p>
                  <p>The Method here used is a mixt method of Doctrine and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; Dogmatical truths and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical Exhortations continually interwoven.</p>
                  <p>He begins with the Great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our faith. Christ is the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chap. </seg>1</label> Son of God, the brightness of his glory; better then the Angels. Wherefore <hi>if the Word spoken by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels was stedfast, how shall we es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape</hi>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:106517:89"/>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chap. </seg>2</label> 
                     <hi>if we neglect so great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the Comparison of Christ <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">chap. </seg>3</label> with <hi>Moses</hi> he concludes against Hardness of heart and Infidelity.</p>
                  <p>He demonstrates the Priesthood <note place="margin">5. 6. 7. 8.</note> of Christ to be more Excellent then that of <hi>Aaron;</hi> and in the midst of his argument, he falls into an Application, or Corollary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the dreadful Condition of them that fall away.</p>
                  <p>This is his design, and method throughout the Epistle; What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Doctrine he is upon, this is still the drift and aim of all his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, namely to preserve the Professors of Christianity from Apostacy and Infidelity.</p>
                  <p>The words, which I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, are a Reiteration or Reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Application, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary, arising from the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106517:90"/>
of the Excellency of Christ above <hi>Moses. Moses was faithful in the house as a Servant; Christ as a Son, over his own house. This bouse are we, if we hold fast our faith.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:106517:92"/>In speaking of the Evil of Infidelity, I shall not discourse at large, but confine my self to an enquiry into two pretences, (Which having been broached in the late times of Infidelity towards the King, are said to have operated ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far towards a general Apostacy from the faith, and the production of Infidelity towards God) both which appealing to the tenor of the Scriptures, must be examined by them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is of a famous Author, and it is this, That the Scriptures do not make Infidelity to be a Sin, at the time of the delivery of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second is of a Writer more <note place="margin">2. C. W.</note> obscure, but in it self, so agreeable to the disposition of the present ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that it hath possessed the minds of many; it is this, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:106517:93"/>Although Infidelity (according to the Scriptures) in the times of Christ and his Apostles, were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and inexcusable; yet in our times, it is excusable. These are the pretences to be examined.</p>
                  <p>The Substance of the Gospel, as it immediately relates to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian duty, is summarily reduced to the Doctrines and Injunctions of our Lord Christ, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</p>
                  <p>The Author of Leviathan (cap. 42. pag 286.) tells us in plain terms, that <q>We do not read any where (in the Scriptures) that they which received not the Doctrine of Christ, did therein Sin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again, that <q>the Injunctions of Christ, and his Apostles, men might refuse without sin.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now concerning this assertion, I cannot chuse but say, that had I
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:106517:93"/>
not been acquainted with the works of that Author, (especially those relating to religion) I should exceedingly wonder at it, because it supposes men never to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Bibles, which is the thing it would perswade.</p>
                  <p>In the 21. of <hi>Matth.</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 42</note> askes the Jews this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Did ye never read in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> such a thing? a question which I must repeat to the Assertors of this doctrine. Did they never read in the Scriptures the Sinfulness, the Danger, the Heinousness of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity? Surely he that runs may read it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our Saviour Christ before his death, did oftentimes vehemently rebuke his Disciples, for Infidelity, <hi>O</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 9. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I endure you? (Quousque tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem abutemini patientiâ nostrâ:)</hi> And
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106517:94"/>
after his Resurrection, he calls them <hi>fools and slow of heart,</hi> for unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: <note place="margin">Ch. 24. 25.</note> Did they never read these Increpations?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Author of this Epistle, and the rest of the Apostles, do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where vehemently and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly dehort from Unbelief. Did they never read these Dehortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the 8 of <hi>John,</hi> Christ tells the Jews, that if they <hi>believe not,</hi> they <note place="margin">Joh. 8. 24. 3. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>shall dye in their Sins.</hi> That <hi>the wrath of God abideth on them,</hi> that <hi>he that believeth not, is damned already.</hi> Did they never read these Denunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
                  <p>Yes! these last, it seems, this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had read, and as his manner is, thinking he could accomodate an answer to these, he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced securely of all the rest: To these he saith that they import
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106517:94"/>
only a non-remission of the sins committed against the Laws of their Countrey; (that they should dye in them;) but that they do not evince any sinfulness to be in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity; Wherefore I must crave licence to proceed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Apostle in the 21 of the Revelations, gives a Catalogue of <note place="margin">4. Rev. 21. 8.</note> such sinners as are of the highest rank, Such as are most abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the eyes of God, Such as are to have their <hi>portion in that lake which burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi> and he puts <hi>Unbelievers</hi> in the head of this Regiment; <hi>The fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fut, and Unbelievers, and Abominable, and Murtherers, and Whoremongers, and Sorcerers, and Lyars shall have their portion in that lake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be, perhaps, that the Scripture doth not in plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press <note place="margin">Obj. 1.</note> terms, affirm Infidelity to be Sinful!</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is true that the Spirit of God in the Scriptures, doth not usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly descend to Logical accuracy, to the <hi>quatenus,</hi> or Causality, to the observation of the rules of <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The first verse of this Epistle (to the Hebrews) tells us what powerful and noble motives to believe, God had afforded to the Fathers.</p>
                  <p>God himself was pleased to speak to them, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, at sundry times, and in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                  <p>In the times of the Patriarchs, Judges, Kings, and Prophets, by the ways of Visions, Dreams, Voices, Similitudes, Urim, and by divers miracles and wonders.</p>
                  <p>So likewise, for those that are here exhorted; About the time of the Writing of this Epistle, God had spoken to them by his Son (the brightness of his Glory, the image of his person) And by the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:106517:99"/>
Apostles, to whom also he bare Witness, by mighty signs and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>Now that such men as these, who had so great advantages to bring them to believe, should be severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished for Infidelity, I am perswaded there is hardly any man but thinks it very just and reasonable.</p>
                  <p>That such as had seen the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of God, in <hi>Egypt</hi> and the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, so manifestly miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, so often repeated, and yet for all this would not believe, that their Carcasses should fall in the Wilderness.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> who had known the miracles which had been done by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, should think to Cousen the Apostles: it deserved the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:106517:99"/>
Judgment that befel them.</p>
                  <p>As for our selves had we lived in times of Miracles or Prophesies, we doubt not but we should have. believed. Or, as <hi>Philip</hi> said, shew us the father, and it sufficeth. Could we but once see a miracle, or talk with one returning from the dead; it should suffice, we would believe.</p>
                  <p>But seeing it is now many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years, since these things are ceased, and we have nothing left us, <hi>Praeter miraculorum famam;</hi> If we shall not believe the Gospel; by some it is openly pretended, and by many it is secretly imagined, that, in this case we may be Excused.</p>
                  <p>I could wish that the time would serve, clearly to rid away this phantasm; In order to it, I shall briefly doe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:106517:100"/>1. Shew that this Phantastical imagination is no new inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that it hath of old, been the conceit of abominable Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>2ly.</hi> I shall inquire a little into the grounds of this Conceit, and shew the mistake of those sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, into which it is resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>3ly.</hi> I shall shew, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour (Knowing the thoughts of men) hath taken particular care to prevent this Imagination; and hath clearly decided the matter in Question.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though the present age be fruitful in inventions tending this way, yet this hath been Anticipated by the Wits of former times</p>
                  <p>In the 11 of <hi>Luke 47.</hi> We find <note place="margin">Luc. 11. 47.</note> the Scribes and Pharises, <hi>building the Sepulchres of the Prophets, whom
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:106517:100"/>
their fathers had killed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we would know, what they pretended, in so doing, we shall <note place="margin">Matth. 23. 30.</note> find it in the parallel place of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew. They said, if we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them, in the blood of the Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That these men, did not believe the Prophets, it is manifest; Christ tells them, <hi>if they had believed the Prophets, they would have believed him; for they wrote of him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that they would have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prophets, (and not have murthered them) had they lived in their times, this they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and it is very probable they had that opinion.</p>
                  <p>Yes Verily! had they lived in the days of Miracles and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, they would have believed, the very conceit which is now Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:106517:101"/>But the Truth is, these men were abominable Hypocrites, and the cause of their Unbelief, was not the want of miracles and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, but Carnal prejudice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and the Vile affections of their hearts. Did not Christ work miracles? Was not he that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet which was to come? Yet they took him, and with wicked hands they slew him, and brought upon themselves the bloud of all the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>But 2<hi>ly.</hi> If we shall examine the bottom of this fancy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve it into its Principles, we shall find that it supposes these things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the want of the sight of miracles, is sufficient to Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie unbelief.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That to live in the very age of miracles, is apter to create be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:106517:101"/>
then to be born and educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in a believing nation, after the world hath been convinced by the miracles of former times (which is our Case.)</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the bare sight of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, is of it self alone, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to create belief, in every person that should see them.</p>
                  <p>Of which suppositions, the first is contrary to common Reason, and the two later are contrary to Scriptural Reason, and to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the world</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the want of the sight of miracles were enough to justifie Infidelity, then for every <hi>Dogma</hi> to be believed, Every Individual person, were to expect the sight of miracles; which if it should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, the wonder should cease, and miracles become no miracles, by the frequency of the performances of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:106517:102"/>
them, and so they would be inept to create belief.</p>
                  <p>Every work of nature, is in it self a miracle; Who would not think it easier to recover a man, (who had all his parts and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours already formed,) from the dead, then from that liquid prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple whereof <hi>Job</hi> speakes, to raise up <hi>flesh and skin, bones and sinews:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 10.</note> to advance an understanding crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, capable of adoring or blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the maker of him? Yet that is a miracle, and this is none, only through the rarity of one, and frequency of the other.</p>
                  <p>Again, if every one were to see miracles, the merit of faith would <note place="margin">Ic. 20. 29.</note> be taken away. <q>Jesus said unto Thomas, because thou hast seen—thou hast believed, Blessed are they that have not seen, yet they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</q> This for the first supposition.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:106517:102"/>2. The second is this, that to live in the very age of miracles, is apter to create a belief, then to live in a believing nation a good time after the times of Miracles.</p>
                  <p>But, contrary to this, we have instances both in Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. After near 4000 years, how pertinaciously do the Jews adhere to <hi>Moses,</hi> against whom their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Murmured, and rebelled, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the sight of all his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; and when he had wrought that great miracle upon <hi>Corah</hi> and for his rebellion, the next day they rebelled again.</p>
                  <p>And we find now all the whole world, (especially the wiser part) Converted to Christianity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Apostles complain of the paucity of professors, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity of the Jews, in the Age of Christ and his Apostles, was so
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:106517:103"/>
great and resolute that it hath a fatal operation upon that nation unto this day.</p>
                  <p>I am sensible, that in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of later ages with the days of miracles, I may be thought <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and to advance a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, where that I may not lean on my own understanding, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you to consider our Saviours decision of the Question which we have in hand.</p>
                  <p>I suppose, I may take it for granted, that the condition of the Jews in our Saviours time, was in respect of <hi>Moses,</hi> the same (as to the matter in Question) with our Condition in respect of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The tradition of the law, was accompanyed with mighty Signs and wonders. And so likewise the tradition of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:106517:103"/>In the times succeeding <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> God for a Season continued the sensible manifestation of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, by miracles. So he did likewise in the times succeeding Christ.</p>
                  <p>But before the time of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour both miracles and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies had a long time ceased. <hi>We</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 74. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>see not our Tokens</hi> (saith the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist) <hi>there is not one Prophet left;</hi> as it is with us at this day.</p>
                  <p>Onely, they had the books of <hi>Moses</hi> and the prophets, Just so Conveighed and propounded to them, as our scriptures have been to us.</p>
                  <p>So that, if the Question be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed concerning those Jews; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the present miracles of Christ, or the complexion of Motives which they had, to induce them to believe the writings of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:106517:104"/>
were apter to create belief, It is the same with our Question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the living in the time of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, or our Motives; are more powerful to believing. To deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which Question; we may observe; That the Apostles after the sight of all our Saviours mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, continued in unbelief, till he had opened unto them the Scriptures, of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. That after many miracles, he refers the Jews to the searching of the Scriptures; (bringing them <hi>à notiori ad ignotius.</hi>) And in the 5 of <hi>John</hi> and the 47. he decides this Question by another <q>If ye  do not believe the writings of <hi>Moses</hi> how shall yet believe my Words?<note place="margin">John 5. 47.</note>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much concerning the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond supposition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third is this, that the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106517:104"/>
sight of miracles, is of it self alone, sufficient to bring every person to believing.</p>
                  <p>We ought indeed to own it, to the eternal glory of our blessed Redeemer, that the Faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians is founded upon his Miracles as well as on his Doctrine, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. And he himself tells the Jews, that <hi>if he had not done</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles <hi>they should not bave had sin (i e.</hi> the sin of Infidelity.) But <note place="margin">Joh. 15. 24.</note> Now to dream of miracles, and hanker after them; or to think to Excuse our Infidelity, for <unclear>want</unclear> of the sight of them, (as if <unclear>that</unclear> alone would certainly make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers of us all,) it argues that we have been sloathful readers of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>It hapned to our Saviours mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles as it did to his Preaching; according to his parable of the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:106517:105"/>
sower. Some of them lighted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hearts that were honest and good, and brought forth the fruit of believing. Others fell by the way side, or upon stony places, or among the Thorns.</p>
                  <p>The prepossession of their minds, by an expectation of a temporal Messiah, in the Rulers; The fear of persecution by them, in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; The Cares of the World, and deceitfulness of riches; The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and and lusts, to which the Austerities of the Gospel-rules, were opposite; and many other preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, deeply rooted in the hearts of a perverse and froward Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prevailed against the sight of miracles; and none were more pervers and resolute unbelievers; then some of those, who had the Advantage of this great argument for believing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:106517:105"/>If the sight of Miracles alone, were sufficient to produce belief, in all kinds of Spectators, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Scribes and Pharisees, (who by their learning were able to Judge of a miracle,) the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen and Kinsmen of Christ (with whom he was most Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,) should have been most Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in believing.</p>
                  <p>But behold the inchantment of prejudice and Carnal Interest! In <note place="margin">Luk. 5. 21.</note> the 5. of <hi>Luke</hi> 21. The Pharisees and Doctors saw the miracles of Christ, and yet they concluded him a Blasphemer. And when he had healed him that was born blind; they (hypocritically) bad the man <hi>give Glory to God,</hi> and said <hi>they knew</hi> that <hi>Jesus was a sinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They turn'd his miracles into wantonness, <hi>fain'd themselves Just <note place="margin">Joh. 9. 24.</note>

men that they might tempt him, i. e.</hi> put a trick upon him: <hi>demanding a sign</hi> for a sight, only to satisfy their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <note place="margin">Luc. 20. 20.</note> Curiosity.</p>
                  <p>As for his Countrey men, this Prophet <hi>had no honour there, he did not many miracles, among them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>As for the People, In the sixth of John we find, that Christ fed five thousand men with five loaves <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 10.</note> and two small fishes, <hi>so that they said, this is of a truth that Prophet.</hi> But the very next day (ver. 22.) the Very <hi>men that had eaten of the loaves (26) Said unto him, what sign shewest thou that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? what dost thou work?</hi> (30) as if a miracle had not been a Sign!</p>
                  <p>He wrought a miracle among <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 17.</note>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:106517:106"/>

                  <p n="3">3. Briefly, to bring this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to an issue.</p>
                  <p>If it were granted to these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106517:107"/>
to see a miracle, what kind of miracle would they chuse, to convince their understandings, and settle them in religion? We are here I confess <hi>in loco conjecturali,</hi> and no man can tell what miracle another man would chuse, but I am perswaded, that which most men would agree upon, as most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to that purpose whereof we are speaking, would be this; that to assure them of the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul and of the rewards and punishments of the world to come, and to satisfie their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity in some other doubts and scruples; They might once be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to see and converse with some one, that might rise from the dead, who might resolve their Questions, concerning the condition of those that are in <hi>Hades.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I say then, that our Saviour
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:106517:107"/>
who knew, what was in man, and needed not that any one should tell him, foreseeing this Phantastical conceit, hath shewed the folly of it, and preoccupated this vain resort.</p>
                  <p>In the 16 of <hi>Luke 27. Dives</hi> makes it his request to <hi>Abraham; that he</hi>

                     <hi>Abraham</hi> refers them to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which were in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner recommended to them as our Scriptures are to us. <hi>They have Moses and the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>let them hear them.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And he</hi> (Abraham) <hi>said If they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be perswaded though one rose from the dead.</hi>

                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:106517:108"/>This I take to be a clear and a full <note place="margin">Joh. 11.</note> determination of the matter in Question; And if any one should magine, that this determination was but Conjectural, Our Saviour afterward tries the Experiment, and raises another <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead.</p>
                  <p>What was the effect of this mans coming from the dead, did it Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the High Priest or the Scribes, the rulers or the people; nay, but <hi>from</hi>

                     <hi>that very day they took counsel together how they might put Jesus to death</hi> And <hi>the Chief Priests consulted, how they might put Lazarus to death also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon these Considerations we may infallibly Conclude, that Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in Such times as ours, is no more excusable, then it was in the days of Christ or his Apostles; the times of mir cles and prophesies.</p>
                  <p>So much of the first Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the Caveat of the Text, the

                  <p>Now the Danger of falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to infidelity is in it self so conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, and made so sensible by every day's experience, that I wish the proof of it were difficult, so as to Justify a studious and laborious demonstration of it.</p>
                  <p>At once to shorten my discourse, and to remove the suspicion of any Satyrical reflexion upon those that hear me; I shall shew, that the Greatest Advantages, have not
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:106517:109"/>
preserved the best of men, from sometimes falling into Infidelity. <hi>Take heed therefore brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The greatest Helps and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages against unbelief, I conceive to be these ensuing.</p>
                  <p>1. Evidences of Gods presence. 2. Or these lighting on a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. 3. At least upon the Ablest of men. 4. Such as have held Communion with God. 5. Or have been eminent for the habit and exercise of faith. 6. Or these with warnings to prevent the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling. 7. And those reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Yet all these, have not preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good men from sometimes fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. A word of each.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First then, to begin with the persons in the Context, What greater Evidences of the Presence of God can be Imagined, then they enjoyed? In <hi>Egypt,</hi> in their passage

over the red Sea; in the Wilderness, <q>my presence, <hi>saith God,</hi> shall go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with you,</q> They were conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Pillar of a Cloud, &amp;c. they were supported, and Corrected by Visible and palpable instances of Gods power and presence: Yet they tempted and grieved the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, by their Infidelity, for <hi>they believed not for all his Wonderous Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But these Jews were a dull and stupid people. If God should once manifest himself, to a wise and understanding person (such as we take our selves to be) We may think it impossible to fall into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</p>
                  <p>I suppose it will be no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to these Objectors, to say, that <hi>Solomon</hi> might be as Wise and Knowing, as Wary and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical as they. And as for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:106517:110"/>
of Gods presence, the Scripture tells us Expresly, that <hi>God appeared to him at Gibeon:</hi> Where <note place="margin">1 Kin. 3. 5.</note> he made a promise to him which he performed.</p>
                  <p>Yet <hi>Solomon</hi> fell into the grossest Infidelity; to think there were Gods and Goddesses, To <hi>worship Ashtaroth, the Goddess of the Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and Milcom the Abomination of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Kin. 11. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>the Ammonites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But it may be yet Objected, that <hi>Solomon</hi> did this in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his years, and his Dotage upon his Idolatrous wives, which turned away his heart, but that it could not have proceeded from him before his understanding was impaired.</p>
                  <p>Behold then a greater then <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon!</hi> even <hi>Adam</hi> in his full strength, when he was newly made after the similitude of God, a little
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:106517:110"/>
lower then the Angels. God se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times appeared to him in the Garden; Yet he fell through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and drew all his posterity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ruine.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But <hi>Adam,</hi> though he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Nature, yet he wanted Grace, whereby he might have held communion with God; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been once enjoyed, would for ever have kept him from infidelity, or deliberate sin, which always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from it.</p>
                  <p>Consider then the case of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> of whom it is said, that <hi>the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 13. Psal. 89. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Spirit of the Lord God came upon him;</hi> That <hi>God</hi> himself <hi>made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him, and Sware unto him by his holiness, that he would not fail him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>David,</hi> who was like unto him, for Devotion and Zeal, for spiritual Communion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:106517:111"/>
with God? He was <hi>the sweet singer of Israel;</hi> and how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do we find his Spirit inebriat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and transported in the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of his divine and ravishing enjoyments?</p>
                  <p>Yet we find him falling from all this height; and great and terrible was his fall; he went <hi>mourning for it all his days,</hi> and <hi>bowed down his head continually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. But perhaps it may be thought, that though <hi>David</hi> was an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent man, yet seeing his Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy lay not in the gift of Faith, but in Zeal, or in some other Grace, the danger may not yet be so very considerable.</p>
                  <p>Behold then even <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Darling of the almighty, who <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with God as a man converseth with his Friend:</hi> to whom God communicated his presence in
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:106517:111"/>
Dreams, in Visions, in Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>He was imbued with the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Faith; he exerted it in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest exercise; he manifested it in the heroical degree; so that he became <hi>the Father of the Faithful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet once we find him offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (tripping) at this stone of stumbling; Equivocating through unbelief.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But all these instances were during the Ancient Dispensation, when the Communication of the presence of God was more Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure; before the fulness of time was come, when <hi>the word was made flesh</hi> and <hi>dwelt amongst men, and they saw his glory as the glory of the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides, we do not find that they were particularly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly warned of their danger,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:106517:112"/>
which may lessen the Wonder of the fall.</p>
                  <p>Consider then the Case of <hi>Peter,</hi> the first of the Apostles. He had been closely conversant with Christ during all the time of his Ministry; Was a witness of his miracles, saw his Transfiguration, heard <hi>the Voyce which came to him from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent glory, saying this is my beloved</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Son—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for his faith; he it was, that made that confession, upon which the Christian Church is founded. And Christ had <hi>prayed for him that his faith should not fail.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was a Valiant man; and he undertook that though he died, he would neither forsake nor deny his Master.</p>
                  <p>When Christ forewarns him plainly and punctually, that his faith would fail him, that very night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:106517:112"/>
a certain hour; So that it was impossible he should be surprised.</p>
                  <p>You know his Undertakings, and of his Failings it is unnecessary to speak.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I know nothing now that can be alledged, against the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propensity of all men to Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but this; that <hi>Peter</hi> was now single and alone, that he failed only this time; when he was invironed with Bills and Staves, and in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his Life.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let us call to mind the Case of all the Apostles, in the great Foundation of our Faith, the Article of Christs Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when these temptations were away.</p>
                  <p>The resurrection of hte dead was in those times so commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that it was conceived of Christ, that he was <hi>one of the Old
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:106517:113"/>
Prophets risen from the Dead,</hi> and <hi>Herod said, he was John the Baptist ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the resurrection, the Apostles had seen Experiments, in <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and in the bodies of the Saints which arose.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Christs resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how plainly and often were they forewarned? After he was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, how often were they told of it? Yet how grossely and often did they fail?</p>
                  <p>In they 8 of <hi>Mark 31</hi> Christ tells his Disciples, that he <hi>should be killed,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mar. 8. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>and the third day he would rise again:</hi> He <hi>spake this saying Openly;</hi>

certain Mountain where they should see him.</p>
                  <p>Yet after he was risen; <hi>Mary Magdaten</hi> told them that he had appeared to her. But they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not <hi>Mary Magdalen. Joanna,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>James,</hi> told them the same, But <hi>their Speech seemed to them as Idle tales.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 24. 11.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The two Disciples told the rest, that he had appeared to them going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> but <hi>they believed them not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He appeared in the midst of ten of them at once, shewed them his hands and his side, But <hi>they believed not for joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Christ when he appeared to the <note place="margin">Luc. 24. 41. Mar. 28. 7.</note> Women, bade them tell the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and <hi>Peter,</hi> that according to his promise, they should see him in <hi>Galilee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the eleven Disciples went into</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">17.</note> 
                     <hi>Galilee, to a mountain which Jesus
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106517:114"/>
had appointed them, And when they saw him, they Worshipped; But some doubted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that Christ, almost in his <hi>last</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mai. 16. 14.</note> words, <hi>Upbraided them with their Unbelief — because they believed not them who had seen him, after he was risen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So prone are even the best of men, after their highest attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, under the best advantages, to fall sometime into Infidelity! So great is the danger of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief!</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, that all these, might say with the Prophet, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce</hi>

                     <hi>Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing? This same Jesus—</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. The Father co-operated with him, according to that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>The father worketh hitherto and I work</hi> — &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>These are some of the Attestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Father.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Christ bore witness of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And this he did, by prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself to be the Messiah; <hi>viz.</hi> by fulfilling all the prophesies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Person or Offices; the Life, and the Death of the Messiah.</p>
                  <p>His Generation was such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be declared, he was born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> of the Family of <hi>David,</hi> about 490 years after the return from Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. When the Scepter was just now departed from <hi>Juda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He performed not only the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

of the Prophesies, but all the Circumstances foretold, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Life and Death of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was to be a Prophet, and so he was. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord anointed</hi> him <hi>to preach,</hi> and <hi>he spake as never man spake.</hi> He foretold many things to come, they all bare him witness.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He was to be a King, and so he was. His Name was Wonderful; his Power was shewen throughout the universal System of the World; the Angels good and evil, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Elements, Plants, Fishes, Brutes, Health and Sickness, Life and Death, were all <hi>obedient unto his Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He was to be a Priest, and so he was. He made an Atonement by his Obedience, and by his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to the least punctilio (to the

                  <p>Moreover, for the Justification of his Gospel (and that he might leave no place for Infidelity;) he rose again from the dead, appeared to many, convinced them by all their Senses; They saw him, They heard him, They felt his hands and his side, They Eat and Drank with him; They <hi>Conversed with him 40 dayes; He was seen by more then 500 at once;</hi> and (lastly) <hi>in the sight</hi> of Many of them, he Ascended Visibly into Heaven.</p>
                  <p>These were some of the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which our Lord Christ bare to himself.</p>

given by the Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>In his Conception, to <hi>Mary,</hi> fulfilling the Promise of <hi>Gabriel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before his Nativity, to <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> in his Infancy to <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Hanna,</hi> in his Baptism to <hi>John. I knew him not,</hi> saith <hi>John, but he that sent me to baptize, said unto me, upon whom thou shalt</hi>

                  <p>Moreover, in his Resurrection <hi>he was declared the Son of God, with power by the Holy Ghost.</hi> After his <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 4.</note> Ascension, the Holy Ghost ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all his undertakings, in that Grand Manifestation at Pentecost, at the time and place which Christ had undertaken for; A manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to all the Senses, and to

                  <p>Such were the Attestations given to Christ (<hi>the Author and finisher of our faith)</hi>

And for the Apostles (the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgers of it) besides the Change of their Spirits from darkness to light, Whereby they were led out of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Infidelity, into all Truth. And from torpid and pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous persons, during thelife of their Master, they became, when he was dead, the most active and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mousin the world. (I say, besides this Change) They had bestowed upon them, All things necessary, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their 1. Own Assurance, or for the 2. Conviction of the World. (Concerning the truth of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which they delivered.)</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for themselves, besides the

Conversation with their Master before and after his Resurrection; they had 1. Apparitions of Angels. And to one of them Christ himself appeared after he was ascended to his father.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They had the <hi>Bath Kol,</hi> (Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from Heaven.) In the 9 of the <hi>Acts,</hi> we find a Voice from Heaven maintaining a Dialogue with <hi>Paul;</hi> and at another time, <hi>a voice saying to Peter, Arise Peter, Kill and Eat.</hi>

                     <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>in a trance</hi> (Act 10. 10, 19.) <hi>Paul rapt up to the third heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. They had monitory Dreams. <hi>Paul</hi> saw a man in a Dream, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto him, Come into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia</hi> and help us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They had Impulses of the Spirit; So Paul was <hi>forbid by the</hi>

the unbelieving World,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>As it is in the words which I quoted, <hi>God bare them witness with gifts of the Holy Ghost, and with Signs and Wonders;</hi> and that he did, so far, that I shall be justified by Christ himself, if I shall affirm, that the Apostles after his death, <note place="margin">Joh. 14 12.</note> did greater miracles then he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self did in his life.</p>
                  <p>Of the same kind with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours, some they performed, by means having an appearance of greater strangeness, (Christ healed by his touch, his word, his spittle,

                     <hi>Peter</hi> by his <hi>Shadow, Paul</hi> by <hi>Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs</hi> taken from his body.) But one great thing there was, wherein they exceeded; The Great and Manifest, and frequent Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the Spirit, the Reception of it upon themselves, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of it to others, by Prayer, Preaching, Laying on of Hands; By these it was that the unbelieving world was convinced, and even <hi>Simon Magus</hi> himself; It is by the power and Vertue of those effusions that we are here met together at this time, that the World continues Christian at this day. And these are some of those standing means and Arguments, whereby the proneness of our hearts to infidelity may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; and faith may be begotten, confirmed, recovered at this day: These are therefore to be revolved,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:106517:121"/>
                     <hi>Exhort one another dayly.</hi> To come therefore to a Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>My text it self is an Application, by way of Exhortation; Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are enforced by Reasons of Duty and Concernment, and these I have hitherto endeavoured to lay before you.</p>
                  <p>If indeed there were no Sinfulness in Infidelity, Or, if in such times as ours, it were excusable. If there were no danger of falling into it, or no means left to remedy or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it; it would then indeed be to little purpose to Exhort men to beware.</p>
                  <p>But if the state of all these things is otherwise, if that be plain and evident; agreeable to Scripture, to Reason and to Experience; if the Speaker hath not beaten the Air, nor the heaters been careless and inattentive, I know not what can
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:106517:121"/>
be required, to enforce and sharpen the exhortation.</p>
                  <p>If the time would suffer it, and I were speaking to a Common or Injudicious Auditory, I might think my self concerned, after all that hath been spoken to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, to Apply my discourse to your affections, I should take unto me the various forms of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion used in this Epistle. I would <hi>Reprove, Rebuke, Exhort;</hi> I would <hi>cry aloud, and</hi> would <hi>not spare.</hi> I would <hi>lift up my voice like a</hi> Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>trumpet,</hi> warning you from the Lord, concerning the Spirit of irreligion and infidelity which is said to have overspread the land.</p>
                  <p>I would <hi>take</hi> to my self <hi>a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, yea it should be for a Lamentation,</hi> for the Professors of Infidelity, and the Infidelity of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:106517:122"/>
Professors, every where. But I may not now be permitted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon these things. I may only pray to God to give you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in all things, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you earnestly to consider what hath been spoken, Conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the words of the Text, <hi>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you, an evil heart of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, in departing from the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. Exhort one another dayly.—</hi>

                     <q>— But know that for all these things God will bring thee to Judgment. Rejoyce O young man, — &amp;c.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE great and general design of the Ministry and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel, is to bring men to Christianity; not in the outward profession, but in the true spirit and power thereof; to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:106517:125"/>
the end they may be justified and sanctified, and finally saved through Christ for ever.</p>
                  <p>The Particular design of this Dayes Observation is to <hi>humble our selves under the mighty hand of God,</hi> in Consideration of his Judgments, especially that late one in consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Fire the Ancient and noble <hi>Metropolis</hi> of this Nation; and to endeavour to appease the wrath of God gone out against us.</p>
                  <p>To compass both these designs (whereof the later is subordinate to the former) I know no better expedient, than to reason a while upon that important argument sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested in the Text.</p>
                  <p>Who can think upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration of our late Glorious City, and not call to mind the great and terrible day of Judgment?</p>
                  <p>Who can think seriously of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:106517:125"/>
Judgment, and not be compelled to come in, (driven to Christianity) that he may be <hi>saved from the wrath to come?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great Instructor and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Christian Preachers (he who saith of himself, that <hi>Christ sent him to preach and not to baptize</hi>) found no means so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to perswade men to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, as to reason upon this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as first to lay before them the terror of Judgment, and then (whilst that was warm upon their hearts) to make them a tender of the Gospel. This is the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and use the Apostle makes <note place="margin">2 Cot 5. 10, 11.</note> of the Doctrine of the Text. <hi>We must all appear</hi> (saith he) <hi>before the Judgment-seat of Christ,—Knowing therefore the terrour of the Lord, we perswade men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon these Considerations I
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:106517:126"/>
shall hope for the pardon of this Noble Auditory, if (without affectation of Science) I shall, in a practical and familiar way of reasoning, indeavour to imitate our Apostle in this particular.</p>
                  <p>If in the mean time it will be irksome and unpleasant to hear of the Judgment to come, we shall do well to consider what it will be to undergo it; we shall do well to reflect upon our Souls, and search out the ground of this avers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; Is it because we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Judgment to come? or that we our selves shall be brought to Judgment? Is it because we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver consider, who it is before whom me must appear? or, what things will be charged on our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? Is it because we are so far gone in our arrears that it is to no purpose to call these things into
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:106517:126"/>
our remembrance? —What ever it be, we may perhaps hear of that which may meet with and remove the prejudice and imposture that is upon us. It is neither our Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence nor Infidelity that will <hi>make void the Truth of God.</hi> Whether we will hear, or Whether we will forbear, the Words which I have read remain firm and unalterable, and they clearly contain these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a Judgment to come.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou shall be brought to Judgment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God will bring thee to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God will bring thee to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for these things, the ways of thy heart, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God will bring thee to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for All these things.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. All this is certain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:106517:127"/>
for it is not <hi>think,</hi> or <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> but — <hi>Know that for all these things God will bring thee to Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. First then, <hi>There is a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come.</hi> This is no Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick invention found out to fright thee from thy pleasures; this is no Engine of State devised to keep you in a subordination to your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; this is no vain Thunder or foolish fire, to affright you in to a blind obedience, but it is the Tenor of the Scripture of the voyce of God, <hi>King Agrippa believest thou the the Prophets? I know that thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievest,</hi> (saith <hi>St. Paul.</hi>) Brethren do we believe the Scriptures? I hope we do believe them; This we do all profess to believe, so often as we repeat our Creed; and I hope the dissolution of our times has not yet shatter'd that foundation of our faith, the ground work of our
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:106517:127"/>
hopes, even the Salvation of our souls. Surely there are rewards for men; <hi>doubtless there is a God which judgeth the earth.</hi> What though the foundations of the world be out of course, the pillar of Faith remains unshaken; <hi>the Rod of the ungodly shall not for ever rest upon the back of the righteous:</hi> I desire to make a little use of your faith for that which anon will be obtained from your reason. There is a Judgment to come, it's as sure as death, nay far surer; they shall be judged which shall not dy, they have been judged which could not dy; the one at the end, the other at the beginning of the world.</p>
                  <p>There is a Particular and a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Judgment; the one at the dissolution of the lester, the other of the greater world; the one at the hour of death, the other at the day
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:106517:128"/>
of Judgment. A Judgment I say, a strict examination, an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, a severe sentence; words which make no thundring noise, or tragical sound, and so they may pass our hardned hearts without any motion; wherefore let us judge of the tenor and moment of them by their antecedent signs.</p>
                  <p>Before one of them, the evil days come: The other is called <hi>the evil day.</hi> Before one, <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>the Sun, and the Moon, and the Light, and the Stars shall be darkned:</hi> Before the other, a greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>the Sun shall be turned into Darkness, and the Moon into Bloud, and the Stars shall fall from Heaven.</hi> Before one, <hi>the Keepers of the House shall tremble, and the Strong men bow themselves;</hi> Before the other, <hi>the Mountains shall quake, and the Powers of Heaven</hi>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:106517:128"/>
                     <hi>shall be shaken:</hi> Before one, <hi>we shall rise at the voyce of the Bird;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other, <hi>at the sound of the Trumpet.</hi> Before one, <hi>the silver Cord shall be loosed, and the golden Bowl broken, and the Pitcher broken at the Fountain, and the wheel broken at the Cistern:</hi> Before the other, the silver Zone of the ecliptick, and the golden Globe of the Sun, the Orbs, and the Vortices shall be confounded, (the <hi>wheel within a wheel)</hi> the <hi>Heavens shall be rivel'd as a scrowl of Parchment,</hi> and the Earth and <hi>the Elements shall melt away with fervant heat.</hi> In the one, the <hi>dust shall return to the earth as it was, and and the spirit to God that gave it:</hi> At the other, the dust shall return from the earth to be as it was, and the spirit from God that gave it.</p>
                  <p>Come now and let us reason to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:106517:129"/>Are all these the fore-runners and symptomes of approaching Judgment? then why art thou so drowsre O my careless soul, and why are thou so secure within me? What strange Lethargy hath seised on thee? <hi>Awake thou that sleepest, and Christ shall give the light.</hi> The time of thy dissolution is coming, and after death, the Judgment. Retire therefore a while into thy self, and commune with thy heart: Enter thou into thy Closet, and shut thy Door upon thee: Let us examine our selves before we come to that strict Examen: Let us make a Judgment of our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before we come to Judgment. Do we believe a Judgment will come? Then how are we provided against that Day? Are our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts ready? Art thou able to stand in Judgment? Shalt thou be
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:106517:129"/>
clear when thou art judged? When <hi>Paul reasoned</hi> before <hi>Felix concerning the Judgment to come, Felix trembled;</hi> and because it was an unpleasant argument, <hi>he put him off to another time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no doubt but our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous hearts would gladly put off these Considerations, and deferr them to a more convenient season. Nay! but there is no time so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient as the present, when we are wrought into some apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Judgment: if we stay till our present thoughts are over, we shall again be brought to lose the apprehension (to forget the import and moment) of the Judgment; we shall come again to hear the Name thereof, and to neglect it as an idle Noise, and empty Sound.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore not neglect this opportunity; Let us search our
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:106517:130"/>
seleves to the bottom; Let us make a discovery of our final Resolution, and secret Reserves in reference to Judgment. We profess openly to believe that Christ shall come with Glory, to judge both the Quick and Dead; What are our inward thoughts in that particular? and how are we provided against the Day of Judgment?</p>
                  <p>There is a Judgment to come, that Judgment terrible, the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation strict, the Condemnation insupportable, and most of us ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unprovided; yet for all this, it's possible it may be avoyded. All these things are true in Judgments here below, and we see the proof of them at every Assizes; yet all Offenders are not brought to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but many Thieves and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers escape it: It may be thus in the Judgment to come; it's
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:106517:130"/>
possible it may be avoidable.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. A miserable hope, if this be all; for <hi>Thon shalt be brought to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> That's the second Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
                  <p>And it contains the Universality or Particularity of the Judgment, (which you please:) thou, and every man, <hi>singuli generum, &amp; genera singulorum;</hi> all sorts of men, and every man of every sort, from <hi>Him that sitteth on the Ihrone,</hi> to <hi>Her that grindeth in the Mill:</hi> For <hi>we must all appear before the Judgment-seat of Christ.</hi> It <hi>is appointed for all men once to dy, and after death the Judgment.</hi> Death shall deliver up our Souls to the first, and death shall deliver up our Bodies to the second Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Grave shall deliver up her spoils, and the bodies of all men, devoured of Beasts, consumed of Fire, swallowed by the Sea, scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:106517:131"/>
to the four Winds, <hi>in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the twinckling of an eye,</hi> shall be brought to Judgment.</p>
                  <p>And here shall I bewail the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or inveigh against the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of us Men, that suffer our selves to be hurried headlong by the power of our imaginations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the striving of our Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; that suffer our Senses to carry away the crown from our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and give over our selves to the impetuous stream of our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: That when we have a full information, a compleat judgment, a clear dictate of conscience, we will suffer all these to be overborn in us by the <hi>Idola Specûs, Tribûs,</hi> &amp;c. which are brought into our imaginations: That having clear and evident Principles, we can yet doubt of their immediate conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; or whilest we profess an
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:106517:131"/>
universal truth, never descend to think of the particulars.</p>
                  <p>We know there is a vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the things present, and those to come; and yet we form our thoughts of those, according to the analogy of these, deluding our selves with idle and childish imaginations. God keeps silence; we <hi>think he is such an one as we: Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is not presently executed, we set our hearts to do wickedly.</hi> We profess that all men must die, and come to judgment; yet we do not really believe that we our selves shall dy, and come to judgment. This is the fountain of our misery, and the original of our spiritual miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages: the discovery of the causes and remedy whereof, lies deep in the Philosophy concerning Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; but the thing it self is of every days observation: we
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:106517:132"/>
may recount it in these authentical examples. <hi>David</hi> knew full well what belong'd to Murder and Adultery, and what himself had done in the matter of <hi>Uriah;</hi> yet he cried not out that he had sinned, till <hi>Nathan</hi> had charged him, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ahab</hi> undoubtedly had read the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and knew the guilt of Murder and Oppression; yet he goes on triumphantly, he kills, and also takes possession: but when <hi>Elijah</hi> charges hime home, <hi>In the field of Jezreel shall Dogs lick thy blood, even thine,</hi> then he cries out, <hi>Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?</hi> (1 Kings 21.) and having applyed things to his particular, he <hi>Rent his Cloaths, and put on sackcloth, he fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once more: 'Tis likely <hi>Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:106517:132"/>
had a general Judgment, and an universal Maxime in his mind, That it was unlawful to spoil the House of God, to plunder those things which were dedicated to the Lord, and to debauch in the Bowls of the Temple, and probably he had seen the hand-writing of the book of God to that purpose: yet all this does not restrain him: But when the <hi>Fingers write upon the Wall, Mene, Mene,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou art weighed,</hi> &amp;c. then <hi>his countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, the joynts of his loyns were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</hi> This then is the Office of this second Proposition, it charges us home, it lays down the Universal, and it brings it down to the Particular.</p>
                  <p>Thou shalt be brought to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thy Judgment is unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:106517:133"/>O but then thy Evasion is crossed, O my stupid Soul! Thou art spoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of thy frivolous ground of hope: Thou shalt surely be cited, and thou must appear, if thou refuse to come thou shalt be brought to Judgment. Return then again into thy self, and take a review of thy condition; what will the issue be of that Judgment to which thou must be brought? What hopes are now remaining that thou shalt not be condemned? when the <hi>Officers have haled thee before the Judge,</hi> that <hi>thou be <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>If thou art called to Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Canst thou elude thy Judge by thy wily Answers? or Canst thou baffle or suborn the Witnesses? Canst thou work off thy Jury not to find the Verdict? or bribe the Judge to favour thee in thy Doom?
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:106517:133"/>
Canst thou withdraw him from the Rigour of Justice by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of thy friends, or melt him into compassion by the loudness of thy cries, the sadness of thy lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation? Canst thou procure a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version or Reprieve of thy sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or appeal from thy Judge unto another? Canst thou make an escape from thine Executioner? Or lastly, Canst thou stoutly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the sentence of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? These are the hopes of men here brought to Judgement, and why may not some of them be mine? No, thou knowest, O trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous heart, all these to be fond impossibilities, dreams, and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions of a childish fancy; If once this day be over, and that time come, thy hopes are barely these, that Omniscience and Wisdom it self may be deluded by stupidity, that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:106517:134"/>
Omnipotence and Power it self may be evaded by poor contemptible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, that Severity and Justice it self may be perverted by iniquity; all this is evident by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: <hi>For we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. God will bring thee to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>And here we are concerned to raise our thoughts, and employ the utmost of our attention, lest by the prejudice which our Idleness hath brought upon us, <hi>we treasure up wrath to</hi> our selves <hi>against that day</hi> of Judgment. 'Tis true, we daily hear of God, and receive the names of his Attributes into our ears, but we pass over his Name as if he were like to us, and never bestow so much labour as to attain to a considerable notion of those names. O that the God of Heaven
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:106517:134"/>
would afford us here some glimpse of himself; That he would illustrate us with some beam of his Majesty; That he would be pleased to visit every unprovided soul, and insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate into it a full and clear appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of this Proposition — <hi>God will</hi> &amp;c —</p>
                  <p>But how shall we endure to see his face? <hi>No man can see my face and live,</hi> (Exod. 33.) if the <hi>Israelites</hi> durst not hear him proclaim the Law, how shall we endure to hear him denounce the Judgment? If the Angels veil their faces, not able to behold his Excellency, how shall we be affected with his terrors? If the Cherubims are oppressed with the sight of his glory, what shall we be with the sense of his fury? If we find our selves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and swallowed up into inextricable Labyrinths, when we
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:106517:135"/>
set our selves to consider of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent Attributes, of his eternal Duration, his unbounded Essence, his unconfined Presence: With what disposition can we entertain the terror of his Judgment, the search of his Omniscience, the stroke of his Omnipotence? If the best and choicest of the Saints of God, have been afraid and trembled at the thoughts of Judgment, if they have been surprised with horror and confusion at the meer imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of that Dreadful voice, <hi>Arise and come to Judgment,</hi> what shall the worst and most obdurate sinners, when they shall be stript of this cloud of flesh and error, and cited before the great tribunal, there to render an account of their Creation, Preservation, and Redemption?</p>

soul, when thou shalt be brought into a perfect apprehension of thy Judge, and of thy self, and he shall begin to order out before thee the things which he hath done; when the whole Trinity shall begin to unfold its common work, and that sacred Person blessed for ever, upon whose <hi>shoulders the Judgment is laid</hi> shall unfold to thee his peculiar, and thou must render a severe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thy returns?</p>
                  <p>When the mystery of thy Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall be unveiled to thee: When thou shalt apprehend through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what it is to have been fetcht out of the dark and barren shade of an eternal privation to be put in a capacity of glory. When he shall recount to thee the proceedings of his handy work, the method of thy making, the several articles and gradations of his Providence in the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:106517:136"/>
formation and information of thee. How at first he <hi>poured thee out like milk, and crudled thee cheese;</hi> How he spun out thine arteries and veins, and <hi>whilst thou wert yet in thy blood, he said unto thee, live:</hi> How he guarded thee with muscles, and strengthened thee with sinews, and propt thee with bones, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thee with skin, furnished thee with organs, endowed them with senses, invested thee with reason, crowned thee with freedom, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned thee with principles of Science and Conscience, bounded thee by his Precepts, encouraged thee by his Promises, restrained thee by his threatnings. When he shall run over the benefits of thy daily preservation, and rigorously exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what thou hast done for him.</p>
                  <p>When God the Son shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play to thee what he hath done and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:106517:136"/>
suffered for thee, and shall set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine eyes the great mystery of thy Redemption; When he shall bring thee to apprehend the price that he has paid, that ransom which thou hast not regarded: When it will not be in thy power to pass over these considerations as now thou dost; but they shall be forced into the essential center of thy Soul: When thou shalt have a clear sight of the abasement of a God incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: When thou shalt know how to be moved at the sight of a despis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and an abused Godhead.</p>
                  <p>When he shall charge thee with the blewness of those stripes, and the ghastliness of those wounds which thou hast made: When he shall rehearse to thee the miseries of his life, and the circumstances of his death: When he shall recount to thee the woundings of the taunts
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:106517:137"/>
and reproaches, the smart of the whips, the terrour of the agony, which made him sweat great drops of blood, the pricks of the thorns, the piercing of the nails, the laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the spear, and the ineffable horror of the dereliction, when he cried out in the bitterness of his soul, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> And when he shall fiercely call upon thee to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for the wounds that thou hast made, to render him his blood that thou hast spilt, to account to him for that life which thou hast bereft, to shew him the fruit of all his pains and sufferings, to present him thy returns for all these bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and favours; then tell me what thou wilt answer, O stupid soul. How art thou provided to reply?</p>
                  <p>Wilt thou deny that he has done
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:106517:137"/>
these things for thee? or canst thou shew as much for him? Hast thou returned him that being which he hath given thee, and so been even with him in a form of words, though that come infinitely short indeed? Hast thou sacrificed thy self for his benefit, or abased thy self for his commodity? What wilt thou plead when thou art called? The time is coming, thy Judgment hastning, thine account is unavoidable, thy Judge inexo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>Alas! what could I have done for him? what profit could I have brought him? if I should have pined away in the exercise of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and been eaten up with zeal? If I should have <hi>spent my sabstance in Burnt-Offerings,</hi> or <hi>Calves of a year old?</hi> If I should have presented him <hi>with thousands of Rams, or ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:106517:138"/>
Rivers of Oil?</hi> To what purpose then should I end eavour that, which I could not have performed? Why should I trouble my self with vain attempts, and spend my strength about that, which I never could accomplish? neither if I be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is he the better; nor if I be wicked is he the worse: <hi>our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness extends not to him; if thou sinnest, what dost thou against him? if thou be righteous, what receiveth he at thine hand?</hi> Is this then the evasion? I need not stand to unfold the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuity, the stupor and madness of this evasion. However though these things shall be urged upon us, they are not all; these offer themselves in the consideration of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Judge, but are not all the matter of thy Judgment.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. For <hi>Thou shall be brought to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:106517:138"/>
for these things;</hi> there is the matter of thy Judgment.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. <hi>For All these things;</hi> there is the extent. Because this latter adds only a Modality to the former, and I desire not to be over tedious, we will put these two together.</p>
                  <p>And now we are descended from those less familiar Considerations, to which we were forced to strein our understandings in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of our Judge, into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of our own sphere, to the survey of our own operations; we are come from the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible ways of God, to the ways of our own hearts. <hi>Walk in the ways of thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. and, <hi>But know,</hi> &amp;c. In the judgment of this life men are tryed by the works of their hands, or the words of their mouths; for theft or murder, for slander or Treason men may
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:106517:139"/>
be brought to Judgment, but thought is free, he has lived well that has carried his crimes close, the crafry Politician and the conceealed Hypocrite escape: There the case is quite contrary, the Judgment takes in primarily the ways of the heart, and the words and actions as they proceed from them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us withdraw a space into our selves, and endeavour to mete out the extent of that Proposition. For all the ways of the hearts of men, God will bring them to Judgment.</p>
                  <p>How would it trouble us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and bring to memory every thought but of one only day? and how many disorders and irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties should we find in such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection? How do our thoughts flote upon our brains, and we know neither whence they come, nor
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:106517:139"/>
what becomes of them? When they are broken in upon our minds we cannot hold them, and when they are gone from us (as it was with <hi>Nibuchadnezzar's</hi> dream) it is not in our power to recover them. How many roving fancies present themselves unto us in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and how many sudden and imperfect Complacencies and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastes are raised by them? Leave but thy self unbound, unfixed (by hearing, or reading, or business, &amp;c.) for an hour, and then tell me what suppositions and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and resolutions thou hast made? And how thou hast felt thy self to strein upon the borders of Lust or Envy, of Pride or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, of Discontent or Melancholy. O that you would but reflect a little upon your souls, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how many wandring thoughts
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:106517:140"/>
have broken in upon your minds since I began to speak of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Subject. You might save me the labour of further speaking and raise your selves to that which I endeavour: I fear you might find among your sacred thoughts, a mixture of others very unsuitable; your envious, your ambitious, your covetous, your idle thoughts All these are the matter of our future Judgment, and however they slightly pass us here, they are noted in the Book of God; and when that Book shall be opened, they will be charged on our account. <hi>Thou tellest my wanderings,</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>Are not these things noted in thy Book?</hi> I have already said enough to take up the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the remainer of our time: But our hearts being too heavy, and our ears too dull of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:106517:140"/>
to be moved with generals, I must crave leave that I may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to run over the heads of some particulars.</p>
                  <p>Thou must give an account of all things committed to thee, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or Outward, Natural or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, thy senses and thy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, thine Outward and thine Inward faculties.</p>
                  <p>If thou hast been at a constant covenant with thine eyes, and hast never suffered them to rove in loose disorders: If thou hast bowed thine ears to discipline, and never let them open to vain entertainments: If thy taste hath been moderated by the necessities of nature, and the laws of temperance, and never let loose according to the lust of Riot: If thy hands have been wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the works of God, and never been instruments to the

machinations of the Devil: If thy speech have never uttered any idle words, but ever <hi>administred grace to the hearers:</hi> If thy feet have only traced the ways of God, and never <hi>stood in the way of sinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What hath been the exercise of thine inward faculties, thine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions and thine Appetite? If thy fancie hath ever been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in administring help to thine understanding, and never afforded incentives to thy vile affections: If thy memory have been taken up with the things which God hath done, and Christ hath suffered for thee, and hath afforded no place to Ribaldry and vanity: How thou hast ordered thine Anger and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence: What have been the object, measure, and end, and circumstances, of thy love, hatred, desire, aversion, delight, sadness,

hope, despair, fear, boldness, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, envie, jealousie, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.</p>
                  <p>How thou hast managed thine understanding, and improved thy contemplative and active princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. If thou hast advanced in the discovery of eternal verities, or herd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the beasts that perish: If thou hast cherished the principles of thy <hi>Synteresis,</hi> and the dictates and reflections of thy conscience, and never rebelled against them: How thou hast determined the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of thy Will, in thy volition and intention, thine election and consent, fruition and duse, when Good and Evil, Life and Death have been set before thee.</p>
                  <p>How thou hast behaved thy self in Spirituals, in gifts and graues. If thou hast accepted that which hath been offered, and improved
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:106517:142"/>
what thou hast accepted, or hid it in a Napkin. In outward things, how thou hast acquired, and how thou hast managed thine Estate: How thou hast behaved thy self in thy Relations publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, in thy charge, and in thy duty. —But the time would fail me to reckon up a considerable part of the exercises and objects of the wayes of the hearts of Men: And now all these and many more, are but the simple elements, and common heads of our account.</p>
                  <p>Consider then, O negligent and incogitant soul! if thou couldst reckon up the ways of thy heart, in any one of these kinds; if thou couldst call to mind but every idle word whereof thou must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or thy motions upon every thing thou hast heard, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in any one of these elements,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:106517:142"/>
what thou hast done or else omitted. Then tell me how wouldst thou find thy self possessed, and how wouldst thou be disposed to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Wouldst thou deem it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less or idle to call it betimes to thy remembrance? Wouldst thou drive off thy thoughts of it to the time of sickness, to the hour of death, and rudely throw thy self upon it? —But then try, and examine all these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, contemplate a little upon the mixtures and combinations of them; these will afford us many millions of millions of wayes (far exceeding the varieties of the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real nature, which proceed from the mixture of fewer elements) so many as will utterly confound our thoughts to number. Who can reckon up the wayes of the hearts of the children of Men? Who can understand his errours?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:106517:143"/>And now, that he that hath the World to uphold, the Planets and Stars to guide, the course of nature to maintain, should keep a Register of our impertinencies, and bring to Judgment all the wayes of Men; (the traces of a Ship in the Sea, of a Serpent upon a Rock) who hath believed our report? we are apt to think it cannot be. Surely he sees not these things: Tush he cares not for them. This is indeed the last resort of the treacherous hearts of men, the grand imposture which resolves into a species of Atheism and Infidelity. O but then, if I shall use the language of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, I must call thee fool and beast, to doubt of that which is plain and evident, to disbelieve that which may be known. This Article con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Judgment to come, is not a problem of Philosophy to be
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:106517:143"/>
disputed this way and that way with equal probability; neither is it only an Article of faith, but it is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of natural Theology, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture speaks of it under terms of greater evidence St. <hi>Paul</hi> reasoned with <hi>Felix,</hi> he disputed with the Philosophers concerning it, he speaks of the terror of Judgment under terms of certainty, and of a kind of Demonstrative evidence; <hi>Knowing the terror of the Law, &amp;c.</hi> and hear in the Text, it is not said, <hi>Think,</hi> or <hi>believe;</hi> But <hi>know that for all these things God will bring thee to Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">VI. He is a fool that hath said in his heart there is no God, and he that thinks he hath no understanding may well be compared to the beasts that <hi>perish</hi> &amp; so sure as there is a God, and that man hath an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing soul, so surely it may be known,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:106517:144"/>
                     <hi>That for all these things, &amp;c.</hi> For if there be a God, he must be infinitely just; and if so, he must render to every one according to their actions; and if not here, then hereafter; and if so, he must bring them to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But he doth it not here: The ways of Providence seem to be promiscuous, <hi>there is a wicked man to whom it happens according to the way of the righteous, and a righteous man</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Eccles 8. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>to whom it happens according to the way of the wicked. Dives</hi> receives pleasure, <hi>Lazarus</hi> pain; therefore so sure as there is a God, there will be a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Again, If man have an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing soul, he must have freedom in his actions; and if so, he deserves either good or evil; and if there be deserts, there must be rewards; and if there be rewards, there must be a Judgment. So then, so sure as thou
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:106517:144"/>
art an understanding creature, so sure there is a Judgment to come.</p>
                  <p>Once more, Reward is answerable to desert; and desert is only in what is free; and what is free in man is the ways of his heart: wherefore they are to be brought to Judgment, and if any, then all: for no reason can be fancied, why some should be brought to Judgment, and others not. Wherefore, if it be sure that God is in Heaven, and that Man hath an understanding soul, then it is also sure that for all these things God will bring thee to Judgment, that God shall bring to judgment every secret thing.</p>
                  <p>And now how sure and evident are these things? more sure and more plain, if we will attend, than any other truths in the world; for there is not any known truth which doth not evict the truth of these
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:106517:145"/>
things. We know a truth, because we plainly and evidently understand the composition or division of the notions in a Proposition, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a Proposition from some others; therefore if we know any truth, we presuppose that we have souls which understand the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of things, and if souls which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand these notions, then to be sure they are not bodies, (no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of fire and air, and earth, and water, no disposirion of insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble atomes can cause the subject to apprehend and judge, to reason and discourse) and if they be no bodies, then they are not subject to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: It is evident therefore that our souls are understanding and also immortal, deserving and capable of future Judgment.</p>
                  <p>And as evident it is also that there is a soveraign Power, a God that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:106517:145"/>
and will Judge the Earth.</p>
                  <p>This is not a Rhetorical under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, but a just and measured truth; there is not anything in the world from whence these two may not be plainly and evidently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <hi>viz.</hi> a Godhead from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and thine own Immortality from the discovery of a Godhead. The world which thou seest, had it a beginning, or had it not? if it had a beginning, he is thy God that made it; if it had no beginning, then there are past as many myriads of years as minutes of time, which is infinitely more absurd to grant, than to say, thou hast as many hands as fingers, as many wholes as parts.</p>
                  <p>If then at any time we find our selves to doubt of these things, it is not because we are the <hi>beaux esprits,</hi> or <hi>forts esprits;</hi> our doubting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from dulness, and the want of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:106517:146"/>
that strong reason to which we do pretend, the things are certain in themselves and evident. <hi>He is not far from any one of us, in whom we live, and move, and have our being;</hi> and the Light of nature discovered our Immortality not only to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, but even to the Heathen Poets, to him that fung to us, that, <hi>We are also his off-spring.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that now thy pretences are all taken off, and every imposture of the heart discovered.</p>
                  <p>Return then once again into thy <note place="margin">Applic. general.</note> bosome, and take account of thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions; The day of the Lord is coming and stealing upon thee as a thief in the night, the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the great and terrible day. A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of a whirlwind and a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, a day of anguish and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Where wilt thou hide thy self?
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:106517:146"/>
O that's impossible, <hi>Where shall we go then from his presence?</hi> shall we <hi>call to the Mountains to fall upon us?</hi> How wilt thou appear? O that's intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>for our God is a consuming fire.</hi> What wilt thou do when the day of Judgment comes, and this may be the hour, this minute thou mayest be smitten and hurried hence to Judgment? Thousands have fallen besides us, and ten thousands at our right hand, and why may not we be next?</p>
                  <p>The time of our particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot be far away, and why may we not reasonably apprehend the approach of the General Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either of this World, or at leastwise of this sinful Nation?</p>
                  <p>Our Lord Christ indeed tells us, that <hi>of the day and hour of the final</hi> Judgment, <hi>Knoweth no man.</hi> Yet he hath given us the signs of his

coming: The Apostles have left us Characters of the last days, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets have declared the manner and <hi>apparatus</hi> of the coming of the Lord to Judgment.</p>
                  <p>We read that when the Disciples admired the stones and the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Herod's</hi> Temple at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> Christ told them, <hi>That the day was coming when there should not be left one stone upon another:</hi> upon this the Disciples ask him (privately) three Questions. <hi>1.

                  </p>
                  <p>As for the precise moment of these things, he denies to tell it them; (Nay, he professes, that as he was the Son of Man he did not know it.) But for the other two he conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends to their curiosity, he tells them the signs of his coming, and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:106517:147"/>
of the end of the World, and that they shall be such as these;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You shall hear,</hi> saith he, (Matth 24.) <hi>of Wars and rumours of Wars, Nation rising against Nation, and Kingdom against Kingdom.</hi> There shall be <hi>Traytors</hi> and <hi>false Prophets,</hi> Saying, <hi>Lo! here is Christ,</hi> Behold!

                  </p>
                  <p>He tells us (<hi>Luke 21.</hi>) <hi>there shall be Famines and Earthquakes, Pestilence, and fearful sights, great signs from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; in the Earth distress of Nations, great perplexities, the Sea and Waves

                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the last dayes, St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that there shall be <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous times;</hi> that on one hand there shall be a sort of men, that shall be <hi>lovers of themselves, Covetous, Proud, Boasters, Ranters, and Blasphemers.</hi>

                  <p>On the other hand there shall be a Race of <hi>heady, high minded Traytors, having a form of godliness, creeping into houses, leading captive silly women.</hi> They shall <hi>despise Dominion, and speak evil of Dignities;</hi> they shall be Separatists from the Church, and false pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Spirit. <hi>These,</hi> saith St. <hi>Jude, are they that separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit,</hi>

                  <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, that in the last times there should be a loose, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, a bold Atheistical Gigantick race of <hi>scoffers, walking after their own

                  <p>Have not all these things come upon us, the men of this Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is it weakness, is it a vain and superstitious scrupulosity to call these things to our remembrance? Have we no reason at all to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the approach of a General Judgment, either upon the World, or upon our sinful Nation?</p>
                  <p>Do we not now envy those des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pised souls which have made their accounts ready? We thought it
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:106517:149"/>
madness to see them pine away with poenitential exercises, and macerate themselves with mourning. We thought it folly which they called Conscience, for which they denyed themselves the pleasures and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the World <hi>We fools counted their life madness, and their latter end to be without honour.</hi> But the time is coming <hi>when they</hi> shall be <hi>comforted, and we</hi> shall be <hi>tormented.

                  </p>
                  <p>May we not therefore give up our selves to the torments of our hearts, and surrender up our souls unto Despair? so <hi>Israel</hi> said, <hi>there is no hope, we will follow every one the devices of his heart:</hi> after 20, 30 or 40
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:106517:150"/>
years continuance in our courses, 'tis in vain to think of turning from them. Our arrears are so far gone, that there is no hope to discharge them; and why should we trouble our selves with the thoughts of our Account? Nay, that which must come, let it come, and what is a few days respite to Eternity? <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall dye.</hi> Let us go forth as at other times, and shake our selves and scatter these troublesom apprehensions of future Judgment. What if we should drink a little to drive away Melancholy?</p>
                  <p>Yes! and fall perhaps, and spew, and rise no more.</p>
                  <p>Nay, but I beseech you, stay a little, and consider, consider <hi>at least in this your day the things which belong to your peace: It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God; Who among us can dwell with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring

                  <p>Such careless and desperate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions are the advantages which the Devil aims at, that he may sear our Consciences, and seal us up in a final obduration. But there is another kind of advantage, which God and our Lord Christ and the Holy Spirit, and the Gospel, and the Ministers aim at, That advantage, which I told you of in the beginning of my Discourse. That <hi>knowing the terror of the Lord they may perswade men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now what is it that they would perswade us? that we will be contented to part with the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting fears of Judgment, that we will condescend not to be miserable to all Eternity: That we will accept of deliverance from the wrath to come, that we will not neglect so

great salvation, nor trample on the bloud of the everlasting Covenant.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>How hath the Lord covered the Daughter of our Zion with a cloud in his anger, and hath cast down from Heaven to Earth the beauty of Israel, and remembred not his footstool in the Day of his Anger? he hath swallowed up the habitations of his people, he hath taken away his Tabernacles, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his places of Assemblies, the Ramparts and the Walls lament and languish, ber Gates are sunk to the ground, her Barrs are destroyed.</hi>

                  <p>O the terrors and affrightments, the shriekes and lamentations, the agonies, the confusions of that Day! They that were on the house top, durst not stay to take any thing out of their houses; nor he that was in the field return back to take his Cloaths; they that were in the City betook themselves to the Fields and Mountains, where they beheld

their flaming habitations, where they trembled to behold the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of desolation raging in the holy places.</p>
                  <p>How were the wise men amazed, and the strong men terrified? despair seised them, counsel and strength fled away from them, there was no help in them, they presently gave all for lost; they stood affrighted at a distance gazing at the dreadful spectacle: in vain they thought it to contend, it looked so like the coming of the Son of Man.</p>
                  <p>The breath of the Lord kindled the fire, <hi>he rode upon Cherub, he came flying upon the wings of the wind.</hi> He made <hi>the winds his Messengers,</hi> and the <hi>flames of fire his Ministers:</hi> He <hi>brought the Winds out of his Treasure,</hi> and (to point the flame directly upon the bulk and body of the City) <hi>through his power he brought in

                  <p>YEt who can tell, but God may have mercy upon us, but he may yet save us from destruction? though our breach be great as the Sea, yet is not in it self irreparable; though our wounds be deep and gaping, they are not desperate or uncurable; hitherto we may say with the Apostle, We are <hi>chastned,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:106517:154"/>
but not killed; afflicted, but not in despair.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The signs and symptoms of an approaching final Judgment are not so decretory and peremptory that we should despair. God's signal Judgments have hitherto been accompanied with signs of mercies, and this is a plain case, that he is not fond of our destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that he had rather that we should live: <hi>He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</hi> He stands pausing and hesita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as he did once before, <hi>O Ephraim, how shall I give thee up, O Ephraim?</hi> O <hi>England,</hi> How shall I give thee up, O <hi>England?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What mean else those Alternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and those mixtures, and combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of wonderful Judgments, and of wonderful deliverances and mercies which our ears have heard,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:106517:155"/>
and our eyes have seen?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We have heard with our ears, and our Fathers have told us what wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deliverances he wrought in their time of old.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have seen vicissitudes great and prodigious, mixtures and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations, marvellous in our eyes, horrible destructions and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful restitutions, succeeding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, raging Plagues at home, and signal Victories abroad.</p>
                  <p>God hath filled us with bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and covered us with ashes: But it <hi>is his mercy that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.</hi> If the arm of his Justice and Severity hath been made bare, that it might be seen of all the people, He hath not left his mercy without witness. If his Judgment hath been great and terrible, in that which is consumed, his Mercy is wonderful
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:106517:155"/>
and miraculous in that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. Plainly! <hi>except the Lord had left us a Remnant,</hi> (and visibly interposed to do it,) we should not have had this place wherein to humble our selves before him. <hi>We should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was he that in <hi>the midst of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remembred mercy;</hi> when the flaming vengeance was in its height, when in the opinion of all men it had arrived at the state of irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and when every mans heart failed him, when the hopes of all men were sunk into despair; He checked the domineering venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, he put up the flaming Sword, he controul'd the streaming waves of fire, and said <hi>thus farr shall ye come and no further.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a wondeful manner he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the Goods and Persons of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:106517:156"/>
the poor Inhabitants of the City.</p>
                  <p>He restreined the rage of our enemies, that cryed concerning our <hi>Jerusalem, Down with it, Down with it, Aha! so would we have it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He suffered not a foreign Enemy to land, nor our domestick foes to make a head in our confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>He was a wall of fire about the the persons of our Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and his Royal Highness, and of those valiant Noble Persons which adventured boldly and strenuously, and indefatigably la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured the publique preservation.</p>
                  <p>He hath given signal Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Victories to our Fleets abroad, he hath restored our High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and Noble Generals, and our Fleet in health and safety.</p>
                  <p>He hath given us plenty of all things necessary for the life of man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:106517:156"/>In one great word, to sum up an aggregation of great and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mercies, he hath upheld our Religion and our Government in peace; and for an earnest of his further preservation, he hath given us this seasonable opportunity with health and safety in this place to attend the Publique Service, to advise and assist in this arduous Juncture of affairs</p>
                  <p>Arduous and difficult indeed it is, to restore our City and defend our Country, to restore the Houses of God, and Publique Buildings, to re-edifie ten Thousand private ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations; to sustein the poor and needy, to preserve the rights, and properties of men; to find such a temper of Justice and equity, <hi>that there be no decay, no just com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining in our Streets.</hi> To up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Traffick of the Nation, and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:106517:157"/>
to keep it in order and security, free from private Robberies and publick Insurrections; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in order to all those ends, to uphold our religion in the zealous and effectual exercise, in the sincerity and uniformity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to preserve it from encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and undermining Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ruinous to Religion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to the Government of the Nation. And all this while to make provision against our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and cruel enemies, <hi>Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,</hi> the <hi>French, Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>Dane,</hi> who have conspired to our destruction.</p>
                  <p>These things are arduous, but not insuperable; difficult, but not to be despaired of.</p>
                  <p>Concerning <hi>Jerusalem</hi> burned and laid wast by the <hi>Assyrians, Daniel</hi> foretold, that the <hi>streets and
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:106517:157"/>
the walls thereof should be rebuilded even in troubleous times;</hi> and when the time came that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edified, we read in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that the labourers in one hand held the trowel, and the other held a weapon; one half of the people laboured in the work, and the other half held the Spears and the Shields, the Bows and the Habergeons, because of their cruel enemies on every side.</p>
                  <p>If God shall be pleased to give us a spirit of Understanding, and <hi>teach our Senators Wisdom;</hi> If he shall pour out a publick spirit upon our Councils, a spirit of tenderness and compassion, of Justice and Equity, Temperance and Frugality, Fortitude and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity; If all Orders and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees amongst us, Civil, and Military, and Ecclesiastical shall
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:106517:158"/>
take to themselves the spirits of Christians and of men.</p>
                  <p>If our Counsels and endeavours shall be answerable to the care and benignity, to the servour and strenuous industry of our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sovereign, and to the ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity and magnanimity of our couragious and generous Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; then (speaking humanely, and abstracting from our Deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) we need not greatly fear, but we may yet subdue the pride and insolence of our barbarous Enemies; we may yet behold our City rising out of its ashes in greater splendour than we have seen it heretofore.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore arise, and gird your selves O ye Princes, ye Nobles, ye Rulers of our <hi>Israel!</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult, Consider, and give sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. <hi>Men, Brethren, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:106517:158"/>
let us arise and labour; let us up and be doing, <hi>be strong and of good courage,</hi> and the good hand of our God shall be upon you; he shall give you the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be the defenders of your Country, he shall make you <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairers of the breaches, restorers of our City to dwell in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I cannot, I may not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to put you in remembrance of this one thing; <hi>Except the Lord build the City, their labour is but lost that build it.</hi> It is not our wisdom or industry, much less our confidence, that will do it, unless God be for us; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will God be for us, unless we turn from the evil of our ways: except we repent, we have reason to fear, that what we have seen hitherto, will be no more but the beginning of our
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:106517:159"/>
sorrows. The Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Lord sent a word unto Jacob, and it lighted on Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; and all the people shall know that say in the pride and stoutness of their hearts, the Bricks are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, but we will build with hewn Stones; the Sycamores are down, but we will change them into Cedars. Therefore the Lord will set up their adversaries, and joyn their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies together, the Syrians before, and the Philistims behind, and they shall devour Israel with open mouth; Because this people turneth not to him that smiteth them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherefore turn you, turn you every one from the evil of his ways. Let us search our hearts, and try our ways, and turn to</hi> him that hath smitten us. <hi>Turn unto him with all our hearts, with fasting and with weeping, and mourning; be

hath smitten us, and he will heal us, because his compassions fail not. Come and let us reason together, saith God, though your sins were as scarlet, they shall be white as snow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is yet a way open to take away the terror of our Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Judgment, and to prevent a final Judgment from falling upon the Nation. We are yet in the Land of hope, and space is given for Repentance, the door of mercy is not yet shut upon us, nor the ears of our Judge sealed against us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O that men would therefore praise the Lord for his Goodness, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the wonders that he hath done for the children of men! that hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our Iniquities;</hi> that hath not cut us off in the midst of our sins, nor in the height of our impenitencies
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:106517:160"/>
snatched us away to Judgment; that hath not dealt with us as with the Apostate Angels, and with Thousands of our Brethren, who were better and more righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than we.</p>
                  <p>Let us once more then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into our selves. Let us consider our condition, let us veiw over and ballance the grounds of our hopes, and the reasons of our fears: Let us take an exact account of our whole estate and interest in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all our concernments, National and Personal, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Eternal. Let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate and advise what is to be done, and what is to be avoided.</p>
                  <p>Did I say deliberate? Whether we shall save our souls from utter darkness and everlasting
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:106517:160"/>
burnings? Whether we shall save the Nation from final ruine and desolation? — Nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us break off our sins by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and our Iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us make our selves <hi>friends of the Mammon of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that when we fail, we may be received into everlasting habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us <hi>lend unto the Lord,</hi> that we may have <hi>treasure in Heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us fast <hi>the fast that the Lord hath chosen; Loose the bands of wickedness, feed the hungry, cloath the naked; he that hath two Coats, let him give to him that hath none; and he that hath
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:106517:161"/>
meat let him do likewise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such an occasion scarce hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in many hundreds of years; and for motives to charity, they are all comprised in that great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Judgment to come.</p>
                  <p>When the Son of Man shall come to Judgment, and shall <hi>sit upon the Throne of his Glory:</hi> When <hi>all Nations shall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered before him,</hi> and he <hi>shall set the Sheep on his right hand, and the Goats on his left:</hi> This shall be the mark of their discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He shall</hi> say to those on his right hand, I was hungry, and ye fed me; thirsty, and ye gave me drink; naked, and ye cloathed me; sick and in prison, and ye visited me; Come ye blessed of my Father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Kingdom prepared for you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:106517:161"/>
                     <hi>And he</hi> shall say unto them on the left hand, I was hungry, and ye fed me not; thirsty, and ye gave me no drink, <hi>&amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> go ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</p>
                  <p>The way is short and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious to save all our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests. <hi>What doth the Lord require of us but to do justly, to love mercy, to walk humbly before the Lord our God? Let us be merciful therefore as our heavenly Father is merciful,</hi> and <hi>let us humble our selves under the Almighty hand of God,</hi> as we pretend to do this day. Let us betake our selves afore-hand to our Judge, and pour out our complaints before him. <hi>Let us confess our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and be sorry for our sins.</hi> Let us lay hold on the feet of our
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:106517:162"/>
Blessed Redeemer, and give him no rest till he hath sealed our pardon. Let us bathe with our tears the wounds that we have made. Let us cry mightily to the Throne of Grace. Let us wrestle and strive with our Redeemer, and not let <hi>him go until he bless us:</hi> Until he open our eyes to see the dangers we are in, and through his mercy shew us a way to escape them. Till he quicken us up to resolutions of amendment, and carry us strongly through these resolutions. Until he heal our backslidings, and make up our breaches: Until he save our souls from death, and our Nation from destruction.</p>
                  <p>To work our selves to these Resolutions, and to fix us in them, to make them abide upon us all our days, let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:106517:162"/>
what hath been spoken, and let us frequently meditate upon that Sarcastical Concession of the Text,</p>
                  <p>Rejoyce O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy youth; walk in the ways of thy heart, and the sight of thy eyes; But know, that for all these things God will bring thee to Judgment.</p>

                  <p>ALthough I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out apprehension, that the frequencie of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential discourses, and the seeming easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of repentance may indispose
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:106517:165"/>
some persons for such an attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as is necessary both to spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and hearers, for a due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Offices, which we are about; yet I shall not spend time in making Apologies for the Argument, which I have chosen.</p>
                  <p>Among all the aggravations of our sins, there is none more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, than the frequent hearing of our duty: Among all the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of our lives, there is none more fatal, than that concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the easiness of the duty of Repentance.</p>
                  <p>To discover the fallacy, and to prevent the dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this imagination, I have chosen at this time to treat of this instructive instance of the Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:106517:165"/>If Repentance were so easie as is imagined, why did not these men repent, that are mentioned in the words, which I have read?</p>
                  <p>They had not only the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Nature, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Scriptures to move them to it; they had the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of Angels to perswade them; they had Thunders and Trumpets to awaken them, and rouze them up: they had signs and wonders in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven above, and in the earth below: they had providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al instances of prodigious judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and wonderful mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                  <p>They were spectators of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Plagues brought upon their neighbours; they were Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of singular mercies and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:106517:166"/>
deliverances a long time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to themselves.</p>
                  <p>When thousands fell beside them, they were a remnant kept alive; when others were destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they were preserved; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, to try whether yet they would repent.</p>
                  <p>I say the persons in the Text were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the rest</hi> of the men that were not killed by those Plagues: <hi>And the rest of the men that were not killed, yet repented not of the works of their hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My endeavours at this time will be, by shewing the danger and fatal consequences of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, to move my self and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to repent. And to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine precisely who these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were, of what Nation, of what Church, of what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:106517:166"/>
in what time they lived, what were the Plagues brought upon them, when and how they were executed, and such other particulars, I am no way obliged by the design which I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                  <p>About these particulars Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors extremely differ; in this they all agree, that they had the advantage of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to bring them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>Whatever is the exact, either liberal, or mystical meaning of this vision of the seven Angels, and the seven Trumpets; and of that losty tragical Scheme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is represented, thus much is evident, that notwithstanding all Gods dealings with men to bring them to repentance, they will sometimes continue in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:106517:167"/>
and that this is an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible provocation.</p>
                  <p>The words which I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen contain the sad result of the labours of six Angels, the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of six Trumpets, the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of six Plagues, and six De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances.</p>
                  <p>And they are the common node, or term, connecting the Antecedent parts of the vision (beginning at the <hi>8th.</hi> Chapter) with the Catastrophe thereof (delivered in the <hi>10th.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>They are to be considered two ways.</p>

From the form and manner of the words (as they are an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphonema</hi> expressing a kind of wonder, and admiration) I shall observe the strangeness of the impenitency, of such men as these, considered in common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the matter of them, I shall observe the frequencie of such impenitencie in common experience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the relative conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the words (as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect the Catastrophe of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion with the Antecedent parts of it) I shall observe the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table consequence of this impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency: And</p>

                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:106517:168"/>4. Conclude with a few words of Application.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. First then to bring to our apprehension the strangeness of impenitencie of such men as these (considered <hi>in Thesi,</hi> and in Theory) it will be needful on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reflect upon the causes of admiration, and to lay before you some of their advantages, and Motives to Repentance.</p>
                  <p>Things wonderful in their nature are those, whose causes are unsearchable; things strange and admirable to common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son are such as happen contrary to the Laws of Nature, and of Reason.</p>
                  <p>From the former cause the motion of the heavens is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; from the latter it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious and admirable, that <hi>the sun stood still in Gibeon, and the

moon in the valley of Ajalon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That God should take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage upon the lapsed Angels, that upon their offence he should bind them up in chains, that he should exclude them from the benefit of Repentance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them to the Judgement of the Great Day.</p>
                  <p>That he should allow this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to lapsed men; that he should reveal himself to them; that he should make them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand their duty, and their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; that he should set before them good and evil, happiness and misery, the desire and the detestation of humane nature; that he should by all means court and wooe them to that which all men naturally desire; and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, and divert them from that which they naturally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr:
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:106517:169"/>
That after all this he should not prevail in such a case as this; that they should scornful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject the end of all their hopes; that they should studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pursue the object of all their fears; This is that rational wonder that I am now to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you.</p>
                  <p>To manifest this wonder a little more explicitely, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the advantages of Nature, and the Motives from Scripture to bring men to repentance.</p>
                  <p>The grounds and fundamental elements of the Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance are these: The Being &amp; Attributes of God; The immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Souls of men; The principles of <hi>Synteresis;</hi> The terrours of natural Conscience; The forecasts of vengeance; The apprehension and desire of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:106517:170"/>

                  <p>Again, he sets before us a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of glorious instances to shew that never any penitent was
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:106517:175"/>
rejected, however heinous, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever numerous were their sins. The prodigal <hi>devoured his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with harlots:</hi> Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen <hi>had seven Devils: Peter</hi> denyed his Master <hi>with</hi> horrid <hi>oaths, and imprecations: Saul was</hi>

                  <p>He had delivered <hi>Israel</hi> seven times, and they <hi>forsook him;</hi> and he said, <hi>he would deliver them no more;</hi> but they repented, <note place="margin">Jud. 10. 10, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>and his soul was</hi> straight-way <hi>grieved,</hi> and he delivered them.</p>
                  <p>Instead of many, consider that one instance of <hi>Manasses,</hi> the evil son of good King <hi>Hezekiah: He</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 33.</note>

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:106517:176"/>
caused his sons to pass through the fire; he observed times, used in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, dealt with familiar spirits, and with wizards; made Judah, and Jerusalem to do worse than the heathen. And the Lord spake to him, and he would not hear.</hi> After all this, <hi>in his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions he humbled himself, and then God was intreated, and heard his supplication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His ways are not as our ways:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Isa. 55. 8.</note> He forgave <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and <hi>Jonah</hi> was displeased exceedingly; he taxes him with easiness in relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he charges him as if he had an ancient known infirmity of flexibility to his veracity, and the honour of his Prophets: <hi>Lord</hi> (saith he) <hi>was not this my saying?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jon. 4. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>and therefore I prevented it to flee to Tarshish; for I knew that thou art merciful;—therefore take, I
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:106517:176"/>
beseech thee, my life from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His thoughts are not as our thoughts:</hi> when <hi>Nathan</hi> had told <hi>David</hi> a story of a poor man, who had his ewe Lamb ravished from him, then <hi>David was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wroth, and he swore, As</hi>

                     <hi>the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely dye:</hi> But when <hi>David,</hi> who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> and murthered <hi>Vriah,</hi> said, <hi>I have sinned; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> said unto <hi>David, The Lord hath put away thy sin, thou shalt not dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other side, we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of horrible judgements for Impenitency; whereof I shall after take occasion to speak.</p>
                  <p>Now considering all these things, is it not strange, that men should not repent? That no consideration of ingenuity, or of
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:106517:177"/>
interest should move them to it? That neither the Law written in their hearts, nor that which was delivered by the mediation of Angels, nor the Gospel given us by the Son of God should bring them to it? That neither reason, nor experience; neither mercies nor judgements; neither the sweetness of a good conscience, nor the torments of a bad; the beauties of vertue, nor the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of sin; the shortness of life, nor length of eternity; the lightness of things present, nor the <hi>exceeding weight</hi> of those which are to come? That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Death nor Life, nor Angels, nor Trumpets; <hi>nor things present, nor thing to come; nor height nor depth, nor any other thing should be able to separate men from the love of</hi> sin?</p>

                     <pb n="349" facs="tcp:106517:177"/>Is it not strange? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, the Prophets were astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this; nay, God himself seems to be affected with wonder: <hi>Hear, Oheavens, and give ear, O</hi>

                  <p>This is that wonder consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it self according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reason, the object of our first observation, drawn from the form and manner of the words by way of <hi>Epiphonema,</hi> expressed by the particle <hi>yet; yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented not.</hi>

                  <p n="2">II.

                  <p>THese words are part of a Song made by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;</hi> and both the song it self, and these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular words are so very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, that I should think it a disrespect put upon the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a venerable intelligent auditory, to be very laborious in gathering arguments to perswade
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:106517:205"/>
your attention to them: the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the antiquity, the penman, do all render it considerable.</p>
                  <p>For as for the subject matter of the song, it contain in it (as the Hebrew writers have observed) a summary of the law, or penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Consider it as a piece of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, there is hardly any poem so venerable: it was written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Homer,</hi> or <hi>Hesiod, Orphens,</hi> or <hi>Linus, David's</hi> or <hi>Asaph's</hi> poems; and except a piece of the same hand, it is the most antient song, that is extant in the world.</p>
                  <p>It was penn'd by one of the most considerable persons: look upon him humanely, and he was very remarkable, for his abstruse learning; (<hi>He was learned in all</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acts7. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>the learning of the Egyptians</hi>) for his military conduct; for his
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:106517:205"/>
policy in administration of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for his felicity in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a law so suitable to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of the people; that after so many thousand years it alone of all antient laws continues in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to this day.</p>
                  <p>But if we look upon him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to God, there was none like unto him; he conversed with God face to face; he was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his secrets, he was entrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the administration of his powers in signs and wonders, in the sight of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was inspired and dictated not by the Muses, or <hi>Apollo,</hi> but by God himself; <hi>Write thee this song,</hi> and <hi>he wrote this song the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">32. 19. v. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>same day</hi> whilest he was yet <hi>Deo plenus;</hi> before the divine <hi>afflatus,</hi> before his transport and rage had left him: and therefore although
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:106517:206"/>
he was the meekest, and most modest man upon the earth; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he resolutely declined his Embassy (till God was angry) because he was <hi>not eloquent,</hi> but <note place="margin">Exod. 4. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>of a stammering speech,</hi> yet now being conscious of that Spirit, which moved within him; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends and justifies this song; he undertakes for the fluency, and <note place="margin">Deut. 31. 30, 32.</note> smoothness, and the exuberance of it; he summons the tribes to record the expressions of his rage; he calls upon heaven and earth to hear the verses made by indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; by indignation kindled and conceived by the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the greatness, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of God, and his goodness in his dealings with this people of <hi>Israel;</hi> and of the unworthiness of their return: <hi>Give ear, O Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> saith he, <hi>and I will speak;
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:106517:206"/>
and hearken O earth to the words of my mouth, my doctrine shall drop as the rain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The song indeed it self is large and very satyrical; but the great argument or burthen of it is in the words of my text: <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words are (as I said) the burthen or argument of the song applicable to every part of it, repetible at the end of every stanza, and indeed of every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.</p>
                  <p>God is a rock, his work is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, his ways are judgment: They have corrupted themselves, they are spotted, perverse, and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Do ye thus requite the Lord?</p>
                  <p>But more particularly, God hath been good to <hi>Israel,</hi> he
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:106517:207"/>
raised him from nothing, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed him from bondage, he was his Protector, his Guide, his Proveditore, his food was of the most delicious, his drink was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, of the <hi>pure blood of the grape,</hi> and <hi>he grew fat</hi> upon it— <hi>But</hi> Jeshurun <hi>waxed fat and kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> Do ye thus requite, <hi>O popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le ingrate</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>)?</p>
                  <p>Again; well; but will God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this base ingratitude? doth he not see it, or not resent it? doth it not move him? can he not, will he not revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon them? Yes, <hi>the Lord saw it, and was moved to Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; a fire was kindled in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Interest, which these words have in the song; and they consist of two general parts:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:106517:207"/>1. An expostulation; <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A censure; <hi>O foolish peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and unwise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former of these needs no explication, being an ardent and vehement exprobration of the ingratitude of this people; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every word is weighty, and very Emphatical. The manner of the retribution, the parties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting and Requited. Ye men! Ye men of <hi>Israel!</hi> do ye make such a requital? such a requital to the Lord?</p>
                  <p>To requite evil for good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Equals is against the light of the sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> and much more against the light of <hi>Israel.</hi> But for <hi>Israel</hi> after their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and their experiences to do despight to the great and the gracious, and the terrible, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

divided the Sea for their passage, and clove the rocks for their sustenance, and covered them with a Cloud for their protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and they sinned yet the more. <hi>They tempted him, they spoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, they provoked him at the sea, even at the red Sea: they turned back and tempted God, and limited the holy one of Israel.</hi> In one word; they were a rebellious house, a stiff-necked people; they kept not the Covenant which <note place="margin">Ezek. 44.

                  <p>This was their behaviour, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then when Gods miracles were fresh, and <hi>Moses</hi> was still among them. And God foresaw that after his decease they would

provoke him yet more. This was that requital, which stirred and inflamed the spirit of <hi>Moses;</hi> and quickned him to that abrupt Expostulation, the first general part of the text, whereof I have hitherto been giving an account, <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have seen some part of <hi>Israels</hi> ingratitude; it follows that we consider the <hi>Turpitude</hi> and the <hi>Imprudence</hi> of this ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which gave occasion for the censure here passed upon them, (O <hi>foolish</hi> people and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</hi>) And first of the <hi>Turpitude</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">II.</note> of their ingratitude, whereby it will appear that they were <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> Now to set forth the unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their in gratitude against God in all the aggravations of it, it is a task too heavy for me (nay, even for Angels;) and <hi>Moses</hi>
                     <pb n="427" facs="tcp:106517:216"/>
when he was inspired, and in the height of his rapture, did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it; but making a chasme, and drawing a veil over that part, insinuates it to be unexpressible. I shall not therefore offer at im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities, but follow the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which the Scriptures have provided for us in like cases. It is the manner of the Scriptures in things concerning God, which are incomprehensible, to bait the mind, and train it on by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising it in the Analogy of things familiar. The love <hi>of God</hi> to his chosen people is incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; to give us therefore a little notion of it, the Prophet brings men to the consideration of the love of a mother to her child; <hi>can a Mother forget her Child</hi> &amp;c? The love <hi>of Man</hi> to God holds no proportion to his Excellency, and
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:106517:217"/>
his goodness; and the heart in judging of it is obnoxious to mistakes, and very deceitful; therefore the Apostle helps us towards an apprehension of it. <hi>He that loves not his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;</hi>

                     <hi>whom he hath seen; how can he love God, whom he hath not seen?</hi> So seeing the turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of mens ingratitude to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God is ineffable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable, it will be requisite to speak a little of the unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Ingratitude towards men, and leave you to work out this proportion; <hi>Look how high the heaven is in comparison of the earth,</hi> so great, nay infinitely grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the unworthiness of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude towards God.</p>
                  <p>And here I shall not go about to Philosophize, or to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the turpitude of ingratitude,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:106517:217"/>
from the nature of it, <hi>à pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori.</hi> The immediate and evident corollaries of natural principles, admit only of jejune and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable reasonings in that kind of demonstration. The odious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of ingratitude is such a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary, naturally and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flowing from that universal maxim, <hi>quod tibi fieri non vis,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 7. 12.</note> &amp;c. which runs thorow all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; and is not only the last resolution of Philosophy, but of the Law and the Prophets, and of the Gospel. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 31. As therefore, when an abstruse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in matter of speculation is resolved into an evident prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, or the contrary position into a plain absurdity, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrator goes no further, but hath said all that can be perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently spoken: so when a piece
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:106517:218"/>
of doubtful Morality is once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into this grand absurdity, <hi>Omnia dixeris,</hi> there is no more to be added, all the rest is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution.</p>
                  <p>It is said that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> made no law against ingratitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Nature had made one to his hand. So some Divines have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, <note place="margin">Prov. 17. 13.</note> that there is no direct precept against ingratitude in the Scripture, though many te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies in effect against it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was needless, as being supposed from the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and below the Majestie of the spirit breathing in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to insist upon it (according to that of our Saviour, <hi>If ye love and do good, and lend to them</hi>

of <hi>Israels</hi> ingratitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, though it cannot be perfectly, yet it may in some measure be collected.</p>
                  <p>It remains that we consider the imprudence of it: <hi>O foolish people and unwise.</hi>

                  <p n="3">III. I may not, I need not insist long upon this Argument.

                  <p n="1">1. Did not God know their behaviour? The Psalmist indeed tells of a brutish people, which wrought all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and yet they said, <hi>The Lord shall not see it, neither shall the</hi>

in reference to the political frame of our Government, Civil and Ecclesiastical, hath he not made us?</p>
                  <p>It was in reference to this that <hi>Moses</hi> asked this question; and to help their understandings in the consideration of it for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, in the words immediately following he calls upon them to search into their antiquities, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon their original, and their progress. <hi>Remember,</hi> saith he, <hi>the days of old, and consider the years of many generations.

one with another, and among themselves; he mixed and blended them by many a terrible combat and collision; he polish'd the roughness of them; by the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Gospel he fermented and matured and sweetned them, till by his powerful word light was brought out of darkness; out of a multitude of disorders and confusions sprang forth a noble well-tempered form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; System of Laws Civil &amp; Ecclesiastical, equal at least to those of any other people; har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniously conspiring (if duly executed) to conserve all estates, orders, and degrees in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est happiness whereof any socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is capable; conducting us by the hand of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and their subordinate Ministers, to the great ends of the great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance

Surely <hi>this</hi> also <hi>hath been of the Lords doing,</hi> in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Society Civil and Sacred: it is he that hath made us, and not we our selves.

that also in both capacities, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal and national.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For our persons spiritually and temporally; hath he not bought our souls at a price; hath he not offered us a plenteous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by the blood of the everlasting Covenant, redeemed us from the curse of the Law, the bondage of Sin, the power of Satan, the wrath of God? Again, is there any one single person to whom he hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven many a temporal deliverance (known and unknown, or at least-wise unconsidered?) Hath not he redeemed us from the prison of the womb, from the hazards of our infancy, from the perils of our childhood, from the wildness and precipitancy of youth, from the snares and entanglements of our riper years?
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:106517:232"/>
Is there any one whom he hath not redeemed <hi>from six troubles and from seven,</hi> in our bodies, estates, liberty, reputation? whom he hath not powerfully and frequently rescued from the folly and perverseness of our selves, from the malice of our neighbours, from the rage of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils? Hath he not redeemed us in our personal capacities?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hath he not redeemed our <hi>nation</hi> again and again, in all its interest civil and sacred? Who else was it that delivered our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and our selves from Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme and Idolatry, from Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Superstition, from fanatical Anarchy, and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>To omit former deliverances, can we forget how it is but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while since the wrath of God
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:106517:233"/>
was poured out upon this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the uttermost? since our Sun was turned into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and our Moon into blood, our stars ravisht from their Orbs, the Royal father Martyred, the Son banished, the Nobles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; the State dissolved, the Church destroyed, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Laws, Liberty, Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, torn away; our bones were dryed, our hope was gone, and we thought we had been clean cut off. Then <hi>when we cried unto the Lord in our trouble, he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us out of our distress: He sent redemption to his people, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our captivity as the Rivers of the South; then was our mouth fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with laughter, and our tongue with Joy.</hi> The Symptoms of joy and triumph were heard, and seen in all the corners of the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:106517:233"/>
land; nay <hi>the Sea roared, and the floods clapped their hands,</hi> the hills and the heavens resounded because of the redemption; for <hi>he cometh, for he cometh-</hi> &amp;c. And now I say unto you, hath he not redeemed us?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hath he not established us? that is to say, the Estalish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we enjoy, is it not all from him? and hath not he done his part for our establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? our spiritual and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, our private, our publick e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment?</p>
                  <p>Doth not the God of all grace continually press upon us the means of grace, calling us to his Eternal glory; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to make us perfect, to establish, strengthen, and settle us in his truth, to establish us in the faith, and in holiness, to
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:106517:234"/>
strengthen our inward man, that we may be rooted and grounded and built up in him, to a lively hope, and an humble assurance of eternal life.</p>
                  <p>All spiritual Establishment, is it not from God? is there any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son within the verge of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Dominions, for whom God hath not provided plentiful means for this Establishment?</p>
                  <p>Again, for our temporal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate condition, is there any one of us destitute of some sort of provision, subsistance; some sort of settlement, or Establishment? Is there any one that hears, or hears me not, for whom God hath not provided some honest way of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment by donation of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Founders and Benefactors, by legal descent, by voluntary Bequest, (<hi>houses which they</hi>

Are not every one of these from the Lord? is any one destitute of one or more of these ways of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment, or that can answer', that God hath made no provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them? hath he not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us our temporal establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, hath not God done his part towards a National and a publick establishment of this Church and Kingdom?</p>
                  <p>Hath he not in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to resetled our gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign in the throne of his Royal Predecessors? Re-established the Church upon its rightful Basis

In one word therefore to conclude this first enquiry, hath not God

dealt with us as he did with <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael;</hi> hath he not <hi>made</hi> us, <hi>redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> us, <hi>established</hi> us?</p>
                  <p>The next consideration ought to be, whether we have not so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited the Lord as they requited him. Whether our behaviour hath not been answerable to that of <hi>Israel,</hi> in reference both to the foolish part, and the unwise. And here alas! how clear and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous is the parallel in respect of

                  <p>Have we not dealt, do we not deal ungratefully with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and instruments of all our mercies? Have all Gods me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and various dealings with us prevailed so far as to bring our persons to repentance, or our Kingdom to a Reformation? Have we been convinced, or have
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:106517:236"/>
we not been hardened by his wonders, converted to his fears or sealed up into a sottish stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and senseless contempt of Religion, a spirit of Atheism, and downright infidelity?</p>
                  <p>Do we not murmur against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron?</hi> do not some amongst us still abet the cause of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram?</hi> are not some of us ready to make them a Captain, and to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Egypt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Have we not soon <hi>forgot God our saviour?</hi> have we not <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered him with our lips, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled with him in our double heart?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do we not despise our very Manna; and wish again for the Garlick of <hi>Egypt?</hi> ready to change our glory for the Calves of <hi>Egypt</hi> or the confusion of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon?</hi>
                     <pb n="467" facs="tcp:106517:236"/>
In a word, are we not <hi>a sinful people laden with iniquity,</hi> as ingrateful and Nabalistical as <hi>Israel,</hi> a foolish people?</p>
                  <p>Again, for matter of impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, wherewithal can we purge our selves from it?</p>
                  <p>Doth not God know our miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages also? doth he not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand us &amp; our ways? and doth he not interest himself in us? doth he not resent our provocations? can we escape for our wickedness? With what apologies shall we <hi>come before the Lord, and bow our selves before the high God?</hi> Have we had no caveats from the Ministers of God, no warnings, no Alarms from God himself? have we not heard, have we not seen, hath it not been told us? The thunders, and the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, the trumpets sounding,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:106517:237"/>
the mountain smoaking, the Angel destroying, the Sword de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring. Are we able to contest with a jealous God? are we stronger than he? are we able to tear him out of his Throne, or to devest him of his Thunder, or to stand the storm of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery indignation? Have we not been a foolish people &amp; unwise!</p>
                  <p>What then remains, but that God should execute upon us the sentence which we our selves have been ready to pass upon the people in the text, that he should do thus, and thus, unto us; that <hi>he should consume us in a moment, and blot out our names from under Heaven?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, rather it remains (men and brethren) lest he should do thus, and thus, unto us, that we prepare to meet the Lord our
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:106517:237"/>
God; that we rouze up the spirit of our minds, and discuss and scatter that Lethargic stupor that is upon us: <hi>Awake, awake, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah; and arise, Barak, the son of Ahinoam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who can tell but God may yet have mercy upon us, may have mercy upon our souls, and speak peace to our land!</p>

                  <p>Wherefore let every one of us examine himself and find out the plague of his own heart, and be deeply sensible of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude; let us search and try our ways, and turn again unto

                  <head>AN <hi>APOLOGY</hi> FOR THE Mysteries of the GOSPEL.</head>
                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>ROM. I. 16.</bibl>
                     <q>For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ: For it is the power of God to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE former part of this Text (being delivered in terms unusual) hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded matter of Disputation to Interpreters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106517:241"/>The Question is, Whether it be to be taken for a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; or to be understood simply, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to the usual import and meaning of such expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>That St. <hi>Paul,</hi> so long after his Miraculous Conversion, (a little before his Appeal to <hi>Caesar</hi>) drawing near to the finishing of his Course.</p>
                  <p>That St. <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had planted the Gospel, from <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> round about unto <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 19.</note> after the composing of all those excellent Epistles written before his bonds, whereof this Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi> was the last.</p>
                  <p>That St. <hi>Paul</hi> (I say) after all this, should descend to so poor an Expression as might insinuate, that there was something in the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106517:241"/>
Gospel, whereof it was possible, that some of the <hi>Romans</hi> might imagine that he ought to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>(That in the judgement of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Gospel should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister occasion for the Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and Amolition of so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible a Prejudice,)</p>
                  <p>It seems to many very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and therefore they say that the words are a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and that the Apostle in saying that he was not ashamed of the Gospel, intended to signifie that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulted and gloried in it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, we finde our Apostle, not only in his other Epistles <note place="margin">1 Tim. I. II.</note> (and in his Apologies) but in <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 4. 3. 7. 10. 8.</note> this Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> often magnifying his Office, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in the Ministry of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel which he had received; he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106517:242"/>
styles it the light of the glorious Gospel, a Ministration exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glorious, and professes that if he should boast of his Authority, he should not be ashamed.</p>
                  <p>Yet (with submission to better Judgements) I humbly conceive that he is not so to be understood in this place.</p>
                  <p>Though the Epistle was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to those at <hi>Rome,</hi> which were already Christians; yet this passage was put in with reference to others, to whom the Epistle was to be communicated (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons not yet converted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.) To them who were <note place="margin">Ver. 8. <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus.</hi>
                     </note> already called to be Saints, whose Faith was spoken of throughout the World; to talk of not being ashamed of the Gospel, had been a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> very incongruous.</p>
                  <p>But (on the other side) for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106517:242"/>
him who (by his original Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission) was constituted the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <note place="margin">Act. 22. 21.</note> of all the Gentiles, made a debtor to them all (as he sayes;) <note place="margin">Ver. 14.</note> to the Wise as well as unwise, to the Greeks and Romans as well as the Barbarians.</p>
                  <p>That he, who in pursuance of this Commission, had already planted the Gospel amongst the more Barbarous Nations, from <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> as far as <hi>Lystra</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acts 14.</note> and <hi>Derbe,</hi> Cities of <hi>Lycaonia;</hi> and among the Greeks, in all the chief Cities of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia</hi> (from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> round about unto <hi>Illyricum</hi>) so that nothing now remained but to Preach at <hi>Rome</hi> (as he speaks Emphatically) at <hi>Rome</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>That he, whose Preaching <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 1.</note> was not in a way of Humane wisdom or excellency of speech
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106517:243"/>
(in the way either of Rhetorical Harangue or Philosophical argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation) intending to preach at <hi>Rome</hi> (the Seat of the Empire of the World) the Resort of the Noble, the Mighty, and the Wise, of all those who in the Phrase of our time, are styled the <hi>Beaux esprits,</hi> the Wits and Braveries of the World.</p>
                  <p>Briefly, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who knew the Prejudices which these men had against the Gospel, and with what Contempt and Scorn they generally looked upon it (as a Dispensation whereof a man ought to be ashamed.)</p>
                  <p>That St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who (as it appears by all his Epistles and Orations) well understood (the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) the Congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and decency of speaking or of writing; intending, before he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106517:243"/>
should conclude, (after he should have evinced the Excellency of the Gospel) to take strength and confidence, and glory in his <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 17.</note> Ministration; Being yet in his <hi>Prooemium</hi> only, whose Office is (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) by a modest and smooth insinuation, to make way for his Discourse which was to follow;</p>
                  <p>I say, that in <hi>this</hi> place of his Epistle, he should <hi>take notice of the Prejudices</hi> which lay against the Gospel, and plainly and clearly (without a <gap reason="foreign">

                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106517:244"/>And these are drawn from two heads and adjuncts of the Gospel:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Necessarily implied and presupposed, and that is <hi>Veritatis evidentia,</hi> (if the Gospel were not the truth of God it could not be the power of God.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Explicitely and expresly proposed, and that is <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutis excellentia,</hi> it is the Power of God to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (and that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) to every one that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <q>I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to Salvation to every one that believeth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that I am to speak of these two general Heads:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Of the Prejudices against the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:106517:245"/>II. Of the Iniquity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness of those Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices.</p>
                  <p>From whence it will follow that we ought to Preach the Gospel, and not to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which things I shall not endeavour at a Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Harangue, but crave leave that I may be admitted to speak in a plain and humble Analyti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Didactical way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Then, I am to speak of those Prejudices against the Gospel, from whence it is (by some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons) imagined, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospel ought to be ashamed of it.</p>
                  <p>And herein I shall</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Shew that there alwayes have been, and alwayes will
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106517:245"/>
be such Prejudices against the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Enquire what it is in the Systeme of the Gospel, which is the special object of these Prejudices.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then make a brief reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the nature and symptomes of the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And upon the Characters of the persons most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, That there alwayes have been, and alwayes will be, Prejudices against the Gospel (and an imagination in some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that Ministers and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians ought to be ashamed of it) is so deplorably manifest, that I need not insist upon either the proof or declaration of it.</p>
                  <p>That it is, and hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106517:246"/>
so, it is not only the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy complaint of the present Age, but hath been of every Age and Generation since the first Promulgation of the Gospel; And that it will be so, we have an infallible assurance from Christ and his Apostles; That the latter dayes shall be times of Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and departure from the Faith, that there will be Scoffers at the <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 1.</note> Gospel, and cruel Mockers, we have the assurance of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 3. Jude 18.</note> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Jude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That when the Son of man shall come to judge the World, <note place="margin">Luke 18. 8.</note> he shall hardly finde Faith on the Earth, we have the Prediction of our Lord Christ himself.</p>
                  <p>Briefly and summarily, our Lord Christ in several places of the Gospel, declares and suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106517:246"/>
that many will be offended at <note place="margin">Mat 23. 3. Mar. 8. 38.</note> him, that they will be ashamed of him, and of his words, both of his Person, and of his Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Our Apostle declares that he himself is not ashamed, exhorts <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 8, 12, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Timothy</hi> not to be ashamed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> that he was not ashamed; St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 16.</note> those that suffered for the Gospel not to be ashamed. If there had not been an imagination in the world that they ought to have been ashamed, to what end were all these Declarations, Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, Exhortations concerning being not ashamed?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I pass therefore to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing propounded, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what is the special Object of these Prejudices, or what are those things contained in the Gospel, whereof (in an especial
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106517:247"/>
manner) it is imagined that we ought to be ashamed.</p>
                  <p>Though the whole System of the Gospel lies under Prejudices, yet not all parts of it alike, some more than other, and some by reason of the other.</p>
                  <p>The whole Gospel is generally dividable into</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Historical Narrations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Moral Institutions and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Dogmatical Mysteries.</p>
                  <p>These are delivered sometimes distinctly and severally, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are combined and mixed together.</p>
                  <p>That there was such a person as Christ, that he was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> that <hi>Joseph</hi> was his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Father; The manner of his Life and of his Death, his Actions, and his Teachings,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106517:247"/>
are matters meerly Historical.</p>
                  <p>That this reputed Son of <hi>Joseph</hi> was indeed the Son of God, conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of a Virgin, and the like, have in them a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of the Mystery toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the History of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>[I stand not to shew, how the Morality is sometimes simply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and sometimes in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination with the Mysterious parts of the Gospel]</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now concerning those parts of the Gospel which are merely and simply <hi>Historical,</hi> and <hi>Moral,</hi> I suppose they cannot be here intended; Because that to such persons, as the <hi>Romans</hi> were, (men pretending to Reason and Philosophy) they afford no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for an imagination that a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106517:248"/>
Minister or Christian ought to be ashamed.</p>
                  <p>Supposing the truth of what is there delivered (whereof <note n="*" place="margin">In Serm. against Antiscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturists.</note> I have spoken heretofore) what was there in the Birth, or Life, or Death; the Conversation, or Actions, (ordinary, or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary) of Christ, or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, whereof in the opinion of a Philosopher, a Christian ought to be ashamed?</p>
                  <p>Was it the meanness of Christs Nativity? That he was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Son of <hi>Joseph,</hi> who was of a mean and despicable Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Was it that he lived an Ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory kinde of life? teaching and disputing concerning good and evil, happiness and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, in the Synagogues and in the Temple, and the Streets
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106517:248"/>
and Markets, and in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (every where) Preaching the Doctrine of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Or lastly, Was it because of the occasion and manner of his Death? because he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and Executed by his Countrey-men, upon an accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of corrupting the People, and making an Innovation in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, upon pretence of holding intercourse with God?</p>
                  <p>Every one of these circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances had been coincident in <hi>Socrates</hi> long before the time of the writing of this Epistle to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was the Son of <hi>Sophro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscus,</hi> as poor a man as <hi>Joseph</hi> (a Carver of Images in Stone) his Mother was a Midwife.</p>
                  <p>His Conversation was Ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory, discourfing and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106517:249"/>
at all times, and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (in <hi>Academia,</hi> in <hi>Lycaeo,</hi> in <hi>Foro,</hi> in places of walking, and of publick Exercise; (when he ate, or drank, or played) in the Camp, the Market, or the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) with all the men he met withall concerning Virtue and Vice, and the <hi>summum bonum;</hi> concerning Wisdom and Folly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noph. in Soc. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia.</note> And he had been condemned and executed by the <hi>Athenians,</hi> upon the very same pretences which were objected against our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Yet all these disadvantages had not hindred <hi>Socrates</hi> (at that time, after about 500 years) from the Admiration, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Adoration of all men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to Philosophy and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, not only amongst all the rest of the Gentile World, but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106517:249"/>
even amongst the <hi>Romans</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the mere <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi> part of the Gospel could mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister no colour of suspicion why a Minister or a Christian should be ashamed of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Moreover, the same may be said of those parts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel which are merely <hi>Practical,</hi> and <hi>Moral,</hi> (The Precepts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Piety and Justice, and Temperance in all the several branches of them, and the motives to them.)</p>
                  <p>The Morality of the Gospel infinitely excells the Institutions of any of the Heathen Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, all that they could object against it, was its too great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and holiness, that it puts a violence, and stretch upon Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, causing men to strain after degrees of purity and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106517:250"/>
sanctity unpracticable and unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable. It excells all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Institutes of the Jews, Christ made a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> even of the Moral Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and tells us, that the Righteousness of Christians must exceed the <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 20.</note> Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees; and the Apostle (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the entire Systems of the <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 6.</note> Mosaical and Christian Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomies in reference to Christian Duties and the motives to them,) justly pronounces, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian hath received a better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, founded upon better Promises.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It remains therefore, that the peculiar and special Object of those Prejudicate imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (whereby it is concluded, that Ministers and Christians ought to be ashamed) are the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106517:250"/>
                     <hi>Articles of mere Belief, Dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Mysteries</hi> of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>At the expence of your time and patience (in a long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) to tell you what are the Mysteries of the Gospel, were to suppose that (in compliance with the barbarity of later times) you had neglected to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in your Catechism, and had need that one should teach you what are the first Elements of Christianity. My design en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages me no further than only to name them, and that also very briefly.</p>
                  <p>In the two first Chapters to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> we finde our Apostle handling this Argument largely and <hi>ex professo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there he reduces the whole mystery to two words, namely, <hi>the Cross of Christ,</hi> he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106517:251"/>
tells them that he was sent to Preach and not to Baptize, that this was that which Christ sent him to Preach; and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to know nothing else among them, but <hi>Jesus Christ and him Crucified,</hi> and in <hi>Chap 1. v. 23.</hi> he declares <hi>this</hi> to have been the occasion of the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, taken both by Jews and Gentiles; I <hi>Preach Christ Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified to the Jews a stumbling-block,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scandal</hi> taken, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and the <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorian Office;</hi> the Character and Personal Concernment of Christ, and work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by his blood spilt upon the Cross, are the two great and comprehensive heads to which the whole Mystery of the Gospel
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106517:251"/>
is easily, naturally, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reducible.</p>
                  <p>The Justification, Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, entire Oeconomy of the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of man, depends immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon the work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by the blood of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The value and efficacy of his blood, resolves into the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his Person, and of his Nature; That he was the Son of God the Father, Conceived by the Holy Ghost, which Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are one.</p>
                  <p>So that in the last resolution, the conjunction of the Divine and Humane Natures in the Unity of the Person of Christ, and the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Persons in the Unity of the Nature of the Godhead, is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>And this is also the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that great thing whereof it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106517:252"/>
is imagined that a Christian or a Preacher ought to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>Which will be yet more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent if we shall make a brief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the Nature and Symptoms of the Prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gospel, and the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the persons more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially obnoxious to these Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Beside the consideration of Interest, (real or imaginary) and the disappointment of mens desires and expectations, (an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, eminent and predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ingredient in the prejudices of all men) there are two things which (in men pretending to prudence and vertue, or to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and understanding) are apt to create a distaste against any way of Institution, or any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106517:252"/>
wherein they are supposed or presumed to be.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>These are injurious to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Mankinde, and they put an indignity upon the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical reason and principles of men, and are apt to be distaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and offensive, instances whereof there are very many among the Heathens, (as among others that of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who banished <hi>Protagoras,</hi> and caused his Books to be burnt in the open Market-place, because he wrote doubtfully concerning the being of a God) But as for these, it hath not been in the power of malice to fasten them upon the Gospel, or in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of mistake to suppose them in it; so that it hath been clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exempted from this Prejudice.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:106517:253"/>2. The other thing that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates an aversion against any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>An Instance whereof we have in the sixth of St. <hi>John,</hi> where when Christ told those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him of eating his flesh and drinking his blood (speaking in a figure not obvious to their vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar understanding) they cryed out <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>And in matters of this nature men are more inclinable to fall
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106517:254"/>

                  <p>To shew the Iniquity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness of these Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices.</p>

                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:106517:256"/>And here I shall endeavour to evince two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is reason for the Contemners of the Gospel to be ashamed of their Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there is no reason for Christians or Ministers to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, There is reason for the Contemners of the Gospel to be ashamed.</p>
                  <p>Because their Contempt of it doth not proceed from any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous or Noble Principle or qualification, it comes not from height of Spirit or Wit, from depth of Reason or Judgement, from largeness of Learning or Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>But from the want of all these
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106517:257"/>
qualifications, and is finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved into an ungentile, and (if I may be permitted to speak plainly) a kinde of Rustical Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and want of Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. St. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the <hi>Thessalonian</hi> Jews with the <hi>Beraeans,</hi> saith that the <hi>Berae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were more Noble (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,) because they did not precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously, and temerariously reject the Gospel, as the others did, but were diligent in searching of the Scriptures daily, and in a strict enquiry concerning the Grounds and Motives to Belief alleadged by the Apostles (whether they were of that weight which was pretended) whether they were so or no.</p>
                  <p>In matters of so great moment as the Gospel doth pretend to be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106517:257"/>
(in reference to this world, and that which is to come) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise, or to reject the Proposals, without a just consideration of them, and without an imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and ingenuous examination (and full understanding) of the Grounds and Reasons, upon which they are propounded, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours not of Prudence or Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Wit or Learning, Ingenie or Ingenuity; in one word, it savours neither of a Gentleman, nor a Scholar.</p>
                  <p>Now that this is the Case in the Contempt of the Gospel, I think it will appear if we shall attentively consider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What was the Judgement of Christ (who was the Author of the Gospel) concerning this matter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The signal Instances of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106517:258"/>
contempt and neglect of the Gospel mentioned in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we shall make a rational enquiry into the Principles and Postulata, into which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Gospel is finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, this will receive evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from the Judgement of Christ himself, concerning the resolution of the rejection and contempt of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>I suppose none will be so Jewish as to object, the bringing of Christ to be a Witness in his own behalf, seeing his case is not the case of an ordinary witness, but resolves it self (as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards will be briefly shewed) into attestation of the greatest credit.</p>
                  <p>I say then, that Christ himself
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106517:258"/>
(who knew what was in man, and needed not that any man should teach him) hath resolved the contempt and rejection of the Gospel into want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and of due and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous consideration, into Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and want of Candour and Ingenuity.</p>
                  <p>In the Parable of the Sower we finde this Argument largely and profoundly handled by our Saviour, the Parable is three <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 3. Mar. 4. 3.

                  <p>That the irregular endeavour after the attainment of temporal good things, and the avoidance of temporal Evils, The lust of the Flesh, the lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, the Cares of the World and Deceitfulness of Riches, the lust of other things, Pride and conceitedness of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and other Carnal Interests, are the cause of the want of an attentive, and patient, an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and impartial considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And that the want of such

                  <p>In the Gospel of <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 8. 15. <gap reason="foreign">

and ingenuous attention and Consideration, and a full Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, are the causes of the Reception; Therefore an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention hypocritical and unsin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, An ignoble ignorance, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness, and want of candour and ingenuity, are the causes of the contempt of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel in the judgement of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The same also will further appear if we might be permitted to examine the several Instances of contempt and neglect of the Gospel, and so go thorow the various degrees of the Symptoms of Infidelity mentioned in the Gospel. I shall only touch them very briefly, and the heads of them are such as these:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The egregious hesitation or slowness in believing.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:106517:260"/>2. The refusal or rejection of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Offence or Scandal at it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The quarrelling and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation against it, and opposition to it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The down-right scorn and contempt of it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And lastly, the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it.</p>
                  <p>I say, if we might stay upon this Argument, it would appear, that as the Remoter causes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Case, are easily reducible, to the lusts and interests men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by our Saviour, so the more immediate Causes, whether in Jews or Gentiles, will be found to resolve into want of Ingenuity and Understanding.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Apostles were <hi>slow</hi> in believing before the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106517:261"/>
and Mission of the Spirit. Christ tells them, that then they were Fools, and slow of heart (inconsiderate and inadvertent, stupid and Disingenuous.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The most eminent <hi>Reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of the Gospel were the Scribes and Pharisees: if we shall enquire after the Vertue or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, Candour or Ingenuity of these men, we will finde them the most barbarous and covetous, proud and supercilious, insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and hypocritical in the world, (how often doth our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour charge them with all these things?) And if we enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Knowledge and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, we shall finde them to have been meer Braggadocio's and pretenders; Christ often calls them blinde Pharisees, and blinde guides; he tells them that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106517:261"/>
they were blinde leaders of the <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 16, 26.</note> blinde: that seeing they did see and not perceive, hearing they did hear and did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the sixth of <hi>John</hi> we finde a mighty <hi>Scandal</hi> taken at the Gospel among the Auditors of Christ, they murmured, they strove amongst themselves, they finally revolted, upon a word, because they judged it to be, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a hard saying; They judged it so, because they did not understand it; they did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it, because they had not the Modesty and Meekness, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Ingenuity to enquire the meaning of it, or to attend to that Explication which our Saviour made of that expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the 22 of St. <hi>Mathew,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 6. 3.</note>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:106517:262"/>
and the parallel places, we finde the Pharisees, the Scribes, the Lawyers, the Herodians, <hi>coursing</hi> our Saviour, <hi>charging him with questions</hi> about paying Tribute unto <hi>Caesar,</hi> the Resurrection, the Great Commandment, &amp;c. If now ye will judge of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of these men, consider there how thick and threefold, how furiously and how rudely, they fall upon him, how stupid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they persist, every one judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was too hard for all the rest, (<hi>and answered them well,</hi>) but every one adhering to his own Conclusion; Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how before they set upon him, they took counsel to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle him, and sent spies to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap (or trepan) him; And for their <hi>Understanding,</hi> consider how ignorant they were, not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106517:262"/>
knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</p>
                  <p>Neither was it thus among the Jews only, but among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles also; nor only in these, but in the two remaining degrees of the down-right scorn, and the contempt of the Gospel, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution for it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the 26. of the <hi>Acts</hi> we finde the opinion that <hi>Festus</hi> had concerning the Gospel, (with what <hi>contempt and scorn</hi> he speaks of it, how roundly he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that <hi>Paul</hi> was mad.) If you should judge of his Ingenuity in pronouncing, by his skilfulness in understanding of the Gospel; Consider how profound an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Paul's</hi> case, and of the Gospel he renders to <hi>Agrippa;</hi>

and concerning one Jesus which was dead, whom</hi> Paul <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be alive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the 17 of the <hi>Acts</hi> we finde <note place="margin">Ver. 32.</note> the <hi>Athenians</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>Making a mock at Paul,</hi> and <hi>scorning his Gospel</hi> as a most ridiculous thing; If you will know their manners and ingenuity, you may observe, that they condemned him for a Babler before they heard him <note place="margin">Ver. 18.</note> speak, and if you will measure the depth of their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which they despised, you may observe, that as they imagined Jesus to be a strange God; so they understood <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis</hi> (the Resurrection) to be a Goddess. He seemeth (say they) to be a setter forth of strange Gods, because he Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them Jesus and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>

                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:106517:263"/>6. The utmost degree of Contempt of the Gospel, is <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution</hi> for it; and the highest imaginable instance of this, was the betraying and murdering of Christ himself; Concerning the Ingenuity or disingenuity of the contrivance, management, and execution of this prodigious Action, it were no less than madness to undertake to speak proportionally; And that this also proceeded not only from wickedness and <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but from Ignorance and <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> we have an irrefragable assurance. Christ himself saith, that they knew not what they did; and our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 34.</note> that if they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood themselves, they would <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 8.</note> not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:106517:264"/>So that by all these instances, and many others of like nature, it doth appear, that (agreeably to the Sentence and Judgement of our Saviour) the contempt of the Gospel is finally resolved into a <hi>shamefull Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Ingenuity;</hi> which will yet be more evident from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I come therefore in the third place to a consideration of the</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) Principle into which the contempt of the Gospel is resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and of</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) The <hi>Postulata</hi> upon which it is grounded.

                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:106517:264"/>1. From the consideration of their Principle: After what hath been spoken in the former part of this Discourse, and what is attested by experience, I take it for granted,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>special Object</hi> of the Contempt of the Gospel is the <hi>Mystical</hi> part of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the immediate reason of the contempt of these Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is an Imagination, or Opinion of the <hi>falshood</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That this Opinion of the falshood of them, is derived from the <hi>Obscurity</hi> and <hi>Difficulty</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>Because they are inexplicable, incomprehensible, unintelligible, they conclude them to be false and incredible, merely Fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Chimerical Imaginations, and so to be despised.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:106517:265"/>So that the Principle into which these Scorners do resolve themselves, is this; That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is Inexplicable, Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible, Unintelligible is (by Philosophers at least and Wise men) to be accounted incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, fantastical, fictitious, and so to be despised.</p>
                  <p>If this be not the Ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this the Principle of those <hi>Virtuosi,</hi> of whom we are speaking, I desire to be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. But if it be, I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them to stand a little, and consider whither they are going, and whither this Principle and reasoning will lead them.</p>
                  <p>Will it not lead them to cast off not only Christianity, but even all natural Religion, and force them (with the wise man in the Psalmist) to say in their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106517:265"/>
hearts that there is no God? Because the <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Essence,</hi> and <hi>Attributes</hi> of God are <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable, incomprehensible,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible;</hi> He dwells in a light which no mortal eye can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto, such knowledge is too wonderfull and excellent for us, and we cannot attain unto it.</p>
                  <p>But this I fear they do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count an inconvenience, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that this is that they would be at.</p>
                  <p>Again therefore, I entreat them to consider;</p>
                  <p>Will not this Principle lead them to deny the most obvious things in nature? Will it not take away the very grounds of all that wisdom, to which they do pretend, (the force even of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment and Demonstration?)</p>
                  <p>Nay, Will it not finally bring
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106517:266"/>
upon themselves, that horrible inconvenience, that they are not to be offended if it shall be doubted or affirmed that they are not such Wits as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend?</p>
                  <p>The most obvious things in Universal Nature, are Continued Quantity, and Local Motion: These are either infinitely divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, or they are not. Will they deny this Disjunction, (and say, that they neither are so, nor not so?) Or will they make choice of either Member? Will they clear the difficulties that are in it? Or answer the Objections that may be made against it?</p>
                  <p>I presume they may have heard of that famous Argument of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> (<hi>AEliates</hi>) called <hi>Achilles,</hi> How whilest that mighty Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant (by the impossibilities and

                  <p>The most previous, most clear, and comprehensible of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Sciences are the pure and unmixed Mathematicks, yet even in Geometry and Arithmetick how many things are forceably concluded to be true, which are inexplicable, unimaginable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible?

                  </p>
                  <p>To give a rational or Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical Demonstration of the truth of the Gospel, there are but three wayes imaginable in Nature: By Arguments, either,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A Priori,</hi> from the common Principles of Intelligence. Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A Posteriori,</hi> from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and sensible observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>And this latter way of arguing must be drawn either,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From instances of things Novel and Anomalous in Nature, things purposely designed for such Arguments: Or else,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It must be taken from the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106517:272"/>
common and ordinary, the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perpetnal Phenomena of Nature.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Demonstration à posteriori</hi> by <hi>particular Instances</hi> of the Divine Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, purposely designed for that end, was the proof offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ and his Apostles; <hi>This they rejected;</hi> To prove par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Mysteries, Mysteries hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from Ages, (and so decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and professed to be by the Promulgers) by general and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Phenomena of Nature, is in nature impossible to perform, and senceless to require: To prove any thing concerning the Essence and Nature of God <hi>per causas,</hi> by Arguments <hi>à Priori</hi> supposes causes precedent to the Essence of God himself, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Contradiction; So then,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106517:273"/>
the Grecanick or Philosophical <hi>Postulatum</hi> proceeds from Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and want of Learning, and is at best disingenuous, and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retically absurd.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again secondly, (concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Judaical or Semeiotical <hi>Postulatum</hi>) After numerous, or rather innumerable Attestations by Signs and Wonders notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously known (and by themselves acknowledged) or sufficiently and authentically proved, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered down by uncontroulable and irreproveable Tradition, yet still to <hi>demand</hi> and <hi>require more Signs,</hi> Signs of their own electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, accompanied with circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of their own prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Is not this to tempt and limit the Almighty?

To suppose that those ought to be subservient to their wanton curiosity; Is it not to expect that God himself should Lacquey after them, to make him a doer of Tricks at their senceless and impudent demand?

                  <p>Now (therefore) that this was, and is, (and to the end of the world must ever now be) the case of the Jewish or Semeiotical <hi>Postulatum,</hi> is a so plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>

                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:106517:276"/>I have now done with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of my undertaking, which was to endeavour to make it appear,</p>
                  <p>That the Comtemners of the Gospel have reason to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their Prejudices.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I come now to the second, which is the last part of what I have propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> to shew,</p>
                  <p>That there is no reason for Christians or for Preachers to be ashamed of the Gospel;</p>
                  <p>And that upon two Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Propter veritatis Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The former of which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied (if it were not the truth of God, it could not be the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:106517:276"/>The later is expressed, <hi>For it is the Power of God to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to every one that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The evidence of the Truth is so great that whosoever duly considers it will certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>The Virtue and Excellency of the Gospel is so great, that whosoever truly believes the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel shall infallibly be saved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, I am to speak of the Evidence of the truth of the Gospel. But because it is here only implied, and because I have <note n="*" place="margin">Serm. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiscript.</note> formerly employed my poor endeavours upon that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I shall only briefly touch upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Mysteries of the Gospel, though they are inexplicable and inconceivable, yet are they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106517:277"/>
not incredible, though incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible, yet they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable; Nor was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Finisher of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith so severe upon the understanding of his followers, as to exact a Belief without a sufficient proof and Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth of that which he delivered.</p>
                  <p>Though he would not offer at the Grecanick way (which he knew to be impossible to grant, to be absurd and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to require) yet he would afford it that Demonstration whereof it was capable (a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration properly so called, accommodate to the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all Mankinde, Jews and Gentiles, Greeks and Barbarians, Noble and Ignoble, Learned and Unlearned) <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:106517:277"/>He that refused to gratifie the impudent Scribes and Pharisees in their way, would not leave the truth of the Gospel unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated in his own.</p>
                  <p>And of the truth of all the Mysteries which he delivered, this is the <hi>Analemma Catholicon,</hi> the Common, the Universal, the Comprehenfive demonstration.</p>
                  <p>He that made himself the Son of God (as the Jews express it) That said he was one with God (<hi>I and the Father are one</hi>) that <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 30. 14. 11.</note> he was in the Father, and the Father in him; That declared the Mission and Emanation of the Spirit from the Father and the Son, and that always spoke of him as a person distinct; And that these three are one.</p>
                  <p>In a word; He that was the <note place="margin">1. Joh. 5. 7.</note> Author of these and all other
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106517:278"/>
Mysteries whereof we have been speaking, did not put the issue of believing upon his <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, but upon an undeniable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refuseable Criterion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If I do not the works of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe me not; but if I do,</hi>

                  <p>He did not only bear witness to himself, (although he died in testimony of his Doctrine) He had not only the glorious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Apostles, the goodly fellowship of the Prophets, the noble Army of Martyrs for his Witnesses; But he called Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth to witness, He subpena'd whatever was in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Earth, and in the Sea,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106517:278"/>
and in all deep places, to bear testimony to him.</p>
                  <p>There were three that bore witness in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, those three which he affirmed to be one. The Angels ministred unto him; The Devils trembled and fled before him; Plants and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, the Winde and Sea obeyed him; The Stars in their courses, or rather out of their courses mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated for him. To give testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to <hi>Consummatum est,</hi> at the time of his Death, the Sun was eclipsed, the Moon being at the Full. To indicate the place of his Nativity, at the time of his Birth a new Star was made on purpose. Health and Sickness, Life and Death, and Hades, gave in their testimonies by their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his word. Yet once
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106517:279"/>
more, he shook the Heavens, and sent down the Holy Spirit upon his followers: he shook the Earth also, he tore the Rocks and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Graves, and at his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full voice the bodies of the Saints arose: And lest it should be said, He raised others but himself he could not raise; As he finished the Great Mystery of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by his Death, so also he proved the truth of it by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; As he died for our Sins, so he rose again for our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 24.</note> for our Justification is in the Belief of that, and all other, the Mysteries of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>These and many more, are heads of Arguments, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever duly considers and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands, will certainly believe the Gospel <hi>propter veritatis Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam.</hi>

                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:106517:279"/>2. It remains only to shew, that whosoever doth truly believe the Gospel, shall infallibly be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Propter Bonitatis,</hi> or <hi>Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Excellentiam; Because it is the Power of God to salvation to every one that believeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In speaking of which Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I need not go about to prove, that the Power of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel is the Power of God, (in which respect it is called the <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 11. 21.</note> Hand or <note n="b" place="margin">Isa. 53. 1.</note> Arm of the Lord, <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 10. 16.

                  <p>Neither shall I stand upon a Comparison of the Gospel, with the Grecanical or Judaical Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, (a man may believe all that ever was written by Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, and yet doubt whether there is, (or can be) such a

                  <p>He that believes, that there is neither God nor Devil, Heaven nor Hell, Salvation nor Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And that he hath not an Immortal Soul (<hi>i. e.</hi>) a Soul to save; such a man (If at least he hath attained to those great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments of Rudeness and Incivility) will make it his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to fill up his measure of Debaucheries, and Impieties; will think it Brave (perhaps) and Witty, to Blaspheme God, and

scoff at Religion; will make it a matter of Gallantry and noble Courage and Resolution, to challenge God to damn him, or bid the Devil take him Body and Soul; will spend his time in Revelling and Drunkenness, in Chambering and Wantonness; Expecting and hoping to die like a beast, he will be sure to live like one; And in conclusion will finde himself disappointed of this glorious hope (this goodly, noble, manly expectation) and that his Miscreancy and the errour of his Judgement hath betrayed him into eternal misery.</p>
                  <p>Whilest (on the other side) he that believes the Declarations, and Promises, and Threatnings, of the Gospel, will have his fruit unto holiness, and the end ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life.</p>

                  <p>That after Death he must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Tribunal of God <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 10.</note> and Christ, to answer for the things done in the body;</p>
                  <p>That from thence he shall be transmitted to a state either of Eternal Happiness, or Eternal Misery; either to be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (in the Vision of God, in the fellowship of Saints and Angels) with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory: Or secluded from the sight of God, and treated with the Devil and his Angels, with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unconceivable, unexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and that to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>This man, if he might gain all

the Profits, and Honours and Pleasures, if he might decline all the afflictions of this world, will not lose his own Soul: <hi>Frustra blanditiae venitis ad hunc, frustra nequitiae venitis ad hunc.</hi> Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that light and momenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things bear no proportion to the exceeding weight and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those which are Eternal, he will forthwith endeavour <hi>to lay hold upon Eternal Life,</hi> and make haste to <hi>escape the Wrath to come;</hi> And to that end he will devour all difficulties, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect no means or opportunities.</p>

                  <p>How that himself (and every <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 3.</note> man) is by nature a childe of wrath, that Sin reigns in his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> body, that he lies under a bondage from which he cannot redeem, a Guilt from which he cannot acquit himself;</p>

                  <p>Whosoever, I say, doth believe this concerning himself; and (on the other side) concerning Christ, that to this end was he born, and for this cause came he into the world, <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 15.</note> that he might save sinners; <note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 3. 17.</note> That the world through him might be saved;</p>
                  <p>That to this end (and this end only) he descended from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; This was the end of his Conversation upon Earth, his Life and Doctrine, his Preaching and Example; This was the end of his Crucifixion, Resurrection, Ascension, and Session at the Right hand of God; That by the sufferings of his Life, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable value of his Blood, the world might be <hi>Justified</hi> and <hi>Redeemed from the Guilt of their

                  </p>
                  <p>And that by the operation of his Doctrine, and Example, and the power of his Intercession, the world might be <hi>sanctified, Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Dominion of sin, purified and prepared to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Vision of the most holy God, Fruition of the Life to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I say, that the man that <hi>firmly,</hi> and <hi>stedfastly,</hi> and <hi>actually</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves these things, will not (nay, indeed that he cannot) neglect so great Salvation; That he will not trample upon the blood of the everlasting Covenant, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the Spirit of Grace, or cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie afresh the Lord of Glory, and put him to an open shame. But that for his continual cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from his past transgressions,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106517:284"/>
he will daily resort to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which Christ hath opened for sin and for uncleanness, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and presenting his head and his heart (his minde and his affections) to the blood of sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; And that for the obtaining of preventing, and following Grace, to preserve him from lapsing for the time to come, He will throw himself daily at the feet of that High-Priest, which is sensible of his Infirmities, and which sits at Gods Right hand, making Intercession for him, and with sighs and unutterable groans he will implore the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of that Spirit which help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our infirmities:</p>
                  <p>And that continuing, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severing in this Course, (by the Grace of God which never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them that seek him) he will
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106517:284"/>
certainly conform himself to the Commands of Christ, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himself to his Example, till at length he be transformed to his Image; <hi>He will add to his Faith Vertue, and to Vertue Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>—and so onwards, He will goe on from strength to strength untill he appear before God in Glory.</p>
                  <p>I say, that such a man, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 12.</note> ungodliness and worldly Lusts, and living Soberly, and Righteously, and Godly in this present world, will work out his Salvation with fear and trembl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in the end of his dayes will <hi>certainly</hi> and <hi>infallibly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the end of his hopes,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Salvation of his Soul.</hi> So that the Gospel is indeed the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation to all men: It is the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106517:285"/>
power of God to Salvation to every one that believeth.</p>
                  <p>TO come therefore to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: Judge now in your selves Brethren, and judge Righteous Judgement; Is this a Gospel which is to be despised? A Dispensation whereof a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster or a Christian ought to be ashamed? Are the Mysteries of this Gospel to be derided and drolled upon?

                     <note place="margin">Act. 17. 28.</note> puts them in minde of a saying of a Poet of their own: I would call to your Remembrance a Saying of a Philosopher of our own, (a Philosopher of great renown) which is to this effect: That a profound consideration of the reason, and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the circumstances of things (a deep dose of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy) will make a man Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; And that the contempt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106517:287"/>
of Religion is an infallible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one that is a smatterer only, and half-witted.</p>
                  <p>I would speak unto ye <hi>Nobles,</hi> that ye would be Noble as the <hi>Beraeans</hi> were, That ye will search, examine, and consider, whether the case of the Gospel be such as hath been represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea or no: And then I am sure ye will continue zealously and vigorously to support the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>I would take heart and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and improve in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confidence, so far as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Petition to King, Lords, and Commons (the Noble, the Mighty, and the Wise) that (at this time especially) they will be carefull of Religion, and tender of the Interests of the Gospel.</p>

                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:106517:288"/>I would humbly endeavour to bring to remembrance, who it is by whom Kings Reign, and Princes decree Justice; And what it is to be <hi>Defender of the truly Antient, Catholick and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would endeavour to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate that neither Forts nor Castles, Armies nor Navies, Arms nor Ammunition, Money nor Men, (to say nothing of Allies or Confederates, or the Staff of <hi>Egypt</hi>) are so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a support of the Crowns of Princes as the Gospel; Nay, not as a few lines of this one Epistle of our High nosed <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean</hi> (as the Scoffers have been wont to call him) duly imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed into the Souls and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, namely, that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the beginning of Chap. 13.

                  <p>And the belief of that which follows would defend us from our enemies abroad; this would raise, Taxes and Contributions, Subsidies and Royal Aids, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure all things necessary for the maintenance of Just Wars abroad; For <hi>for this cause also pay ye</hi>

all the succours and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary supplies of Government, to bring fear to whom fear, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to whom honour, tribute to whom tribute belongeth.</p>
