         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Though theſe things can never be ſufficiently la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented;
yet ſeeing it is not ſufficient barely to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
them, without indeavouring to heal them:
and conſidering, that it is a duty incumbent upon all
Chriſtians, (according to their ſeveral places and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities)
to promote the welfare of <hi>Sion;</hi> eſpecially
when wee have taſted ſo much of the bitterneſs of
our diviſions: And becauſe a brotherly union hath
ſo much of God in it, and conſequently gives ſo
much hope that God will take that courſe in eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
his Church, when he ſhall ariſe to build <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi>
and ſeeing it is an unjuſtifyable pettiſhneſs
and peeviſhneſs of ſpirit, to be averſe from joyning
together in any thing, becauſe we cannot joyn in all
things; therefore we reſolve (ſetting aſide all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
intereſts, and caſting our ſelves, with all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments,
at the Lords feet) to walk together as
far as we can for the preſent, not reſting here, nor
tying our ſelves from further progreſs in union, (as
the Lord ſhall give light and ſatisfaction) much leſs
binding our ſelves from a ſubmiſſion to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with a more general accommodation, (if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117429:3"/>
ſuch thing ſhould hereafter be agreed on) which
might be more ſutable and fitted for the compoſure
of the different principles of Brethren throughout
the Nation.</p>
            <p>In order to the carrying on of this great work, wee
lay down and aſſent unto theſe general rules, as
the Baſis and Foundation which muſt ſupport and
bear up our following Agreement.</p>
            <p>1. THat in the exerciſe of Diſcipline, it is not
onely the moſt ſafe courſe, but alſo moſt
conducing to brotherly union and ſatisfaction, That
particular Churches carry on as much of their work
with joynt and mutual aſſiſtance, as they can with
conveniency and edification, and as little as may be
in their actings, to ſtand diſtinctly by themſelves, and
apart from each other.</p>
            <p>2. That in matters of <hi>Church Diſcipline,</hi> thoſe
things which belong onely<note n="†" place="margin">Things not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</note> 
               <hi>ad melius eſſe,</hi> ought to
be laid aſide, both in reſpect of publication and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
rather then that the Churches peace ſhould be
hindered.</p>
            <p>3. That where different principles lead to the
ſame practice, wee may joyn together in that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
reſerving to each of us our own principles.</p>
            <p>4. That where we can neither agree in principle,
nor in practice, we are to bear with one another's
differences, that are of a leſs and diſputable nature,
vvithout making them a ground of diviſion amongſt
us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:117429:4"/>
Yet notwithſtanding, we do not hereby binde up
our ſelves from endeavouring to inform one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in thoſe things wherein we differ, ſo that it
be done with a ſpirit of love and meekneſs, and
vvith reſolutions to continue our brotherly amity
and aſſociation, though in thoſe particulars our
differences ſhould remain uncompoſed.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Upon theſe grounds we agree as followeth.</head>
               <p>1. Seeing the Lord hath called us out of his <hi>work,</hi>
and hath imployed us as <hi>Ambaſsadors, Stewards,
Watchmen,</hi> and <hi>Overſeers,</hi> in his Church, we reſolve
through his aſſiſtance, to endeavour the diſcharge of
our duty and truſt herein, unreſervedly, and with all
faithfulneſs, to the utmoſt of our power, though
hereby vve hazard reproach, revilings, contempts,
injuries, loſs of friends, and maintenance, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
elſe may be dear to us.</p>
               <p>2. To this end we reſolve in the courſe of our
Miniſtery, to obſerve the temper, diſpoſition, and
capacity of the generality of the people, and to ſuit
our ſelves not onely in our matter to the people's
conditions, but alſo in our expreſſions to the people's
apprehenſions, that ſo our Sermons may bee plain,
piercing, ſeaſonable, and profitable.</p>
               <p>3. Particularly, we reſolve undauntedly (and
yet according to the rules of Chriſtian prudence) to
reprove the ſins that moſt abound in our people, and
ſhall mainly bend the force of our endeavours to
convince men of their carnal ſecurity, to diſcover
the rotten and deceitful props on which it is built,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117429:4"/>
and to preſs them to the acceptance of Chriſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the proffers of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>4. We will lay out our ſelves in keeping Lectures
(as the ſeaſons of the yeer will permit) wherein we
will more eſpecially have regard to thoſe places that
are deſtitute of preaching.</p>
               <p>5. We reſolve to catechiſe and inſtruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
committed to us, explaning to them the grounds
of Religion, that knowledge may increaſe among
them; and to this purpoſe we conceive it moſt fit
to make uſe of the Aſſemblies larger and ſhorter
Catechiſms.</p>
               <p>6. We reſolve, beſides the work of publike
preaching, and catechiſing, to inſtruct them private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from houſe to houſe, (ſo far as our publike work
will permit) that ſo we may have an opportunity of
being more throughly acquainted with their ſtate
and condition, and of dealing with them more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and particularly, as occaſion ſhal require, ſtriving
alwayes to improve our occaſional diſcourſes and
commerce with them to that end, having our words
ſeaſoned with ſalt, that they may adminiſter grace
to the hearers.</p>
               <p>7. Foraſmuch as affliction and ſickneſs doth not
onely call for miniſterial help and advice in a more
eſpecial manner; but alſo gives opportunity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
for counſel or reproof; therefore wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to be as diligent in viſiting the ſick and afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as other labours, greatneſs of our charge, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to go abroad will ſuffer us; and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the rich, and thoſe that deſire us, but alſo the
poor, and thoſe that ſend not for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:117429:5"/>
8. Seeing we are in Scripture commanded to love
all men, and as much as in us lieth, to follow Peace
with all; and yet warned to reſerve our Brotherly
kindneſs and delight for thoſe that walk holily;
therefore we reſolve in our Society, as well as in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pencing
of Ordinances, to put a difference between
the precious and the vile; and though we intend not
to deny that Charity, Help, Civility and Duty that
we owe unto the Scandalous, yet will we beſtow our
love of complacencie onely on thoſe that order
their converſations aright, leſt by intimacie with
wicked men, we ſtrengthen the hands of evill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
grieve the hearts of the godly, and enſnare our
own ſouls.</p>
               <p>9. Seeing the ſins of Sabbath-breaking, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Fornication and Drunkenneſs are ſo abominable
in the ſight of God and men, and yet ſo frequent, we
reſolve, beſides the reproving of theſe ſins in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
and private, to endeavor to bring ſuch Offenders
to the puniſhment of the Law, in thoſed caſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
               <p>10. We will inſtruct our people publikely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the nature of the diſcipline of Chriſt, &amp; ſhal
preſs the neceſſity of their ſubmiſſion to it, according
to the Rule of Scripture.</p>
               <p>11 Becauſe it hath been the commendable prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of the Saints of old, in order to the <hi>Reformation</hi>
of the Churches, publikely and ſolemnly to renew
the Covenant with God; and becauſe in this Age,
temptations to Apoſtacie, and back-ſlidings from the
faith are ſtrong and frequent, and becauſe our hearts
are ſo ready to ſtart aſide from the Power of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117429:5"/>
that we daily ſtand in need of all poſſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
to ſubmiſſion; therefore we reſolve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
from our people an aſſent to the Truths of
Chriſt, (contained in a ſhort Confeſſion of Faith
hereunto annexed) and a Profeſſion of their conſent
to ſubmit unto, and accept of the terms of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, to take the Lord for their God; to
walk in his Wayes; to fear, love, honor and obey
him with all their heart, and with all their might,
and to ſubmit to Diſcipline and Government.
Yet</p>
               <p>1. We are ſo far from reſolving to ſatisfie our
ſelves with the bare recital and repetition of the
words of the Profeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make the people not onely to profeſs with
Underſtanding, but (ſo far as we can) with feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Apprehenſions of what they ſpeak.</p>

                  <p>That there is but one Mediator betwixt God and

Titles or particular intereſts; &amp; in all other things
wherein the ſinfulneſs is dubious and diſputable.</p>

               <p>6. In caſe the party offending upon Reproof,
ſhall manifeſt repentance by a ſerious profeſſion of
ſorrow, (not ſleight and meerly verbal) he ought

               <p>7. And if the party profeſſing repentance, ſhall

are lyable to miſ-conſtructions, and miſ-apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
eſpecially amongſt the weaker ſort of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,

               <p>9. Foraſmuch as in the buſineſs of ſcandal it is
unreaſonable and uncharitable to take up againſt

from the time preſent; and becauſe in ſome caſes
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117429:10"/>
it will be neceſſary to require ſome teſtimony of

in point of ſcanſdal, or inabilitie of Miniſters,
made by thoſe that deſire to be entertained in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
congregations, becauſe we conceive, That
neither the people that deſire to depart from ſuch
Miniſters, nor the Miniſters with whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to joyne, are competent Judges in ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
caſe; yet if the Exceptions be ſuch as are
approved of by the Aſſociation, we conceive it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
for the Reaſons aboveſaid, that they joyne
themſelves to the neereſt congregation, where a
godly and able Miniſter is ſetled.</p>
               <p>3. Neither do we intend hereby to debar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from the occaſional hearing of other Miniſters
or from the occaſional partaking of other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
in another congregation, ſo that this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be not uſed to the apparent prejudice of the
Miniſtry and Diſcipline of their own Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>17. When a Miniſter is to be ordained unto a
congregation, we agree, That godly and able mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117429:11"/>
of neighbor congregations, be called to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the examination and trial of the fitneſs
of the party to be ſet apart to that weighty Office,
and in the act of Ordination.</p>
               <p>18. Though we differ about the firſt ſubject of the
power of the Keys, yet foraſmuch as we all agree,
That the affairs of the Church are to be managed by
the Officers thereof, therefore we conclude that the
examination and determination of things in caſes of
admiſſion and rejections, and other church acts, ſhall
be permitted by the Officers; yet ſo that the people
have notice of what they reſolve and conclude upon,
in matters of moment, that in caſe any thing be done
againſt which the people may (upon probable
grounds at leaſt) object from the word of God, it
may either be forborne, or their ſatisfaction endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured.</p>
               <p>19. And foraſmuch as we cannot all proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ordinary rules in managing of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of our particular congregations, through the
want of fit perſons to be made church-officers, and
for other cauſes; therefore we reſolve by our mutual
aſſiſtance to ſupply the want, becauſe we may have
(according to Scripture warrant) recourſe to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
expedient, the ordinary rule failing, and
becauſe this ſeems to us to come neereſt the ordinary
rule. Yet</p>
               <p>1. VVe intend not that this ſhould be perpetual,
but only during the preſent want, and in order to
the ſetling of our churches according to the rules
of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:117429:11"/>
2. Neither intend we hereby, to put into any
Miniſters hand, a ſuperior power over his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p>3. Nor would we be underſtood, as making our
many churches to be but one particular church, or
giving the Paſtor of one church a true Paſtorall
power and charge over other churches.</p>
               <p>20. Albeit we differ as to the power of aſſociated
churches over particular congregations; yet, we agree
that it is not only lawful and uſeful, but in many caſes
neceſſary, that ſeveral churches ſhould hold commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and correſpondency together; and to that end
we reſolve to aſſociate our ſelves, &amp; to keep frequent
meetings for mutual advice and help, as occaſion
ſhall require.</p>
               <p>21. VVe take our ſelves and our churches bound
to follow whatſoever advice, direction or reproof,
(being agreeable to the word) any of us ſhall receive
from the Brethren in aſſociation with us.</p>
               <p>22. And in caſe it ſhould ſo fall out, that our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in aſſociation ſhould adviſe that which might
ſeem leſs convenient in the judgement of the Parties
immediately and ſpecially concerned, in the advice
or reproof, or to the particular apprehenſions of any
other of us, (it being of leſs moment, and not appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
contrary to Scripture) then we reſolve to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to it, rather then to endanger the peace of the
churches, and to become examples and encouragers
of diſorder by our diſſent and refuſal.</p>
               <p>23. Particularly, Foraſmuch as the cenſure of
excommunication is of great weight and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
wherein we are ſure we can never be too cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſpect
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117429:12"/>
and careful; therefore we reſolve, firſt to adviſe
with the aſſociation, before we proceed, by that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
to caſt any out of our particular churches; and
whoſoever ſhall thus be caſt out of one church, wee
wil repute him equally caſt out of all, and avoid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with him accordingly.</p>
               <p>24. If it ſhould ſo fall out, that any Miniſter or
particular church, ſhould obſtinately and wilfully,
after many endeavours, and much waiting, reject the
direction and counſel of the aſſociation, in things
apparently agreeable to the word of God, then we
reſolve to draw the right hand of fellowſhip from
ſuch Miniſter or church.</p>
               <p>25. For the better carrying on of our intended
aſſociation, we reſolve to obſerve theſe following
rules.</p>
               <p>1. We judge it convenient to divide our ſelves
into three aſſociations, (<hi>viz.</hi>) at <hi>Carlile,</hi> at <hi>Penrith,</hi>
and <hi>Cockermouth,</hi> and ſhall meet once a Moneth, or
more or leſs, as occaſion ſhall require, and the
major part of the aſſociation ſhall think fit; yet in
this we do not intend to exclude any Miniſter (not
being ſcandalous) from any of the aſſociations,
that will be pleaſed to take the pains to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
there, nor yet the Miniſters of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that ſhall deſire to joyne with any of them.</p>
               <p>2. At theſe meetings we ſhall hear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
things of common concernment, endeavour
to reſolve doubts, compoſe differences, conſider
the juſtneſs &amp; weight of the grounds and reaſons
of Miniſters removals from any place, when ſuch
caſes ſhall fall out, conſult and adviſe about ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:117429:12"/>
emmergencies that may happen to our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
or congregations in particular.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe miniſters being men of like paſſions with
others, can claime no exemptions from humane
frailties and infirmities; and in regard their miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
are more diſhonorable to God and the
Goſpel, more offenſive and hurtful to private
chriſtians, therefore we reſolve, impartially to hear
complaints made againſt any Miniſter in aſsociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with us; and to this end we do all and every one
of us (in caſe any exception or complaint againſt
any of us ſhall be made) freely profeſs our reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to ſubmit to the admonition, reproof, cenſure
or advice of our brethren; yet we would not be
here miſtaken, as if we intended the encouragement
of groundleſs and frivolous quarrels and excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
either in people againſt miniſters, or in one
miniſter againſt another; for as we purpoſe (the
Lord aſsiſting us) not to be too backward to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
and rebuke when there ſhall be juſt cauſe, ſo
ſhall we endeavour to be mindefull of that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs
which the Scripture enjoyneth, in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an Accuſation againſt an Elder.</p>
               <p>4. Though for conveniencie we divide our ſelves
into three aſsociations, yet we reſolve ſometimes
to meet all together, eſpecially when there ſhall
fall out any thing of more extraordinary and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
nature or difficulty, which cannot be eaſily &amp;
ſatisfactorily decided in any of our particular aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations.</p>
               <p>5. If any that ſhall offer to ioyn with us in our
aſsociation, lie under the common repute of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:117429:13"/>
then we will deferr his admiſsion till he have
cleared himſelf, or otherwiſe given ſatisfaction;
and for the prevention of offences, we reſolve not
to admit any into our aſsociations without the
conſent of the whole or major part of them.</p>
               <p>6. Laſtly, we will endeavour a cloſure of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as well as judgement and practiſe, and to that
end we reſolve, wholly to lay aſide, and bury all
names and terms of difference, to carry our ſelves
each to other as brethren, forbearing (as much as
we can) whatſoever might, either in word or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
occaſion miſ-reports and offences, or raiſe up
grounds of iealouſie and exception one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>

               <head>Upon theſe and ſuch like Conſiderations, we have
put our ſelves upon theſe Reſolutions, which
herewith are preſented unto you.</head>
               <p>WE, who have engaged our ſelves in this undertaking, have (we
hope) throughly conſidered, what in all probability it may coſt
us, that while we look for reproach &amp; contradiction, which yet we would
not willingly finde, our oppoſers may find that undaunted courage in our
proſecution of this Work, which they would not readily have
looked for.</p>
               <p>The great diſtance of this from the firſt undertaking, and Report
of our Agreement, doth neceſſarily draw forth this brief Account
of its Birth and Progreſs. About three yeers ago ſome of us joyned
together in an Expedient much of this nature, which we propounded
to ſome of our Brethren of different perſwaſions in theſe things, but it
took not; whereupon we reſolved to proſecute it among our ſelves, and
made ſome Progreſs in it: At which time <hi>VVorceſterſhire Aſſociation;</hi>
with Mr. <hi>Baxters Explication,</hi> came forth: Upon this we began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
more probability of ſome reconciliation (at leaſt) of different
judgements, in matters of Church-Government, then formerly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we hoped, the prejudice which poſſibly might ariſe from our ſingle
attempt, (in a buſineſs of that nature) would be much removed,
when they ſaw we were not alone, and that the way was led by others of
ſo much worth and ability; we therefore reſolved to take up our former
deſign again, and to propound it to the whole Miniſtry of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in general. To that end ſeveral Meetings were deſired; and at laſt
we agreed in theſe following Propoſitions, which were cheerfully
ſubſcribed by ſeveral, both of the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and Congregational
Judgement. During the agitation of theſe things, ſome of us were
much affected to obſerve:</p>
               <p>1. The Aſſent of men both able and judicious, and ſuch as had
throughly ſtudyed the Congregational Way, and from whom (in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probability)
oppoſition might have been expected, in caſe theſe
things had been inconſiſtent with theſe Principles.</p>
               <p>2. That Prejudice (which like a hateful Monſter, impoyſons the beſt
things, ſeeks Fuel from its own ignorance and blindneſs, and from the
very diſtance which it ſelf cauſed; like a Fiery Oven devours all that's
caſt into it, and muſters up all the Paſſions to fight againſt it knows not
what) hath the greateſt hand in hindering the Unity and and Concord
of Brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:117429:16"/>
3. That the beſt way to cure it, is friendly and brotherly debates,
eſpecially after it hath tyred it ſelf with its own Activity, and evaporated
ſomething of its Fury.</p>
               <p>4. That the Churches Peace (if by all parties ſeriouſly laid to heart)
is a very forceable <hi>medium</hi> to infer a concluſion of Unity.</p>
               <p>Yet all was not done when we had proceeded thus far; Action (the
life of all) was yet behinde; Satan is enraged, (and ſurely that muſt
needs be good which he ſo furiouſly oppoſeth) and endeavours to ſtiffle
it in the birth; to effect which, he diſgorgeth from his hateful ſtomack,
a ſwarm of Quakers; theſe, at that very time, when all things were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for practice, come upon us like a furious Torrent; all is on fire on the
ſudden, many are unſetled, the foundations ſhaken, and ſome <hi>apoſtatize;</hi>
here we are beaten off, and are forced to lay other things aſide, that we
might more fully binde our ſelves to quench theſe flames. After a while
this ſtorm abates, and we begin to think of our former Work.</p>
               <p>But the laſt Parliament was then ſitting, and becauſe ſomething of
that nature was expected from them, it was adviſed we ſhould yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
forbear, till we might ſee the iſſue. The Parliament being ended,
we encountered with an other Demurrer which was this: The provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God ſo ordered things, that many Miniſters in this County
were unfixed, ſuppoſing they ſhould be neceſſitated to remove; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
did remove to other Counties, ſo that we were again forced to let
all alone, expecting what way things would be caſt. And now all theſe
things being over, we have once more re-aſſumed our ancient Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
caſting our ſelves upon the Lord, and looking up to him for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
That things concerning his Honor and Houſe, with ſo much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
now brought to the <hi>birth, may not miſcarry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When theſe were now ready, it pleaſed the Lord to give us this encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement;
Our Brethren, the Miniſters of our neighbor-County of
<hi>VVeſtmerland,</hi> deſired of us a Copy of our Propoſitions and Confeſſion;
and after they had among themſelves conſidered and debated them,
they ſignified to us their free conſent to all, except what concerned the
County of <hi>Cumberland</hi> in particular.</p>
               <p>Theſe things we ſpeak from the Preſs; 1. Becauſe we ſuppoſe it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that you have Copies of theſe Propoſitions, and this is the readyeſt
way to procure them. 2. For prevention of miſtakes and miſ apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
which might ariſe either from corrupt Copies, or from Report of
our bare actions, while men only hear what we do, but are not acquainted
with our Grounds and Principles. 3. That this may ſtand upon Record
as a Teſtimony of our deſires of, and endeavours for the healing of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
We know not what ſucceſs the Lord may be pleaſed to give to this:
when we look upon our ſelves, we profeſs our ſelves unworthy of that
honour, of being imployed in any part of Gods Work, and unable of

                  <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> is not yet come, or who knows but he may exclude you from
ſuch a Priviledge, while he grants it to others? Yet when we look upon
his Power, his Word, and his Work upon ſome of you, we are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope: How ever it pleaſe the Wiſe God to diſpoſe of this, we are
ſure it is our duty to do our utmoſt in the proſecution of concord: And
though our ſouls ſhall mourn in ſecret, if our diſ-union and diſtractions
continue; yet it will be no grief of heart to us (eſpecially in our dying
hour) to conſider that we did what we could to prevent them.</p>
               <p>It will not be requiſite to ſpeak much in Explanation, or Vindication
of what we propoſe; becauſe in moſt things it is fully done to our hands,
by Judicious and Learned Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his Explication of the <hi>VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſte-ſhire
Aſſociation,</hi> unto which we refer you for ſatisfaction, whiles we
give a brief touch upon ſomething in the general.</p>
               <p>1. Know that ſeveral things, as to Method, Phraſe, and Omiſſions,
(which thoſe that are verſed in the Controverſies about Government,
will readily obſerve) were not done altogether upon neglect, or inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency,
but on deſign.</p>
               <p>2. That theſe were not calculated for every <hi>Meridian;</hi> we were forced
to have an eye to the general temper of our people, as well as the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Judgements of one another: And therefore let it not be blamed, if
it be found not ſuitable in all things to other places.</p>
               <p>3. Let it be carryed in your minde all along, That through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
of the whole work, our Debates were, what we ought to do for
the Churches peace, and not what each of us might do, according to
the latitude and utmoſt extent of the uſual practice of different Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>4. In all this Agreement there are no Principles broken on either
ſide; and nothing condeſcended unto by any, which hath not the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
and aſſent of eminent men on both parties in their writings.</p>
               <p>The chief Corner-ſtones of this Fabrick, are four, which preſent
themſelves in the entrance, whereof the firſt and laſt Propoſitions nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fear oppoſition, nor require explication; if any ſhould queſtion
them, ſuch evidence and general acception doth accompany them, that
they will finde advocates in every place.</p>
               <p>The ſecond (we hope) will not be accuſed (by any that ſhall ſeriouſly
conſider all) for entrenching too much upon the intereſt of truth. We
acknowledge every truth to be precious in it ſelf, and profeſs our ſelves
unfeigned lovers of it; neither are we ignorant how much thoſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Union, (ſuch as <hi>Charls</hi> his <hi>interim,</hi> and <hi>Caſſanders</hi> deſigne)
wherein the difference is compremiſed with the loſs of truth, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
and juſtly diſtaſted: Neither can we blame thoſe primitive Fathers
for ſticking ſo peremptory to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, refuſing Concord, rather then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
one <hi>iota</hi> more to that word, where ſuch a little litteral Addition
would make ſo great an alteration in ſenſe and Faith; Neither do we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:117429:17"/>
how apt the beſt men are (with <hi>Bucer haurire faeces) to ſuck in the
dreggs</hi> out of an eager thirſt after peace.</p>
               <p>But no ſuch thing can be faſtned on what we aſſert; we are not enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to deny or renounce the leaſt Truth, much leſs any Fundamental:
All that the Propoſition ſpeaks of, is onely a ſilencing and forbearing
ſome truths. And this Condiſcention is, 1. Terminated only on Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
2. On the confeſſed lower, and moſt queſtionable Points there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And 3. This only ſo long, and ſo far as the Churches peace requires
it.</p>
               <p>If any think that Union and Peace ſhould be hazarded, nay loſt, rather
then ſo great an injury done to truth; let them conſider, Whether they
be ſo great friends to truth as they pretend; if the Church be broken
through diſſention, we ſuppoſe Truth will bleed and groan under its
Ruines. If the Pillar ſhake or fall, Truth that hangs on it, will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
in the ſame fate. What if Peace borrow ſomething of truth?
will it not by that loane be enabled to repay all with advantage? <hi>Truth
indeed is the way to Peace,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>
                  <hi>Greg. Naz. Orat. 12. de Pace:) Yet when Truth is
queſtioned, then Peace is the way to Truth; and the main thing to be looked at
for the ſecuring of its intereſt, is union;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.
<hi>Greg. Naz. ibid.</hi> In ſo narrow a point doth Truth lye, that men are not
likely to have any full or certain view of it, till their Spirits be calmed,
and their eyes be freed from that duſt which their contentious bickerings
have raiſed.</p>
               <p>But have not the Guides of the Church in all ages been forced to
make uſe of this Plaſter to heal the Churches Wounds?</p>
               <p>Did not the Apoſtles betake themſelves to this expedient, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 20.
to allay the difference betwixt the Chriſtian <hi>Iews</hi> and Gentiles? And
were not circumciſion and <hi>Moſaicall</hi> ceremonies of greater moment then
our differences? And were not thoſe truths, about our Freedom from
that Yoke, ſilenced for that time, and the contrary practiſed even by
themſelves? <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 3. &amp; 21. 24. 26. This is ſo clear an inſtance, that it
is frequently urged in this caſe; and indeed, ſo ſtrong for us, that we
doubt of being acquitted by it in the judgement of underſtanding men.
Conſider,</p>
               <p>1. That the Laws concerning <hi>Moſaical</hi> Obſervations were abrogated
at the death of Chriſt, and therefore in regard of their preſent ſtate (or
elſe as ſome call it) neither lawful nor indifferent.</p>
               <p>2. The Apoſtle of the Gentiles had laid them aſide as uſeleſs, nay
had ſpoken againſt them; and hence aroſe the conteſt about them.</p>
               <p>3. When the matter was referred to the Synod of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> (though
before he had preached publikely againſt them; yet) he is ſo far from
aſſerting, That every Truth muſt be publiſhed what ever become of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117429:17"/>
peace, that he forbears to ſpeak publikely, and applies himſelf <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>to thoſe that were pillars, and of Reputation,</hi> viz. <hi>Peter,
Iames, Iohn, &amp;c.</hi> for Dr. <hi>Lightfoot, Harm. N. T.</hi> p. 97. makes it the ſame
journey with that mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
               <p>4. The Synod doth determine not only the ſilencing of this truth, <hi>viz.</hi>
the abolition of ceremonies, and Chriſtians freedom from them; but alſo
permits the exerciſe of theſe to the Jewes, and injoynes the practice of
ſome of them to the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>5. The ground of the determination was the churches peace, <hi>Acts</hi>
15. 21.</p>
               <p>6. And in this regard they enjoyn them as <hi>neceſſary things,</hi> which they
ſhould do well to obſerve, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28, 29. till the church might have a
competent time and means of ſatisfaction. The ſum is this: The ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of ſome truths for peace ſake (both in regard of publication and
practice) was by them judged neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Since the Apoſtles dayes, thoſe who have moſt earneſtly contended
for the foundations, and things neer the foundation, have alwayes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
to condeſcention for peace ſake. To recite all inſtances that might
be given, would be tedious: We ſhall content our ſelves with two or
three in ſtead of many.</p>

for the eſtabliſhment of the church, and propounds condeſcention as
a neceſſary means of it; There is need (ſaith he) of a great deal of

by uniting thoſe that differ; which union will be effected (<gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Let us yeeld a little in ſmaller truths,

<hi>p.</hi> 203. but we forbear.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe we might urge the example of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great,
who in matters of greater conſequence, (<hi>viz.</hi> the difference betwixt <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
and the Orthodox) propounds the forbearance of asking or anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
queſtions concerning that difference as a neceſſary means to peace;
which he did as ſuppoſing it to be of lower concernment, <hi>vide Soc. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.
l. 1. c.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>To the third we need ſay little; onely to explain our meaning, know,
That there are ſeveral things which both Parties practiſe upon different
grounds: As in matters of Appeal, where one party gives power au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative;
the other fraternal onely; yet both own the thing: So
in the exerciſe of the power of the Keyes, where though the
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the firſt ſubject be queſtioned, yet all agree, that
(in Churches Organical at leaſt) the Officers are to manage them.</p>
               <p>To theſe may be added Ordination by Paſtors of other Churches, and
the Church-covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now all we ſay here is this, That the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of principles by which both parties are carried to the ſame thing,
doth not make our conjunction unlawful.</p>
               <p>The 11th. Propoſition we hope will not be quarrelled with by ſober
minded men. 1. None will ſay that 'tis unlawful to renew covenant with
God. 2. Nor will any deny the expediency and uſefulneſs of it in refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of churches. 3. Nor that our particular churches (ſo overgrown
with ignorance and prophaneneſs, ſo beſet with Hereſies, ſo weakned (as
to diſcipline and government) through licencious Liberty) have no need
of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:117429:18"/>
4. In this we croſs not any <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Principle. Thoſe that have
moſt oppoſed an explicite Church-covenant as the form of a Church, do
not deny the lawfulneſs and uſefulneſs of the thing, but only the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of it, in reference to ſuch an end; and the extent of it, as to ſome
particular Articles; <hi>vid. Ruther.</hi> due Right, <hi>p.</hi> 85. <q>
                     <hi>An explicite vocal
covenant,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we deny not, as if the thing were unlawful,</hi> &amp;c. p. 86.
<hi>Nor deny we, that at the Election of a Paſtor, the Paſtor and people tye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by reciprocation of Oaths,</hi> &amp;c. p. 88. <hi>Nor do we queſtion whether
ſuch a Covenant may be lawfully ſworn; we think it may,</hi> &amp;c.</q> So alſo
<hi>Apollonius,</hi> p. 4.</p>
               <p>5. The grounds and ends mentioned, and only impoſed in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
and the draught of the Profeſſion it ſelf, will (as we hope)
ſufficiently clear us from the two fore-hinted Exceptions.</p>
               <p>6. The mentioning only of thoſe Grounds wherein all are agreed,
doth not exclude <hi>a reipſa,</hi> any other further end of covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(if it have any ſuch,) nor bereave it of any of its proper effects:
For ſo long as the thing is done, it will reach all its ends of inſtitution,
whether we particularly diſcover them or no. Divine inſtitutions, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the effects immediately reſulting <hi>ab earum poſitione &amp; uſu,</hi> are
not enlarged, or narrowed, according to the largeneſs or ſtraightneſs of
our apprehenſions, no more then our not apprehending the Sun to be
appointed to concurre to the production and growth of vegetables, will
hinder its effects that way. So that the Congregational Brethren, being
condeſcended unto in the practice of the thing, need not preſs the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ends and grounds of it: And the <hi>Prebyterian</hi> Brethren need not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
the thing, they being not urged to do it upon thoſe queſtionable
grounds.</p>
               <p>The twelfth Propoſition ſhews our rule of Admiſſion, and the
rules which we have propounded to our ſelves for our ſafer proceeding:
We know that two parties will take Exceptions againſt what we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound:
ſome thinking us too ſtrict; others too open-handed.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that think this rigid and harſh dealing, let them be pleaſed
to conſider; 1. That 'tis none but the ignorant and ſcandalous, which
we ſhall deſire to debar from that Ordinance. 2. That by putting bounds
to our ſelves, we take away the aſperſion of an indefinite, unlimited, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
and uncertain Government. 3. That in debarring ſuch, the
Church-guides go not beyond their commiſſion, but only execute that
Office, and diſcharge that truſt that God hath laid upon them: Are
thoſe not Rulers and Governors? and doth not this engage and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize
them, to prevent and hinder the polluting and prophanation of his
Ordinances? Have thoſe that are charged with holy things, a charge to
give onely and not to debar? The Officers of the Old-Teſtament, were
to exclude the unclean actually; the Porters of the Temple were not to
ſuffer the Unclean to enter the Temple, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 23. 19. &amp; in <hi>Eze.</hi> 44. 7, 8.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117429:19"/>
ſhall we think that when God prohibits the unfit, he leaves the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Prohibition ſolely to every mans particular perſwaſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
himſelf, and leaves only a Doctrinal declarative power to the
Officers; and that though they may declare a perſon unfit, yet they may
not refuſe to give the Ordinance to him whom they declare unworthy;
is the Juridical, Deciſive Power in every perſon for himſelf? Doth
not this as much diſable them from debarring and men, or men actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Drunk? If ſuch intrude, can he do no more then declare them unfit?
Or if he may debarr theſe juridically, becauſe they are not in a capacity
of improving the Ordinance,<note n="*" place="margin">May he not then juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally debar others that are in a like capacity of improving the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance?</note> though from other cauſes, as ignorance,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And indeed, that the Officers may juridically debar from the
Lords Supper, cannot be denyed, by thoſe that will acknowledge
That the offended Brother muſt <hi>tell the Church;</hi> the Church then hath
power to examine; elſe, to what purpoſe is it to make known the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to it? And doth not Examination infer more then a declarative
power? neither can it be denyed by thoſe that will grant excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
if they can juridically caſt out of the Church, then it muſt
be granted, they can juridically exclude from the Supper, for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
at leaſt, Becauſe the former includes the latter. 4. The excluſion of
ignorant and ſcandalous perſons, is not a novel invention, or new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but that which carries the Stamp of <hi>Antiquity</hi> upon it. The very
Light of Nature ſeems to have hinted ſuch a thing to the Heathens; as
their <hi>Proculite propahni</hi> at ſacrificings teſtifieth. But if we look within the
Church, we have abundant evidence.</p>

               <p>Neither are our proceedings herein different from what was preſcribed
and enjoyned by the Epiſcopal Divines; knowledge was alwayes preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

               <p>The ſame thing alſo was expreſſed in the Rubrick of the Common-Prayer;
where the Miniſter was not only to diſſwade perſons in malice to
come to the Lords Table, but not to ſuffer them: and not only ſuch, but

               <p>Nay, thoſe that plead moſt for a free admiſſion, are ſo far from taxing
this practice with novelty, that they yeild it to be a piece of the ancient
and uſual diſcipline of the church, to exclude the notorious and open
ſcandalous, though not excommunicate; Neither do they ſo much plead
for the admiſſion of the ſcandalous, as for the excommunicating of

have charity, &amp; may, &amp; muſt uſe it to prevent our brothers danger, ſo
long ſurely may we do all this; if we had nothing elſe to bear us out,
would not this engage us to help you to examine your ſelves? (&amp; is the
matter of ſo ſmall moment, that you need no help?) nay, and to refuſe to
give you that which we ſee would hurt you? will real love ſatisfie it ſelf
with a bare warning, without endeavouring to prevent? will it only tell
him 'tis poyſon he drinks, &amp; not alſo take it out of his hand? &amp; have you
any cauſe to be angry when we tel you the truth concerning your eſtates,
or hinder you from deſtroying your ſelves out of love to you? that when

When the Phyſician puts the Patient to ſome grief, in the application of

The Lord knows we delight not in excluding, if we could admit you
without your own hurt; &amp; if God laid not this duty upon us, can you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine

your hatred and oppoſition, when they might have love and good will?
But when we conſider the weight of the blood of ſouls, and how bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
many a poor creature ſhall in hell curſe his man-pleaſing Miniſter, we
are afraid.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that think us too large, let them be pleaſed to conſider.</p>
               <p>1. That God would not have the door ſo ſtrait as many ſuppoſe; we
know that purity is amiable, and required of all in the Church, and that
it hath ſuch a lovely aſpect, that many ſo fix their eyes upon it, as if that
were only to be attended and proſecuted in the conſtitution and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Churches; yet with ſome confidence we dare affirm, 1. That
the ſtricteſt way of admiſſion is not therefore beſt, becauſe ſtricteſt.
2. That 'tis much ſafer, in the management of Admiſſions, and more
acceptable to God, to be ſo facile, as to hazard the admiſſion of many
unfit, rather then to exclude one that ought not to be excluded:
Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> ſaith, <q>
                     <hi>Rather ninety nine ſhould periſh through preſumption,
then one humble ſoul belonging to Chriſt, ſhould ſink under diſcouragement:</hi>
                  </q>
Way. <hi>p.</hi> 58. 3. That the admiſſion of ſome leſs fit, can neither defile
the Ordinances to others, nor hinder their Spiritual Communion: <hi>Non
polluitur communio, licet minuitur ſolatio.</hi> 4. That Cenſoriouſneſs, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings
and Contempt of weaker Chriſtians, Errors, Averſneſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
and yeild to Brethren of different Judgement in leſs things, for
peace ſake, (though they make not ſo great a noiſe in the world) are
ſins of a more dangerous conſequence, more pernicious to the Church,
in themſelves more infectious, and againſt which there lies more juſt
exceptions, as to admiſſion, then many other failings which uſually are
excepted againſt in the weaker ſort. 5. That thoſe Churches have moſt
of Goſpel-order, where unity and encouragement of the weak is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
regarded and proſecuted with purity, going hand in hand, but one not
juſtling out another. 6. That if the beſt of men would but impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weigh their private failings in the ſame Scale in which they uſually
weigh other mens, with the application of <hi>Matt.</hi> 7. 1, 12. and would put
on charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, 5, 6. with humility, they would not be ſo ſevere
againſt others.</p>
               <p>2. We cannot ſee any ground or Scripture-Warrant, for a ſtricter rule
then this we walk by: 1. The fitneſs which comes under our cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,
is only outward; whether they that are only outwardly qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
have a real intereſt in the ſeals of the covenant, <hi>before God,</hi> or not;
we think it unſeaſonable now to diſpute; that which we aſſert, is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117429:20"/>
by all of both parties, (that underſtand their principles) that the ſeals
are given to ſuch; and that in our Enquiries and Determinations, we are
to go no higher, leaſt we be guilty of prying into things ſecret, and of
uſurping the Throne and Scepter of the Almighty. 2. The rule which
muſt direct us to judge aright of this fitneſs, muſt of neceſſity have theſe
properties; Firſt, it muſt be general; or elſe, how ſhall it reach all men?
if it ſhould be ſo ſhort, or ſo narrow as to exclude any admiſſable, it
could not be acknowledged to be true. Secondly, it muſt be publike; the
Officers are publike, and ſo is the Act of Admiſſion, and ſo are the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
admitted to: and therefore it cannot be granted, that Officers
muſt manage theſe things by private inſtructions, and let in by a private
door. Thirdly, it muſt be a ſtanding rule; for if it be uncertain, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
and bending, how ſhall it direct us to make any ſteady or certain
tryal?</p>
               <p>3. The ſatisfaction wherein we are to acquieſs, ought to be publike
and Eccleſiaſtical; for if we were to admit only according to our private
ſatisfactions or diſ-ſatisfactions, who almoſt then could be admitted
with ſome? Who ſees not the uncertainty of ſuch a Rule? If this were
true, the ſame parties, under the ſame qualifications, without any alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
might be lawfully admitted, and rejected by ſeveral Churches,
nay, by the ſame Church at ſeveral times, ſome being more eaſily ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
then others.</p>
               <p>Not that the uſe of charity in this caſe is denyed, when we have made
as impartial a trial as we can; the ſtanding rules of charity muſt be made
uſe of: But yet God hath not ſo referred the matter to charity, as if none
were to be admitted, where our charity would not bring us up to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
or belief of regeneration; we ſuppoſe this therefore to be a
ſtanding Truth, that we may lawfully, and with peace of conſcience,
nay we ought to admit one, (if coming up to the rule) of whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
we may have particular diſ-ſatisfactions.</p>
               <p>If this were well conſidered, the difference about rigid admiſſions
would not be ſo great. Mr. <hi>Noton, Cont. Apoll.</hi> pag. 11. is full in this
point, diſtinguiſhing 'twixt <hi>fideles</hi>

or Eccleſiaſtice fideles, <hi>Believers that are really ſuch, and thoſe that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to be ſuch:</hi> And plainly aſſerts, That we ought to carry our ſelves
toward thoſe, as if they were really godly; and that
we are not bound poſitively to believe every one admiſſable into the
Church to be regenerate: Nay, that the Church may ſin in not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
one Eccleſiaſtically fit, although not really a Believer; and that the
judgement of charity, is not a perſwaſion of the integrity of a man;
but, in doubtful facts where the evil is not evident, an inclining to judge
the beſt, <hi>Negative &amp; practice,</hi> as he ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>Or if any ſhall not be ſatisfied with this, let them be pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
whether Mr. <hi>Burrows (Goſpel VVorſhip</hi> p. 238) doth not ſpeak more
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117429:21"/>
                  <hi>largely then we in the inſtance of</hi> Iudas; <hi>where he affirms our reſting in
Eccleſiaſtical ſatisfaction ſo neceſſary,</hi> 
                  <q>That though we had a private
Revelation from heaven, that ſuch a one were an hypocrite, yet we are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with him ſtill, till he ſo far diſcover himſelf, that his evill can be
proved publikely by witneſſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If any Rule ſhall come ſhort of theſe, we doubt not to call it defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
and if any ſhall go further, we as little doubt to call it a ſtrictneſs
above what is written.</p>
               <p>That our Rule is adaequate to outward fitneſs, hath the three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
qualifications, and affords ſufficient ground of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall
ſatisfaction, ſeems very clear to us, neither is it charged by any
with defect, ſaving that it ſpeaks not of the declaration of the work of
Grace, (which is further required by ſome) which how far it ſuits with
what we have now hinted, we leave to the judicious to conſider: And
ſhall only add a Word or two concerning the fifteenth Propoſition,
which expreſly relates to this. Wherein take notice:</p>
               <p>1. That it is not denyed, but that men converted may lawfully and
profitably declare what the Lord hath done for them.</p>
               <p>2. That therefore we ſhall accept it where offered.</p>
               <p>3. But the preſſing of this as a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> upon all, is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we are not ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe ſome of us ſee neither Scripture-Precept, nor preſident
for it: If the Apoſtles had either preſſed this themſelves in their Admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or preſcribed it to us, good reaſon had it been we ſhould have done
10. The moſt probable place for countenance of this practiſe, is 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15,
16. which yet ſpeaks nothing to a declaration of the work of grace; but
only that in thoſe perſecuting times, they ſhould have ſo much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Principles of Religion, as might enable them to juſtifie
their profeſſion, by giving a Reaſon of the Doctrine thereof, which he
calls hope, as <hi>Paul</hi> frequently doth, <hi>Act. 23. 6. &amp; 26. 7. &amp;</hi> 28. 20. And
that this is the meaning, appears from the Context, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15, 16, 17 which
ſhews he ſpeaks of giving this Reaſon of their Hope to Perſecutors diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfyed
with their Doctrine, (not with their integrity and truth of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion)
and therefore not a declaration of the work of Grace to Church-Officers
for admiſſion. To this ſome add <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 6. which indeed ſpeaks
of confeſſion of ſins, but nothing of a Declaration of the work of
Grace; they might acknowledge the ſinfulneſs of their former eſtate, or
acknowledge particular offences, and yet be far from that, for which
ſome produce this Text: Or if this Text would prove ſuch a thing, it
would only prove it voluntary on their part, but not enjoined by <hi>Iohn;</hi>
nay, what ever it was, it will be very hard to prove that it was publike,
or to <hi>Iohn</hi> at all; and as hard to prove it to have been before their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
by Baptiſm, and not after, <hi>vid.</hi> Dr. <hi>Lightfoot, Harm. Evan. in

2. Though it ſhould be granted (which yet all wil not) that the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church is the prime, and proper only ſubject to whom the ſeales be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long;
and that ſaving qualifications are requiſite to give a real intereſt
in them; and that we are to admit onely upon ſuch evidences, as may
give proof of intereſt; yet there are other more ſatisfactory evidences,
<hi>viz.</hi> from the tenour of a Chriſtians life, then this; which would ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
demonſtrate, (ſo far as we either can, or are concerned to know)
though this were laid aſide. If we had no mark but this, or none ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative
as this, or none ſufficiently demonſtrative without this, or
none leſs queſtionable, or leſs open to inconveniences, we conceive much
might have been ſaid.</p>
               <p>3. This is ſo inconſiderable an evidence, that it ſeems ſcarce any at
all (beſide ſo much of it as is included in the former)
to ſome of us; if there be any thing in it, it muſt be from the parties
own word, that is, his own affirmation that he is converted; which we
ſuppoſe to be no proof in this particular. If you ſay there is more, it
muſt be either from the thing ſpoken in the matter, or in the manner,
<hi>viz.</hi> the affectionateneſs of utterance. For the former, we ſuppoſe none
will ſay, That he only that hath the real experiences of grace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
can declare ſuch things, at leaſt, as are ordinarily ſpoken and
accepted in ſuch caſes. As for the latter, we ſuppoſe it will ſcarcefinde a
Patron for its evidenceſhip: And if his Expreſſion and affectionateneſs
ſhould, yet ſtill it reſts upon his own his word, whether it be ſo with him
as he ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>We intreat thoſe that think this ſo full a proof, to conſider how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
it is, ſince this came into faſhion, for vile men (ſome of us could
give inſtances, if it were convenient) to ſpeak ſo affectionately of their
converſion, and tell you how they were caſt down, and comforted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
that as to expreſſion, they would match the holyeſt Saint in the world.</p>
               <p>4. 'Tis not adaequate to Saint-ſhip, (at leaſt as 'tis preſſed and urged
by ſome) and therefore unfit to try by, as not reaching all admiſſable, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Rule of Chriſt. Who knows not how ſecret a thing the
work of grace is upon a ſoul, and how hardly diſcernable? The gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and ſtill proceedings, the long intervals of the ſpirits acts, the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
method, the darkneſs and fears upon peoples hearts; all theſe make
it hard to be diſcovered.</p>
               <p>5. We have ſeen ſome printed Books of Confeſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
have as much ſatisfied us againſt it as any thing. We are afraid of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our people upon theſe temptations and inconveniences, which in
that courſe others have fallen upon.</p>
               <p>6. There is a holy modeſty and baſhfulneſs, which either doth, or
ought to attend thoſe paſſages and tranſactions (we mean the work it
ſelf, and not the ſhameful miſcarriages of our lives) 'twixt God and
out ſouls, which may juſtly excuſe them from publike view.</p>

not there, nor can the laſt reſolution of judicious and reaſonable charity iſſue
there: whether the perſon be a viſible Saint or no? for there be many truly and
ſavingly called, who never knew the time and manner of their converſion, and
therefore cannot relate it to others, and yet expreſs the power of grace in their

if a perſon live not in the commiſſion of any known ſin, or in the neglect of

with judicious charity, to hope and believe there is ſomething of God and
grace in the ſoul; and therefore fit for Church-Society.</q>

Surely ingenious men will not threap that upon them, which they with
one Voice do ſo much diſown.</p>
               <p>2. All that they ſay, (in this caſe) is this, That it is neceſſary that
Church-Members do co-habit; and that for order ſake, it is fit that
bounds be ſet and obſerved. And doth not Scripture and reaſon ſay the
ſame?</p>
               <p>1. In the New-Teſtament, Did not the people of God, living in a
Town or City, alwayes joyne together among themſelves in a Church-Way?
For why elſe are Churches denominated from places? as the
Church of <hi>Rome, Corinth,</hi> &amp;c. when will it be proved, or what Scripture
ſpeaks it, that any lived in a Neighborhood or Town, where there was a
Church, and yet was a Member of a Church in an other Town?</p>
               <p>2. Is not this (as 'tis uſually practiſed) inconſiſtent with the ends of
Church-Memberſhip? Church-Members may ſo live together, 1. That
their Paſtor and Officers may reſide among them for inſpection and
rule. 2. That they may meet commodiouſly and frequently together for
the enjoyment of Ordinances. 3. That they may maintain communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for help and advice among themſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all this with eaſe and
conveniency. Now how this can be done as it ought, where the Members
live ſo much diſtant, (as is uſual in many gathered Churches) let the
moderate judge?</p>
               <p>3. How will contention, confuſion and diſorder be avoided, if this
be kept up? Is it nothing for one Miniſter (by the invitation of ſuch a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:117429:23"/>
proclaimed Liberty) to deprive another of the comfort of his prayers,
tears and labours? Or for one Church to bereave another of its help
and comfort, in bereaving it of its choiceſt Members? Or is it nothing
to ſet ſuch an example before the eyes of the weaker ſort? May not the
pulling out of one Pin endanger the ruine of the whole Fabrick? Make
the caſe your own, and then judge. Would you be willing to be ſo dealt
withall? Would you not think your ſelves wronged, if others ſhould go
about to withdraw from you the Members of your Churches? It is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by ſome, how men can ſo confidently appropriate the title of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Order
to their Way, (but that glorious pretences, and high words
are more hopefull to prevail with the greater part of men, then ſolid
Arguments,) when 'tis ſo apparently peccant againſt the Goſpel rules of
the God of Order? yet let not this be thought an Accuſation of all the
Congregational Brethren. Many there are (we know) that judge theſe
proceedings irregular as well as we; and that are afraid <hi>to boaſt in another
mans line, of things made ready to their hand,</hi> chooſing to wait with hope for
the enlargement of their Churches and comfort, from the reformation
and growth of thoſe that are under their own Miniſtry, rather then to
make up their churches by entring upon <hi>other mens labours, 2 Cor.</hi> 10. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>3. That the Principles of the Congregational Brethren come up ſo
far, that we think there would be no difference in this point, if they were
practiſed.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>They ſay, co-habitation of Members is neceſſary, upon many ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
accounts.</hi> Vid. Hooker Survey, Part 1. <hi>p.</hi> 49. <q>Such co-habitation (<hi>ſaith
he</hi>) is required, which is neceſſary for the diſpenſation of Gods Ordinances,
and the adminiſtration of Church-cenſures; for otherwiſe the end of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
would be made fruſtrate, and the benefit of the whole prejudiced; and
hence there muſt needs be ſuch a co-habitation of Officers, and a convenient
company of Members, that they comely and conveniently meet together, to
the exerciſe of all Gods Ordinances,</q> Act. 14. 27. 1 Cor. 11. 20. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 14. 23.
<hi>To the ſame purpoſe,</hi> Norton Contr. Apoll. <hi>p.</hi> 40.</p>
               <p>2. They acknowledge our churches (at leaſt, moſt of them) to be true
Churches. Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> rejects the denyal of this with abhorrency.</p>
               <p>3. That therefore 'tis unlawful to ſeparate from them, either for the
want of ſome Ordinances, or for the <hi>fin</hi> of ſome worſhippers. <hi>Vid. Hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
Preface</hi> to the <hi>Survey:</hi> and <hi>Norton, p.</hi> 156.</p>
               <p>That theſe three Principles are owned by them, will not be denyed;
and that they are inconſiſtent with the common practice of gathering
Churches out of other Pariſhes, is too evident. Will they call our
Churches true, and yet unchurch them, by taking our Members againſt
our conſent? Will they ſay, That 'tis unlawful to ſeparate from our
Churches, and yet entertain and encourage thoſe that ſeparate? Will
they ſay, Co-habitation is neceſſary, and yet receive thoſe that live ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
miles diſtant?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:117429:23"/>
If any ſeek to evade this by ſaying, That though many, yet not all
Congregations in England are true Churches.</p>
               <p>We anſwer, 1. It ſhould then firſt be proved, (and not taken for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
that ſuch a Congregation as they deſire to receive Members from,
is no true Church.</p>
               <p>2. But who (of all that take this Liberty) doth make a difference
'twixt one congregation and another, and forbears to take (if opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
ſerve) from a congregation, reputed a true Church.</p>
               <p>3. How eaſily will this be objected againſt any Church whence Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
be had, That 'tis no true Church; and how muſt the controverſie
be decided? <hi>Facile credimus quod volumus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be further urged, that though our Churches be true, yet are they
corrupt: So that it may be lawfuli to withdraw communion from the
ſame; as in the <hi>Anſ.</hi> of Elders of <hi>New-England,</hi> to the 32. Queſt.
<hi>pag.</hi> 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We acknowledge with grief, That many of our congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are corrupt. Yet [1.] this doth not in any wiſe juſtifie the gathering
of Members that inhabit not within convenient limits. [2.] Nor the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereing
out of thoſe Congregations which are more purged, though
not according to the hight of ſtrictneſs which ſome require. <hi>Ames</hi> (uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
cited by our Brethren in this point) <hi>Caſ. Conſc. Lib. 5. cap.</hi> 12. Q. 3.
mentions but three cauſes of ſeparation from a true Church: 1. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of their ſins. 2. Eminent danger of Seduction. 3. Perſecution.
And yet theſe are not applicable to many <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Churches, from
whom nevertheleſs Members are withdrawn. True indeed, Mr. <hi>Norton</hi>
adds a fourth; Separation may be (ſaith he, <hi>p.</hi> 168.) for purer Worſhip
and Edification, <hi>no great inconvenience enſuing.</hi> But there lies much
weight in the laſt words; otherwiſe upon this ground men might ſhift
from one Congregational-church to another for purer Worſhip, as well
as from a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> to a Congregational-church. But (3.) is it the beſt,
moſt warrantable, and moſt effectual courſe of curing a corrupt church,
to take away from it the beſt Chriſtians it hath? Or are you ſure that
you can juſtifie before the Lord, your weakning the hands and hearts of
other Miniſters, that are upon the reformation of their more corrupt
churches, which you unavoidably do by this practice. Many have
thought, that it were a better expedient to diſperſe good members into
leſs pure Churches, that ſo there might be moſt help, where there is moſt
need.</p>
               <p>If any ſay, This is a grievous yoke for tender conſciences.</p>
               <p>We anſwer: 1. Tender conſciences ought to be univerſally tender;
Why alſo are they not tender of breaking rule, and of being exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of diſorder, and introducing the many inconveniences that attend
this practice?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:117429:24"/>
2. We think we have provided as much for a tender conſcience, as a
truly tender conſcience can require. Do we engage them to be without
Ordinances or Memberſhip, in caſe there be no Miniſter of their own?
Or do we engage them to ſcandalous and inſufficient Miniſters? If any
will deſire to depart when they can plead none of theſe; we fear it be hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
or ignorance, more then tenderneſs of conſcience, To thoſe that
would plead that we may tye them from Church-Ordinances, (as in caſe
the Miniſter where they live forbear them upon the general unfitneſs of
his people.) 'Tis readily anſwered, we provide help for that, he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
them for the preſent in other congregations.</p>
               <p>They that ſay, by this means they ſhall be hindered from ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
with whom they can moſt profit; may be pleaſed to anſwer theſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions:
Whence is your profiting? is it from the Miniſter and his ability,
or from God? Is it likely that God will give the ſucceſs you, expect out
of his own way? We deny not but the God of order may overlook your
irregularities, and give divine influence while ye ſeek it in a diſorderly
way. But what reaſon have ye to expect it in your way? Do ye certainly
know that ye have profited, or that all your joy which you have got in
this courſe is ſolid? Are there not ſenſible conſolations, even in holy
men? And do not theſe run with a violent ſtream? May they not miſtake
their own ſpirits upon that account? May you not profit more, for ought
you know, in humble waiting on God where he hath ſet you? And might
you not more cheerfully expect it here then elſewhere? Many ſerious
Chriſtians have thought, and found it to be the moſt hopeful, ready,
certain way of a ſpeedy increaſe of grace, and of attainment of more
real and laſting comfort, for a man to beſtirre himſelf in the inſtruction,
reproof, and reformation of the people with whom he lives (this affords
opportunity and advantage for the exerciſe of grace; and exerciſe is one
of the beſt wayes to increaſe it) rather then to remove to the miniſtery
of a man of quicker and abler parts.</p>
               <p>Some may (poſſibly) except againſt the condeſcention of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of the congregational-judgement, in point of Ordination, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<hi>Prop.</hi> 17. Let ſuch conſider:</p>
               <p>1. That Ordination by the people is one of the main occaſions of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Brethren, who in this regard do not know how
to own men, ſo ordained, for Miniſters; and then ſurely, if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
this offence ſhould be removed.</p>
               <p>2. This Propoſition doth not take away the election from the
people, which the congregational-brethren look upon as the chief
thing.</p>
               <p>3. We are agreed, That ſuch Ordination ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in the Congregation, unto which the perſon is to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:117429:24"/>
4. <hi>Albeit, the congregational brethren affirm, that an</hi> inorganicall
Church, and homogeneal, <hi>may ordain; yet 'tis not againſt their principles,
that Miniſters of other Churches do it for them. Mr.</hi> Hooker <hi>affirms as
much out of</hi> Didoc. Survey Part 2. p. 57. (<hi>ſpeaking of thoſe that are to
ordain</hi>) <q>By Elderſhip then is meant the Officers; but whether they were the
Paſtor and Teacher, and the Ruling Elders of one Congregation, called a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory;
or whether they were the Officers of many congregations together, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a Claſſis: I could never yet hear any Arguments that could evince either
by dint of undenyable evidence. <hi>And more fully, p.</hi> 59. Though it be moſt
comely that thoſe of the ſame congregation ſhould exerciſe it, yet the Elders
alſo of other congregations may be invited hereunto, and intereſted in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of it, in an other church where they have no power.</q> 
                  <hi>And the Liberty
which they allow to Miniſters of preaching and adminiſtring the Seals
in other congregations beſides their own, as alſo the requiring of the
counſel and help of other Miniſters for the tryal of a perſon to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
over an other church (which is allowed and adviſed too by</hi> Ames.
Bellar. Enerv. Tom. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> Norton <hi>p.</hi> 101.) <hi>will alſo prove this condeſcention
ſutable to their principles. Mr.</hi> Allin, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Shepheard <hi>in the defence of
the 9. Poſitions, p. 132. grant,</hi> 
                  <q>That a Miniſter may put forth an occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
act of Power, or <hi>precariam poteſtatem</hi> to thoſe in an other Church, over
whom he is no Officer (though it be not towards them as over his own Flock)
and that though an Officer of one Church, is no Officer over an other Church,
yet ſuch an Officer may put forth acts of his Officer towards thoſe that are
not of his proper Flock.</q> 
                  <hi>And if ſo, why not this Act of Power as well as
an other? why may they not ordain, as well as adminiſter Sacraments
in another Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> (a Congregational-Brother, and one thus ordained) in
his Epiſt. before his ſerious queſtion, gives us the report, that of late
this is practiſed in <hi>New-England;</hi> which alſo we have had confirmed to
us by others. And ſhould not this then be yeilded unto for the churches
peace?</p>
               <p>5. Although the congregational-brethren ſhould think the peoples
Election greater then ordination, yet if they yeild to Ordination as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>-Brethren can comfortably own them as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Goſpel; for ſo long as they have both, there is no doubt to
be made, but that they have all eſſentials of an outward call to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a miniſter; though we run up ſeverall lines, yet we all meet in the
ſame point.</p>
               <p>One thing more there is which ſome may peradventure ſtumble at,
which is the ſupplying the want of Elders by the aſſiſtance of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring-miniſters,
of which in <hi>Prop.</hi> 19. The reaſons of which practice
are hinted in the Propoſition; and the cautions for the right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:117429:25"/>
We would not have adventured upon any thing not ordinary; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ words">
                     <desc>〈◊…〉</desc>

did not compel us. They that underſtand the controverſſe about Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
know, 1. That all are not ſatisfied concerning Ruling Eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
2. And others are not ſatisfied concerning the power of a Miniſter
to act alone in theſe things, where Elders are not to be had. And ſuch is
the general ſtate of our people, that in caſe we were all ſatisfied in the
firſt, yet can we not at preſent act in that courſe, for want of fit men to be
imployed in that Office. So that ſuch of us as are not ſatisfied concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Miniſters ſole power, muſt either take ſome ſuch courſe, or do
nothing. If our preſent caſe then be well conſidered, we hope men will
not be ſo ready to except againſt it.</p>
               <p>That in ſuch a caſe, where the ordinary courſe cannot be followed,
ſome extraordinary way may be taken, is not only our aſſertion, but the
aſſertion and practice of others (in other caſes) whoſe authority we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
will not be ſlightly overlooked by pious and intelligent men; we
mean the Aſſembly, who in their advice concerning Ordination, lay
this down as a certain concluſion, which they prove 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 29. 34, 36.
where the <hi>Levi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> (which was beſide the ordinary rule) helped the Prieſts
to ſlay the Burnt Offerings, they being too few to do it by themſelves.
And alſo 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 30. 3, 4. which Propoſition will as much juſtifie us in this
particular, as them in an extraordinary expedient for Ordination; which
as things then ſtood, was neceſſary; and for which this was produced by
them.</p>
               <p>That this courſe is neereſt to the ordinary rule, we think is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p>1. The work is done by Miniſters, of which number the Miniſter of
the Congregation is one: Here is one part of the ordinary Rule kept
up.</p>
               <p>2. The end may be as well attained in this, as in the ordinary
courſe: None (we hope) will ſay this is a leſs ſafe proceeding, in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the juſtneſs of admiſſion and rejection.</p>
               <p>3. Many ſuppoſe, that as in the planting of the firſt Churches, all
things were managed by Miniſters in common, till the churches were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
ſo in the reformation of corrupt churches, things cannot be carried
on any other way, till the churches be brought into ſome order.</p>
               <p>4. This is no other then what the Aſſembly adviſe, in the Form of
Church Government, where in the want of an ordinary Elder-ſhip,
they direct, that ſuch a congregation ſhould be under the inſpection of
the aſſociated Neighbouring-Officers.</p>
               <p>Many other things there are which we would have inſiſted on, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
having writ ſo fully of them, we ſhall paſs them over in ſilence.
Many exceptions alſo we foreſee, ſome of ignorant &amp; wilful men, which
we conceive not worthy to be taken notice of; others of learned men,
which we apprehend not fit to trouble the weak withal. We are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:117429:25"/>
that the diſtinction of <hi>Forum Eccleſiae &amp; Dei</hi> (which we make
uſe of) is queſtioned by ſome; as Mr. <hi>Blake Cov. ſealed p.</hi> 141. But the ſenſe
in which we uſe it, lies not open to his exceptions. We deny not but that
<hi>Forum Eccleſiae</hi> is a Court of Gods conſtituting, and in that regard, 'tis
alſo <hi>Forum Dei;</hi> but we only uſe it to expreſs that external right which
Profeſſors have, by vertue of thoſe directions which God hath given for
the regulating of Church-affairs (whether this be a real, or onely an
analogicall right we meddle not) as it ſtands in oppoſition to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and gracious acceptance of God.</p>
               <p>The uſual exceptions about ſcandals not enumerated, need not trouble
us. When we aſſent to the Aſſemblies directions, about ſins ſcandalous
in one ſingle act, though we ſay that we look upon all the ſins mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them as ſuch; yet we ſay not that we look upon them only as ſuch.
So that when any thing of that nature falls out, we are agreed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
the Aſſociation about it.</p>
               <p>Some may likewiſe think our uſing the Aſſemblies direction (in thoſe
Principles of Religion ſet down by them) for tryal of Knowledge, to
be ſuperfluous, ſeeing we might have made uſe of our Confeſſion for
that end. But we have not done this without weighty reaſons (as ſeems
to us) which for brevitie ſake we mention not. And ſeeing the worſt
that can be ſaid againſt this, is but to charge us with an unneceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundancy
(which yet judicious men will not do) we are the leſs careful
to ſpend time about it.</p>
               <p>As for the Confeſſion it ſelf, we have added it as an Expoſition to the
Creed; and yet not out of any affectaion of Novelty or Singularity. They
that know any thing of the Hiſtory of the Church, know that it hath
not been unuſual to compoſe and recommend ſeveral forms of Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Faith; and that in ſuch caſes thoſe things were moſt inſiſted on,
which were then moſt queſtioned and oppoſed; wiſe men (we know) will
not take exceptions againſt the thing it ſelf. 'Tis not a new Faith that
we propound, but that which was of old delivered unto the Saints; none
(ſurely) but blind and perverſe men will think to bring it into contempt
by calling it a new Creed. If the exceptions lie againſt our perſons, as
unfit to compoſe or recommend ſuch a thing; we have this to ſay, That
as we conceived ſuch a thing neceſſary, (as the caſe of the Church now
ſtands) ſo were we moſt deſirous to have uſed what others have done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, rather then by our example to encourage a raſh, indeliberate,
or perverſe undertaking of men in this kinde, or whatſoever inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
might follow the common practiſe hereof. Yet while ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
(which others uſe) pleaſed not all, as to method, and form, and
the like: It was propounded that we ſhould ſet the Aſſemblies confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Catechiſm before us, as our rule, that a ſhort confeſſion ſhould
be drawn out of them, and as near as could be in their very words. And
this courſe accordingly was agreed on: So that we would not have
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:117429:26"/>
you to look upon it as ours, but the Aſſemblies, onely epitomized by us.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Having put you in minde of theſe things, we ſhall now conclude with
Exhortation.</head>
               <p>1. We beſeech you Brethren, in the Name of our Lord Jeſus, proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
union and concord: Let the peace of the Church lie very neer
your hearts. This is ſo much in mens mouths, prayers and wiſhes, that it
would ſeem not to ſtand need of many Arguments to inforce it: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it would not, if mens endeavours were but anſwerable to their
expreſſions; but the thing is ſo precious, and men (notwithſtanding
their complemental pretences) ſo really backward, that it requires more
then at preſent we can ſay.</p>
               <p>1. Our Profeſſion is a profeſſion of Peace; Concord is a neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
of Religion, both in reſpect of its preſervation and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Scripture telling us of the <hi>bond of peace,</hi> and calling love the
<hi>bond of perfectneſs,</hi> doth more then hint how much Religion is behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it, both as to life and growth. The Goſpel indeed doth occaſion
wars, and thrives by them, while her profeſſors are at peace among
themſelves: But if diſſention among brethren ariſe, ruin haſtens on,
<hi>a Kingdome divided cannot ſtand.</hi> So much of Religion is wrapt up in it,
that God ſtiles himſelf by that name. And Chriſt looks upon it as one
of his honourable titles, [<hi>King of Peace.</hi>] And that we may know how
much he delights to have us reſemble him in this, he puts that name
upon his Goſpel, and Children. It runs through all the veins of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and is as inſeperable from it as holineſs, <hi>the wiſdome from above is
peaceable, as well as pure, Sam.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
               <p>2 How many ingagements hath the Lord laid upon us for unity?
Would he have inculcated his exhortations to amity and peace ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
if it had been a ſuperfluous, unneceſſary, indifferent accident of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?
What book almoſt of the New Teſtament is there that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
it not? Read <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17, 18. and 15. 1, 2, 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10, 11.
with many places more; Or would he have preſſed it ſo earneſtly, if
he would not have had us forward in it? <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts and conjures

<hi>Pſal.</hi> 133. calls it not onely good in it ſelf, but alſo pleaſant in its
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117429:26"/>
fruits and exerciſe. Chriſt makes it the great Character of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and annexeth large and glorious promiſes to it. And beſides all
theſe, our own confeſſions of the happineſs and neceſſity of concord
(wrung from our own lips, by the ſmart of our diviſions) and our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for it, as a choice bleſſing, are ſtrong obligations upon us for the
proſecution of it.</p>
               <p>3. Why is the rod yet upon our backs? Is not this one main cauſe,
that we know not how to agree among our ſelves? doubtleſs our falling
out by the way is diſpleaſing to the Lord: When the Lord was about
to heal us we have fallen together by the ears, and ſet up Altar againſt
Altar; Church againſt Church: The Lord hath ſeen it, and hath turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us back into the wilderneſs: Shall wee not learn yet to be friends,
when the Lord hath been forced to whip us for our contention? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we cannot expect the healing of the Land till our mindes are more
peaceable, and the noiſe of the Axe and Hammer ceaſe; The
houſe of God will not be built, till the materials be fitted for a cloſe
and orderly conjunction.</p>
               <p>4. Is it ſeaſonable now to contend when we are upon the very brink
of ruine? If we were not aſleep, or if God had not beſotted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed
us, in order to deſtruction, (for <hi>quos perdere vult dementat</hi>)
would we not be more ſenſible of our danger then to trifle and contend
when the ſhip is now almoſt overwhelmed with the waves?</p>
               <p>What greater advantage can wee give to the common adverſaries?
who looks upon our diviſions as the hopefulleſt ſtratagem to further
their deſign? How eaſie is the conqueſt when wee have weakned our
ſelves? what will they have to do more then to look on, and gather
the ſpoil? Forrain invaſions is uſually a means of cementing a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
under civil Conteſts: And why do not we ſee this neceſſary upon
the Churches account? Is it not enough for <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Mount
Seir</hi> to be againſt us, but we muſt needs be one againſt another? True,
divine anger hath ſtirred up the waves, and made the Sea boiſterous,
and now (as <hi>Baſil Epiſt.</hi> 5. makes the compariſon) we are ready to bee
deſtroyed, not ſo much from the violence of the ſtorm, as our claſhing
one againſt another. Oh! remember it's eaſie to break a divided church;
but if once broken, who knows whether ever it may be made up again.
<hi>Baſil in Epiſt.</hi> 203. compares the Church to an old garment which is ſoon
torn, but not ſo ſoon mended; he ſaith not at all, (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>)
and ſpeaks of its recovery as hopeleſs.</p>
               <p>See how our ſtrifes gratifie our adverſaries! 1. While we are buſie one
againſt another, we give them opportunity to undermine us; the duſt we
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:117429:27"/>
have raiſed, gives incouragement to them that work unſeen, and alſo
afford tools to work withall, and advantages to work upon. 2. The
ſcoffs they caſt upon us keep off many, and ſo weakens us by with-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a party; which though it cloſe not with them directly, yet they ſerve
as a Blinde to cover their ſecret contrivances againſt us. 3. We put an
argument into their mouths againſt our ſelves; they conclude againſt
the truth of our Churches from our diſagreement. The Papiſts, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi>
and all of that way that ſpeak of the notes of a Church,
as alſo Quakers make uſe of this to prove us no true Church. How
quarrels and diviſions among Chriſtians occaſioned the perſecutions of
the Heathen Emperors, and were made uſe of to juſtifie their cruelty, is
too apparent.</p>
               <p>5. We not onely hazard all for the future; but at preſent we taſte ſo
much of the bitter fruits, as may make us lay aſide our contendings:
Who ſees not how much the honor of Religion, the glory of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
name, and of Gods name too, is wounded by it?</p>
               <p>We have ſtriven ſo long about ſmaller matters, that others begin to
queſtion all, and with a daring hand to ſhake the main Pillars of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
And theſe ſtrivings about Government gave the firſt hint of take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up notions, and encouragement to thoſe errors to appear boldly with
open face, which otherwiſe would not have dared to have peeped out of
their graves. And thoſe that adhere to the truth, are not a little prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by it, as to piety and growth in grace: If that heat and diligence
which hath been ſpent in the purſuance of theſe queſtions, had been
laid out for the improvement of godlineſs, Oh! what glorious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ſhould we have had! How weariſome and tedious are theſe civill
broyles? What miſtakes, revilings, and unſeemly expreſſions have
they occaſioned? How much hath our communion with God been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
by them? and how much of our ſweetneſs and inward peace,
while we were neceſſitated to ſtudy, and dwell upon ſuch unpleaſing
ſubjects? O ye ſons of peace! why do ye ſo forget your name, your
Fathers name, the Goſpels name? why are you ſo pitileſs to the diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Church, your diſtreſſed Mother? Hath cuſtome ſo naturalized you
to contention, that you will rather venture the reputation of Religion,
weaken your own graces, abate your comforts, ſtraighten the paſſages
of intercourſe 'twixt God and your own ſouls, then be perſwaded to bee
at peace? Doubtleſs, if we hold long at this, we ſhall have cauſe to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
peace at a higher rate than many of our queſtionings, when perhaps
we cannot ſo eaſily obtain it.</p>
               <p>But this is a thing which (by vertue of divine Authority) will claim
a greater intereſt in our endeavours then our bare wiſhes and prayers
will amount unto; In <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 19. we are bid (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to <hi>proſecute</hi> it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:117429:27"/>
while it flies from us; not barely to meet and accept it, when it comes
to us; 'tis a ſad contradiction (nay a ſelf-conviction and condemnation)
to pray for it, and yet not to purſue it.</p>
               <p>True, all would have peace; but then they would have others to
come up to their terms, while they in the mean time refuſe to deſcend
to others; ſo that the hinderance is from hence, not that peace is not
deſired, but not rightly proſecuted. There are fit mediums and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for peace, which we are ingaged to look after as well as peace it
ſelf; in the fore-mentioned place the Apoſtle bids us follow not barely
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>things that concern it,</hi> and may conduce
thereunto; would but men conſider that they are ingaged to this, and
conſcienciouſly obey the divine command herein, peace would not long
be a Stranger to us.</p>
               <p>We know ſome that eagerly preſs peace, propound no other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for it then union of affection, with a mutual toleration of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences:
But alas, this will not heal the wound, nay ſcarce skin it over,
ſo long as no courſe is taken to heal our differences (eſpecially in thoſe
things wherein we intrench upon one anothers intereſt) it will be found
a task next to an impoſſiblity to cement affections: We know when all is
done, there will be a need of that principle; but yet it muſt be condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the ſmaller things of difference, that muſt do the work They that
will not ſacrifice their Punctillo's for the Churches peace, do not value
peace of the Church as they ought. The great controverſie 'twixt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Jews and Gentiles was thus compoſed by the Synod of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<hi>Act.</hi> 15. The Gentiles were ſo far to condeſcend, on their part, as to
ſubmit to the four Precepts of <hi>Noah:</hi> And the Jews ſo far to condeſcend
to the Gentiles, as not to preſs circumciſion and other ceremonies upon
them. Neither do we ſee how peace can be ſetled in theſe Churches up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other terms; Shall the Presbyterian and Congregational Brethren
ſtand at a diſtance ſtill? then they mutually hinder one anothers work,
and betwixt them endanger the intereſt of the Goſpel: Would you have
either of them to drive on their way to the overthrow of the other? that's
unchriſtian, unbrotherly, unmerciful: Is there hope of convincing each
other, and ſo of one party to come over to the other? that's not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected:
Is there a probability of union of affection while the difference
ſtands as wide as before? Experience teacheth the contrary; alienation
of affections is the onely iſſue of different judgement and practice. What
other thing then can be thought of, beſides mutual condeſcention in
leſs things? And if both parties would but ſtand to what hath been
written on either ſide, and improve their mutual conceſſions, the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the difference would in a great part be effected. And as for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
differences, if they were put to this iſſue, How far we ought to
yeeld for peace? it would (through Gods bleſſing) be quickly complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:117429:28"/>
The greateſt difficulty is from the diſtemper of mens heads and hearts;
the diſtance of principles is not half ſo great as the diſtance of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The due reſpect that (for conſcience ſake) is to be had to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
lafety and welfare of the Church, together with what is already
yeilded unto by the ſeveral parties, will take away a great part of the
difference; the diſagreement in ſeveral other principles (though it ſhould
continue) need not hinder union in the practice of thoſe very things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
which the diſagreement is, and an agreemen thus far is the moſt
hopeful courſe to ſatisfie one another in other things; to debate things
in ſuch a calm way, gives more hope of divine approbation and bleſſing,
and leſs advantage to Satan of working upon the humors and paſſions
of men, which uſually darken the judgement, even of thoſe that ſeek
the truth, and hinders ſatisfaction. If a compoſing deſigne proſper not,
we ſuſpect the hinderance will chiefly ariſe from ſome of theſe
evills.</p>
               <p>1. Some are pleaſed with nothing which themſelves propound not;
many are ſo deſirous to be Leaders, and have ſuch an immoderate am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
after an <hi>ego primus inveni,</hi> that they think it a diſgrace to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
though in a neceſſary work. This thiſtle will grow ſometime in
good ground, and good men have cauſe to watch againſt it: the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of <hi>Luther</hi> from <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> in the buſineſs of pulling down
of Images, is ſaid to have ſprung from this root.</p>
               <p>2. Ignorance (we fear) will prove as great an enemy to peace, as any
thing elſe: Many underſtand only the practike part of their own way,
not fully knowing the extent, limits, neceſſity, and indifferencie of their
ſeveral principles: theſe even out of a zeal to truth, will ſtand off, as
not knowing how far they may ſafely yeild.</p>
               <p>3. Many are engaged, and they will finde it a hard task to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in point of honor and credit, which they will think muſt be loſt
if they alter their courſe; this will ſtick in the heart many a time, when
the mouth will be ready to proclaim it to be the higheſt honor for any
man to be conquered by truth and peace.</p>
               <p>4. Many Miniſters (and yet they muſt be leading-men, if ſuch a thing
as this go on) are ſo over-driven by their friends and members of their
congregations, that they dare do little for fear of diſpleaſing them; an
unworthy ſpirit in a Miniſter of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>5. Some are ſo imbittered and exaſperated, that their blood is not
eaſily cooled, to condeſcend to thoſe whom but now they oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:117429:28"/>
6. Some delight in quarrels, and are only whetted up to embrace a
way, or to continue in it becauſe of oppoſition; their zeal is not ſo much
from love or conviction of the truth, as from an angry deſire to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict;
like ſouldiers of fortune, who, becauſe they live by the wars, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to hear of peace.</p>
               <p>7. Some want publike ſpirits; others want publike Principles; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
care not, ſo much as they ſhould, what becomes of other Churches,
ſo long as they have the ball at their own foot, and things go with them
as they would have it. The latter are ſo ſtraitned and pinioned in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that, if they would, they cannot be very ſerviceable, theſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
but ſome one thing in their eye, (as ſuppoſe purity or peace) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
that to the ruine and neglect of other things neceſſary.</p>
               <p>8. Some have drunk in ſuch ſtrong prejudices againſt their brethren,
that fancying the difference to be greater then it is, and ſuppoſing a clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
either unlawful, or ſcarce poſſible, they are the more backward to
hearken to any thing tending to a compoſure.</p>
               <p>9. Some place too much of their religion in ſtanding off from others,
as if the excellency &amp; height of chriſtianity lay in a rigid ſeperation from
thoſe Profeſſors which are of a lower ſize; and therefore will be more
hardly drawn to remit any thing of their ſuppoſed neceſſary ſtrictneſs,
rather deſiring to pleaſe themſelves, then to bear the infirmities of the
weak, ſuſpecting even neceſſary proviſions for the admiſſion of ſuch as
favouring too much of looſeneſs, and that which may bring upon them
a participation of other mens ſins.</p>
               <p>10. Some (it may be) think, an utter refuſal of peace with the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>
is but a juſt requital of that rigour and harſhneſs which they
uſed to others when they had the chair.</p>
               <p>We do not juſtifie the failings and irregularities of any; all parties (we
think) have too much cauſe to acknowledge themſelves guilty before
the Lord, and to be humbled; but if any make this a ground of diſtance,
let him call to minde that, in ſo doing, he becomes guilty of that which
he condemns in them: Nay, let him know, that whatever were the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
of ſome particular men at that time; yet the Aſſembly were
even then no leſs deſirous of concord with the diſſenting Brethren,
then others are at this preſent: They that will read the papers of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
annexed to the Reaſons of the diſſenting Brethren, may ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
ſatisfie themſelves in this.</p>
               <p>So powerful and ſo frequent are theſe diſtempers in many of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:117429:29"/>
(we intend them not as an accuſation of any particular man) that
except the Lord command theſe proud waves to be ſtill, and take down
the loftineſs of all our hearts (which is the root whence all theſe evils
ſpring) we cannot hope for any great ſucceſs in this deſigne of concord,
notwithſtanding that our ſeveral principles make ſo fair a way for it. If it
would pleaſe the Lord to do this for us, &amp; withal to ſtir up a <hi>Conſtantine</hi> or
a <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> that might rigorouſly preſs on this work, by countenancing
it where it is endeavoured, by calling the Godly Miniſtery of the land to
conſultation, by charging them to agree, and holding them to it, we
ſhould quickly ſee the face of things altered; <hi>Ephraim</hi> would not any
more envy <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> would not vex <hi>Ephraim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. We exhort you to ſubmit to the Diſcipline and Government of
Chriſt: <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves; for
they watch for your ſouls, as they that muſt give account, that they may do it
with joy, and not with grief, for that is unprofitable for you. Heb.</hi> 13. 17. The
great quarrel that carnal hearts have againſt Chriſt, is about the Laws
and Scepter of his Kingdom: this is that that renders him ſo unlovely
to them. To ſuch men we ſhall propound four things, which we deſire
they ſhould ſeriouſly weigh.</p>
               <p>1. The Government and Diſcipline is not ours, but Chriſts: True
indeed, he hath appointed his Officers to manage it, and for that end
hath made them Rulers over you, but yet they are <hi>over you in the Lord,</hi>
1 Theſ. 5. 13. and <hi>as thoſe that muſt give an account for you,</hi> and therefore
charges you to <hi>obey</hi> and <hi>ſubmit</hi> to ſuch; not only to obey their Doctrine,
but alſo to ſubmit to their reproof and cenſures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. And becauſe
the conſideration of their inſpection may be a means to prevent ſins in
you, therefore he commands you to <hi>remember them which have the rule
over you,</hi> v. 7. And in 1 <hi>Theſſ. 5. 12, 13. Know them which labour among you;</hi>
that is, acknowledge (for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>non eſt ſimpliciter cognoſcere ſed agnoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.
Zanch.</hi>) them as Rulers appointed over you by God, obeying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verencing
them accordingly; and that not only in their teaching when
they <hi>labour among you,</hi> but alſo in their Ruling-work when they <hi>admoniſh
you.</hi> And though the effect of this might be ſometime diſpleaſing to you,
yet notwithſtanding he chargeth you to <hi>eſteem them very highly in love,</hi>
(<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>very abundantly, more then exceedingly for their work ſake.</hi>
Oh! then take heed of that rebellious voice, which coſt <hi>Korah</hi> and his
company ſo deer, <hi>Numb. 16. 3. Ye take too much upon you; wherefore lift you
up your ſelves above the Congregation of the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If ye refuſe and rebell, you do not ſo much deſpiſe us as Chriſt,
who hath imployed us; the cauſe is not ours, but his; and the contempt is
principally againſt the king of peace: he fully tels you all this, <hi>Luk</hi> 10. 16
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:117429:29"/>
                  <hi>that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he
that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> Say not in your hearts as thoſe
wicked ones, <hi>VVe will not have this man to rule over us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Conſider the iſſue; will ye think to gain any thing by rejecting
his Government? Do you not remember that he hath an Iron Rod, as
well as a Scepter of Mercy? If ye refuſe the yokes of wood, can he not
put an iron yoke upon your neck? think not to bear out in a bravado
againſt God, though like the wilde Aſs in the wilderneſs, you ſhould
ſnuff up the winde, and traverſe on your way, or bend your brow againſt
him; yet, will the Almighty be afraid of your frown? Or will he make
ſupplications to you? Oh vain man! bethink thy ſelf how thou wilt
anſwer thy contempt if thou doſt continue.</p>
               <p>4. There is nothing in the Government of Chriſt, that ſhould make
a rational man refuſe it, (we ſpeak of Government and diſcipline in the
main, and not of the controverted points of it) That there muſt be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and ruled in the Church, is not queſtioned; and that the ruled muſt
ſubmit to the direction, admonition and reproof of their rulers; and
that in ſome caſes ſinners muſt be ſharply dealt withall by publike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20. and ſometimes by excommunication, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. 17.
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4, 5, 13. All theſe are evident. Now though theſe thwart the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
intereſts of men, and are no wayes pleaſing to fleſh and blood, yet
ſeeing all is <hi>for edification, and not deſtruction, 2 Cor.</hi> 10. 8. &amp; 13. 10. <hi>for
the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord
Ieſus, 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 5. What man is there, that prefers heaven before hell, or
the ſafety of his ſoul before bodily eaſe and credit, that will turn his
back upon theſe neceſſary, though ſharp Medicines? How then can you
profeſs Chriſt, and yet refuſe to ſubmit to the righteous Scepter of his
Kingdom?</p>
               <p>3. Beware, leſt you alſo being led away with the Error of the wicked,
fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs; be not children toſſed to and fro with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
winde of Doctrine, by the ſlight of men, and cunning craftineſs,
whereby they lie in wait to deceive. 'Tis the glory of a Chriſtian to
be ſteady and unmoveable, holding faſt the faith once delivered to the
Saints. We would not be over-tedious, and therefore ſhall ſet before
you but ſome of thoſe many Conſiderations which might here be urged.</p>
               <p>1. God doth permit theſe ſwarms of Errors for the tryal of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the diſcovery of Hypocrites and rotten Profeſſors. <hi>Paul</hi> (in
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 19.) tells us, <hi>Hereſies muſt be,</hi> (they are not only poſſible but
neceſſary) <hi>that they which are approved might-be made manifeſt; and that
they that went out from us might be made manifeſt that they were not all of us,</hi>
1 Joh. 2. 19.</p>
               <p>2. Do you not ſee it frequently, that they who make ſhipwrack of faith,
make alſo ſhipwrack of a good conſcience? Do not erroneous principles
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:117429:30"/>
in wicked and licencious practices? It is too viſible in the carriage of
many already, and of others, you may eaſily gueſs what will follow,
when they are more hardened in error. And dare you take that for truth
which hath a natural tendencie to looſeneſs and liberty? How far theſe
principles of following the Light within, and of abſolute perfection,
(which will at laſt bring in either a denyal of Fornication and Lying,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be ſins, or to be theirs that act them) and ſeveral others are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
improveable this way, we need not tell you.</p>
               <p>3. Have you not obſerved how fickle and uncertain error is? when once
men are turned off from the truth, they readily fall into a diſlike of the
errors, which at firſt they doted on, (after they are ſtale) for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of a new Error, when grown into faſhion; and ſo from one
Error to another, till they arrive at <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> if God in pitty ſtop them
not; like a ſtone, when once ſet a going down the hill, it rowles ſtill till it
come to the bottom.</p>
               <p>4. Conſider the dreadful threatning of the Lord againſt thoſe that
received the truth, but not in the love of it: Read and ſtudy wel that text
of 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 11. For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions,
that they ſhould believe a lye, that they all might be damned who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs. And forget
not the danger of Apoſtacie: ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. &amp; 10. 26. 'Tis a ſad ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
(though we ſhould take the moſt favourable conſtruction that is
given of it) to ſay, There remains no more ſacrifice for ſins, and that
'tis impoſſible to renew them again by repentance.</p>
               <p>5. The hand of God is ſo viſibly againſt them, that they that will

of late in <hi>New-England,</hi> ought not to be ſlightly paſſed over. And how
heavy ſpiritual Judgements are upon Apoſtates, ſeveral of our own
Counties are ſad and ſufficient Examples: when God ſuffers Error to
draw men beyond the bounds of Reaſon, Modeſty and natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
when that which they ſeemed to have is taken away; their gifts
withered, and their former ſeeming religious obſervation of duty quite
dryed up by the roots: ſurely his minde is, that we ſhould take warning
by their dreadful fall.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>quakers,</hi> one would think their actions and principles would
make a man that had any of common reaſon left, to abominate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
them: Sure we are, the prevalency of that madneſs, is not from any
ſtrength of rational, or ſcriptural ſatisfaction, (we have ſeen many
ſtrongly and paſſionately poſſeſſed with that, who yet neither underſtood
it, nor could give a reaſon for it) but from an <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>the efficacie and ſtrength of deluſion,</hi> through divine judgement upon them:

with them. What groſs principles do they maintain? as of ſetting up
their Conceits and Experiences, as being of equal authority with the
Scriptures; and that the Scripture bindes not them, if not let on their
hearts by a preſent impulſe: Their denying interpretations of Scr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
under the name of Meanings and Additions: Their following the
Light within: Their pleading for a neceſſity of being ſaved, as <hi>Adam</hi>
ſhould have been, by an abſolute perfection: Their grievous conceits
concerning Chriſt, to the ſubverting of the Doctrine or his Nature, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and ſatisfaction: Their neglect and denial of the obſervation of
the Lords Day and Ordinances, as Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
We might tell you of their ridiculous interpretations of Scripture,
(interpretation of Scripture is a fault in other men, but none in them)
of their placing their religion in trivial things, as <hi>Thou-ing,</hi> and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the har, when yet the weightier matters of communion with
God, are neglected. As alſo we might reckon up their ſelf-contradictions,
their ignorant and ſottiſh conceits about the unlawfulneſs of uſing
words which the Scripture uſeth not, (as <hi>Trinity, Sacrament, &amp;c.</hi>) or
habits which the Scripture ſpeaks not of, when yet they cannot excuſe
themſelves from what they condemn in others; neither is it to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that when they have ſtuffed a paper as full of lying and non-ſenſe
as it can hold, (and we have many of them in our hands) they bluſh
not to father all upon the ſpirit of God. Conſider we pray you the caſe
of thoſe that have been entangled, and yet are pluck'd out as a brand
out of the fire. Conſider the relation of <hi>Iohn Gilping</hi> well, (you ſee what
pittiful ſhifts they are put to, when they would ſeem to ſay ſomething in
anſwer to it) Obſerve what a favourable aſpect all their opinions have
to Popery, and how viſibly thoſe poor creatures are acted by the Jeſuits,
as by relation of the man of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and others, it appears. What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
in grace, and true religious walking can you obſerve in them ſince
their Apoſtafie? Where is now their conſtant Family and private pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
Where is that conſcientious fear (which ſometime they ſeemed to
have) of ſpeaking evill of what they know not? Laſtly, Doth not all
that they ſay againſt us (under the reviling terms of <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, or
Prieſts of the world) ſtrike alſo againſt all thoſe Martyrs, which in
Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, and before, have laid down their lives for the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Jeſus? Oh! then beware, if you love your own ſouls; what is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:117429:31"/>
there here that can be called Chriſtian? We could tell you of ſome
Chriſtians in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> that have thought it their duty to humble
themſelves ſolemnly before God for their inclinations this way (when
the error firſt appeared, and was not then well known) and alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
thanks to God for preſerving them from the infection; and the
reaſons of their diſlike of the <hi>quakers</hi> (given in writing) were moſt of
theſe that we have hinted to you. 'Tis good to learn the danger of the
ſnare from other mens dear-bought experience. <hi>Mark therefore them
which cauſe diviſions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which yee have
learned, and avoid them: For they that are ſuch ſerve not the Lord Ieſus,
but their own belly,</hi> Rom. 16. 17. We ſhall conclude this with that of
1 <hi>Tim. 6. 3, 4, 5. If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholeſome
words, even the words of our Lord</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and to the doctrine which is
according to godlineſs, he is proud, knowing nothing, &amp;c. From ſuch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
thy ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Laſtly, walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called,
and let your converſation be ſuch as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt; ye
cannot be happy without holineſs; except you be redeemed from your
vain converſation, and have crucified the old man with his deeds, the
fleſh with the luſts thereof, and be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind,
ye ſhal periſh, and ſhal not enter into his reſt.</p>
               <p>Ye are ſure that you can never be too holy, or that you can never do
too much for God. Gird up therefore the Ioyns of your minde, and
run the race that is ſet before you: Be not affraid of being too preciſe,
or of being reviled and hated for a Puritane: Take courage; you are
unworthy of ſuch a Prince of Righteouſneſs, if ye dare not own him; how
wil you deny your ſelves, &amp; take up his Croſs, and follow him (&amp; upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
terms you cannot be his diſciples) if a word or a frown of man do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
you? Be not aſhamed of <hi>Chriſt</hi> &amp; his ways, even in their ſtrictneſs,
leſt he be aſhamed of you in his <hi>kingdom, Mar.</hi> 8. 38 therfore walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly;
avoid the appearances &amp; occaſions of evil. Sanctifie the Sabbath
conſcientiouſly: Set up prayer and inſtruction in your Families: Deal
uprightly with all men. Set a watch over your lips. Take heed of giving
offences. Let your zeal and moderation be known to all. Forget not to
do good, and to diſtribute. Do not ſatisfie your ſelves with a form of
godlineſs, but labour after the power of it. Endeavour to grow in grace,
and knowledge. Edifie one another; Warn the unruly; Comfort the
feeble-minded; Support the weak; Conſider one another, to provoke
unto love and good works. Keep up Chriſtian communion and ſociety:
Let thoſe that fear the Lord ſpeak often one to another, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. but
yet manage it wiſely; let other mens miſcarriages in this kinde be a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:117429:31"/>
warning to you. Keep within your ſphere; Take heed of pride, and
contempt of the weaker ſort. Loſe not the end of Chriſtian Society,
by doating about queſtions and ſtrifes of words, whereof cometh <hi>Envy,
Strife, Railing, Evill Surmiſes, Perverſe Disputings of men of corrupt
mindes, and deſtitute of the truth, 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 4, 5. Let your diſcourſes be
ſober, tending to the promoting of grace, duty and aſſurance. Theſe
Counties of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>VVeſtmerland</hi> have been hitherto as a
Proverb and a by-word in reſpect of ignorance and prophaneneſs;
Men were ready to ſay of them as the Jews of <hi>Nazareth, Can any good
thing come out of them?</hi> Let us now labour to become a bleſſing and a
praiſe, that people may ſay concerning us, <hi>Behold in the VVilderneſs
waters have broken out, and ſtreams in the Deſart; the parched ground is
become a pole, and the thirſty land ſprings of water; it doth rejoyce
and bloſſome as the roſe. Therefore beloved Brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt, unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
alwayes abounding in the work of the Lord; for as much as you
know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi>
