            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PRETENCE of the preſent <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Companies Property Stated and Conſidered as well in Reſpect to the Sole Trade Excluſive to all others, as to their Iſlands, Forts, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Pretence of their Property to the <hi>Sole Trade Excluſive to all others</hi> is grounded on the <hi>Kings Charter,</hi> which Grants them the Trade in that manner, and Provides that they ſhall not be diſſolved without 3 years notice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Proviſo</hi> for 3 years is as follows.</p>
            <p>PROVIDED <hi>alſo that if it ſhall hereafter appear to Us Our Heirs or Succeſſors, That this Grant or the continuance thereof in the whole or any part thereof ſhall</hi> Not be Profitable <hi>to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, Our Heirs or Succeſſors, or to this Our Realm, That then and from thenceforth upon and after Three Years warning to be given to the ſaid Company by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, Our Heirs or Succeſſors under Our or their Privy Seal or Sign Manual, this preſent Grant ſhall Ceaſe, be Void, and Determin, to all Intents, Conſtructions and Purpoſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Proviſo the <hi>Judges</hi> have given this following Opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are of Opinion, That by this Clauſe the</hi> Eaſt India <hi>Company cannot be Determined till after 3 years warning given them under the Privy Seal or Sign Manual, and that they will continue a Company during the ſaid 3 years, and may Trade and Act in the mean time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will not be amiſs to make ſome Obſervations on this <hi>Opinion of the Judges.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The <hi>Judges</hi> Opinion is given ſtrictly upon the foregoing Clauſe of the Charter, with reſpect only to what the <hi>King Himſelf</hi> might do, which does no ways limit the Parliament; For the <hi>Parliament</hi> made Void a <hi>Charter</hi> granted to the <hi>Canary</hi> Company in <hi>Anno</hi> 1667. And <hi>Our Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> in all Reigns have Vacated their Patents ſo ſoon as they have been found <hi>Prejudicial to the Publick Good.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The <hi>Judges</hi> do not ſay, That though the Company continue a Company, and may Trade and Act, That others Their Majeſties Subjects may not likewiſe lawfully Trade into and from the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> as well as the ſaid Company, notwithſtanding their <hi>Charter.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. They do not ſay in what manner the Company may Trade notwithſtanding ſuch Notice, whether as amply as ever they did before, or if it may not be <hi>Limited</hi> only to the bringing home their Effects.</item>
               <item>4. They do not ſay the <hi>King</hi> could not give a concurrent Grant or Charter before the expiration of the ſaid Three Years, and indeed it ſeems ſtrange to ſay, <hi>That the King cannot give his Subjects leave to do that, which they can Lawfully do without his Leave.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. They do not ſay the Company have not Forfeited their Charter, and that by a <hi>Scire Facias</hi> the <hi>King</hi> could not void it without any Notice given them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And having thus conſidered the <hi>Judges Opinion</hi> on the <hi>Proviſoe,</hi> I ſhall now proceed to conſider the Companies pretence of <hi>Property</hi> to the Sole Trade excluſive to all others.</p>
            <p>There can be no <hi>Property</hi> without a <hi>Legal Right,</hi> and therefore if the Company have not a <hi>Legal Right</hi> they can have no <hi>Property,</hi> and that they have no <hi>Legal Right</hi> may appear by theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Property</hi> is grounded on the <hi>Common or Statute Law of this Land,</hi> and the Companies pretence of <hi>Property</hi> to the Sole Trade being grounded on the Kings Charter only, its plain they can have no other <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Property</hi> than what the King can lawfully grant them.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Trade</hi> being the <hi>Right</hi> of every Subject of this Realm, they cannot be excluded from it by <hi>Grant</hi> from the <hi>King</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and this appears not only from the <hi>Petition</hi> which the <hi>Company</hi> themſelves preferred the laſt Seſſion to the <hi>Honourable Houſe of Commons,</hi> Praying to have an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> paſſed to confirm the ſaid Trade to them excluſive to all others.</p>
            <p>But the ſame is likewiſe evident by the ſeveral <hi>Judgments</hi> at Law given, ſince the late Happy Revolution, againſt the <hi>Eaſt India Company</hi> and the <hi>Affrican Company,</hi> notwithſtanding their <hi>Charters,</hi> and may likewiſe appear by the <hi>Meſſage</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> himſelf lately ſent the <hi>Houſe</hi> by an Honourable Member of His <hi>Privy Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides that the Company have no <hi>Property</hi> in that Trade excluſive to others, There would ariſe many inconveniences by their enjoying it Three years after warning (although they had a Property thereunto) and the whole <hi>Trade</hi> would be in danger to be loſt to this <hi>Nation,</hi> of which <hi>His Majeſty</hi> having been pleaſed to take Notice in His <hi>Meſſage to the Houſe</hi> on this occaſion as the <hi>reaſon</hi> why he did not give them <hi>Notice,</hi> it will be therefore unneceſſary to mention the particulars.</p>
            <p>But the Company muſt nevertheleſs remain a <hi>Company and Body Politick</hi> three years for ſome purpoſes; otherwiſe many miſchievous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences would enſue, the prevention of which muſt have been what was intended by the <hi>Proviſo</hi> in their Charter for 3 years warning.</p>
            <p>For if the Company ſhould ceaſe and determine immediately there could be no Proprietor to their Eſtate, there would be no body to make Satisfaction for what is due from them to others, nor to demand or receive of thoſe who are Debtors and accountable to them, ſo that they could neither pay what they Owe, nor receive what is due to them, nor divide their remains (if any there were) to the <hi>Adventurers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Property</hi> they claim in their <hi>Iſlands, Forts,</hi> &amp;c. in the ſame manner as any man in <hi>England</hi> has to his Mannors and Lands, <hi>it is Evident</hi> by the Clauſe in their Charter before recited, that their Grant may determin and Ceaſe at 3 years warning given under the <hi>Privy Seal</hi> or <hi>Sign Manual,</hi> and when that is determined, ſo is their Pretence of <hi>Property,</hi> which therefore differs very much from the right a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man has to his Mannors and Lands, the one being founded on a <hi>Legal Right,</hi> the other depending only on the <hi>Kings Will and Pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though they have no <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Property</hi> to the <hi>Sole Trade,</hi> it is to be acknowledged they have a <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> to their <hi>Forts, Caſtles, &amp;c.</hi> although not in the ſame manner as they pretend; the Iſlands of <hi>Bombay</hi> and St. <hi>Hellena,</hi> being Annexed to the Crown, and holden of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>East Greenwich</hi> at a certain Quit Rent, cannot therefore be Sold to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> or Alienated from Their Majeſties Subjection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Their Iſlands, Forts,</hi> &amp;c. are ſuch as have either been granted to them and their Succeſſors as a <hi>Company</hi> by the <hi>Crown,</hi> or have been Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by them from the <hi>Former East India Company;</hi> ſo that their property to them has a <hi>Publick</hi> regard to the <hi>Trade</hi> which is <hi>National,</hi> and their <hi>Succeſſors</hi> are thoſe which ſhall ſucceed them in that <hi>Trade as a Company;</hi> and it is therefore altogether different from the <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> which a Private Man has to his <hi>particular Eſtate. Nevertheleſs</hi> it's but juſt a reaſonable Allowance ſhould be made to the Company for them; in the Valuing of which it is to be conſidered what the Company paid either to the Crown, or the former <hi>Company</hi> for them, and the <hi>Uſe and Advantage</hi> they may be to the carrying on the <hi>Trade,</hi> the Value of which may be adjuſted by Perſons indifferently Choſen on both ſides, as has been formerly practiſed by ſeveral Succeſſive <hi>Companies;</hi> and if any other Forts, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> have been acquired by the Preſent Company, the Value of them may likewiſe be adjuſted in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the Whole Matter,</hi> ſeeing that the <hi>Eaſt India Trade</hi> is ſo Neceſſary and Advantageous, and Beſt to be managed by a <hi>National Joint Stock,</hi> and that the Preſent Company have no <hi>Right</hi> thereunto <hi>Excluſive to others,</hi> And that the ſaid <hi>Trade</hi> is already ſo <hi>much impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and in ſuch danger to be loſt to <hi>this Kingdom,</hi> as His Majeſty is pleaſed to intimate in His <hi>Meſſage;</hi> and was fully <hi>proved</hi> before the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> in the laſt <hi>Seſſion,</hi> It cannot therefore be doubted but the <hi>Honourable Houſe</hi> will direct a <hi>Bill</hi> to be brought in in order to paſs into an <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> to Eſtabliſh a <hi>New East India Company,</hi> in which no one may be Excluded from his <hi>Right</hi> to that <hi>Trade,</hi> who deſires to be Concerned therein, which its Humbly Conceived is the only <hi>Foundation</hi> on which this <hi>Trade</hi> can be <hi>Eſtabliſhed,</hi> ſo as to be preſerved and advanced to the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> of this <hi>Nation,</hi> as His <hi>Majeſty</hi> has recommended to them in his ſaid <hi>Meſſage.</hi>
