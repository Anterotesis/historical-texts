            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J. Pemberton.</speaker>
                  <p>GEntlemen of the Jury, we are all met here in one of the moſt Solemn Aſſemblies of this Nation; it is upon the Execution of Juſtice upon ſuch as ſhall be found Offenders, and Guilty of the Breach of the King's Laws.</p>
                  <p>This Commiſſion by which we ſit, and you are Summoned, doth in its nature extend to all Offences whatſoever againſt the Laws of the Land, Treaſons, Miſpriſions of Treaſons, Felonies, and all other Crimes and Offences againſt the King and his Government, ſuch as are vulgarly called <hi>Pleas of the Crown;</hi> they all fall under our Cognizance, and your Enquiry in a general manner. But I muſt tell you, there is a particular occaſion for this Commiſſion at this time. His Majeſty having Information of ſome Evil, Trayterous Deſigns againſt his Perſon and Government, has thought fit to Direct a due Examination of them, and that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be brought to Condign puniſhment who ſhall be found Guilty thereof. You muſt not therefore expect any general and formal Charge from me; Truly I came hither this Morning, with an apprehenſion, that you had had your directions given you before by the Recorder, for it is our uſual way not to come until the Juries are Sworn in this place, and their Directions given them; but ſince I find it otherwiſe, I take it to be my Duty to ſay ſomething to you, but ſhall not go about now to make any ſuch formal Charge, as in Commiſſions of this nature is wont to be done, nor to give an account of all Offences that fall under your Enquiry of a Grand Inqueſt, Impannelled by vertue of ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion at large: Nor muſt you expect I ſhould acquaint you with all the Crimes that you may enquire of as ſuch an Inqueſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall content my ſelf ſo far, as on the ſudden I can recollect my thoughts, to acquaint you with the Nature of thoſe Bills; with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry whereof, you ſhall at preſent, upon this occaſion, be troubled, and your Duty concerning that Enquiry. I hinted to you at firſt, that they are matters of High-Treaſon, which is a Crime of the greateſt and higheſt nature of any Crime that can be committed againſt Man; other Crimes, as Felonies, Riots, Treſpaſſes, and Things of that nature, they may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion diſorders and troubles in a State or a Kingdom. But, I muſt tell you, Treaſon ſtrikes at the root and life of all; it tends to deſtroy the very Government, both King and Subjects, and the Lives, Intereſt and Liberties of all, and therefore has always been look'd upon as a Crime of the moſt notorious nature that can be whatſoever, and accordingly Puniſhments have been appointed for it of the higheſt and ſevereſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. There was at Common Law great variety of Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Treaſon, and there were many Diſputes about it what ſhould be Treaſon, and what not; and therefore it was thought fit, by the Wiſdom of our Anceſtors, to have a Law to Declare Treaſon: and by the Statute of the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> there was a plain Declaration made of what was Treaſon, and what not: By that Law, <hi>for any one to Compaſs, Imagine, or Intend the Death of the King,</hi> (for I will give you no more of that Statute, nor concerning the ſenſe thereof, than may be for your purpoſe now); I ſay, by that Law, <hi>to Compaſs, Imagine, or Intend the Death of the King, and to declare it by Overt-Act, or to Levy War againſt the King</hi> were declared (amongſt other things in that Statute men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) <hi>to be High-Treaſon:</hi> And this hath obtained for Law among us ever ſince; and by that ſtanding Law, nothing is to be accounted Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but what is therein particularly declared ſo; but upon many
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54424:3"/>
emergent occaſions there hath been ſeveral other Laws, as the caſe hath required now and then, for to declare and bring other particular Crimes within the compaſs of Treaſons: So there was a Law made in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, for Enacting ſeveral Crimes to be Treaſons, during her Life, which was made upon the occaſion of the Inveterate Malice of the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> againſt her and her Government; and ſo there hath been in other Kings Reigns upon other occaſions.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the reſt, it was thought fit by the Parliament aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled here, in the Thirteenth year of this preſent King, to make a particular Law for the Enacting and Declaring ſeveral Crimes to be Treaſons, during this Kings Life; they had great grounds, and too much occaſion for it, and ſo they expreſs it in the Preamble of that Law. The wounds which the then late Treaſons had made, that had ſo far obtained in this Kingdom, were then ſtill bleeding, ripe, and ſcarcely cloſed; many Trayterous Poſitions, and many Seditious Principles were ſpread, and had obtained and gained footing among the People of this Kingdom; and the Parliament had reaſon to believe, that where they had been ſo maliciouſly bent againſt the King and his Family, and had taken off his Father, and maintained ſo long and dangerous a War againſt him, almoſt to the utter Deſtruction and Extirpation of him, and all his good Subjects, and of his, and all our Intereſts, Properties, and Liberties, and had almoſt deſtroy'd a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Kingdom: Here they had reaſon, I ſay, to be careful, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the like miſchiefs for the future; therefore, Gentlemen, they did think fit to make a new Law for this purpoſe: And whereas the Law before was, That it ſhould be Treaſon to Compaſs, Imagine, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Death of the King, ſo as it were declared by Overt-Act; now they thought it would be dangerous to ſtay till an Overt-Act ſhould declare the intention; for when they had ſeen ſuch malicious and evil Deſigns againſt the King and Supreme Authority; and that they had prevailed ſo far, as to Murder one King, and Baniſh another; and had gone a great way in the deſtruction of the Government of this Kingdom, abſolutely to root it quite out: They had reaſon then, as much as they could, to prevent the Deſigns before they ſhould grow full ripe, and vent themſelves in Overt-Acts; therefore it was Enacted by that Statute, made in the <hi>13th</hi> year of this Kings Reign, <q>That if any one ſhould Compaſs, Imagine, or Intend the Death of the King, or his Deſtruction, or any bodily harm, that might tend to his Death or Deſtruction, or any Maiming or Wounding his Perſon, any Reſtraint of his Liberty, or any Impriſonment of him; or if any ſhould deſign or intend to Levy any War againſt him, either within the Kingdom, or without; or ſhould deſign, intend, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or procure any Foreign Prince to Invade theſe his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, or any other of the Kings Dominions, and ſhould ſignifie or declare this by any Writing, or by any Preaching or Printing, or by any adviſed, malicious ſpeaking, or words, this ſhall be High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Treaſon.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this hath altered the former Law greatly, eſpecially in two Caſes: Firſt as to Levying of War; the Intention was not Treaſon before, unleſs it had taken effect, and War had been actually Levied: And then as to the Deſigning and Compaſſing the Kings Death, that was not Treaſon, unleſs it was declared by an Overt-Act: And as to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54424:4"/>
the Impriſoning, or Reſtraining of the Liberty of the King, they of themſelves alone were not High-Treaſon; but now by this Law theſe are made Treaſon, by this Law, during his Majeſties Life: And the very deſigning of them, whether they take effect, or not take effect, though it be prevented (before any Overt Act,) by the timely Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the King and his Officers, though it ſhould be timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, that there is no hurt done; yet the very deſign, if it be but utter'd and ſpoken, and any ways ſignified by any diſcourſe; this (Gentlemen) is made Treaſon, by this Act; and this hath wrought very great alteration in the caſe of Treaſon now; formerly it was ſaid, and ſaid truly enough, that Words alone would not make Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but ſince this Act, Gentlemen, Words, if they import any mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deſign againſt the Kings Life and Government; any Trayterous intention in the party; ſuch words are Treaſon now within this Act: And this Act was made with great Prudence, and with great Care to take off that undue Liberty that men had taken to themſelves; in thoſe times of Licentiouſneſs, people had taken to themſelves an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and undue liberty to vent all their Seditious and Malicious minds one to another, without any reſtraint at all: Therefore now, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you muſt conſider, that Words, if they ſignifie or purport any Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> intention or deſign in the party, either againſt the King or his Government; either to reſtrain his Liberty, or Impriſon him, or to do him any bodily hurt, or any Crime of that nature; this is Treaſon within this Act of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Look ye, Gentlemen, now as to the Indictments that ſhall be brought before you, you are to conſider theſe things: 1. Whether the Matter contained in them, and which you ſhall have in Evidence, be Matter of Treaſon within the former, or this Act of Parliament? And here, if you doubt of it, then you muſt adviſe with us that are Commiſſionated by his Majeſty to Hear and Determine theſe Crimes; and in Matters of Law we ſhall direct you: And you are to enquire if there be two Witneſſes that ſhall teſtifie the Matters in Evidence to you, for without two Witneſſes no man is to be Impeached within theſe Laws; but if there be two Witneſſes that ſhall teſtifie to you Matters to make good the Indictments, then you have ground to find the Indictments. But I muſt tell you as to this caſe of two Witneſſes, it is not neceſſary that they ſhould be; Two Witneſſes to the ſame words, or to words ſpoken at one time, or in the ſame place; that is not neceſſary: If one be a Witneſs to words that Import any Trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſign and intention, ſpoken at one time, and in one place; and another teſtifie other Seditious and Trayterous Words, ſpoken at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, and in another place; theſe two are two good Witneſſes within this Statute, and ſo it hath been ſolemnly reſolved by all the Judges of <hi>England</hi> upon a ſolemn occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Look ye, Gentlemen, I muſt tell you, That that which is referr'd to you, is to conſider, whether upon what Evidence you ſhall have given unto you, there be any reaſon or ground for the King to call theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to an account; if there be probable ground, it is as much as you are to enquire into: You are not to Judge the perſons, but for the Honour of the King, and the Decency of the Matter; it is not thought fit by the Law, that perſons ſhould be Accuſed and Indicted, where there is no colour nor ground for it; where there is no kind of ſuſpition
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54424:4"/>
of a Crime, nor reaſon to believe, that the thing can be proved, it is not for the King's Honour to call Men to an Account in ſuch caſes: Therefore you are to enquire, whether that that you hear be any cauſe or reaſon for the King to put the Party to anſwer it. You do not Condemn, nor is there ſuch a ſtrict Enquiry to be made by you, as by others, that are ſworn to try a Fact, or Iſſue: A probable cauſe, or ſome ground, that the King hath to call theſe perſons to anſwer for it, is enough, Gentlemen, for you to find a Bill, 'tis as much as is by Law required. Gentlemen, you muſt conſider this, That as it is a Crime for to condemn Innocent perſons, ſo it is a Crime as great to acquit the Guilty, and that God that requires one of them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires both; ſo that you muſt be as ſtrict in the one, as you would be in the other. And let me tell you, If any of you ſhall be Refractory, and will not find any Bill, where there is a probable ground for an Accuſation, you do therein undertake to intercept Juſtice, and you thereby make your ſelves Criminals, and Guilty, and the fault will lye at your Door. You muſt conſider, Gentlemen, you are under a double Obligation here to do Right; you are under the Obligation of <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> as we are all Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one great Body, of which the King is Head; and you are engag'd, as <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> to conſider, That Crimes of this Nature ought not to go unpuniſh'd: Then you have an Oath of God upon you, you are here ſworn to do according to what the Evidence is. Now therefore, if you have two Witneſſes of Words that may import a Treaſonable Deſign or Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any of thoſe Parties, againſt whom you ſhall have Indictments offer'd to you, you are bound both by the Law of Nature, as you are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Body; and by the Law of God, as you have taken an Oath upon you, for to find thoſe Bills.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen, Compaſſion or Pity is not your Province, nor ours in this caſe; there is no room for that in Enquiries of this nature, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to an higher and ſuperiour Power, from which ours is deriv'd: Therefore, Gentlemen, I muſt require you to conſider ſuch Evidence as ſhall be given you, and to be impartial according to what you ſhall hear from the Witneſſes, if you have ground, upon what Evidence you ſhall have given to you, to believe, that there is any reaſon or cauſe for the King to call the perſons named in ſuch Indictments, as ſhall be tender'd to you, to anſwer for what is objected againſt them therein, you are to find thoſe Bills, that is all that I ſhall ſay to you, only pray God to direct you in your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, that Juſtice may take place.</p>

                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, You hear it is deſired by the King's Council, (and that we cannot deny) that the Evidence may be publickly given, that it may not be hereafter in the Mouths of any ill-minded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons abroad, to ſcatter any Miſtakes or Untruths up and down, or to ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King's Evidence, or to ſay any thing concerning them that is not true: Therefore we cannot deny this motion of the King's Council, but deſire that you will take your places, and hear the Evidence that ſhall be given you.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>[The Jury then deſired a Copy of their Oath, which the Court granted, and then they withdrew. After ſome little time they returned, and then the Clerk called them by their Names.]</p>

                  <p>My <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice,</hi> it is the opinion of the Jury, that they ought to Examine the Witneſſes in private, and it hath been the conſtant practice of our Anceſtors and Predeceſtors to do it, and they inſiſt upon it as our Right to Examine in private, becauſe they are bound to keep the King's Secrets, which they cannot do if it be done in Court.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>Look ye Gentlemen of the Jury, it may very probably be, that ſome late uſage has brought you into this Error, That it is your Right; but it is not your Right in truth: For I will tell you, I take the reaſon of that uſe for Grand Juries to Examine the Witneſſes privately and out of Court, to comply with the Conveniencies of the Court, for generally upon ſuch Commiſſions as theſe are, the buſineſs is much; and at <hi>Gaol-Deliveries</hi> there are a great many perſons to be Indicted and Tried, and much other Work beſides, of other natures, to be done: And if at ſuch times we ſhould examine all Buſineſſes publickly in the Court, it would make the buſineſs of theſe Commiſſions of a wonderful great length and cumbrance. Therefore the Judges, for the conveniency of the matter, have allow'd, That Witneſſes ſhould go to the Jury, and they to Examine them; not that there is any matter of Right in it, for without queſtion Originally all Evidences were given in Court; the Jury are Officers and Miniſters of the Court by which they enquire, and Evidence ſure was all given in Court formerly; and the Witneſſes ſtill are always ſworn in Court, and never otherwiſe. And, Gentlemen, I muſt tell you, 'Tis for your Advantage, as well as for the King's, that it may be ſure, that you comply with your Evidence, that you do nothing clandeſtinely; therefore 'tis for your advantage that this is done, and the King likewiſe deſires it. Now I muſt tell you, That if the King require it of us, and it is a thing that is in its Nature indifferent, we ought to comply with the King's deſire, to have it examin'd in Court; you ſhall have all the liberty that you can have in private; what Queſtion ſoever you will have ask'd, your ſelves ſhall ask it, if you pleaſe, and we will not cramp you in Time, nor any thing of that Nature. Therefore, Gentlemen, there can be no kind of reaſon why this Evidence ſhould not be given in Court. What you ſay concerning your keeping your Councels, that is quite of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is, your Debates, and thoſe things, there you ſhall be in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate for to conſider of what you hear publickly. But certainly it is the beſt way, both for the King, and for you, that there ſhould, in a caſe of this nature, be an open and plain Examination of the Witneſſes, that all the World may ſee what they ſay.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, if your Lordſhip pleaſes, I muſt beg your Lordſhip's pardon; if I miſtake in any thing, it is contrary to the ſence of what the Jury apprehend. Firſt, They apprehend that the very words of the Oath doth bind them, it ſays, <hi>That they ſhall keep the Council's, and their own Secrets:</hi> Now, my Lord, there can be no Secret in publick; the very intimation of that doth imply, that the Examination ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; beſides, my Lord, I beg your Lordſhip's pardon if we miſtake, we do not underſtand any thing of Law.</p>

                  <p>Your Lordſhip is pleaſed to ſay, That it hath been the common uſage and practice; ſometimes, my Lord, we have heard, that that hath been the Law of <hi>England,</hi> that hath been the Cuſtom of <hi>England:</hi> If it be the ancient uſage and cuſtom of <hi>England,</hi> that hath never been alter'd from time to time, and hath continued ſo, we deſire your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Opinion upon that, as we would not do any thing that may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54424:5"/>
to the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo we would not do the leaſt that ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Liberties of the People; if it be the ancient Cuſtom of the Kingdom to Examine in private, then there is ſomething may be very prejudicial to the King in this publick Examination; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Examining Witneſſes in private, there come to be diſcover'd ſome perſons Guilty of Treaſon, and Miſpriſion of Treaſon, that were not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> known, nor. thought on before. Then the Jury ſends down to the Court, and gives them intimation, and theſe men are preſently ſecur'd; whereas, my Lord, in caſe they be Examined in open Court publickly, then preſently there is intimation given, and theſe men are gone away. Another thing that may be prejudicial to the King, is, that all the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences here will be foreknown before they come to the main Tryal upon iſſue by the Petty-Jury; then if there be not a very great deal of care, theſe Witneſſes may be confronted by raiſing up Witneſſes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice them, as in ſome caſes it has been: Then beſides, the Jury do apprehend that in private, they are more free to Examine things in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular for the ſatisfying their own Conſciences, and that without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or affection; and we hope we ſhall do our duty.</p>

                  <p>Look ye, Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> it is reaſonable that we ſhould give you our advice in this caſe: I muſt tell you, if you had conſider'd of what I had ſaid before, I thought I had obviated theſe Objections: Firſt as to that that you do ſay, that you are bound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Conceal your Councels, and the Kings ſecrets, that is very true; as to your Councels, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your Debates, you are bound to conceal them: As to the Kings ſecrets, ſo long as he will have them kept ſecret, you are bound to keep them ſo too, but it doth not deprive the King of the benefit of having it publick, if he have a deſire for it; you don't break your Oath, if the King will make it publick; you don't make it publick, 'tis the King does it. Then as to that that you do ſay, that you apprehend the common uſage of the Kingdom to be a Law; that is true, Mr. <hi>Papillon,</hi> in ſome ſence; a conſtant and uninterrupted uſage goes for a Law among us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I thought I had told you before, that both of ancient and later times there have been Examinations of the Witneſſes in Court in Caſes of this nature; and we are not without preſidents of it every Year, every Term, continually from time to time, Evidence is heard in Court by the Grand-Jury; it is as uſual a thing with us, as any thing, if it be deſired, nothing more frequent, or more common: I never heard it deny'd, or ſtood upon by any Grand-Jury in my life, till of late here; you may be inſtructed with a thouſand preſidents, for I am ſure it is a common and ordinary caſe upon ſuch occaſions, if deſired to hear the Evidence in Court.</p>
                  <p>Look ye, Gentlemen, as to that care that you have of the Kings affairs, the King has reaſon to take it well that you are ſo careful for them; and that you are ſo mindful of his concerns, he hath a great deal of reaſon to think well of you for it: And, Gentlemen, conſider this, that His Majeſties Council have certainly conſidered of this Evidence, before they brought this to a publick Enquiry; or elſe it would be a hard thing if they ſhould come raw, and not know what the Witneſſes can ſay; for though you are the Jury to hear the Witneſſes, yet you muſt conſider, that the Kings Council have Examined whether he hath cauſe to accuſe theſe perſons, or not; and, Gentlemen, they underſtand very well, that it will be no prejudice to the King to have the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54424:6"/>
heard openly in Court, or elſe the King would ne're de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it.</p>

I muſt tell you from my own experience; where the King will, he ought to have it kept ſecret: I have not known it done publi<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> hath been deſir'd by thoſe which Proſecute for the King, that Evidence hath been given openly; and I never knew it deny'd: If any of my Brothers think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I deſire they would ſpeak; but, I tell you, as to my experience, this is the caſe.</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, This is an Indictment againſt the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> I ſhall not trouble you to open the Indictment, becauſe the Evidence will be ſomewhat long, I ſhall only tell you which way we ſhall go—</p>

                  <p>I do not know whether you deſire the Witneſſes ſhould be Examin'd apart, do you deſire that, Gentlemen?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
                  <p>If you do deſire it, Gentlemen, they ſhall, for Mr. <hi>Sheriff</hi> hath nothing to do with it; but if you do deſire it, you ſhall have the Witneſſes call'd one at a time, and all the reſt ſhall be put out of the Court.</p>

                  <p>We did deny it to Mr. <hi>Sheriff,</hi> becauſe we are to keep Men within their Duty. Here it is not his Duty to meddle with any thing of this nature.</p>

                           <p>And it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being notorious that they have been highly encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the Countenance and Protection given and procured for them by <hi>J.

                           <p>It appearing alſo to us, That by his Influence Mercenary Forces have been levied and kept on foot for his ſecret De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns contrary to our Laws; the Officers thereof having been named and appointed by him, to the apparent hazard of his Majeſties Perſon, our Religion and Government, if the danger had not been timely foreſeen by ſeveral Parliaments, and part of thoſe Forces with great difficulty, cauſed by them to be disbanded at the Kingdoms great Expence: And it being evident, that notwithſtanding all the continual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the Parliament to deliver his Majeſty from the Councils, and out of the Power of the ſaid <hi>D.</hi> yet his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the Miniſtry of State and others have been ſo preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that Parliaments have been unreaſonably Prorogued and Diſſolved when they have been in hot purſuit of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Conſpiracies, and ill Miniſters of State their Aſſiſtants.</p>

                           <p>And as we conſidering with heavy Hearts how greatly the Strength, Reputation and Treaſure of the Kingdom both at Sea and Land is Waſted and Conſumed, and loſt by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate expenſive management of theſe wicked deſtructive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; and finding the ſame Councils after exemplary Juſtice upon ſome of the Conſpirators, to be ſtill purſued with the utmoſt deviliſh Malice, and deſire of Revenge; whereby his Majeſty is in continual hazard of being Murdered to make way for the ſaid <hi>D.</hi>'s Advancement to the Crown, and the whole Kingdom in ſuch caſe is deſtitute of all Security of their Religion, Laws, Eſtates, and Liberty, ſad experience in the Caſe, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> having proved the wiſeſt Laws to be of little force to keep out Popery and Tyranny under a Popiſh Prince.</p>
                           <p>We have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore endeavoured in a Parliamentary way by a Bill for the purpoſe to Bar and Exclude the ſaid Duke from the Succeſſion to the Crown, and to Baniſh him for ever out of theſe Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> But the firſt means of the King and Kingdoms Safety being ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly rejected, and we left almoſt in Deſpair of obtaining any real and effectual ſecurity, and knowing our ſelves to be intruſted to Adviſe and Act for the preſervation of His Majeſty and the Kingdom, and being perſuaded in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences that the dangers aforeſaid are ſo eminent and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that there ought to be no delay of the beſt means that are in our power to ſecure the Kingdom againſt them.

                  <p>This Paper is very plauſibly penned in the beginning, and goes a great way ſo, but in the laſt clauſe but one, there they come to perfect levying of War; for they do poſitively ſay, they will obey ſuch Officers as either the Parliament or the major part of them, or after the Parliament is diſſolved, the major part of thoſe that ſhall ſubſcribe this Paper ſhall appoint; they will obey all ſuch Officers.</p>

                  <p>I will ſpeak as loud as I can. In the month of <hi>January,</hi> about the middle of <hi>January</hi> laſt, I was introduc'd into my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance by one Captain <hi>Henry Wilkinſon.</hi> I ſay I was introduc'd into my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s acquaintance by one Captain <hi>Henry Wilkinſon.</hi> This Captain <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> is a <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Gentleman, he has known me above twenty years, and he and I have had familiar converſation a long while; ſo waiting upon my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> our firſt buſineſs that we went about was, Captain <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> did pretend to receive a Commiſſion from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and ſome others of the Lords Proprietors of the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate of <hi>Carolina</hi> to be their Deputy-Governor; and he told me the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that Journey was like to be very hopeful, and that his intereſt was good, and that he could procure me a Commiſſion, and ſuch a number of Acres for quality and quantity as I did deſire: and he ſaid he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to go over immediately in his own perſon, but he would ſend his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son, and his youngeſt Son, and if he went, he would return again as occaſion ſhould ſerve. I conſented to him in all this, and we diſcours'd it divers times together, and we went to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> on purpoſe to receive Commiſſions in order to this purpoſe. The firſt time I went there was the Earl of <hi>Craven, Peter Colbert,</hi> one <hi>Archdell</hi> a Quaker; I
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54424:12"/>
thought him a Quaker becauſe he kept his Hat on, when the reſt of the Lords ſtood bare in civility to him. We diſcours'd the thing about <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina.</hi> After this, and before, Captain <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> and I had ſeveral diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes about the juncture of Affairs in theſe times, tho I knew him to be an old Royalliſt, and one that ſerved his Majeſty and his late Father very much in the Wars; yet being under great diſappointments of Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at Court, and miſſing the Reward he expected from the King, his heart was turned another way, and he had repented himſelf of thoſe Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had done for the King, and was become a man of another Opinion; and there was ſome inducements upon me that I was inclin'd to the ſame opinion: ſo he expreſs'd himſelf to my Lord, and ſo from one thing to another we went on in diſcourſe, and related the ſeveral Parliaments, and the Proroguing them, and the Diſappointments of the People, and the fear of Popery and Arbitrary Power: and this was not done once, nor twice, nor ten times; for I cannot enumerate them, for we kept a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Club, and convers'd together familiarly near three quarters of a year. After this firſt acquaintance with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> at his houſe, I did frequently go with Captain <hi>Wilkinſon,</hi> and between Chriſtmaſs and <hi>March</hi> four or five times: and I obſerved this, that when we came to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s they were cautious in our acceſſion: In the firſt place it was to be known by ſome of the Servants, who he was in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with: And in the ſecond place the names were ſent up, who they were, that were to ſpeak with him: Sometimes we had an Alehouſe at the Bell in the ſame Street: (I forget the name of the Street) we ſtaid at the Alehouſe till we had a ſit time, Captain <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> had acquaintance with his Porter and his Gentleman of his Chamber: and ſo we often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd. And from the concerns of <hi>Carolina</hi> we fell to matters more publick concerning the State. I remember he would uſe to inveigh ſharply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the times, and look upon himſelf as not ſo valued, nor ſo reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, nor in thoſe places and dignities as he expected he ſhould be, and ſeem'd to be diſcontented, and he did fear that Popery would be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and Arbitrary Power: and when Parliament-men were to be Elected, there came every week news, bringing particulars of ſuch Boroughs and Counties as had made particular Elections for Members for Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whether Knights, Citizens, or Burgeſſes: And he would often conſider that Parliament that was to ſit at <hi>Oxford,</hi> what they were as to their Inclinations and Diſpoſitions: and he ſaid, they would iuſiſt upon the ſame things the other Parliaments before had done. Particularly he ſaid the Parliament would never grant the King any aſſiſtance of Money, nor ſatisfie him in thoſe things that he deſired, unleſs he gave the people firſt ſatisfaction in thoſe things that they inſiſted on before, and he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved would inſiſt upon after; and particularly the Bill of Excluding the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from the Crown: another was the aboliſhing the Statute of the 35th. of <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> and the third was giving his Royal Aſſent for the Paſſing a new Bill whereby all Diſſenting Proteſtants, Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, or what you will term them, ſhould be freed from thoſe Penalties and Eccleſiaſtick Puniſhments that they are ſubject to by the preſent Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht Law: and he ſaid, if theſe and ſome other wholeſome Laws and Bills were paſt by the Royal Aſſent of the King, he believed that when the people had received this Security and Satisfaction, that they would be very willing to grant the King ſuch accommodations of Money by way of Aſſeſſment, or ſo, as his neceſſary occaſions ſhould alſo require: but without this he believed, there would be a breach between the King and the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54424:12"/>
Parliament, and that they had order'd the Parliament ſhould meet at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and not at this Metropolis at <hi>London,</hi> where they might go on without fear of being over-awed: that this was an intention to awe the Parliament. But he ſaid, himſelf and divers Noble Lords, and Members of the Houſe of Commons had conſidered themſelves and their own ſafety, and that they judg'd it dangerous to go to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where they were ſure the Guards, the Retinue of the Court, and the Aſſiſtance of the Scholars (which uſually incline to the Crown) might ſo over-awe the Parliament, that they might not ſo freely proceed in a way for the publick Good as they intended; and therefore he and others had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd with themſelves, that it were fit for them to have Guards and ſend them thither; and to this purpoſe he had eſtabliſht a matter of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men, perſons of Quality, that he believed would have men along with them; and he intruſted Captain <hi>Henry Wilkinſon</hi> with the Command of theſe men, and they were to come to <hi>Oxford</hi> at ſuch a time, and if there were any breach between the King and the Parliament, or any Violence offer'd to any of theſe Members by the Guards, or Retinue of the Court, that then theſe men with others that other Lords had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, ſhould repel his Force, by greater Force, and ſhould purge the Guards of all the Papiſts and Tories, and ſuch as were againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and the Eſtabliſht Laws of the Land; and likewiſe theſe men ſhould be ready to aſſiſt himſelf, and thoſe other perſons in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, to purge from the King thoſe Evil Counſellors which were about him: particularly there were named, the Earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> my Lord <hi>Clarendon,</hi> my Lord <hi>Hallifax,</hi> my Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hide,</hi> now Lord Viſcount <hi>Hide;</hi> and theſe perſons were look'd upon to be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and gave the King evil Advice, and made him continue ſo very deaf to what the Parliament urg'd him to; and therefore they ſaid they would not only purge the Guards, and repel that Force by a greater Force, but alſo take thoſe Lords by Violence from the King, and bring the King to <hi>London,</hi> to the chief Metropolitan City, where thoſe things ſhould be eſtabliſht, which they deſign'd for their ſafety in theſe two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, for the preſerving the Proteſtant Religion, and likewiſe for the keeping and defending us ſafe from Arbitrary Power and Government. Upon this Captain <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> did deſire me that I would be one of thoſe under his Command: this I did conſent to. And he requeſted me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I would provide for my ſelf Horſe and Arms; and likewiſe Arms for my man, and he would provide me a Horſe for my Man. I did accordingly provide Arms for my ſelf, and a good Stone-Horſe for my ſelf, and Arms for my Man before the Parliament did ſit at <hi>Oxford.</hi> I think the 23d. of <hi>March,</hi> I do not punctually remember the day, and when the Parliament was ſet, we enquir'd and heard how things went on, and found that it was as my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> had predicted, that the Parliament did inſiſt upon thoſe very things that he told they would do, but never believ'd or imagin'd they would be ſo ſoon diſſolv'd. Upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> before the Parliament was diſſolv'd, Captain <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> told me he expected that very Week to have a Summons to go up to <hi>Oxford</hi> with thoſe men that were liſted with him; but then <hi>Saturdays</hi> news came of the Diſſolution of the Parliament, and therefore it took no further effect. The whole matter, the main deſign was this, That my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſhould have ſo many men to attend him there for the ſecurity of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and likewiſe to repel the force of the Kings Guards, or any other perſons that followed the King; and alſo to remove from him thoſe five
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54424:13"/>
Lords and bring the King back to <hi>London,</hi> to Eſtabliſh thoſe Laws that I have mention'd.</p>

                  <p>I ſaid before that the firſt motion of theſe fifty men that were to be my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Guard came from Captain <hi>Wilkinſon;</hi> but after this when I went with Captain <hi>Wilkinſon</hi> to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> the ſame thing was diſcourſed there. The laſt time I was with my Lord <hi>Shaftſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was about a week before he went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> about ten days before the Parliament ſet, or a week, and then I heard the ſame diſcourſe from my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s own mouth.</p>

                  <p>I ſay I made three or four Viſits between <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> and we had diſcourſe every time particularly about the Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and if the King did refuſe theſe motions, that then theſe men were to be taken from him, and he repell'd with a greater force, and be brought to it by force.</p>

                  <p>Thus far I did, and I will tell you the whole matter in that point; there was one <hi>Walter Banes</hi> an acquaintance of mine, and I found that he had at <hi>Wilkinſon</hi>'s requeſt engaged himſelf in ſome buſineſs that one <hi>Brownrig</hi> an Attorney in <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> had writ to him about, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome men that were to Swear againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury.</hi> I asked Mr. <hi>Banes</hi> what men theſe were, he ſaid, he thought they were <hi>Iriſh-men.</hi> I ſaid, I don't know what Converſation in that nature my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> might have with <hi>Iriſh-men,</hi> for I know none of them; but I am ſatisfied that he had Converſation tending to theſe ends that you ſpeak of with ſome <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh-men,</hi> and that I know. This Mr. <hi>Banes</hi> did take particular notice of, and he was very frequently upon me to tell him what the matter was, and I gave him ſome intimation of it. Truly 'twas very much upon my ſpirit, and I could not tell whether I was able to carry it through or not, or had better to let it alone as it was in ſilence: but diſcourſing ſtill more with him, and at the reſult of that diſcourſe we had by degrees, I did give him ſome intimation of it. And after that upon ſecond thoughts I took a reſolution to diſcover it: and when I did diſcover it, I do here in the preſence of God declare, that no mortal did know any thing of what I had to ſay, in reference to the King; nor did I make any more applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world, but took Pen, Ink, and Paper, and writ it down, and ſealed it under a Cover and ſent it to the Council.</p>

                  <p>Yes ſeveral times. In <hi>February</hi> laſt, I am not poſitive in the time, but about the beginning of the Month, I waited upon my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> about ſome moneys. I waited upon him to have his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice how I might come by't, and to gain my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Letter in my behalf to the Preſident of the Council to ſtand my friend; and he ſaid there was little good to be had from the King, as long as his Guards were about him; for were it not for his Guards, we would quickly go down to <hi>Whitehal</hi> and obtain what terms we thought fit. Said I, my Lord, I ſuppoſe his Guards can't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him from the whole Kingdom. His Lordſhip ſaid, That the Rabble were all of that ſide, eſpecially the People about <hi>Wapping,</hi> and <hi>Alderſgate-ſtreet;</hi> and the Rich men of the City would Vote for Elections; but they could not expect they ſhould ſtand by them in caſe there ſhould be any Diſturbance, for they valued their Riches more than their Cauſe. And at <hi>Oxford</hi> I heard my Lord ſay again, He wonder'd the people of <hi>England</hi> ſhould ſtickle ſo much about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and that if he were to chooſe a Religion, he would have one that ſhould comply with what was apt to carry on their Cauſe.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Smith.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, I ſuppoſe it is paſt all doubt, that I have been very often with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury;</hi> and I have often in his diſcourſe obſerved that he ſpake very irreverently and ſlightly of the King; ſometimes ſaying he was a Weak man, and ſometimes ſaying he was an Inconſtant man; a Man of no firm or ſettled Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; and a Man that was eaſily led by the Noſe, as his Father was before him, by a Popiſh Queen, which was the Ruine of his Father: This was both in publick and in private. I have alſo obſerved ſometimes in his diſcourſe, ſomething that he mention'd of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and that the King ſhould declare, That the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was not ſatisfied to be an ill man himſelf, but got over the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> too: This the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> declar'd publickly in his own houſe. Another ſtory was of the Rebellion of <hi>Scotland,</hi> That the King ſhould ſay that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was the chief Promoter of that Rebellion; and when this was told my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> that he ſhould ſend word back again to the King, <q>I am glad (ſays he) that the King ſees not his own Danger, nor what he runs himſelf into: and pray tell him, that, if I were to raiſe a Rebellion, I could raiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>othergueſs Rebellion than the Rebellion was in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                     </q> But now as to the particular points I am to charge him with, I remember my Lord, that my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſent for me one time, and that by one <hi>Manly;</hi> ſometimes they call him Major <hi>Manly,</hi> ſometimes Captain <hi>Manly;</hi> and this man found me at Mr. <hi>Bethel</hi>'s Club in <hi>Newgate-ſtreet</hi> at the Queens Arms; and there he told me my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> would ſpeak with me that night. I immediately left the Club, and went to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s; and I was introduc'd into the Dining Room, where there were two Gentlemen in diſcourſe with my Lord; and as ſoon as he ſaw me, he askt me how I did: I told him I was very well, and came in obedience to his Lordſhips Command to wait upon him; for Major <hi>Manly</hi> told me your Lordſhip had a mind to ſpeak with me: he ſaid he had. Soon afterward, theſe two Gentlemen went away. Upon this my Lord turns about, Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> ſaid he, Mr. <hi>Hetherington</hi> was with me this morning, and told me he was afraid that the Iriſh Witneſſes would go over to the Court Party, and retract what they had ſaid formerly. My Lord, ſays I, I know no perſon can better and with more eaſe, hinder that than your Lordſhip, by procuring ſome ſmall Allowance for them; for they complain much of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. Says he, Maſter <hi>Hetherington</hi> has the charge of them, and hath a ſpecial care of them, and I believe they don't want. My Lord, ſays I, I know nothing of that, he knows what provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he hath made for them. This is the thing, ſaid my Lord, that I would have you do, they ſtand in great awe of you, and you muſt perſuade them from going nigh that Rogue <hi>Fitz-Gerrald,</hi> that great Villain, that is pamper'd up, and maintain'd by the King and the Court Party, to ſtifle the Plot in <hi>Ireland.</hi> My Lord, ſays <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> do you think the King would be at ſuch vaſt charges for to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54424:14"/>
bring over Witneſſes, and at laſt maintain men to ſtifle this Plot, for that is the way to ſtifle the Plot in <hi>England</hi> too, as well as that. Sayes he, what is this Frequent Diſſolutions and Prorogations of Parliaments for, but to ſtifle the Plot here, and to hinder the Lords in the Tower to come to a Tryal? This is a ſtrange thing my Lord, ſaid I, when he gave Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> ſuch large allowances to proſecute this Plot. Sayes my Lord, that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that may hold for a year or two, he may take it off when he will, but the chief means are put by whereby we might find out the depth of this Plot, and if Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> and Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> be knock't on the head, then where is this Plot? then there will come an Act of Oblivion for them, and all things will be well as they were before. My Lord, ſaid I, this is very ſtrange to me. I can give you inſtance of it, ſayes he, when I was lately in the Tower, I told ſome I ſaw Popery coming in, and that it was hard to prevent it. I am ſorry to hear it, ſaid I, but what would you have me do with theſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Witneſſes? Say's he, perſwade them not to go near <hi>White-hall,</hi> nor this <hi>Fitzgerrald.</hi> And, ſaid he, one thing more, I would have you mind, Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> that if the King were not as well ſatisfied with the coming in of Popery as ever the D. of <hi>York</hi> was, do you think the D. of <hi>York</hi> would be ſo much concern'd in the bringing in of Popery as he is? I am ſorry for it, my Lord if it be ſo, After this I parted with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> with full inſtructions from him to thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Witneſſes. I met Mr. <hi>Hetherington</hi> the next morning, and I told him that I was with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury:</hi> ſayes he, I know your buſineſs and would have you meet us at the Sun Tavern in the Afternoon. My Lord, I went according to the time appointed, and met him at the Sun Tavern between 6, or 7, or 8 of the Clock, as near as I can remember. When I came to them I began to open thoſe great and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Crimes that I heard Mr. <hi>Fitzgerrald</hi> accuſed of, That he was a man came to diſcover a Plot, and diſowned it here, and retracted all he had ſaid. I told them what a Crime this was. In ſhort, my Lord, they promiſed never to go near the man. I parted that night and came to my Lodging, and the next morning Mr. <hi>Hetherington</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Bernard Dennis</hi> came to my Lodging and told me, That this <hi>Bernard Dennis,</hi> was ready to give in Information againſt <hi>Fitzgerrald,</hi> that he had tamper'd with him to forſwear all he had ſworn before. I went preſently with Mr. <hi>Hetherington</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> to my Lord Major, who was then Sir <hi>Patience Ward;</hi> after we had told the buſineſs to Sir <hi>Patience Ward,</hi> Sir <hi>Patience</hi> ask't this <hi>Dennis</hi> if there were any other perſons preſent. Yes, ſayes he, there was. Sayes Sir <hi>Patience,</hi> you are upon your Oath, if you know not the Nature of an Oath, I will tell you. The Information was drawn up; the Copy of this Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I carry'd to my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and ſhew'd it him, he read it, and was very well pleas'd with it, and ſaid, Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> don't you ſee the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany of that man and that factious Party, and that the King runs the ſame Steps as his Father did before him, how can any thing of this Nature be done without the King and the Court pamper'd him up? My Lord, ſaid I, I think now the thing is clear. I, ſayes he, theſe are the very ſame Steps that his Father followed when he was led by his Popiſh Queen, and the poor man doth not ſee his Danger. I parted from my Lord, and came, and gave an account of this very diſcourſe to the Club in <hi>Newgate</hi>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, and they were glad of it, and I told what my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſaid, That the King would never be quiet till he came to his Fathers end, he follow'd the ſame ſteps. Another thing that I have obſerv'd particularly before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> I went to ſee him, and wee fell into ſome diſcourſe,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54424:15"/>
and my Lord ſaid there was great preparations made, and a great many ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd together upon the Road between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Oxford.</hi> My Lord, ſaid I, what is the meaning of that? Any body may ſee, ſay's he, that is only to terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Parliament to comply with the King's deſire, which I am ſure the Parliament never will, for we are as reſolute now as ever; and more reſolute, for we ſee clearly what the King Aims at, and that is to bring in Popery. Which I told ſeveral years ago, and when I was laſt in the Tower; but, ſayes he, we have this advantage of him, if he offer any Violence to us, (For we expect it,) that we have the Nation for us, and we may lawfully oppoſe him, and he will meet with a very ſtrong oppoſition; for all that come out of the Countrey, ſhall be well Hors'd and well Arm'd, and ſo we ſhall be all, and here is the City which now has a queſtion in Debate among them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall bear the charge of their own Members or no, but they are willing to do it, and ſend ſo many men to wait on them, and if we oppoſe the King, as we may do, for it hath been done in former times, the whole Nation is to ſtand by us, and as I ſaid when I was in the Tower, I would dye, before I would ever bring in Popery or any thing of that Nature.</p>

                  <speaker>Smith.</speaker>
                  <p>He ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the King, if he offer'd any Violence at <hi>Oxford</hi> to the Parliament, he would meet with a ſtrong oppoſition, and that the Gentlemen that came out of the Country were well provided with Horſe, Arms, and Men, to oppoſe him, and that they might lawfully do it if the King offered any Violence to them whilſt they ſat, and that the Nation ſtood by them, and that they did repreſent the Nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that for his part he and all his Friends would do it to the utmoſt of their Power, and, as Old as he was, he would be one that would oppoſe it to his power. My Lord, ſaid I, we can expect nothing but Confuſion, from this Parliament in this Nature, for then we ſhall be involved in another Civil-War, nothing elſe can put an end to our Miſeries, or make this Nation a ſettled Nation, but a Civil-War. Then my Lord ſaid I, by this means wee ſhall make an end of Monarchy, or elſe inſlave the Nation to Popery for ever. No doubt of one ſay's he, but we are ſure of one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Nation is of our ſide, and the City you know how they are, and where ever they Strike, I am ſure the Nation will, and this I'le ſtand and dye by. This is the ſubſtance of what I have to ſay againſt my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and upon the Oath I have taken, I am ſure I have not added a Word. One Word more I have to ſay, 'Tis reported I have been hired and Suborn'd, I do admire why this City of <hi>London,</hi> where there are as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men, and as great Lovers of the King and Government as any in the World, ſhould ſay any ſuch thing; I was never Suborn'd by them, nor never took a farthing of their money, nor never took a farthing of the King in my life.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I have heard him Villifie the King very often, and he told me about the Narrative that I made about Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury Godfrey</hi>'s death, Mr. <hi>Ivey</hi> and I went to him one day and he ſpoke to me of it, and I deſired him not to expoſe my perſon to the King's Anger, for I was ſure he would never grant a pardon to any man that impeached the Earl of <hi>Danby.</hi> Say's he, Do not fear, if he doth not grant you a pardon, he makes himſelf the Author of the Plot; and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſay's he, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> my Lord <hi>Maxfield</hi> and I, wee do all reſolve if you put in writing, we will go to the King, and beg a pardon of his Majeſty for you, and if he doth not grant it, we will raiſe the whole Kingdom againſt him; for, ſay's he, he muſt not expect to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in his Throne, if he doth not grant it. For he makes himſelf author of the Plot.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, ſaid I, he hath diſſolved ſo many Parliaments for the ſake of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and prorogued ſo many Parliaments, therefore he will never grant me this Pardon. Say's he, doe not fear, 'tis the beſt pretence we can have in the world, and if you will but put in writing, and let me read it, that I may give my opinion of it, the work is done; and if he doth not do it, we are prepar'd to raiſe Arms againſt him. I was with him another time after I made this Narrative, and he told me the two Mr. <hi>Godfrey</hi>'s were with the King at <hi>Windſor,</hi> and begged a pardon of his Majeſty for me, but the King would not grant it, but if he be an honeſt man, let him lye at my mercy, let him come in and declare what he knows. Said I, I would not have your Lordſhip ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my cauſe in theſe day's. This is the beſt time for it in the world, ſay's he, if he doth not do it, he can't expect to be long King of <hi>England.</hi> Pray my Lord ſaid I, what ſhall I do in the mean time? I will go beyond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sea, ſaid I. No, ſayes he, don't leave the Kingdom, he dares as well be hang'd as meddle with you. I deſir'd him a ſecond time not to expoſe me to the King's fury, and I prayed him to help me to a little money to go beyond Sea, for I was ſure I could not be ſafe in <hi>England.</hi> Sayes he, Have a care of your ſelf; but, ſayes he, he dares as well be hang'd as meddle with you. Then I was in cloſe conference with him one day, and I gave him ſo exact an account of all Tranſactions from King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt's Reign, the commencement or coming to the Crown to this very day, that he was mightily ſatisfied, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by me that I was a Traveller, he was mightily pleaſed, and free with me. Pray my Lord, what Model do you take, or intend to do? Sayes he, Do you not think but there are Families in <hi>England,</hi> that have as great pretences to the Crown as the King? Sayes he, there is the Duke of <hi>Bucks</hi> in the right of his Mother, ſhe was deſcended from <hi>Edward,</hi> one of the <hi>Edwards,</hi> and in her Right he claimes the Barony of <hi>Roſs,</hi> he hath as great a Right to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> as ever any <hi>Stewart</hi> of them all.</p>

                  <p>I was in Conference with my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> one day, and I gave him an exact account of all Tranſactions, and I asked what they did intend to do with the Government, if they pull'd the King down. Sayes he, Do you think there are no Families in <hi>England,</hi> that have as much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the Crown as any of the <hi>Stewarts?</hi> I know none my Lord, ſayes he, there is the Duke of <hi>Bucks</hi> that is deſcended of the Family of the <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagenets;</hi> he named ſome of the <hi>Edwards,</hi> and in her right he ſhould have the Barony of <hi>Roſs,</hi> and in her Right he has as good a Title to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> as ever any <hi>Stewart</hi> had.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, I came upon a deſign to make cleer the Plot in General, as far as I have travell'd, as in <hi>Ireland, France, Spain, Maryland, Virginia</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and upon that account I was brought before a Juſtice of the Peace, in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in <hi>November</hi> laſt, this time 12 month, and Examin'd before Juſtice <hi>Walcup,</hi> a Juſtice of the Peace, and from thence to the Committee of the Houſe of Commons, of whom Collonel <hi>Birch</hi> (I believe he is here) was Chair-man, and gave in my Evidence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called upon at the Tryal of the Earl of <hi>Stafford,</hi> I was commended as I ſuppoſe to the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and upon the Account he ſent me word of it, by <hi>William Hetherington,</hi> who was then very intimate with the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> to my knowledge; and <hi>William Hetherington</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:54424:17"/>
came to me ſeveral times, and he preciſely was my maintainer at that time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is, to find me what ever I wanted, and provide me my Lodging, and carry me to ſome place where accommodation might be more better for me. Upon this account one time the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſent to me, deſiring that I would wait upon him at his own houſe. I came to him, and there in the Gallery of his own houſe, walking very ſlowly he told me, what I gave in of the Plot in general was very good and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, but as to the Queen and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> that I ſhould ſpeak more home and poſitive againſt them, at leaſt that I might be a corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to others in what they Swore againſt them; This was all at that preſent time, that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ſpake to me, and he deſired me to go home to his Lodgings. With that I went home, and within a Month it may be, or thereabouts, he ſent for me again, by the ſame <hi>William He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therington,</hi> and <hi>William Hetherington</hi> told me, that the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> would ſpeak with me. So I came and Waited upon his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at his own Houſe, and ſay's he, Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> I underſtand that you are a Clergy man. Yes my Lord, ſaid I. And ſay's he, I would adviſe you to take a black gown, and I will preferr you to a Benefice, till ſuch time as this buſineſs is over; and, ſays he, at the end of this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I will not fail to preferr you to a better, and in the mean time I would adviſe you to take a black gown; and this was a little, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, after the Parliament was Diſſolv'd at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and he ſent a Gentleman out of his own Houſe along with me, to a Doctor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity living hard by <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> Fields, Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> by Name, as I remember, and the Gentleman acquainted the Doctor what I was, and about what occaſion I came there; ſo the Doctor indeed diſcourſed with me very familiarly, and rend'red thanks to the Earl for me into his converſation rather then another's. What diſcourſe we had then was nothing to the matter, it was about matters of Conſcience, and Religion. But Mr. <hi>Colledge</hi> that was the Joyner here in Town, and Executed afterwards, being familiar with me brought me to one Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> a Miniſter, as I ſuppoſe of the Presbyterian form, for he goes in their garb as near as I can tell, and Mr. <hi>Ferguſon</hi> at our firſt meeting was in <hi>Richard</hi>'s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Coffee-Houſe, in an upper room one pair of ſtairs, and in ſome company; and <hi>Colledge</hi> going to him brought him aſide, and ſpake to him concerning me, and he came to me apart, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd with me; from whence he brought me to a Bookſeller's Shop. and bought for me the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and in all theſe diſcourſes there was a hand, as <hi>Colledge</hi> told me, of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> who did procure him, and ſent to Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> to bring me that way. I do not deny neither, that I had an inclination before I left <hi>Ireland,</hi> and when I was in <hi>Spain,</hi> and when I was in <hi>France</hi> for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Proteſtant, according to the Laws and Rules of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The force of what I have to ſay is this, The Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> one day after all theſe things were paſt, and after the Parliament were diſſolved at <hi>Oxford,</hi> diſcourſing with me in his own Houſe, Major <hi>Manley</hi> being in the ſame Room then, who lives beyond <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> he asked me what was the preſent occaſion I came to him there, and it was pretty early in the Morning, and the Earl had a Barber to trim him in his Room. I told him my occaſion was then, That I was ſomething low in Money, that I did a little want money at that time, and did not know to whom to ſpeak for any thing but his Lordſhip, and ſaid I came to tell you ſo. Well, ſay'd he, Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> I have appointed Mr. <hi>Rouſe,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54424:18"/>
John Rouſe</hi> whom you know, for to give you and maintain you in money; go to him eſpecially once a week, and he will give you money. And, ſaid he, Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> what is the Number of your name in the Country as near as you can tell, how many are you? My Lord, ſaid I, to tell you exactly what number they be of, I cannot at preſent, but within a little time, I may tell you. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve really there may be upon the matter 3 or 400 able men of my Name, in the County where I was born. Say's the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> I would very willingly have you to adviſe thoſe of your name, and thoſe of your Friends for to be in a readineſs, when ever occaſion ſhall ſerve, and to ſtand by, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhould be, for to aſſiſt the Commonwealth of <hi>England;</hi> for we do really intend to have <hi>England</hi> under a Common-wealth and no Crown; and, ſay's he, we intend to live as we ſee <hi>Holland</hi> does, that is, to have a Commonwealth, and to have no Supream head, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man, ſay's he, or King; nor owe Obedience to a Crown; and, ſay's he, we will extirpate the King, and all his Family as near as he can; and Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> ſay's he, I do admire that your Nation ſhould be ſuch Fools as they are, for it is very certain that King <hi>James,</hi> Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, ſay's he, and the King that now is, does wrong you to very deſtruction; and, ſay's he, if you had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Common-wealth, the Common-wealth would take more pitty of your Nation, and the Gentry of your Nation, then any doe of them now, in this time wherein the King Governs, and upon this I doe count the <hi>Iriſh</hi> fools.

                  <p>Look ye Gentlemen, this is grounded upon the Statute of this King, though there is enough to find an Indictment of Treaſon upon the Statute of the 25th of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; that which is Treaſon within the Statute of the 25th of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, is Treaſon within this Statute, ſo this is the more Copious Statute; for as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this Statute has enlarged that of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third in a great many Particulars; and therefore look ye Gentlemen, always conſider this, when one Statute contains the Matter of another, and inlarges it, the Indictment is always upon the laſt Statute, that being the more Copious Statute: But you are to Conſider both.</p>

                  <p>I would ſay one thing, becauſe I obſerve that ſome of you asked the queſtion, whether the Parliament did not debate about an Aſſociation: whether it related to that Paper or no, I am not certain, I hope you will conſider that Paper well, for my part I muſt needs ſay for my ſelf, I heard of it, but I never heard it read before, and never heard the contents of it; but it ſeems to me to ſhow what thoſe Officers were to do, for the ends of this Aſſociation, and one of thoſe ends as <hi>I</hi> remember (Gentlemen, <hi>I</hi> refer you to the Paper, and hope you will conſider it, you are men of underſtanding) <hi>I</hi> thought that one of thoſe ends was to deſtroy the mercenary forces in and about the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and that the Government was to be by the major part of the Members of Parliament in the ſitting of Parliament, not with the King, but the major part of the Members of Parliament. Gentlemen <hi>I</hi> may miſtake, for <hi>I</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs <hi>I</hi> ſpeak only out of memory; but it ſeems to me to be of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and there is great matter to be preſumed upon it, it being found under Lock and Key in his Study: but <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> may give an account of it, but there is great preſumption upon it, it doth not import to be an Aſſociation by Act of Parliament.</p>
