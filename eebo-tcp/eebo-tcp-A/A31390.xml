            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THat little diſcourſe we had laſt, wherein my opinion and ſuffrage was deſired, concerning the reaſonableneſs of General Addreſſes of all the Members to the Head, in an univerſal diſtemper of the Body; though in the humble dreſs of a Petition, hath yet ſo mutinous an Aſpect, as carries a prodigious horrour with it, and gives us the proſpect of that calamity, diſorder, and confuſion, wherein ſuch prepoſterous motions and commotions do uſually determine by your ſelf procured, but juſt judgment of an offended Deity to an infatuated People, that whilſt the wounds of a dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable Rebellion and Civil War are yet bleeding, are fiercely proſecuting its ſad revival. <hi>And the reſt of the men that were not killed by thoſe plagues</hi> (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 20, 21.) <hi>yet repented not of the works of their hands.</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed Loyal Royalliſts repent not of their intemperancies, or at leaſt reform it not; neither the Papiſts of their Idolatries and Conſpiracies; the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians and Parliamenteers of their Murthers, Sorceries, Fornications, and Thefts; thoſe Witchcrafts of Rebellion, wherewith they delude themſelves and their Proſelites, and are made meer Properties to carry on their malitious and ambitious deſigns of the active hands of ſubtil Projectors of all Factions. And too late I fear we ſhall find the Jeſuits, though undiſcern'd, to be the grand Promoters of theſe Petitions, and what they could not effect as Papiſts, they endeavour doubtleſs as heretofore to accompliſh by Proteſtant Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians, ſowing the ſeeds of Sedition and Diſſention; and what theſe Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners would be at, is evident by the late Inſurrection and Declaration of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Rebels, timely ſuppreſs'd by Divine Providence. <hi>So let all thine Enemies periſh, O Lord: But let thoſe that love thee be as the Sun when he goeth forth in his might, that the Land may have rest many years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, it was, and is yet my wonder, that a perſon of your ingenuity and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95027:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
parts ſhould fall into this ſnare, and be caught with ſpecious pretences, which are indiſpenſably neceſſary to carry on a miſchievous Deſign to ſubvert the Government, which they ſeem to endeavour to rectifie and ſupport, and with this Bait to catch well-meaning men, firſt to ſubſcribe, and then to purſue that Engagement, and what ere conduces to advancement, or ſhall be impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p>Thus the Proteſtation, the fore-runner of the late War, had nothing in it, but what the beſt Proteſtant Chriſtian in the World might with a good Conſcience have ſubſcribed, and yet upon that foundation there followed dreadful Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructures. Perhaps you will ſay, the Petition is recommended from Perſons eminent in the Nation, Patriots, and aſſertors of the Peoples intereſts and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: Theſe indeed are Perſons priviledged within doors, but they have no lawful Authority when out of the Houſe, to promote any publick Petitions; neither are a multitude to be followed to do evil.</p>
            <p>There were no leſs than 250 ſuch <hi>Princes of the Aſſembly famous in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, men of Renown,</hi> (ſays the Text, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 2.) <hi>And they gathered themſelves together against Moſes and against Aaron,</hi> diſputing their Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, <hi>and ſaid unto them, Ye take too much upon you,</hi> &amp;c. Neither did they leave out ſo neceſſary an ingredient to their purpoſe, as a complacent Complement to the People, by ſtiling them the holy Congregation of the Lord, <hi>every one of them.</hi> The dreadful conſequences of this follows in the Story: The Earth's Diviſion devours them quick, to puniſh them for their Diviſion, and Fire from Heaven conſumes them, and the infecting minds of fourteen thouſand ſeven hundred Rebels and Murmurers met the Plague, and became mortally infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to one another. And are thus far parallel'd in our Times, that though the Earth did not ſwallow theſe Rebels up quick, yet the Lord did a new thing, and the Earth did in a manner vomit up three of the grand Rebels out of their graves, and ſince the Nation hath felt a War, and the bloudy City, whoſe ſcum is yet in her, I fear hath felt the Fire and the Plague; and though it be affirm'd the Fire was by Plot, yet I think few will venture to ſay the Peſtilence was a Plot. But theſe three prodigious Judgments had their Meteors to declare whence they came: <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up they will not ſee, but they ſhall ſee, and be aſhamed</hi> for their envy towards thy loyal People, ſo that a man ſhall ſay, <hi>Doubtleſs there is a God that judgeth the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How zealous God hath been for the ſupream Magiſtrate, and how ſevere to ſuch as are over-buſie to cenſure or pry into the Errors of Princes, there is a notable example in the puniſhment of <hi>Miriam,</hi> for leſſening her reverence and duty to <hi>Moſes,</hi> though a Brother, becauſe he had taken a Gipſie, or <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Woman, or to ſpeak in the language of our bad Times, a Miſs: And yet God ſaid to an High-Prieſt and a Propheteſs, <hi>Wherefore then were ye not afraid to ſpeak against my ſervant</hi> Moſes? <hi>and the anger of the Lord was kindled againſt them, and Miriam became leprous, white as ſnow.</hi> Far be it from me to plead for Incontinency, or any thing ſcandalous to Chriſtianity, for I know it gives too much occaſion to the Enemies of God's Vice-gerent to blaſpheme, and ſeems to be obnoxious to a puniſhment, like that of <hi>David</hi> in his Son <hi>Abſalom.</hi> But I would not have any one think, that the Errors of Princes ought to leſſen our Duties.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore fear God and the King, and not meddle with thoſe that are given to change, which I think is at this time a duty incumbent upon all that have the Cure of Souls, to preſs upon their Congregations.</p>
            <p>Sir, Your putting the Queſtion to me, muſt be my Apology for the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my thoughts upon this Subject, which comes to you in a moſt unfeigned Integrity from,</p>
