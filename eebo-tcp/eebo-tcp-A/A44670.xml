            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A CALM DISCOURSE OF THE <hi>Trinity</hi> in the <hi>Godhead, &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Intend not this Discourse shall be concern'd in what this Author hath said of the <hi>several Explications</hi> given by the Persons named on his <hi>Title-page.</hi> The only thing it is design'd for, is the Discoursing with him that <hi>single Point</hi> which he refers to in his <hi>29th.</hi> and <hi>30th. pages,</hi> and which in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, is on all hands confessed to be the <hi>Cardinal one,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Godhead be possible or no?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I put not the Question about <hi>three Persons;</hi> both because I will not, in so short a Discourse as I intend to make this, be engaged in discussing the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed Notion</hi> of a <hi>Person;</hi> and because the <hi>Scripture</hi> lays not that Necessity
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56066:3"/>
upon me, (tho' I do not think the use of that <hi>term,</hi> in this affair, either blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or indefensible.)</p>
            <p>But I shall enquire whether <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son (or Word)</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> cannot possibly admit of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent distinction from one another to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the <hi>parts and purposes</hi> severally as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed them by the Scripture, <hi>in the Christian Oeconomy,</hi> and yet be each of them God, consistently with this most inviolable and indubitable truth <hi>[that there can be but one God.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Author concludes it to be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> in the <hi>mentioned Pages</hi> of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and thereupon seems to judg it <hi>Necessary</hi> that <hi>two of them</hi> be excluded the Godhead, as many others (some going the <hi>Arian,</hi> some the <hi>Photinian,</hi> more lately called the <hi>Socinian</hi> way) have done before him. He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges <hi>pag.</hi> 30. <hi>col.</hi> 1. there may be <q>[some Secret revealed by God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was above Humane Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to discover it; and sometimes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56066:3"/>
 also to comprehend how it can be]</q> But adds<q> [there is a vast difference between my not being able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>how a thing should be,</hi> and a clear apprehension, and sight that <hi>it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be.]</hi>
               </q> What he says thus far is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable, and I heartily concur with him in it.</p>
            <p>But for what he subjoyns, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he might have spoken his Mind of the Matter in Controversie with as much Advantage to his Cause, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon his Adversaries, as if they considered these things either with <hi>no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> or with <hi>no sincerity,</hi> not allowing them even the <hi>never so little</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other)</hi> that <q>[three distinct almighty and alknowing Persons, should be but one Almighty, or but One All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing, or but one God, a Man (who considers with never so little intention and sincerity) clearly sees that <hi>it cannot be.</hi> In short, that it is not a Mystery, but (as Dr. <hi>South</hi> speaks) an absurdity and a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.]</q> 
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56066:4"/>
This is that I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with him, if he will affix these words of his [a Man who considers, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> clearly sees it cannot be; and it is an absurdity and a contradiction] to the Question as I have set it down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. In the mean time he cannot be ignorant that as he hath represented the matter, he hath <hi>here</hi> either not truly, (or at least not fairly) given the sense of any of them whom he pretended to oppose.</p>
            <p>For when by those words, <q>But that three Divine Persons, or that three distinct almighty and allknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Persons should be but one Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, but one Allknowing, or but One God,</q> he would slily insinuate to his unwary and less attentive Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that the same Men held <hi>three Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties,</hi> and <hi>but One;</hi> He well knows, and elsewhere confesses (tho' he might suppose that some Readers would not be at leisure to compare one place of his Writings with another, but hastily
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56066:4"/>
run away with the apprehension, that such as were not of his mind spake nothing but <hi>Nonsense</hi> and Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that not only his later Opposers since <hi>P. Lumbard,</hi> as he speaks, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers much more ancient, as <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Nicene Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. deny'd <hi>three Almighties,</hi> tho' they affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each of the Persons to be Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, understanding <hi>Omnipotency</hi> (as they do <hi>Omnisciency)</hi> to be an attribute not of the <hi>person,</hi> as such, but of the <hi>essence,</hi> as such, which they affirm to be <hi>but One,</hi> i. e. that they are each of them almighty, by communication in one and the same almighty essence. And if their Sentiment be so very absurd, he needed the less to fear representing it as it is.</p>
            <p>And <hi>the other</hi> who seems to grant <hi>three Almighties,</hi> doth never say there is but <hi>one Almighty;</hi> tho' such say too there is but <hi>One God,</hi> placing the <hi>Unity of the Godhead</hi> in somewhat else, as he hath himself taken Notice; which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56066:5"/>
from express Self-contradiction also.</p>
            <p>But I shall concern my self no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other</hi> of these ways of explaining <hi>the Doctrine of the three Persons.</hi> Only shall enquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>possibility of such a Trinity in the Godhead</hi> as was above expressed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting the <hi>uncharitableness</hi> of this <hi>Author,</hi> in imputing <hi>carelesness</hi> or <hi>insincerity</hi> to all, that <hi>think it possible,</hi> with so much <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as to believe he would not (against the plain tenour of Scripture) have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> (as he professes to do <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi> if he had not thought it <hi>every way impossible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I premise</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the present Undertaking is not to shew that the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are <hi>three,</hi> and <hi>but One, in the same respect,</hi> which I would adventure (in this Authors words) to say, no Man that considers with never so little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Sincerity, would offer at.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56066:5"/>
But when they are supposed to be <hi>but One, in respect of Deity,</hi> they are thought to be <hi>three</hi> in <hi>some other respect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That what I now design is only to represent this matter as <hi>possible</hi> to be <hi>some way,</hi> and in the way here propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for ought we know, not as defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>certain,</hi> to be <hi>this way</hi> or <hi>that.</hi> The former is enough to our present purpose, <hi>i. e.</hi> if <hi>any way</hi> it can be conceived, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>absurdity</hi> or <hi>contradiction,</hi> that <hi>these</hi> may be <hi>three</hi> with <hi>sufficient distinction</hi> to found the <hi>distinct Attributes</hi> which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> do severally give them, so as some things may be affirmed of <hi>some one,</hi> and not be affirmed of <hi>the other</hi> of them, and yet their <hi>Unity in Godhead</hi> be conserved, our Point is gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the clamour of <hi>this</hi> (and <hi>every other)</hi> Opposer ought to cease, for our asserting what <hi>every one that considers clearly sees cannot be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, so much being forelaid, that we may proceed with clearness and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of mind [If we would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56066:6"/>
whether it <hi>be possible</hi> that <hi>these three</hi> may be <hi>sufficiently distinguished</hi> for the mentioned purpose, and yet be <hi>one in Godhead,</hi> or in <hi>Divine Being;</hi> we are to recollect our selves, and consider what we <hi>are wont,</hi> and find our selves <hi>indispensably obliged</hi> to conceive of that <hi>ever blessed Being,</hi> and what is with less certainty or evidence said or thought of it. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">I. We cannot but acknowledge that whereas we do with greatest certainty and clearness conceive of it as <hi>an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Being, comprehensive</hi> (with <hi>that) of infinite and universal perfection,</hi> so we do <hi>(most expresly,</hi> tho' this be <hi>imply'd</hi> in <hi>universal perfection)</hi> conclude it a Being most <hi>necessarily existent;</hi> which God hath himself been pleased to signifie to us by the appropriated Name <hi>I am,</hi> or <hi>I am what I am.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hereby is this most excellent of Beings</hi> infinitely, distinguished from <hi>all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> or from <hi>the whole Creation.</hi> All <hi>created being</hi> is <hi>meerly contingent,</hi> i. e. (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56066:6"/>
to the true Notion of Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency) <hi>dependent upon will and pleasure.</hi> So he hath himself taught us to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish; and with such distinction to conceive of the Creation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Thou hast made all things, and for</hi> [or by, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>thy pleasure</hi> [or Will <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] <hi>they are, or were created.</hi> Whatsoever being is <hi>necessarily existent,</hi> the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of its Nature being such, as that it was necessary to it to exist, or impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not to exist, is God, or is <hi>Divine being.</hi> [Notwithstanding what some have imagined of <hi>necessary matter,</hi> we might adventure to affirm this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally of all <hi>necessary being</hi> that it is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, taking it to be plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable, and to have been demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beyond all contradiction, by the learned Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> and many others long before him. And doubt not to evince (tho' that is not the present bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness) that supposing the imagination of <hi>necessary matter</hi> were true, this sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble World could never possibly have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56066:7"/>
been made of it, by any power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; the only pretence for which it is imagined. But if any have a mind to make this a Dispute, to avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unseasonably involved in it at this time, it will serve my present purpose to assert only, <hi>whatsoever intellectual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is necessarily existent is divine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And on the other hand, whatsoever being is <hi>contingent,</hi> i. e. <hi>such</hi> as that it depended on a <hi>meer intervening act of will, (viz.</hi> even the <hi>sovereign</hi> and <hi>supream will)</hi> whether it should be or not be, is <hi>created,</hi> or <hi>is creature.</hi>

Whatsoever <hi>simplicity</hi> the ever bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God hath by any express Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion claimed to himself, or can by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and irrefragable Reason be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to belong to him, <hi>as a Perfection,</hi> we ought humbly and with all possible reverence and adoration, to ascribe to him. But <hi>such simplicity</hi> as he hath not claimed, as is arbitrarily ascribed to him by over-bold, and adventurous Intruders into the deep and most profound <hi>arcana</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56066:7"/>
of the divine Nature, <hi>such</hi> as can never be proved to belong to him, or to be any real Perfection, <hi>such</hi> as would prove an imperfection, and a blemish, would render the divine Nature less intelligible, more impossible to be <hi>so far</hi> conceived as is requisite, as would discompose and disturb our Minds, confound our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, make our apprehension of his other known Perfections <hi>less distinct</hi> or inconsistent, render him <hi>less adorable,</hi> or <hi>less an Object of Religion,</hi> or <hi>such</hi> as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly unreconcileable with his plain affirmations concerning himself, we ought not to impose it upon our selves, or be so far impos'd upon, as to ascribe to him <hi>such simplicity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be an over-officious and too meanly servile Religiousness to be aw'd by the Sophistry of presumptuous Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastick Wits, into a Subscription to their confident determinations concerning the Being of God, that such and such things are <hi>necessary</hi> or <hi>impossible</hi> thereto, beyond what the plain undisguised reason of

things, or his own express Word do evince. To imagine a Sacredness in their rash Conclusions, so as to be afraid of searching into them, or of examining whether they have any firm and solid ground or bottom. To allow the <hi>Schools</hi> the making of our Bible, or the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Creed, who license (and even sport) themselves to Philosophize upon the Nature of God with as petulant, and irreverent a Liberty, as they would upon a Worm, or any the meanest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect, while yet they can pronounce little with certainty <hi>even concerning that,</hi> hath nothing in it either of the <hi>Christian</hi> or the <hi>Man.</hi> It will <hi>become</hi> as well as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern</hi> us, to disencumber our Minds, and release them from the entanglements of their unproved dictates; whatsoever authority they may have acquired, only by having been long, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, taken for granted.

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56066:8"/>
III. Such as have thought themselves obliged by the plain Word of God to acknowledge a <hi>Trinity</hi> in the <hi>God-head, viz.</hi> of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>H. Ghost,</hi> but withall to <hi>diminish the distinction</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> from the <hi>other,</hi> so as even to make it next to nothing, by reason of the straits into which unexamined Maxims have cast their Minds, concerning the <hi>Divne Simplicity;</hi> have yet not thought <hi>that</hi> to be <hi>absolute</hi> or <hi>omnimodous.</hi> For the allowing of <hi>three somewhats</hi> in the divine nature (and what less could have been said?) cannot consist with <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Simplicity</hi> in <hi>all respects,</hi> inasmuch as they cannot be <hi>three</hi> without differing, in <hi>some refpect,</hi> from one another.</p>
            <p>Since therefore there is a necessity apprehended of acknowledging <hi>three</hi> such <hi>somewhats</hi> in the Godhead, both because the Word of God (who best understands his own Nature) doth speak of three in it so plainly, that without notorious violence, it cannot be understood otherwise, and because
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56066:9"/>
it affirms some things of one or other of them, which it affirms not of the rest; it will therefore be <hi>necessary</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a <hi>true distinction</hi> between them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they cannot be <hi>three,</hi> and <hi>safe</hi> to to say there is <hi>so much,</hi> as is requisite to found the <hi>distinct affirmations,</hi> which we find in Gods word, concerning <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> apart from the <hi>other;</hi> otherwise we shall, in effect, deny what God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms; and <hi>modest</hi> to confess that <hi>how great</hi> the distinction is, with precise and particular limitation, <hi>we do not know</hi> nor dare be curious to determine or enquire: only that as it cannot <hi>be less,</hi> than is sufficient to sustain distinct predicates or attributions; so it cannot be <hi>so great,</hi> as to intrench upon the Unity of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. Which <hi>limits,</hi> on the <hi>one hand,</hi> and <hi>the other,</hi> God hath himself plainly set us.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Therefore since we may offend very highly by an arrogant pretence to the knowledge we have not, but shall not offend by confessing the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56066:9"/>
which we cannot (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore need not) remedy. We should abstain from confident Conclusions in the dark, and at random, especially concerning the Nature of God; and for instance from saying, we <hi>clearly see a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient distinction</hi> of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> in the Godhead <hi>cannot be,</hi> or is <hi>impossible.</hi> It expresses too little Reverence of God, as if his being had any, or so <hi>narrow, limits</hi> as to be presently seen thorough; an over-magnifying Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our selves, as if our Eye could penetrate that vast and sacred darkness, or the glorious light (equally imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to us) wherein God dwells; too great rudeness to the rest of Men, more than implicitly representing all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind besides as stark blind, who can discern nothing of what we pretend <hi>clearly to see.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is manifest this cannot be said to be impossible, upon any other Pretence, but that it consists not with the <hi>Unity of the Godhead,</hi> in opposition
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56066:10"/>
to the multiplication thereof, or with <hi>that simplicity,</hi> which stands in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the concurrence of all Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein, with distinction greater than hath been commonly thought to belong to the <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> For <hi>the former</hi> we are at a certainty: But for <hi>the latter</hi> how do we know what the <hi>Original, Natural State</hi> of the <hi>Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is, <hi>in this respect?</hi> or <hi>what simplicity</hi> belongs to it? or what it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or comprehend in it, <hi>consistently with the Unity thereof;</hi> or <hi>so,</hi> but that it may still be <hi>but one Divine Being?</hi> What <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> (conserved together) we can have, <hi>otherwise, an IdÃ©a</hi> of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any apprehended <hi>inconsistency, absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> or <hi>contradiction,</hi> we shall rashly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce to be impossible (or somewhat <hi>imperfectly</hi> resembled thereby) in the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> unless we understood it better than we do. Some <hi>prints</hi> and <hi>characters</hi> of <hi>that most perfect Being</hi> may be apprehended in the creatures, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that are intelligent; <hi>such</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56066:10"/>
said to have been made <hi>in the Image of God.</hi> And if here we find <hi>Oneness,</hi> with <hi>distinction,</hi> meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the same <hi>created intelligent being,</hi> this may assist our Understandings in conceiving <hi>what is possible to be</hi> (in much higher Perfection) tho not to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding <hi>what certainly is,</hi> in the <hi>uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>

            <p n="5">V.

            <p>But so much we manifestly find in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56066:11"/>
our selves, that we have <hi>three Natures in us</hi> very sufficiently distinguishable, and that are intimately united, the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative, sensitive,</hi> and the <hi>intellective.</hi> So that notwithstanding their manifest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, no one scruples when they are united, to call the whole <hi>the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature.</hi> Or if any make a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, or would raise a Dispute about the distinction of these three Natures, I for the present content my self with what is more obvious, not doubting to reach my mark by degrees, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are made up of a <hi>mind,</hi> and <hi>a body, somewhat</hi> that <hi>can think,</hi> and <hi>somewhat</hi> that <hi>cannot;</hi> sufficiently <hi>distinct,</hi> yet so <hi>united,</hi> that not only every one (without hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) calls that <hi>thing</hi> made up of them <hi>one man;</hi> but also every one that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders deeply, will be transported with wonder by what more-than-magical knot or tye, two things so little a-kin, should be so held together, that <hi>the one</hi> that hath the power of will and choice cannot sever it self, and return
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56066:11"/>
into the same union with the other at pleasure. But,</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Since we find this is a thing <hi>actually done,</hi> the making up of <hi>two things</hi> of so different Natures into <hi>one thing, that</hi> puts the matter out of doubt that this was a thing <hi>possible to be done,</hi> 'twas what God <hi>could do,</hi> for he <hi>hath done it.</hi> And if <hi>that</hi> were possible to him, to unite two things of so very different natures into <hi>one thing;</hi> let any colourable reason be assigned me why it should not be as possible to him, to unite <hi>two things</hi> of a <hi>like nature. i. e.</hi> If it were possible to him to unite <hi>a spirit</hi> and <hi>a body,</hi> why is it less possible to him to have united <hi>two spirits?</hi> And then I further enquire, If it were possible to him to unite <hi>two,</hi> would it not be as possible to unite <hi>three?</hi> Let Reason here be put upon its utmost stretch, and tell me what in all this is less pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible than what we see is actually done! Will any man say two or three spirits united, being of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56066:12"/>
will mingle, be confounded, run into one another, and lose their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction? I ask, supposing them to <hi>pre-exist apart,</hi> antecedently to their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; are they not now <hi>distinguished by their own individual essences,</hi> let them be as much united as our Souls and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are, why should they not as much remain distinct <hi>by their singular essences?</hi> There is no more hazard of their losing their distinction, <hi>by the similitude</hi> of their natures, than of our Soul and Body's transmuting one another by <hi>their dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know not but the dictates of so vogued an <hi>Author</hi> with many in this Age, as <hi>Spinosa,</hi> may signifie somewhat with some into whose hands this may fall; who (with design bad enough) says, <hi>that,</hi> from whence one might col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the remaining <hi>distinction</hi> of two things of the same nature in such a <hi>supposed union,</hi> were the more easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable of the two, <hi>i. e.</hi> than of two things of different natures. For in his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56066:12"/>
               <hi>Posthumous Ethicks, de Deo,</hi> He lays this down in Explication of his second De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, <hi>[Cogitatio aliÃ¢ cogitatione termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. At corpus non terminatur cogitatione, nec cogitatio corpore.]</hi> Some may regard him in this, and it would do our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness. For my patt, I care not to be so much beholden to him; for it would, at the long run, overdo it; and I know his meaning. But I see not but <hi>two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous natures</hi> are <hi>equally</hi> capable of being united, retaining their distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>two</hi> of a <hi>different kind,</hi> and that sufficiently serves the present purpose.</p>
            <p>However, let any man tell me, why it should be impossible to God so to unite <hi>three spirits,</hi> as by his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to fix their limits also, and by a <hi>perpetual Law</hi> inwrought into their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct beings to keep them distinct, so that they shall remain everlastingly <hi>united,</hi> but not <hi>identifyed;</hi> and by vertue of <hi>that union,</hi> be <hi>some one thing</hi> (which must, yet, want a name) as much, and as truly, as our Soul and Body united
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56066:13"/>
do constitute <hi>one man.</hi> Nor is it now the question, whether such an union would be convenient or inconvenient, apt or inept; but all the question is whether it be <hi>possible</hi> or <hi>impossible;</hi> which is as much as we are concerned in at this time.</p>
            <p>But you will say, suppose it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, to what purpose is all this? How remote is it from the supposed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Godhead? You will see to what purpose it is by and by. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore adde,</p>
            <p n="7">VII. That if such an Union of three things (whether of like, or of different Natures) so as that they shall be truly one thing, and yet remain distinct, tho united, <hi>can be effected,</hi> (as one may with certainty pronounce, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more impossible, or unconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in it, than we find is actually done) then it is not <hi>intrinsecally impossible,</hi> or <hi>objectively;</hi> it is not impossible <hi>in it self.</hi> No power can effect what is <hi>simply,</hi> and <hi>in it self impossible.</hi> There is therefore
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56066:13"/>
no contradiction, no repugnancie, or inconsistencie, <hi>as to the thing,</hi> nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently any shadow of absurdity in the conception hereof. Whereupon,</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. If such an <hi>union with such distinction</hi> be not impossible <hi>in it self,</hi> so that by a competent power it is sufficiently pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be effected, or <hi>made;</hi> we are to consider whether it will appear more impossible, or whether I shall have a conception in my own mind any thing more incongruous if I conceive such an union (with such distinction) <hi>unmade,</hi> or that is <hi>original</hi> and <hi>eternal,</hi> in an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made,</hi> or <hi>uncreated being.</hi> For we are first to consider <hi>the thing in it self,</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractly from <hi>made</hi> or <hi>unmade,</hi> created or uncreated being. And if it pass clear of contradiction or absudity, <hi>in its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract notion,</hi> we are so far safe, and are not liable to be charged as having the conception in our minds of an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, absur'd, or self-repugnant thing. So <hi>that</hi> clamour and cry of the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary must cease, or be it self absurd,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56066:14"/>
and without pretence. This now <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Union with such distinction,</hi> must if it be judg'd impossible, as it is in our thoughts introduc'd into <hi>unmade being,</hi> can no longer be judg'd impossible, as it is <hi>an Union</hi> of distinct things, but only as it is <hi>unmade,</hi> or is supposed to have place in the <hi>unmade eternal Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">IX. This is that then we have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to consider, whether, supposing it possible that <hi>three spiritual beings</hi> might as well be made or created in a State of so <hi>near Union</hi> with <hi>continuing distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> as to admit of becoming <hi>one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual being,</hi> to be called by some fit <hi>name</hi> (which might easily be found out, if the <hi>thing</hi> were produc'd) as that a <hi>spiritual being,</hi> and a <hi>corporeal being</hi> may be made or created in a state of so <hi>near union</hi> with <hi>continuing distinction,</hi> as to become <hi>one spiritual-corporeal being,</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Name of <hi>Man;</hi> I say, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther supposing <hi>the former</hi> of these to be as possible to be done, or created, <hi>as the latter,</hi> which we see done already;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56066:14"/>
we may not as well suppose <hi>somewhat like it,</hi> but <hi>infinitely more perfect</hi> to be <hi>original,</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> in the <hi>uncreated Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> If the first be <hi>possible,</hi> the next <hi>actual,</hi> what pretence is there to think the last <hi>impossible?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">X. I might add, as that which may be expected to be significant with such as do seriously believe the <hi>Doctrines</hi> both of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and the <hi>Trinity</hi> (tho' I know it will signifie nothing with <hi>them,</hi> who with equal contempt reject <hi>both)</hi> that the <hi>union</hi> of the <hi>two Natures,</hi> the <hi>humane</hi> (made up of an <hi>humane Body</hi> and an <hi>humane Soul,</hi> which are <hi>two</hi> exceedingly <hi>different Natures)</hi> with the <hi>divine</hi> (which is a third and infinitely <hi>more different</hi> from both the other) in one <hi>Person,</hi> viz. of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> cannot certainly appear to any considering Person more conceivable or possible, than that which we now <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> (but <hi>assert</hi> not) of three distinct <hi>Essences</hi> united in the <hi>One Godhead,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any account, but this only, that <hi>this</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:56066:15"/>
is supposed to be an <hi>unmade, eternal</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the other <hi>made</hi> and <hi>temporal;</hi> which renders not the one <hi>less conceivable</hi> than the other, <hi>as it is union,</hi> but only as in the several terms of <hi>this union</hi> it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed eternally to have place in the <hi>Being of God;</hi> whereas that <hi>other union,</hi> in respect of one of its terms is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd <hi>de novo</hi> to have place there.</p>
            <p>In short, here is a <hi>spiritual created being,</hi> an humane Soul (setting aside for the present the consideration of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body, which united therewith made up the <hi>Man, Christ)</hi> confessed to be in hypostatical union with the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created spiritual being of God,</hi> not as that being is in the Person of the <hi>Father,</hi> nor as in the Person of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> for then <hi>they</hi> should have <hi>become Man too;</hi> but as it was in the Person of the <hi>Son</hi> only; why shall it be thought less possible that <hi>three uncreated spiritual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> may be in so near an union with each other as to be <hi>one God,</hi> as that a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56066:15"/>
created Spirit (and Body too) should be in so near union with <hi>one of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> in the Godhead only, as therewith to be <hi>one Person?</hi> will it not hereby be much more easily apprehensible how <hi>one</hi> of the Persons (as the common way of speaking is) should be <hi>incarnate,</hi> and not the <hi>other two?</hi> Will not the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Person it self</hi> be much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable, when it shall be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have its <hi>own individual Nature?</hi> And why is a <hi>natural, eternal union</hi> of <hi>uncreated Natures (with continuing distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> or <hi>without confusion)</hi> sufficient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Unity of the Godhead,</hi> less sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posable, than a <hi>temporal contracted union</hi> with created Natures (without confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion too) that shall be sufficient to the <hi>Unity of a Person?</hi> will it be any thing more contrary to <hi>such simplicity</hi> of the Divine Nature <hi>as is necessarily to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed thereto?</hi> or will it be <hi>Tritheism,</hi> and inconsistent with the acknowledged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable <hi>Unity</hi> of the Godhead?</p>
            <p n="11">
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:56066:16"/>
XI. That we may proceed to speak to both, let these things be consider'd with seriousness and sobriety of mind, <hi>as to our selves;</hi> with all possible reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <hi>towards the blessed God,</hi> and with just candour and equanimity <hi>towards other Men.</hi> And first we must leave it to any ones future representation (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hitherto able to discern any thing) what there is in all this that is here supposed any way repugnant to <hi>such simplicity,</hi> as God any where claims to his <hi>own being,</hi> or that plain reason will constrain us to ascribe to him, or that is <hi>really in it self any Perfection.</hi> We are sure God hath not by his Word taught us to ascribe to him <hi>universal absolute simplicity;</hi> or suggested to us any such <hi>Notices</hi> as directly and evidently infer it to belong to him. Nor hath seem'd at all intent upon cautioning of us lest we should not ascribe it. The <hi>word</hi> we find not among his <hi>Attributes</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> The <hi>thing,</hi> so far as it signifiies any general per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56066:16"/>
we are sure belongs to him; but <hi>the Scriptures</hi> are not Written with visible design to obviate any danger of our misconceiving <hi>his Nature,</hi> by not apprehending it to be <hi>in every respect most absolutely simple.</hi> It doth teach us to conceive of him as most <hi>powerful,</hi> most <hi>wise,</hi> most <hi>gracious;</hi> and doth not teach us to conceive all these in the abstract, <hi>viz. Power, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to be the <hi>same thing.</hi> Yet we easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehend by reflecting <hi>upon our selves,</hi> that, without <hi>multiplying the subject,</hi> these may all reside together in the <hi>same man.</hi> But our difficulty is greater to conceive what is commonly taught, that these, without <hi>real distinction,</hi> or with <hi>formal</hi> only (as contradistinguished to the difference of <hi>thing</hi> from <hi>thing)</hi> are in the abstract affirmable of God, that he is <hi>Power, Wisdom, Goodness.</hi> That to his Being belongs so <hi>absolute simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> that we must not look upon these as things really distinguishable, <hi>there,</hi> from one another, but as different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56066:17"/>
of the same thing. We must conceive of things as we can, not as we cannot; and are only concern'd to take heed of unreveal'd, and undemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strable, and peremptory conceptions concerning that glorious most incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible and ever-blessed Being; to beware of too curious prying into the <hi>Nature of God</hi> (when it vvas so Penal to look unduly into, or even to touch that only-hallovved Symbol of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, his Ark!) beyond what he hath reveal'd expresly, or we can most clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by generally received light, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. When we knovv there is a Knovvledge of him so reserved from us, vvhereof our Minds are so little receptive, that it seemed all one, vvhether he told us, he did dvvell <hi>in thick darkness,</hi> or <hi>in inaccessible light.</hi> 'Twill be a reproach to us, if we shall need to be taught reverence of him by <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans;</hi> or that such a document should need to be given us for our Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that very ancient Inscription in

               <hi>compounded Deity,</hi> or of a composition in it; I only say the term, <hi>composition,</hi> seems to imply a pre-existing <hi>component</hi> that brings such things together, and supposes such and such more simple <hi>things</hi> to have pre-existed apart or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, and to be brought afterwards together into <hi>an united state.</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I peremptorily deny any Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Being of God. And let any man from what hath been hitherto said or supposed, inferr it, if he can.

Essence, <hi>i. e.</hi> the putting of things together that were separate, to make it up; which must suppose it a <hi>new production,</hi> that once was not, and from an <hi>imperfect state</hi> by the Coalition of things once severed, to have arrived to the <hi>perfection</hi> we ascribe to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being;</hi> which sort of being can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, without the most absurd and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous contradiction, ever admit to be called <hi>God.</hi> But if we suppose most <hi>perfect, essential, Power, Wisdom, Love,</hi> by <hi>original, eternal,</hi> and <hi>most natural necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to have co-existed in <hi>that being</hi> most <hi>intimately united,</hi> tho' <hi>distinct;</hi> that seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly important reason, will appear <hi>but a shadow,</hi> and accordingly vanish as such.</p>
            <p>And indeed this is no more than what, <hi>in effect,</hi> such as discourse upon this Subject do commonly say (tho' perhaps <hi>some</hi> may less consider the <hi>ducture</hi> and <hi>sequel</hi> of their own professed Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) when they speak of the <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensibleness of God's Essence,</hi> and how
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56066:20"/>
impossible it is a <hi>finite mind</hi> should form or receive a full and compleat <hi>IdÃ©a</hi> of it; or when they therefore say, that any <hi>conceptions</hi> we can have of the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Goodness,</hi> or any <hi>other Attribute</hi> of the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> are still but <hi>inadequate conceptions;</hi> whereby they must mean, when we consider for instance <hi>the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God</hi> that we not only fall infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely short of conceiving all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to <hi>the Divine Being, in that kind,</hi> but that there is also infinitely more belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto, <hi>in other kinds,</hi> than it is possible <hi>that conception</hi> can contain or express. And when we have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in our minds of the <hi>Divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> do we not apprehend there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally somewhat else in the Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereof <hi>that term</hi> hath no signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? or will we say his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and his <hi>Power</hi> are really <hi>the same thing?</hi> (as they must either be the <hi>same,</hi> or <hi>divers things:)</hi> If we say they are <hi>the same,</hi> we must, I doubt, confess our selves to say what we do not understand, especially
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56066:20"/>
when, in the abstract, we affirm them of <hi>one another,</hi> and of <hi>God;</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly say that <hi>Wisdom</hi> is <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> is <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and the <hi>one</hi> of these is <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>other, God.</hi> I know a <hi>formal distinction</hi> is commonly admitted, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the <hi>conception</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> is not included in the <hi>conception</hi> of the <hi>other.</hi> But are these different conceptions <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false? If false,</hi> why are they admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? <hi>if true,</hi> there must be somewhat in the <hi>Nature of the thing</hi> corresponding to them. But if we say they are <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,</hi> but most intimately, and eternally united in the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> by a <hi>necessary, natural</hi> Union, or that it is not impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble so to be, what we say will, I think, <hi>agree with it self,</hi> and not disagree with any <hi>other conception</hi> we are obliged to have concerning the blessed God.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I profess not to judge, we are under the <hi>precise Notions</hi> of <hi>Power, Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> nor that the <hi>Notions we have</hi> of <hi>those,</hi>

or <hi>any other</hi> divine Perfections, do exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correspond to vvhat, <hi>in God,</hi> is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd by these Names; but I reckon, that vvhat relief and ease is given our minds by their being disentangled from any apprehended necessity of thinking these to be the <hi>very same things,</hi> may facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to us our apprehending the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> to be <hi>sufficiently distinct,</hi> for <hi>our affirming,</hi> or <hi>under standing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi> of some things, concerning <hi>some one,</hi> without including the <hi>other</hi> of them.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. But some perhaps will say, while we thus amplify the distinction of these glorious <hi>three,</hi> we shall seem to have too friendly a look towards, or shall say in effect, what Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> is so highly blam'd for saying, and make <hi>three Gods.</hi> I answer, that if with sincere minds we enquire after truth, for its own sake, we shall little regard the friendship or enmity, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or dishonour of this or that man. If this were indeed so; doth what was
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56066:21"/>
true become false, because such a man hath said it? But it is remote from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so. There is no more, <hi>here</hi> posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively asserted than generally so much distinction betweeen the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> as is in it self necessary to the founding the distinct attributions, which in the Scriptures are severally given them [that when the <hi>word</hi> or wisdom was said to be <hi>with God</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding it, as the case requires <hi>with God the Father)</hi> in the creation of all things, we may not think nothing more is said than that he was <hi>with himself;</hi> that when the <hi>Word is said to be made flesh,</hi> 'tis equally said the <hi>Father</hi> was <hi>made flesh,</hi> or the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> that when the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is said to have <hi>proceeded from,</hi> or have been sent by the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or the <hi>Son,</hi> he is said to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>from himself,</hi> or have sent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.] But, in the mean time this is offered without determining precisely, how great distinction is necessary to this purpose. It is not here positively said
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56066:22"/>
these <hi>three</hi> are <hi>three distinct substances, three infinite minds</hi> or <hi>spirits.</hi> We again and again insist, and inculcate, how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming, and necessary it is to abstain from over-bold enquiries, or positive determinations concerning the <hi>limits,</hi> or the <hi>extent</hi> of this distinction, beyond what the Scriptures have, in general, made necessary to the mentioned pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; that we may not throw our selves into guilt, nor cast our minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to unnecessary straits, by affirming this or that to be <hi>necessary,</hi> or <hi>impossible</hi> in these matters.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. The case is only thus, that since we are plainly led by the express reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation God hath made of himself to us in his Word, to admit a <hi>trinal conception</hi> of him, or to conceive this <hi>threefold distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> in his Being, of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> since we have so much to greaten that distinction, divers things being said of <hi>each</hi> of these, that must not be understood of <hi>either</hi> of the <hi>other;</hi> since we have nothing to limit it on

            <p>And it shall be considered, that the <hi>Godhead</hi> is not supposed more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to exist, than <hi>these three</hi> are to <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exist</hi> in the nearest and most intimate union with each other therein.

We could never have known, 'tis true, that there are such <hi>three</hi> coexisting in <hi>this one God,</hi> if he himself had not told us. <hi>What Man knoweth the things of a Man,</hi>

told us no impossible, no unconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing.

More admirable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Patience spares us! He hath only let us know that this is <hi>the State of his Essence</hi> (whereof we should have been otherwise ignorant.) This is its <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> (q. d. <hi>ita se habet comparatam)</hi> thus it is <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>of it self,</hi> that there are <hi>three</hi> in it to be conceived, under the distinct Notions of <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> without telling us expresly how far they are distinct, in <hi>terms of Art,</hi> or in <hi>Scholastick Forms of Speech.</hi> But he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered us <hi>as Men, reasonable Creatures;</hi> and that when he tells us there are <hi>three</hi> existing in his being, of each of which some things are said, that must not be understood spoken of the

And the frame of our Religion is therefore ordered for us accordingly, i. e. <hi>for us</hi> to whom he hath revealed so much. <hi>Others,</hi> to whom such Notices are not given, he expects should deport themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, according to the light which they have, not which they have not.</p>

at first, so that all might have been otherwise, this signifies nothing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt them out of the state and rank of Creatures, or invalidate this most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable distinction between <hi>created</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and <hi>uncreated.</hi>

            <p n="19">XIX. But if here it shall be urged to me that <hi>one individual necessarily exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent spiritnal Being</hi> alone <hi>is God,</hi> and <hi>is all that is signifyed by the Name of God;</hi> and therefore that <hi>three distinct, indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, necessarily existent, spiritual Beings</hi> must unavoidably <hi>be three distinct Gods:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would say, if <hi>by one individual, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily existent, spiritual Being,</hi> you mean <hi>one such Being, comprehending Father, Son and Holy Ghost taken together,</hi> I grant it. But if by <hi>one individual, necessarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent, spiritual Being,</hi> you mean <hi>either the Father, Son, or Holy Ghost,</hi> taken se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctly, I deny it; for <hi>hoth the other</hi> are truly signify'd <hi>by the Name of God too,</hi> as well as that One.</p>
            <p>I therefore say, the term <hi>individual,</hi> must in this case now supposed (as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56066:27"/>
possible, not as certain) admit of a <hi>twofold application;</hi> either to the <hi>distinct essence</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> or of the <hi>Son,</hi> or of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> or to <hi>the entire es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Godhead,</hi> in which these <hi>three</hi> do concur. Each of these <hi>conceived by it self</hi> are (according to this supposition) <hi>individual essences,</hi> but conceived together, they are the <hi>entire individual essence of God.</hi> For there is but one such <hi>essence,</hi> and no more, and it can never be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, nor divided into more of the <hi>same name and nature.</hi> As the <hi>body,</hi> and <hi>soul</hi> of a man, are <hi>one individual body,</hi> and <hi>one individual soul,</hi> but both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are but <hi>one individual man:</hi> And the case would be the same, if a man did consist of <hi>two, or three spirits</hi> so (or <hi>more nearly)</hi> united together, as his <hi>soul</hi> and <hi>body</hi> are. Especially if you should suppose (which is the supposition of no impossible or unconceivable thing) that these <hi>three spirits</hi> which <hi>together</hi> (as we now do suppose) do constitute <hi>a man,</hi> were created with <hi>an aptitude</hi> to this

            <p n="20">XX. Or if it should be said, <hi>I make the Notion of God to comprehend Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and a Godhead besides common to these three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer; <hi>nothing</hi> I have said or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed implies <hi>any such thing;</hi> or that the <hi>Notion of God</hi> imports <hi>any thing more of real being,</hi> than is contained in <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, taken together,</hi> and <hi>most intimately, naturally, and vitally, by eternal necessity, united with one another.</hi> As in a <hi>created being, consisting of more things than one taken together</hi> and united; a <hi>Man</hi> for instance, there is nothing more of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56066:28"/>
               <hi>real entity,</hi> besides what is contained in <hi>his Body and his Soul united and taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</hi> 'Tis true that <hi>this term, a Man,</hi> speaks somewhat <hi>very divers</hi> from <hi>an humane body taken alone,</hi> or an <hi>humane soul taken alone,</hi> or from <hi>both, separately taken;</hi> but <hi>nothing divers from both united, and taken together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for what this may be <hi>unjustly collected</hi> to imply of <hi>composition,</hi> repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to <hi>Divine Perfection,</hi> it is before obviated. <hi>Sect.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>If therefore it be askt, <hi>What do we conceive under the Notion of God, but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, spiritual Being?</hi> I answer that this is a <hi>true</hi> Notion of God, and may be passable enough, <hi>among Pagans,</hi> for a <hi>full one.</hi> But <hi>we Christians</hi> are taught to conceive <hi>under the Notion of God, a necessary spiritual Being,</hi> in which <hi>Father, Son, and Spirit, do so necessarily coexist, as to constitute that Being;</hi> and that when we conceive any one of them to be God, that is but an <hi>inadequate,</hi> not an <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>full conception</hi> of the Godhead.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:56066:29"/>
Nor will any place remain for that <hi>trivial Cavil,</hi> that <hi>if each of these</hi> have <hi>Godhead</hi> in him, <hi>he</hi> therefore hath a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> in him; but that <hi>he is one of the three</hi> who <hi>together</hi> are the <hi>One God,</hi> by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, natural, eternal Union.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which Union</hi> is also <hi>quite of another kind</hi> than that of <hi>three Men</hi> (as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, of <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John)</hi> parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the <hi>same kind</hi> of Nature; who notwithstanding, <hi>exist separately,</hi> and <hi>apart from each other. These three</hi> are suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to coexist in <hi>natural, necessary, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and most intimate Union,</hi> so as to be <hi>one Divine Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it any prejudice against our <hi>thus stating the Notion of the Godhead,</hi> that we know of no such Union in all the Creation, that may assist our Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>this Union.</hi> What incongruity is there in supposing, <hi>in this respect, as well as in many others,</hi> somewhat most peculiarly appropriate to the Being of God? If there be no such <hi>actual Union</hi> in the Creation, 'tis enough to our
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56066:29"/>
purpose, if such a one were <hi>possible</hi> to have been. And we do know of the <hi>actual union</hi> of <hi>two things</hi> of <hi>very different Natures</hi> so as to be <hi>one thing,</hi> and have no reason to think the Union of <hi>two</hi> or <hi>more</hi> things of the <hi>same sort of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> with sufficient remaining distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>less possible</hi> or <hi>less intelligible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">XXI. <hi>Upon the whole,</hi> let <hi>such an union</hi> be conceived in the <hi>Being of God,</hi> with <hi>such distinction,</hi> and one would think (tho' the Complexions of Mens minds do strangely and unaccountably differ) the <hi>absolute perfection</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi> and especially the <hi>perfect felicity</hi> thereof, should be much the more apprehensible with us.

            </p>
            <p>God speaks to <hi>us, as Men,</hi> and will not blame us for conceiving things so infinitely above us, <hi>according to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of our Natures;</hi> provided we do not assume to our selves to be <hi>a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for our Conceptions of him;</hi> further than as he is <hi>himself</hi> pleased to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and direct us herein.

of <hi>being, goodness,</hi> or <hi>felicity,</hi> and whom he hath made to stand <hi>much</hi> in need of one another, and <hi>most of all</hi> of him.</p>
            <p>But when, <hi>looking into our selves,</hi> we find there is in us a disposition, often <hi>upon no necessity,</hi> but sometimes, from <hi>some sort of benignity of temper,</hi> unto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with others;</hi> we have no reason, when other things concur, and do fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induce, and lead our thoughts this way, to apprehend any incongruity in supposing he may have some <hi>distinct object</hi> of the <hi>same sort of propension</hi> in his own most perfect Being too, and <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with</hi> such a <hi>propension it self</hi> also.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. <hi>As to what concerns our selves,</hi> the <hi>observation</hi> is not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apposit, what <hi>Cicero</hi> treating of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> discourses of <q>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56066:31"/>
endure it, to be without some one or other to whom he might disgorge the virulency of that his malignant Humour. Or that supposing such a thing could happen, that God should take a Man quite out of the Society of Men, and place him in absolute solitude, supplyed with the abundance of whatsoever Nature could covet besides; who, saith he, is so made of Iron, as to endure that kind of Life?</q> And he introduces <hi>Architas Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentinus</hi> reported to speak to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>
               <q>That if one could ascend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, behold the frame of the World, and the beauty of every Star, his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration would be unpleasant to him <hi>alone,</hi> which would be most delicious, if he had some one to whom to express his sense of the whole.</q>
            </p>

But if we so form our Conception of <hi>Divine Bliss,</hi> as not to exclude from it somewhat, whereof <hi>that Delight in Society,</hi> which we find <hi>in our selves</hi> may be <hi>an imperfect faint resemblance,</hi> it seems not altogether disagreeable to what the <hi>Scriptures</hi> also teach us to conceive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, when it brings in the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wisdom,</hi> saying, as <hi>one distinct</hi> from the <hi>prime Author,</hi> and <hi>Parent</hi> of all things, <hi>then was I by him, as one brought up with him, and daily his delight.</hi>

            <p>Wherefore now taking all <hi>these texts</hi> together; with <hi>many more</hi> that might have been mentioned, I must indeed profess to wonder, that with men of so good sense, as our <hi>Socinian Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries</hi> are accounted, <hi>this consideration</hi> should not have more <hi>place</hi> and <hi>weight, viz.</hi> That it being so obvious <hi>to any Reader of the Scriptures</hi> to apprehend <hi>from so numerous Texts, that Deity must belong to the Son of God,</hi> and that there wants not <hi>Sufficient inducement</hi> to conceive so of the Holy Ghost also; there should be

no more caution given <hi>in the Scriptures themselves</hi> to prevent mistake (if there were any) in apprehending the matter accordingly.

            <p>And it is really a great assuming, when a man shall adventure to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce so peremptorily, against the so common judgment of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> without any colour of proof, that our <hi>copies,</hi> are <hi>false copies,</hi> our <hi>translations,</hi> our <hi>explications</hi> false, and the generality of the wisest, the most inquisitive, most pious, and most judicious <hi>assertors</hi> of the <hi>Christian cause,</hi> for so many continued ages, fools, or cheats for owning and avowing them; for no other imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable reason, but only <hi>because they make against him!</hi> How will he prove <hi>any Copies</hi> we rely upon to be false? Is it because he is pleased to suspect them? And is <hi>an interpretation</hi> false, because the words can <hi>possibly</hi> be tortur'd unto some

other sense? Let him name me <hi>the Text,</hi> wherein any <hi>Doctrine</hi> is supposed to be delivered that is of meerly <hi>supernatural</hi> revelation, of which it is not <hi>possible to to devise some other meaning,</hi> not more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, alien, or unimaginable, <hi>than theirs,</hi> of most of <hi>the disputed Texts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor indeed do we need to except that <hi>natural sentiment</hi> it self, <hi>that there is but one God,</hi> (which this <hi>Author</hi> takes such Pains to prove, as if <hi>he thought,</hi> or would <hi>make other men think,</hi> we deny'd it.) For tho' it is <hi>so generally acknowledged,</hi> doth he not know it is not <hi>so generally</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>in the same sense?</hi> Against whom doth he write?

            <p>But (for such things as did need a <hi>superadded verbal revelation)</hi> how easie is it to an inventive, pervicacious Wit, <hi>to wrest words</hi> this way or that.</p>

The <hi>Scriptures</hi> were writ for the <hi>instruction</hi> of sober learners; not for the <hi>pastime</hi> of contentious wits, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect only to play tricks upon them. At <hi>their</hi> rate of interpreting, <hi>among whom he ranks himself,</hi> 'tis impossible <hi>any Doctrine</hi> can with certainty, be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon them.

Especially when he shall take notice of so many <hi>other Texts,</hi> that, according to their most obvious appearance, carry the <hi>same sense.</hi> But it is <hi>first,</hi> thorough meer shortness of discourse, taken for granted, and rashly concluded on, that it is <hi>absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:56066:36"/>
               <hi>impossible,</hi> if the <hi>Father</hi> be <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> can be <hi>God</hi> too (or the <hi>Holy Ghost)</hi> upon a presumption, that we can know every thing that belongs to the Divine Nature; and what is possible to be in it, and what not; and <hi>next,</hi> there is hereupon not only <hi>a license</hi> imagined, but an <hi>obligation, and necessity,</hi> to shake Heaven and Earth, or tear that <hi>divine Word</hi> that is <hi>more stable,</hi> into a thousand pieces, or expound it to nothing, to make it comply with <hi>that forelaid pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous determination.</hi> Whereas if we could but bend our Minds so far to comply with the <hi>plain ducture</hi> of <hi>that revelation</hi> God hath made unto us <hi>of himself;</hi> as to apprehend that, in the <hi>most only Godhead</hi> there <hi>may be</hi> distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which we <hi>particularly understand not,</hi> sufficient to found the <hi>Doctrine of a Trinity</hi> therein, and very consistent with the <hi>unity of it;</hi> we should save the <hi>divine Word,</hi> and <hi>our own Minds,</hi> from unjust torture, both at once. And our <hi>task,</hi> herein, will be <hi>the easier,</hi> that we

are neither <hi>concerned</hi> nor <hi>allowed</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that things <hi>are precisely</hi> so, or so; but only to suppose it possible that <hi>so they may be,</hi> for ought that we know.

            <p>Indeed if any one would run the discourse <hi>into the abyss of Infinity,</hi> he may soon create such difficulties to himself, as it ought not to be thought strange, if they be greater than any humane understanding can expedite. But <hi>not greater</hi> than any man will be intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in, that shall set himself to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <hi>Infinity</hi> upon other accounts; which yet he will find it impos'd upon him unavoidably to admit whether he will or no. <hi>Not greater</hi> than <hi>this Author</hi> will be equally concern'd in, upon his doing that right to Truth, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the <hi>former leaders</hi> of his <hi>own Party,</hi> as to acknowledge the <hi>Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>

Yet also in this present case, the impossibility to <hi>our narrow Minds</hi> of <hi>comprehending Infinity,</hi> is most ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally improveable to our very just ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. It ought to be upbraided to none as a pretext, or a cover to <hi>sloth,</hi> or <hi>dulness.</hi> 'Tis no reproach to us <hi>that we are creatures,</hi> and have not <hi>infinite capacities.</hi> And it ought to quiet our minds, that they may <hi>so certainly know</hi> they have <hi>limits;</hi> within which, we are to content our selves with <hi>such notions,</hi> about <hi>indemonstrable, and unrevealed things,</hi> as they can, with greatest ease to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, find room for.</p>

            <p>But I think, tho' <hi>this Hypothesis</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractly considered, and <hi>by it self,</hi> is not indefensible; it doth not <hi>altogether so well</hi> square with the <hi>Christian Oeconomy,</hi> nor so easily allow <hi>that distinction</hi> to the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which seems requisite to found the <hi>distinct attributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> that are severally given them in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi>

To conclude, I only wish these things might be considered, and discoursed with <hi>less confidence,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory determination;</hi> with a greater awe of what is <hi>divine and sacred;</hi> and that we may more <hi>confine our selves to the plain words of Scripture in this matter,</hi> and be content therewith. I generally blame it in the <hi>Socinians</hi> (who appear otherwise rational and considering men)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56066:39"/>
that they seem to have formed their belief of things, not possible to be known <hi>but by</hi> the <hi>Scriptures, without them;</hi> and then think they are by all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <hi>Arts,</hi> and they care not what <hi>violence,</hi> (as <hi>Socinus</hi> himself hath in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect confessed) to mold and form them according to their <hi>preconceived sense.

            </p>
            <p>For <hi>this Author,</hi> I Congratulate his nearer approach to us, from those who were formerly <hi>Leaders</hi> of his Party, in the Doctrines of <hi>Gods Omnipresence,</hi> and the <hi>perceptiveness, and activity of separate</hi>

            <p>I believe few would have thought him to <hi>see the less clearly,</hi> if he had been content to see <hi>for himself,</hi> not <hi>for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi> And if he had not talkt at that rate, as if he carried the Eyes of all the World in his Pocket, they would have been less apt to think he carried <hi>his own</hi> there.</p>

            <p>And to allude to what he says of Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> his displeasure will not hurt so rough an Author as <hi>Arnobius,</hi> so many Ages after he is dead, if he should happen to offend him, by having once said, <hi>Dissolutiâ€”est pectoris in rebus serijs quaerere voluptatemâ€”</hi>&amp;c.</p>
            <p>But <hi>for all of us,</hi> I hope we may say without offence <hi>to any,</hi> common hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty should be more consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that we know but in part, and in how small a part!

            <p>So much you know was under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration <hi>with</hi> us above <hi>twenty years ago;</hi> and was afterwards imparted to many more; long before there was any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or forethought, within our notice, of such a revival of former controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, upon this Subject, as we have lately seen.</p>
            <p>

            <p>HAving the <hi>Copies</hi> of some <hi>Letters</hi> by me, which I wrote to Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> between two and three Years ago, upon this Subject; I think, <hi>Sir,</hi> it is not improper, and perhaps it may be some way usefull, to let them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company <hi>this to your self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I shall freely tell you my principal inducement, (taking notice in some of the Doctor's <hi>printed Letters;</hi> of <hi>others to him,</hi> contained in them) to send him <hi>(incognito) one</hi> also; but with that reason against printing it, which you find towards the end of the first Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>really</hi> the apprehension, which had long remained with me, that the <hi>simplicity,</hi> which (if the Notion of it were stretch'd <hi>too far)</hi> not the <hi>Scriptures,</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:56066:44"/>
but the <hi>Schools</hi> have taught us to ascribe to the <hi>Being of God,</hi> was <hi>that alone</hi> which hath given us difficulty, in conceiving a <hi>Trinity</hi> in the <hi>onely One God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not the <hi>Unity,</hi> or <hi>Oneliness</hi> of the <hi>Godhead;</hi> but the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of it, <hi>as the School-men have stated it,</hi> that hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the matter of dispute. <hi>Unity,</hi> you know, denies <hi>more of the same; simplicity</hi> denies <hi>more in it.</hi> Concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>that there could be no more Gods than One,</hi> we are at a point; the <hi>reason of the thing it self,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> so expresly asserting it, leave it out of dispute.</p>
            <p>All the doubt is about the latter. Not <hi>whether such a thing belong to the Nature of God;</hi> but concerning the <hi>just explication of it:</hi> As it is a real excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not a blemish; and not meerly a <hi>moxal,</hi> but a <hi>natural excellency,</hi> there can be no doubt of its belonging to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature; but if you understand it as exclusive of all <hi>Varietie therein,</hi> you find not any express mention of such
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56066:44"/>
an Attribute of God in the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> They are silent in the matter. It hath no <hi>authority,</hi> but of the <hi>Schools. That</hi> and the <hi>Reason</hi> that can be brought for it must give it its whole and only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. It is the only thing that must open, and give way, to admit the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity;</hi> and it is the only thing that needs to do so. For we none of us assert <hi>a Trinity of Gods;</hi> but <hi>a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Godhead.</hi> It is the <hi>only thing</hi> that can to the Adversaries of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with any colourable pretence seem opposite to it. And which therefore I thought the <hi>only thing</hi> that remained to be sifted and examined, if they will state it in an opposition thereto. What so mighty and invincible strength of <hi>reason</hi> it had, whence <hi>alone</hi> either to <hi>shock the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> or <hi>pervert</hi> the <hi>plain meaning</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> discompose the <hi>whole frame of Christian Religion,</hi> disturb the Peace of the <hi>Church,</hi> perplex <hi>very think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> minds, subvertt <hi>the Faith of some,</hi> and turn <hi>it into ridicule</hi> with too many.</p>

I reckon'd <hi>the Dr.</hi> (as I still do, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Contempt this <hi>Author</hi> hath of him) a Person of a very clear, unmuddied Understanding. I found him, by what he express'd <hi>in his first Letter of the Trinity,</hi> not apt to be awed by the Authority of the <hi>Schools,</hi> nor any <hi>Bigot</hi> to them, as having declined <hi>their Notion</hi> of a Person, and fixing upon another, (less answering, as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, the <hi>Scheme</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of <hi>Christianity)</hi> I thought it easie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable enough to him to add, what might be requisite in this matter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradicting (directly, or discerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) any thing he had said. I gave him the opportunity of doing it, <hi>as from himself,</hi> without seeming to have the least thing to that purpose suggested to him by any other. I had my self, <hi>I think,</hi> seen and considered the main strength of the <hi>School-mens reasonings</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that <hi>simplicity,</hi> which they will have to be divine; and, for ought I do yet know, have competently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56066:45"/>
to it in this <hi>foregoing Letter,</hi> and partly in what you will now find I wrote to him. But what there is of <hi>real infirmity,</hi> or impertinencie to <hi>this case</hi> (as it is, and ought to be represented) in their arguings, I reckon'd he would both <hi>see</hi> and <hi>evince</hi> more clearly than I.</p>
            <p>Therefore I greatly desired to have engaged him upon <hi>this Point;</hi> but I could not prevail. And am therefore willing that what I writ then with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the greatest privacy, should now become publick. Not that I think it hath so great value <hi>in it self;</hi> but that perhaps it may furrher serve to excite some others <hi>more able</hi> and more at lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to search and enquire into this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and either to <hi>improve,</hi> or <hi>disprove</hi> what I have essayed. And <hi>which of the</hi> two it is, 'tis all one to me. For I have no Interest or Design, but that of <hi>Truth,</hi> and the service of the <hi>Christian Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was so little apprehensive of any such future use to be made of these
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56066:46"/>
Letters, that I kept no account of the dates, except that one of the two lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (which both only refer to the first) I find by the Copy I have in my hands, to have been sent <hi>Decemb. 19th.</hi> 1691. I remember it was a long time, and guess it might be 6 or 8 weeks, e're I heard any thing of the <hi>first,</hi> after I had sent it. Probably it might have been sent in <hi>October,</hi> or the begining of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> before. I at length heard of it very casually, being in <hi>an house in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> whither the <hi>Doctor's Eighth Letter</hi> was nevvly arrived (then no secret) <hi>in order to impression.</hi> I then found this my first Letter was lightly toucht, but mistaken; vvhich occasioned (it being a <hi>Post-night)</hi> my <hi>second.</hi> That was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the <hi>third,</hi> the next Post af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when I had a little more time wherein to express my mind, tho' I still concealed my Name, as it is yet fittest to do, my main Business in my Letter to you lying with a Person, who (blamelesly enough) conceals his.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:56066:46"/>
These <hi>two latter</hi> of my <hi>Letters</hi> to the Dr. produced some alteration in that <hi>Paragraph</hi> of his <hi>8th. Letter,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to my <hi>first.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet no way answering the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign for which I writ it. You have them now together exactly according to the <hi>Copies</hi> I have by me, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one or two circumstantial things fitly enough left out, or somewhat altered.</p>
            <p>And they had all slept long enough, if this occasion had not brought them to light.</p>
            <p>But before I give them you, let me suggest some things further to you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>foregoing</hi> Letter to <hi>your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may apprehend that some will think it strange (if not an inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) that I should suppose it possible an <hi>absolute onmimodous simplicity</hi> may not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> when yet I absolutely deny <hi>all composition</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>And I apprehend too some may
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56066:47"/>
think so, at least a while; but such as <hi>have</hi> considered well, will not think so, and such as shall, I presume will not long. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If I had <hi>deny'd the simplicity</hi> of the Divine Nature, had the inference been just, that therefore I must grant a composition? How many instances might be given of <hi>one opposite</hi> not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that thing,</hi> when also the <hi>other</hi> doth as little agree! And most of all doth the transcendent excellency of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> exempt it from the limiting <hi>by-partitions</hi> to which Creatures are subject.</p>
            <p>Take <hi>Reason</hi> in the proper sense for arriving gradually by argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the knowledge of more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to the knowledge of obscurer things, and so we cannot say <hi>the Divine Nature is rational.</hi> But is it therefore to be called <hi>irrational? Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not to it. Are we therefore to think <hi>Infidelity</hi> or <hi>Despair</hi> do not disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:56066:47"/>
It is indeed more generally appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, we can scarce have the notion of any thing that strictly, or otherwise than by some very defective analogy, agrees to him, and to us. Some <hi>Pagans,</hi> and some <hi>Christians</hi> from them (not in derogation, but) in great reverence to the high excellency of the Deity, not excepting the most common noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all other, even that <hi>of being it self;</hi> but making his <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> to be <hi>superessential,</hi> and <hi>supersub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial.</hi> 'Tis out of doubt that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <hi>perfection</hi> is in us, is not the <hi>same thing</hi> in him <hi>formally,</hi> but in an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable transcendent <hi>eminency</hi> only. Do therefore their Contraries agree to him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am far from denying <hi>the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the blessed Nature of God,</hi> which I ascribe to him in the highest Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which it is capable of signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I most peremptorily affirm not only all the Simplicity, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly affirms of himself; but all that can by just consequence be inferr'd from
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56066:48"/>
any affirmation of his; or that can by plain reason be evinced any other way. Whatsoever is any real Perfection, <hi>&amp;c. Sect.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>'Tis true while I affirm such a <hi>sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi> as excludes all <hi>composition,</hi> in the sense already given, I affirm not such as excludes all <hi>variety.</hi> Not such as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <hi>a Trinity,</hi> which he so plainly affirms, and with such distinction, as his affirmations concerning it imply, and make requisite.</p>
            <p>I further judge that tho the <hi>Scriptures</hi> do not expresly ascribe simplicity to the <hi>being of God,</hi> as a <hi>natural excellency,</hi> they say that which implies it, <hi>as such,</hi> to belong to him; as when they bring him in saying of himself <hi>I am what I am.</hi> This must imply <hi>his nature</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude every thing that is <hi>alien from it self.</hi> I take it, as it signifies (besides a <hi>moral)</hi> a <hi>meer natural excellency,</hi> to import a most perfect <hi>purity of essence.</hi> And I understand that to be <hi>purum,</hi> which is <hi>plenum sui,</hi> and <hi>quod nihil habet alieni.</hi> I
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56066:48"/>
do therefore take the <hi>natural simplicity</hi> of the divine Being to exclude the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grediency of any thing that can infer in it, <hi>conflict, decay, change, disturbance</hi> or <hi>infelicity</hi> in the least degree; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude whatsoever infers the contraries of all these; <hi>serenity, tranquillity, harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, stability, delight,</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> in high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Perfection; as <hi>necessity of existence</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so doth; and that <hi>for all this,</hi> it by no means needs to exclude a Trinity, but to include it rather.</p>
            <p>But I judge humane (and even all created) Minds very incompetent Judges of the <hi>divine simplicity.</hi> We know not what the <hi>divine nature</hi> may include con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistently with its own perfection, nor what it <hi>must,</hi> as <hi>necessary thereto. Our eye</hi> is no judge of <hi>corporeal simplicity. In darkness</hi> it discerns nothing but <hi>simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> without distinction of things. <hi>In more dusky light</hi> the whole Horison ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears most simple, and every where like it self. <hi>In brighter light,</hi> we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great varieties, and much greater
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56066:49"/>
if a Microscope assist our Eye. But of all the <hi>aerial people</hi> that replenish the Region (except rare appearances to very few) we see none. Here want not Objects, but a finer Eye.</p>
            <p>'Tis much at this rate <hi>with our Minds</hi> in beholding the <hi>spiritual Sphaere of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> most of all <hi>the uncreated,</hi> which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest, and <hi>furthest above, out of our sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We behold Simplicity! and what do we make of that? vast undistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht Vacuity! sad, immense Solitude! only this at first view. If we draw nearer, and fix our Eye, we think we apprehend somewhat, but dubiously hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucinate, as the half-cur'd Blind man did, when he thought he saw <hi>Men</hi> like <hi>Trees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if a <hi>voice</hi> which we <hi>acknowledge</hi> Divine speak to us out of the <hi>profound abyss,</hi> and tell us of gratefull varieties and distinctions in it; Good God! shall we not believe it? Or shall we say <hi>we clearly see that is not,</hi> which <hi>only we do not see?</hi> This seems like somewhat worse than blindness!</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Could much please my self in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving in my own mind the very respectful Thoughts and Veneration I have long had for you, and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with the grateful and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>IdÃ©a</hi> which I have not abitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by your irresistible imposition received; and retained of you many
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56066:50"/>
Years, on the account of your former most useful and acceptable Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and which is both renewed and heightened greatly by your late, clear, prudent, and piously modest Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses (both Letters and Sermons) of that awful Mystery [the Trinity in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.] But as I can neither <hi>satisfie my self</hi> of the fitness of making an <hi>Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> of you the matter of a Letter <hi>to your self;</hi> so nor can I hope to <hi>please you</hi> by doing a thing <hi>in it self so inept,</hi> and so <hi>insignificant to you.</hi> I shall bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do <hi>both,</hi> if I shall offer any thing to you concerning this mentioned Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>your</hi> further consideration whereof may prove a further benefit to the World.</p>
                  <p>In what you have already said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, you have used that great Caution, and so well guarded your self, as not so far as I can apprehend, to <hi>give an adversary in this single point, the least advantage.</hi> That which I would in the general, humbly offer, is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56066:50"/>
you have said so much as <hi>with safety might be said,</hi> and as <hi>the Case may require,</hi> for the <hi>gaining of a just advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> to the <hi>common Christian Cause.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We design, <hi>in fight,</hi> not only to <hi>keep our selves safe,</hi> but to <hi>overcome,</hi> and not <hi>in praelio</hi> only, but <hi>in bello.</hi> In Wars, indeed <hi>of this sort,</hi> both <hi>our own safety</hi> and <hi>victory,</hi> are less to be valued than <hi>truth.</hi> Which, being of a piece, can be injured in no part, without some dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the whole frame of congene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Truth. And as it is very possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, while an Enemy is withstood at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking <hi>some one Fort,</hi> a greater loss may not be provided against <hi>elsewhere;</hi> it may so fall out in Affairs of this kind too, that the Care of defending some <hi>one Truth</hi> may be accompany'd with a present not attending to the jeopardy of <hi>divers others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The nearer we approach an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary (within just limits) in these ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal decertations, the less he can have to say against us. But being well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56066:51"/>
our selves about the main point of disagreement, we then take Care not to come so near, as to fall in with him, pass into his Tents, and give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our main Cause.</p>
                  <p>I am <hi>(worthiest Sir)</hi> far from assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming so much to my self, or detracting so much from you, as to give a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that this <hi>really</hi> is done in your Discourses about the Trinity. I only submit it to your own most penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting judgment, what may be further <hi>requisite</hi> and <hi>possible</hi> in this matter, to take away any appearances hereof, and prevent ill consequences that may too easily ensue.</p>
                  <p>I have, for my own part, long im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd it upon my self to abstain from any <hi>positive Conceptions</hi> concerning the <hi>Godhead,</hi> beyond what I find expresly contain'd in the <hi>divine revelation,</hi> or what the <hi>reason of things,</hi> either antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereto, or consequentially there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, doth most evidently perswade and require; and do greatly approve the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56066:51"/>
same caution, which I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve with you. But desire it may be weigh'd whether <hi>such measures</hi> may not, and must not lead us further.</p>
                  <p>As for the word <hi>person,</hi> you prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profess not to be fond of it, the thing being agreed, thÃ´ you also tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge it a good word, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently warranted.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Notion</hi> signify'd by it, you all along seem to decline that <hi>of the Schools,</hi> or the <hi>Metaphysical one,</hi> which, you know, makes it to be a <hi>rational</hi> (or intelligent) <hi>suppositum;</hi> and to take up with (what I think I may, wanting a fitter, <hi>i. e.</hi> a more comprehensive word, call) the <hi>Civil Notion</hi> of it; which will allow the same man to be capable of sustaining three or more <hi>persons,</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his circumstances or qualifications to be <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such,</hi> as to that purpose you speak both in your <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Sermons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now whereas you have also told us, <hi>Letter</hi> 1. that by <hi>personality</hi> you mean
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56066:52"/>
                     <hi>that distinction</hi> (whatever it be) by which the <hi>three persons</hi> are distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each from other; <hi>that</hi> which, with great submission, and most profound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to you, I propose to your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Consideration, will be capable of being resolved into these two Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether only such a distinction of the Divine Persons, as this amounts to, will be <hi>sufficient to found the several attributions</hi> which the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> give distinctly and severally to them, and to preserve the Scheme of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion entire, which is wont to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from these Sacred Writings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether some further distinction may not be admitted as <hi>possible,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistently with the salved unity of the Godhead.</p>
                  <p>As to the former, 1. Whereas you think the word Person to be a good word, and <hi>sufficiently warranted by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> Heb. 1. 3. <hi>where the Son is called the express Image of his Father's Person; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:56066:52"/>
                     <hi>that so we render the word Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis which is there used, and do mean by it what you think to be there meant;</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you would please to consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the word <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> according to the common use of it will admit to be so taken, as you explain your self to mean by the word <hi>Person.</hi> For thÃ´ the <hi>Latine</hi> word <hi>persona,</hi> as you say, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true and ancient sense, may well enough admit to be so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as that the <hi>same Man</hi> might sustain <hi>three persons,</hi> I offer it to your re-conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whether ever you have observ'd the word <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> in any sort of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, when it signifies any Person at all (for I know that it frequently sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies somewhat else than a Person) to be taken in that sense. And whether <hi>one Hypostasis</hi> so taken as it uses to be when it signifies a Person, may not be capable of sustaining three of those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which you here describe. And whether, according to this sense you mean not God to be <hi>only one</hi> such <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:56066:53"/>
2. Be pleas'd further hereupon to consider how well it agrees with this supposition of God's Being but <hi>one Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis,</hi> or intelligent <hi>suppositum,</hi> so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to speak, as the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do of the <hi>Father, Son</hi> or <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as three distinct I's or He's. <hi>The Lord possessed</hi> me (as the Divine Word or Wisdom is brought in speaking) <hi>in the beginning of</hi> his <hi>way.â€”</hi>I <hi>was set up from everlasting,</hi> Prov. 8. 22, 23. <hi>When</hi> he <hi>prepared the Heavens</hi> I <hi>was there,</hi> vers. 27.â€”<hi>Then was</hi> I <hi>by</hi> him, <hi>vers.</hi> 30, &amp;c. <hi>The Wordâ€”was with God,</hi> Joh. 1. 1. He <hi>was in the World,</hi> vers. 10. <hi>We beheld</hi> his <hi>glory,</hi> vers. 14. And of the Spirit, He <hi>dwelleth with you,</hi> Joh. 14. 17. <hi>The Holy Ghost whom the Father will send in my name,</hi> He <hi>shall teach you all things,</hi> vers. 26. And <hi>whom</hi> I <hi>will send you from the Father,</hi> he <hi>shall testifie of me,</hi> Chap. 15. 26. <hi>And when</hi> he <hi>is come,</hi> he <hi>will reprove the Worldâ€”</hi>Ch. 16. 8.

easily admit it. But what will be the consequence? That therefore there are three Deities? That cannot be <hi>his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> nor be consequent from it, if he only mean that the <hi>Deity</hi> comprehends in it <hi>three such essences.</hi> If indeed he think those <hi>three beings</hi> are as distinct as <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> what is said by <hi>W. J.</hi> against him, I think irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, that then they are no otherwise <hi>one,</hi> than <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> and by him against himself; for <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are not mutually <hi>self-conscious,</hi> as <hi>they</hi> are asserted to be, which mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual self-consciousness, since it is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make the three divine Persons one, cannot be supposed to leave them so distinct, as they are with whom it is not found.</p>
                  <p>As to what is observed of the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective expression of this unitive Principle by the word consciousness, that bare Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, without consent, is no more than bare Omnisciency.</hi> Sure it is not so much. For Consciousness doth not signifie Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciency.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56066:58"/>
We are conscious to our selves, yet are not omniscient. But I reckon, (as I find he also doth) that even <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> added to <hi>consciousness,</hi> would yet leave the expression defective, and still want the <hi>unifying power</hi> which is sought after. For it would infer no more than a sort of <hi>moral union,</hi> which <hi>in the kind of it,</hi> may be found among men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom there is so little of <hi>natural union</hi> (speaking of the numerical na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) that they are actually sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
                  <p>But now may we not suppose (as that which is <hi>possible,</hi> and actually is, (for ought we know) what may be fundamental to both <hi>Consciousness</hi> and <hi>Consent,</hi> a <hi>natural union</hi> even of the <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical natures?</hi> Such an <hi>union</hi> would not infer an <hi>Unity,</hi> or <hi>Identity</hi> of these Natures, Essences, Substances, or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings themselves. For as <hi>W. J.</hi> hath well argued, Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Substances upon Union are not confounded or identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, or brought to unity of Substance, but</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:56066:58"/>
                     <hi>continuing numerically distinct Substances acquire some mutual community or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of operations,</hi> &amp;c. And deferring the consideration a while what this would signifie towards the <hi>unity,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, <hi>of the Godhead,</hi> shall take notice how accommodately to our present purpose <hi>W. J.</hi> speaks in what follows, <hi>where instancing in the chief uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are known to us,</hi> he says, <hi>Our Soul and Body are two substances really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, and in close union with one another.</hi> But notwithstanding this, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue <hi>distinct substances under that union. In like manner the humane soul of Christ is in union with the</hi> Logos, <hi>or second Person of the Trinity, which we call an hypostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Union. But neither doth this union make an unity of substance. For the two substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the divine and humane natures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue distinct under that union.</hi> 'Tis true, he addes, <hi>which must not be allowed in the Unity of the Godhead, where there can be no plurality or multiplicity of substhaces.</hi> Nor do I say that it must, I only say
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56066:59"/>
                     <hi>Do we know,</hi> or <hi>are we sure</hi> there is <hi>no sort</hi> of Plurality?</p>
                  <p>But if we are sure that there are temporal unions <hi>(i. e.</hi> begun in time) as in our selves for instance, of two substances that make but one man, and in our Saviour an humane nature and divine that make but one <hi>Emma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel.</hi> How do we know but that there may be <hi>three</hi> in the Godhead that make but <hi>one God?</hi> And the rather, because this being supposed, it must also be supposed that they are <hi>necessarily and eternally united,</hi> and with a conjunct na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural impossibility of ever being, or having been otherwise, whereof the absolute immutability of God must up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that supposition most certainly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us. And such a supposed union will be most remote from making the Deity <hi>an aggregate.</hi> And for <hi>any thing of composition,</hi> I reckon we are most strictly bound to believe every thing of the most <hi>perfect simplicity</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being</hi> which his Word informs us
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56066:59"/>
of, and to assent to every thing that is with plain evidence demonstrable of it. But not every thing which the <hi>Schools</hi> would impose upon us, without such <hi>testimony</hi> or <hi>evidence.</hi> For <hi>as none can know the things of a Man, but the Spirit of Man which is in him, so nor can any know the things of God, but the Spirit of God.</hi> Nor can I think the Argument concluding from the <hi>imperfection of a Being,</hi> in which distinct things concur <hi>that were seperate,</hi> or are <hi>de novo</hi> united, to the <hi>impersection of a being,</hi> in which things some way distinct are <hi>necessarily and eternally self-united.</hi> Nor can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore agree with <hi>W.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56066:60"/>
not separable from it without the cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole. But now, as the accession of the <hi>humane Nature</hi> to the <hi>divine</hi> in the <hi>hypostatical union</hi> infers no imperfection to the <hi>divine,</hi> so much less would what things we may suppose naturally, necessarily, and eternally uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Godhead infer any <hi>imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I easily admit what is said by <hi>W. J.</hi> Letter <hi>pag.</hi> 8. That we have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter definition of God, than that he is [a Spirit infinitely perfect] But then, being so far taught by himself my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of him, I must include in it, this trinal distinction, or a <hi>triple somewhat</hi> which he affirms of himself, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, or any one whereof, he were not infinitely perfect, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not God, and <hi>that all together</hi> do make <hi>one God.</hi> As you most aptly say of your resemblance of him, a <hi>Cube,</hi> there are in it three dimensions truly distinct from each other, yet all these are but <hi>one Cube,</hi> and if any one of the

three were wanting, it were not a Cube.</p>
                  <p>Set this down then for the Notion of God, that he is a Spirit infinitely perfect, comprehending in that omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modous Perfection a <hi>trinal distinction,</hi> or <hi>three persons truly distinct,</hi> each whereof is <hi>God.</hi> What will be the consequence? that therefore there are <hi>three Gods?</hi> Not at all, but that each of these partaking Divine Nature give us an <hi>inadequate,</hi> and all together a most perfectly <hi>adequate</hi> and entire Notion of God.</p>
                  <p>Nor would the Language of this Hypothesis being prest to speak out (as he says in his Letter) be thisâ€”these are not <hi>fit</hi> to be called three Gods; but not <hi>possible</hi> (with any truth) to be so called.</p>
                  <p>And whereas he after tells us these <hi>three</hi> being united by similitude of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, mutual consciousness, consent, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation under the greatest union possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and in that state of union do constitute the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. I note that what he opposes to it (so defectively represented) is as defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, that the Christian Trinity doth not use to be represented thus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What hurt is there in it, if it can be more intelligibly represented than hath been used?</p>
                  <p>But his gentle treatment of <hi>this hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi> which he thought, as he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it, not altogether unintelligible,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56066:61"/>
and which with some help may be more intelligible, became one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring what might most safely, and with least torture to our own minds, be said, or thought in so awful a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery. It however seems not proper to call this an <hi>hypostatical unionâ€”</hi>much less to say it amounts to no more. It amounts not to so much. For an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatical or personal union would make the <hi>terms united</hi> (the <hi>unita,</hi> the things or somewhats under this union) become by it <hi>one hypostasis</hi> or <hi>person;</hi> whereas <hi>this union</hi> must leave them distinct <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> or <hi>hypostases,</hi> but makes them <hi>one God.</hi> In the use of the Phrase <hi>hypostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> or <hi>personal union</hi> the denomination is not taken from the <hi>subject</hi> of the union, as if the design were to signifie <hi>that</hi> to be <hi>divers hypostases,</hi> or <hi>persons,</hi> but from the <hi>effect</hi> or <hi>result</hi> of the <hi>mentioned union,</hi> to signifie that which results to be <hi>one person</hi> or <hi>hypostasis.</hi> As the matter is plain in the instance wherein it is of most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted use, the case of the <hi>two Natures</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56066:62"/>
in the one Person of the Son of God; where the things united are not supposed to be <hi>two Persons,</hi> but <hi>two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> so conjoyn'd, as yet to make but <hi>one person,</hi> which therefore is the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive result or effect of the union, <hi>viz.</hi> that the person is not multiply'd by the accession of another Nature, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains still only one. But this were an union quite of another kind, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>three hypostases,</hi> still <hi>remaining distinct,</hi> and concurring <hi>in one Godhead.</hi> And may not this be supposed without prejudice to its Perfection.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Schools</hi> themselves suppose themselves not to admit a composition prejudicial to the Perfection of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, when they admit three modes of subsistence, which are distinct from one another, and from the Godhead, which they must admit. For if each of them were the very Godhead, each of them (as is urged against us by you know who) must have three Persons belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, as the Godhead hath. And
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56066:62"/>
your self acknowledge <hi>three somewhats</hi> in the Godhead distinct, or else they could not be <hi>three:</hi> I will not here urge that if they be three somewhats, they must be <hi>three things,</hi> not three nothings; for however uneasie it is to assign a <hi>Medium</hi> between something and nothing, I shall wave that Metaphysical contest. But yet collect, that <hi>simplicity</hi> in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strictest sense that can be conceiv'd, is not, <hi>in your account,</hi> to be ascribed to God, either according to his own word, or the reason of things.</p>
                  <p>It may here be urged, how can we conceive this <hi>Natural Union</hi> (as I have adventur'd to Phrase it) of the <hi>three Persons,</hi> supposing them <hi>distinct things, substances,</hi> or <hi>Spirits?</hi> Is such an Union conceivable, as shall make them be <hi>but one God,</hi> and not be such, as shall make them cease to be three distinct things, substances, or Spirits? We find indeed the mentioned unions of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> in our selves, and of the <hi>two Natures</hi> in Christ consistent enough with manifest
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56066:63"/>
distinction; but then the things united are in themselves of most different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But if things of so congenerous a Nature be united, will not their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction be lost in their union?</p>
                  <p>I answer, 1. That a Spirit and a Spirit are numerically as distinct, as a Body and a Spirit. And, 2. That we may certainly conceive it as possible to God to have united two or three crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spirits, and by as strict union as is between our Souls and Bodies, without confounding them; and I reckon the union between our Souls and Bodies much more wonderful than that would have been. Why then is an unmade, uncreated union of three Spirits less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable as that which is to be presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to their mutual consciousness?</p>
                  <p>I shall not move, or meddle with, any Controversie about the Infinity of these three supposed Substances or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it being acknowledged on all hands that Contemplations of that kind can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be above our measure. And
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56066:63"/>
well knowing how much easier it is to puzzle <hi>oneself</hi> upon that <hi>Question, An possit dari infinitum infinito infinitius,</hi> than to speak satisfyingly, and unexceptionably about it <hi>to another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And tho' I will not use the expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as signifying my formed judgment, that there are <hi>three things, substances,</hi> or <hi>Spirits</hi> in the Godhead (as you that there are <hi>three somewhats)</hi> yet, as I have many Years thought, I do still think that what the learned <hi>W. J.</hi> doth but more lightly touch of the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> being <hi>produced</hi> (which term I use, but reciting it, as he doth) not by a voluntary external, but by an internal, necessary, and emanative Act, hath great weight in it.</p>
                  <p>In short my sense hath long lain thus, and I submit it to your searching and candid Judgment, <hi>viz.</hi> That tho' we need not have determinate thoughts, <hi>how far</hi> the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are distinguished; yet we must conceive them <hi>in the general</hi> to be <hi>so far</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56066:64"/>
as is really necessary to the founding the distinct attributions which the Scriptures do distinctly give them. And that whatever distinction is truly necessary to that purpose, will yet not hinder the two <hi>latters</hi> participation with the <hi>first</hi> in the <hi>Godhead,</hi> which can be but one, because that tho' we are led by plain Scripture, and the very import of that word, to conceive of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> as the Fountain, yet the <hi>Son</hi> being from him, and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> from them both, not contingently, or dependently on will and pleasure; but by eternal, natural, necessary promanation, these two latter are infinitely distinguisht from the whole Creation. Inasmuch as all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are contingent beings, or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon will and pleasure, as the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is given us of created things, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Thou hast made all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.</hi> But that whatever is what it is necessarily is God. For I have no doubt but the Dreams of some, more anciently, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56066:64"/>
of late, concerning <hi>necessary matter,</hi> and the <hi>Sophisms</hi> of <hi>Spinosa</hi> and some others, tending to prove the <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>all substance</hi> are (with what they aim to evince) demonstrably false.</p>
                  <p>The Summe of all will be this,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we can be more certain of nothing than that there is but one God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are most sure the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are sufficiently distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished to give a just ground to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct attributions, which are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture severally given to them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are not sure what that suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient distinction is (wherein I find you saying with me over and over) But whereas you rightly make the word <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> applicable to God, but in a sense analogous to that which obtains of it <hi>with men;</hi> why may it not be said it may be fitly applicable, <hi>for ought we know,</hi> in a sense analogous to <hi>that notion of it among men,</hi> which makes a <hi>person</hi> signify an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent hypostasis; and so three distinct persons, three distinct intelligent hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stases.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:56066:65"/>
4. But if that <hi>sufficient distinction</hi> can be no less, than that there be in the Godhead, three distinct intelligent hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postases, each having its own distinct singular intelligent nature, with its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per personality belonging to it, we know nothing to the contrary, but that the necessary eternal nature of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head may admit thereof. If any can from plain Scripture testimony, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent reason evince the contrary, let the evidence be produced. In the mean time we need not impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our selves any formal denial of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If the contrary can be evidenced, and that hereupon it be designed to conclude that there can be but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent hypostasis in the Godhead, and therefore that the Son, and the Holy Ghost are but creatures, the last refuge must be to deny the former conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and to alledge that thÃ´ the same finite singular nature cannot well be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to remain entirely to one, and be communicated entirely to another,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56066:65"/>
and another, the case will not be the same speaking of an infinite Nature.</p>

                  <p>If what is here said shall occasion to you any new thoughts that you shall judge may be of common use, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there will be no need of Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Letter, but only that you be pleased to comunicate your own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as from your self, which will have so much the more of Authority and Usefulness with them. The most considerable thing that I have hinted, is the necessary Promanation of the Son, and Holy Ghost, that must distinguish them from contingent Beings, and so from Creatures; which if you think im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable to any good purpose, as it hath been with me a Thought <hi>many years old,</hi> so I suppose it <hi>not new</hi> to you, and being now resumed by you, upon this occasion, you will easily cultivate it to better advantage than any words of mine can give it.</p>
                  <p>But if you think it adviseable that any
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56066:66"/>
part of my Letter be Published, if you please to signifie your mind to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in one Line to markedâ€”â€”it will come Sealed to my view, and will give Opportunity of offering my Thoughts to you, what parts I would have supprest, which will be such only, as shall leave the rest the fuller Testimony of my being,</p>

                  <p>YOur Eighth Letter happening to come to my View before it was
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56066:66"/>
printed off, I have the Opportunity of taking Notice to you that it quite mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represents the intent of the Letter to you subscribed <hi>Anonymous,</hi> which it makes to be the defending or excusing some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s; which indeed was the least considerable thing, if it were any thing at all in the design of that Letter, and not altogether acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to it. The true design of it was, that there might be a clearer Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on asserted (as possible at least) to the Doctrine of the Incarnation and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Son of God. Nor can the <hi>fortÃ¨ quod sic,</hi> here be solved by the <hi>fortÃ¨ quod non,</hi> the Exigency of the Case being such, as that <hi>if more be possible,</hi> it will be <hi>highly requisite;</hi> and that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be avoided to assert more, unless it can be clearly evinced that more is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</hi> Nor yet is it necessary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine how much more is necessary. But not only the commonly receiv'd frame of <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> doth sem to require somewhat beyond what the meer
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56066:67"/>
                     <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>respective</hi> Notion of the word <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> imports; but also the plain Letter of Scripture, which says <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. that the Son is the express Image of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>hypostasis,</hi> which seems to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie there are <hi>two Hyyostases,</hi> and other Scriptures seem to say enough, whence we may with parity of Reason collect a <hi>third.</hi> Now that Letter intimates, I think, sufficient matter of doubt, whether <hi>hypostasis</hi> doth not signifie much more than <hi>Person,</hi> in your sense.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>principal thing</hi> that Letter humbly offer'd to consideration <hi>[i. e.</hi> whether, supposing a greater distinction than you have assign'd be <hi>necessary,</hi> it may not be defended, by the just supposal that the <hi>promanation</hi> of the second or third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (or <hi>hypostases</hi> rather) howsoever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers they are, is by <hi>natural eternal necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> not <hi>contingent,</hi> or <hi>depending upon will and pleasure,</hi> as all <hi>created Being</hi> is and doth] is altogether waved.

                  <p>I Am very loath troublesomely to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune you. But the very little time I had for the view of your <hi>8th.</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, before I wrote mine by the <hi>last Post</hi> not allowing me fully to write my sense as to <hi>that part</hi> which concern'd <hi>my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Letter;</hi> I take leave now to add,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56066:68"/>
that my design in it (as well as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest design of the Letter it self) was to offer you the occasion of employing that clear understanding, wherewith God hath blest you, above most, in consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether a <hi>greater latitude</hi> cannot be allow'd us in conceiving the <hi>distinction</hi> of the three in the <hi>Godhead</hi> consistently with the <hi>Unity</hi> thereof, than your <hi>notion of a person</hi> will extend to. And <hi>if it can,</hi> whether it ought not to be represented (at least as possible) to give a less ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable ground to the Doctrines of the <hi>incarnation</hi> and <hi>satisfaction</hi> of the <hi>second Person,</hi> in order whereto it seems to me highly requisite. This was that I really intended, and not the vindicating the Sentiments of <hi>that Author,</hi> which you might observe that letter animadverts upon. The Scripture seems to allow a greater latitude, by the ground it gives us to apprehend <hi>three hypostases;</hi> which so much differ from the notion you give of <hi>persons,</hi> that one <hi>hypostasis</hi> may sustain three such <hi>persons</hi> as you describe. The
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56066:68"/>
only thing that seems to straiten us in this matter, is the usual Doctrine of the <hi>Schools</hi> about the <hi>divine simplicity.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I greatly coveted to have had your thoughts engag'd in sifting and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that Doctrine; so far as to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether there be really any thing in it, cogent and demonstrable that will be repugnant to what is overtur'd in that Letter. And I the rather desir'd more room might be gained in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, apprehending the <hi>Unitarians</hi> (as they more lately affect to call themselves) might, upon the whole, think you more <hi>theirs,</hi> than <hi>ours;</hi> and while they agree with you concerning the possibility of such a Trinity as you assert, may judge their advantage against the other men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Doctrines, no less than it was.</p>
                  <p>My desiring that letter of mine might not be printed, was most agreeable to what I intended in writing it; that was, only to suggest to you somewhat (very loosly) that I reckon'd you more capable than any man I knew, to cultivate, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:56066:69"/>
to the great service of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Christian Cause.</hi> And that you might seem to say, what you might, upon your own search, find safe and fit to be said, <hi>as meerly from your self,</hi> without taking notice that occasion was given you <hi>by any such Letter at all.</hi> Had I design'd it for publick view, it should have been writ with more Care, and with more (expressed) Respect to you. But if upon the whole, you judge there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it considerable to the purposes it mentions, my further request is, you will please rather to suppress that part of your Letter which concerns it (for which I suppose there is yet opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) and take no notice any such letter came to your hands.
