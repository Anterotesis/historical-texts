            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What was thus by his Lordſhip deſigned in all juſtice, was by an intire lover of peace and truth publiſhed in all charity, to reſiſt and check a threatning tempeſt, which riſing from out preſent evils, was apt (if it did not begin) to ſhake ſome. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this Tract preſently provoked an Aſſertor of that <hi>Infallibility,</hi> to take upon him the <hi>anſwering</hi> of it, and to complaine that an <hi>Anſwer</hi> which had been by the ſame hand given it formerly, was not permitted to attend it into publick. This then being a <hi>ſecond Care,</hi> was probably to have arrived to a higher degree of <hi>perfection,</hi> and indeed among the Favourers of that pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was cried up for ſo ſatisfactory a piece, that it was delivered to a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as unanſwerable. From him it came to thoſe hands, which returned it to the Authour with this enſuing Rejoynder, withall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating, that ſince in his, he ſeemed to wiſh the ſame freedome of the <hi>Preſſe,</hi> which his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> had found, both the Anſwer and the Reply ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended thither, if he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>After he had detained the Reply ſome weeks, he was pleaſed to returne it with a proteſtation, That he neither intended, nor would permit his to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come publicke, <hi>pretending</hi> (that I may give you his owne words) <hi>his Treatiſe to have been no finiſh'd worke, but onely a firſt draught, or inchoation, ventured abroad, to explore the judgements op one of two intelligent Adverſaries, that ſo the Authour by his ſecond</hi> (he might have ſaid third) <hi>thoughts, might be better able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what was to be altered in it, what added or what taken a way, either as ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, or offenſive, and till that act was done, and withall till an approbation and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe given by thoſe, to whom it belonged, neither the worke, nor any line of it, is to be acknowledged or vouched by the Authour.</hi> And ſo both were returned with ſome few alterations and additions in his Anſwer, and marginall Notes on the Reply, and one ſheet at the end of them, containing a new Scheme of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, of the pretended <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and a <hi>preloquium</hi> to it, wherein the paſſage juſt now mentioned, is <hi>interminis</hi> recited.</p>
            <p>This the Replicant (to avoid all appearance of ſeverity) was content to accept for ſad earneſt, and therefore freely expreſt his willigneſſe to give the Authour leave to provide a new Anſwer to his Lordſhips-Treatiſe, which he might be willing to owne in publicke, which when he ſhould doe, promiſe was made to prepare a ſpeedy Anſwer thereunto, and on thoſe termes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to lay aſide the former.</p>
            <p>That this ſhould be done, was affirmed on one part, and on the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſome months with patience, till at length the Anſwerers pleaſure was made knowne, that that reſolution was put off, and that in ſtead of ſo meane a combat either with his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> or this <hi>Replicant,</hi> he was pleaſed now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne a full diſcourſe on that Subject, without taking notice of either, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than he ſhould thinke fit to take in his way any thing by them objected againſt his <hi>poſition,</hi> and that this ſhould be printed beyond the <hi>Seas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this will be performed I cannot tell. Onely this is now diſcerned (ſomewhat contrary to expectation) that what hath been diſclaimed by him, is extolled by others, and the weakneſſe of the <hi>Replicant</hi> ſufficiently deſpiſed;
<pb facs="tcp:55236:3"/>
Wherein though he hath not much temptation to thinke himſelf injured, being ready to acknowledge the emptyneſſe of theſe Papers (and more then ſo, to render a reaſon of it, <hi>viz:</hi> the fate which they were under, by a neceſſity of attending this <hi>Apologiſt</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which yeilded them occaſion of little varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, unleſſe they would extravagate.) Yet could he not reſiſt the Reaſons which charged it on him as a <hi>duty,</hi> thus confidently to importune the Reader with the view of the whole matter, as farre as it hath paſt between them; ſetting downe that <hi>Anſwer</hi> to, and this <hi>Vindication</hi> of his <hi>Lordſhips</hi> Arguments by Chapters, and then (not doe him the leaſt injuſtice) adding in the end of all, the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerers</hi> marginall <hi>Replyes,</hi> and that concluding Sheet (that even now was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) with a Rejoynder to that alſo.</p>
            <p>By all this, endeavouring to lay grounds, for all men to judge, how little truth there is in that ſo <hi>Epidemicall</hi> perſwaſion, that there is no middle, betwixt aſſerting an <hi>Infallible Judge,</hi> and the falling headlong into all the <hi>Schiſmes,</hi> and <hi>Haereſies</hi> of this preſent age.</p>
            <p>My Conſcience aſſuring me, that the grounds on which the <hi>eſtabliſh'd Church of England</hi> is founded, are of ſo rare an excellent mixture, that as none but intelligent truely Chriſtian minds can ſufficiently value the compoſition, ſo there is no other in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo likely to preſerve <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> if what prudent Lawes had ſo long agoe deſigned, they now were able to uphold; For want of which and which onely it is, that at preſent the whole Fabricke lyes polluted in confuſion and in blood, and hopes not for any binding up of wounds, for reſtauration of any thing, that lookes like Chriſtian, till the faith of the reformed Engliſh have the happineſſe to be weighed prudently, and the <hi>military</hi> Sword being timely ſheathed, the Power and Lawes of Peace be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into thoſe hands, which are ordained by GOD the Defenders of it.</p>

The reaſon of this aſſertion, is, That <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Canterbury</hi> are but ſmall, and onely materiall portions of either Church, and therefore no way ſufficient to give a denomination to the whole. As then the Church of <hi>England</hi> is wrongfully called the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> ſo, in like manner is the Church Catholique wrongfully ſtiled the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or as ſuch, controverted to be fallible, or infallible, foraſmuch as this perfection of being infallible is not claimed by her as ſhe is Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but as ſhe is the Catholique, and, according to the appointment of Chriſt, governed by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and his ſucceſſours. For this cauſe we have altered the title, and ſtated the queſtion in tearmes more proper and formall, enquiring not Whether the Roman Church, but whether the Catholique be infallible, and this ought to be the title.</p>

time <hi>Chillingworths</hi> Booke began to be in moulding, and it may be that ſame new labour diverted the Enquirer, and altered his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne. Now at length in a time moſt unſeaſonable, by the frivolous officiouſneſſe of I know not whom, theſe old papers are forced to ſee the light, and to leave their anſwer behind them. After ſo meane and creeping a faſhion doe they appeare now unto the world. But although no notice hath been taken of any anſwer made already, or of giving licence for any other to be made hereafter, or, if made to be publiſhed in print, and have the advantage to be diſperſed abroad in many copies; yet are we not by this diſcouraged from compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing one, for, though for want of the Printers helpe, it ſhall lye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, and in much reſtraint, yea and be in danger to periſh, as the other did before it, yet may this ſmall labour fall, at leaſt, into ſome few hands, and remove out of their way ſuch dangerous ſtumbling blockes as have beene caſt into it by this Enquirer, who, by his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of doubts, about the method of reſolving faith, hath thereby, amongst all thoſe who are not much verſed therein, endangered the ſtability and ſafety of the whole fabrique, not of Catholique Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion onely, but of Chriſtian in Generall.</p>

Now true reaſon or authority is a way quite different from pretended, and much better then it, and therefore the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers charge is falſe, or, at leaſt, light and ineffectuall. Muſt all controverſies in Philoſophy be undecidable, becauſe both ſides pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend reaſon; or no ſuits of Law be judged, becauſe both ſides pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Law? Certainly, whatſoever both ſides doe pretend, yet there is but one ſide that hath it, as namely, but one ſide of Philoſophers have true reaſon, and but one ſide of contendents have true Law, and ſo in like manner but one ſide of contending Chriſtians have true reaſon for them, Scripture, or Tradition, howſoever both may pretend it, and therefore we doe not goe about to prove the Church is infallible by the ſelfe ſame wayes that you goe about to prove that ſhe hath erred, but by wayes that are quite different from them, and the ſame but in name onely, and no farther; By which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that, either you are deceived, or we, and it is not neceſſary that both.

Laſtly, the Fathers be aſſured and undoubted witneſſes of the Doctrines which were held in their time, though not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted definers of them.

Now he that takes an unſure way, which no reaſon or diſcretion commends unto him, and leaves the ſure, which Reaſon does perſwade him to be ſuch, if that man chance to erre, it is eaſie to underſtand why God ſhould be more offended with him, then with others that doe not ſo but hold a prudent and contrary courſe.</p>

               <p>The anſwer is, that people illiterate may have evidence ſufficient whereby to reſolve and ſatisfie themſelves without making any ſearch into Hiſtories, Fathers, or Scripture; and therefore this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers ſuppoſition is falſe, and indeed it were a hard caſe, if no man might be able to underſtand what he was to beleive, without looking into all theſe; and yet as hard as it is, doth this Enquirer impoſe it upon all, if not in expreſſe tearmes, yet by the conſequence of his doctrine. As for our ſelves alone, what need can we have for ſeeking out the true ſence of Scripture, and a conformity of doctrine with the Ancient, more then other Chriſtians have? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to this method of his, all true religion, whether in our Church, or any other, would be impoſſible to be learned by the illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and very hardly by any other men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:55236:24"/>But what evidence can the illiterate have, or rather from whence? Out of the preſent face, condition, and viſible practice of religion in the Church, out of the antient monuments yet remaining that give in their depoſitions, out of common fame and unſuſpected teſtimonies, out of the manifeſt perfections and excellencies both of the Church and Religion; out of all which, as from ſo many cleare ſignatures and characteriſmes of truth, ariſeth an evidence of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility that this Church and this Religion are the true, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is once ſo creditable, cannot poſſibly be falſe, becauſe for the verity of that, the veracity of God doth ſtand engaged, as <hi>Ric. Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorinus</hi> hath long ſince declared. For it is a cleare caſe that all ſuch things be true which God makes evidently credible and worthy of acceptance by the publique acts of his owne providence; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that providence ſhould publiquely entangle and deceive us by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging us, or, at leaſt, publiquely and potently inducing and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us to believe that which were falſe; and ſo by following that way which God hath ſigned out for us, we ſhould goe aſtray; which thing can neither be done, nor yet permitted to be done, without impoſture, as all the antient Schoolemen doe obſerve. By this meanes then are prudent publique motives able to make a certainty, though not by their owne vertue, yet at leaſt by the vertue of the Supreame vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which goes annexed with them.</p>
               <p>Moreover, this meaſure of evidence perceptible by the illiterate and weake, though it be not ſo ample as others have, or ſtand in need to have, yet is it ſufficient to ſway their underſtanding, and to call in the divine aſſiſtance for the ſupplying of whatſoever by reaſon of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or incapacity,<note place="margin">Prov. 3.32.</note> is wanting in them. <hi>Cum ſimplicibus eſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocinatio mea</hi>? ſaith the Wiſeman. Therefore it is falſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to ſay, as this Enquirer ſeemes to doe; namely, That ſuch men as theſe doe aſſent to truth upon no better grounds then others doe to falſhood.</p>
               <p>The Enquirer's inference againſt the Church is this. We thinke ſhe hath erred, therefore ſhe may: The Inference is good, but the Antecedent is infirme, and ought not to have beene made, becauſe he cannot have ſo great reaſon to judge ſhe hath erred, as on the contrary that ſhe hath not; in regard that it is farre more likely he himſelfe erred in making that judgement of the Church, then that the Church erred in making that judgement of the truth, or that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55236:24"/>
ſhe hath contradicted her ſelfe; it being farre more probable, that a private man ſhould be deceived, then a whole Church. Wherefore it is a great act of preſumption and temerity in any ſingle man, though never ſo intelligent, to judge the whole Church hath erred, rather then himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The Enquirer ſaith, that he tries the Church by her conformity with the Antients, as ſhe her ſelfe appoints. But what then? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhe is not that way to be c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nvinced, foraſmuch as every intelligent man will ſuppoſe that no particular man is able to examine that ſo well at ſhe her ſelfe hath done before him, and therefore may be pleaſed to underſtand that this pretended non-conformity of hers ought to be diſcovered very clearly and perfectly before he adventure to condemne her; and this great diſcovery having yet not beene made and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to the world, may juſtly be thought an act impoſſible, and be judged in ſuch as make pretenſions of it, a worke rather of a ſtrong apprehenſion, then of any ſolid judgement. If then our Enquirer in this caſe ſhould be rejected, let him not complaine of us, as if we ſent him to a witneſſe, and after bid him not believe it, but rather bid him not believe himſelfe, and his owne judgement more then the Churches; that is to ſay, more then he ought; nor ſuffer himſelfe to be miſled by the teſtimony of a witneſſe to whom we did not ſend him, I meane him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in hearkning unto whom ſelf-love too much inclines him, and made him over credulous, as to their great griefe it hath made very man.</p>
               <p>Now for the better underſtanding this point of conformity with the Antients, of which this Enquirer, and <hi>Chillingworth</hi> his confederate doe talke ſo much, and ſeeke to urge againſt us; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may pleaſe to know, that they themſelves are bound to ſolve this knot, as well as we; for it will be both as neceſſary and as hard for them to finde out the conformity of their doctrines with the Antients, as it is for us to finde out ours; and againe, the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of this moderne Scripture with the Antient; and theſe preſent copies of the Greeke and Hebrew with the Originall, or Archetype of the ſame languages, as it is to finde out a conformity of this Church and her Doctrines with the Antients; and ſo theſe Authors have made a rodde wherewith to whip themſelves, as commonly wrangling people doe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That there be other notes of truth beſides this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55236:25"/>
and therefore the enquiry after it is not neceſſary for any man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That we may know this conformity by the truth a great deale eaſier, than the truth by conformity; becauſe truth may be knowne by the preſent notes, and ſuch as are before our eyes; but conformity muſt a great way off, and through a thick miſt of many Ages, if it be ſought after by examination of particulars.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the enquiry after conformity by examining the Antient rites, and the innumerable darke paſſages and deciſions of Antiquity cannot be a generall method for the inſtruction of all, or of the greater part of Men; for it is a long buſineſſe, and ſo cannot be ready at all times, but rather after divers years: it is alſo ſo difficult, that few have learning or ability to go through with it; for the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Antiquity be very intricate, and require a great light of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding for their diſcovery. You ſee the Enquirer, <hi>Sect. 37.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth he was much vext with the harſh Greek of <hi>Evagrius,</hi> and the hard Latine of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and with diſtinguiſhing between different ſences, and various lections, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If this learned Gentleman found ſo much difficulty in the ſearch; what muſt become of the greater part of Men, if there were no way but this? for in compariſon of the reſt, few have ſo much wit as he, or ſo much leiſure; few underſtand Greek or Latine either, whether harſh or pleaſant, few ſo painfull. Muſt no man that is not acquainted with <hi>Evagrius</hi> or <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> come to the knowledge of the truth? nor any man be able to know the Creation of the World, and the Old law, without he can read in Hebrew, or learn the New law without reading the New Teſtament in Greek? Theſe were very hard conditions, and certainly ſuch at God never impoſed upon us.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe we are not obliged to find out the Originall Copies of Scriptures and Fathers, of which ſort, as I ſuppoſe, there be none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, nor trouble our ſpirits with judging about various lections; we are not bound to impoſſibilities for our inſtruction and ſalvation, but have a ready way aſſigned us, which is the conſpicuous body of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church, which body is like a City built upon a hill, and that hill is a rock not to be undermined.</p>
               <p>It will be therefore ſufficient that we can any ſure way come to the knowledge of the truth without taking care whether it be conforme unto the Ancients or no; for ſure we are, all truth is conforme to that it ſhould be, abſtracting from the conſideration either of Antient or
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55236:25"/>
New, and this alone may be ſufficient to content any Man.</p>
               <p>Yet if he would know conformity, I will ſhew him a readier way than examination of places; let him but take the voluntary confeſſion of the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> in their ſeverall Centuries, and he need ſeek no further; for they acknowledge all that we deſire, and this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of theirs cannot but ſatisfie, for they make it neither out of ignorance of the truth, nor out of affection to us.</p>

               <p>Out of that which hitherto hath beene ſaid, it appeares plainly how the concluſion which the Enquirer would inferre in this fifth Section, is no way applicable to our manner of probation of the Churches Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility: for we doe not, as he ſurmiſeth, maintaine that our Church the Guide of Faith, is to be knowne by ſuch markes by which the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant cannot ſeeke it, and the Learned may chance to miſſe, although with all diligence and without prejudice they enquire after it; for we affirme that our firſt principles of probation are certaine and manifeſt, and out of them, we with certainty, though not with evidence, evict the Church. By which manner of proceeding it is cleare, that our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations are Logicall and conformable to the rules preſcribed for the hunting out of truth by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Analytiques, and the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers in generall.</p>
               <p>Some peradventure will deny our Churches verity to be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently credible: If any doe it, the matter muſt be remitted to an equall triall betweene us.

               <p>It may be further replied, that theſe principles of ours are alſo queſtion'd. Admit they be, yet nevertheleſſe may they be certaine and evident, otherwiſe we ſhould grant nothing to be certaine; for there is no one thing ſo evident, which is not queſtion'd by ſome or other.</p>

               <p>He maintaines here a ſtrange paradox, and one very improbable, namely, that to define any thing of new, is to beſtow upon the Devill one path more for us to walke in towards him. If you aske why, he tells you, becauſe, before the definition made, it was lawfull to hold either ſide, but after, it is damnable. Belike then with this Author the manifeſtation of divine truths is the high way to damnation; but I ſuppoſe few men are of his minde. Certainly moſt are of opinion, that every ſuch verity we learne, had rather beene a new ſteppe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, becauſe knowledge of things divine doe enable men for the attaining of ſalvation; and therefore the Apoſtles by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing our underſtandings in them, ſhewed the world ſo many more paths to Heaven. It may be indeed that by accident minds blowne up with ſelfe-conceit, may by their reſiſting ſuch revealed truths, take an occaſion to tranſgreſſe, but that is their owne faults, not the fault of them that teach, or of the verities that are declared, and therefore this cavill of the Enquirers againſt the definitions of Councels was very frivolous.

at this time, I muſt adde, that in ſuch deciſions of Councels, the worth of the matter, and inconvenience of leaving it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided, are the maine things worth conſidering; and ſo it is poſſible that the deciſion may be ſuch, that it may tend, Firſt, to ſome publique end, whether the clearing of obſcure Scripture, or the recovering of ſome venerable and uſefull practice, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church. Secondly, to the ſetling and eſtabliſhing of peace, by interpoſing ſuch a judgement which may probably ſway with both pretenders; And in theſe, and the like caſes, the advantages being ſo intrinſecall to the deciſion, and withall ſo great, the inconvenience mentioned by his Lordſhip ought not to prevaile to the diſparaging of Councels, becauſe though it be an inconvenience, yet is it over-weighed with other convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and therefore the argument I confeſſe is not infinitely or unlimitedly true.</p>

Againe, theſe we hold to be infallible, becauſe they are the <hi>Compendium</hi> and quinteſſence of the Church, and the body repreſentative thereof, as a King and the three States be of the whole Kingdome.</p>
               <p>The cauſe of Pope <hi>John</hi> the <hi>22.</hi> is cleared ſufficiently by <hi>Ciacconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in his life, by <hi>Caeffeteau</hi> in his learned anſwer to <hi>Pleſſye's</hi> iniquity, and by many others, and therefore needs not be argued any more. I grant it a point of faith that the ſoules of the juſt ſhall ſee God before the laſt judgement, and doe deny that this doctrine was generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted at any time. Nevertheleſſe I doe not know it to be of faith that all of them ſhall enjoy the ſame viſion before that great day, and that none of them ſhall be detained in ſecret receptacles, as the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents hold, till they, together with their bodies, ſhall be compleatly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the great fire of the worlds conflagration, as I have treated elſewhere.</p>
               <p>It was not needfull that Councels ſhould define in tearmes their owne immunity from errour, becauſe a Councell both in ſubſtance and ſemblance is the Church, who needs not define her owne infallibility, and therefore needs not, becauſe that ſame is to be preſuppoſed to all her definitions as a thing knowne without them, before hand; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſhe would not be believed in any of them at all, either touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelfe, or any other matter. Nevertheleſſe though this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not in tearmes, yet it is virtually done, and <hi>in actu exercito,</hi> as often as a Councell defineth any thing, by the pronouncing of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi> againſt ſuch as doe not ſubmit, and counting them as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques; It is done againe in the uſing continually this old forme, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum eſt Spiritui Sancto &amp; nobis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For a concluſion I demand of theſe eager impugners both of Church
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55236:40"/>
and Councels, what thing it it muſt regulate our beliefe, and keepe us in diſcipline and unity; for if they let all men looſe upon themſelves, and make all men Judges in the Court of faith, as they, <hi>de facto,</hi> doe, controverſies will multiply apace, and no meanes left to reconcile them; and while all men have authority of deciding, no man hath it. Reaſon alwaies did teach us, that confuſion would be the effect of this new li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; yet could we never underſtand it, till that now coſtly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the miſtris of the improvident, hath laid it open before our eies. And now at length we ſmart for our leaving the venerable decrees and definitions of Church a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>erne the true cauſes of all theſe evils. The daily growing up of new and new devices in ſtead of the old faith, and the continuall diſcords and diſſentions thereupon enſuing, evict un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably the weakneſſe and inaptitude of the rule of faith, and our young and preſuming wits way ſee how farre ſhort they come of their forefathers wiſedome, and how much more unhappy then thoſe who were governed by Church and Councels.</p>

and this is ſought to be perſwaded and made good, by ſundry intricate diſcourſes, all which I willingly doe pretermit, and onely ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that they all fall wide of the marke; for, in a word, our anſwer to them is, that private men ſtand in no need at all of having any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular information of them, but, that it is ſufficient for them if they doe learne what is the common doctrine of the preſent Church, without looking any higher to the Primitive and elder times: becauſe this doctrine now taught is credible and perſwaſive enough for ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any wiſe mans underſtanding, and the ſetling of his judgement upon it: as for example, it is ſufficient for any man deſirous of knowing which is the River <hi>Thames,</hi> to ſee it at <hi>Graveſend</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any laborious aſcending by it higher and higher, and tracing the ſhoares thereof, till he come unto the springs; and more then this would not be needfull for the diſtinguiſhing of it from <hi>Severne,</hi> or <hi>Trent,</hi> or any other River. For if this kinde of aſſurance might not be ſufficient, then certainly few or none could ever have come to know which water was the famous River <hi>Nilus,</hi> of which few have ever ſeene the springs, and which, as it is very likely, doe lye conceal'd in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and wholly undiſcovered even to this day.</p>
               <p>Againſt the poſſibility of ſearching out traditions Apoſtolicall, and diſcerning them from others that be spurious and falſe, his principall inſtance, and that in which he moſt confides, is the doctrine of the Chiliaſts or Millenaries; and the ſame example is vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently preſſed and repeated often by his Friend <hi>Chillingworth.</hi> The ſubſtance of all they ſay conſiſts in this, namely, that their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, although now generally received to be erroneous, was received in the firſt <hi>200.</hi> yeares with one conſent, as a tradition Apoſtolicall. For making of this charge good, they both of them doe jointly alleadge Saint <hi>Juſtin</hi> as their witneſſe. But that we may judge moſt favourably of this their allegation, we needs muſt tell them they are mistaken groſſely, for Saint <hi>Juſtin</hi> speaking there of three ſeverall ſorts of Chriſtians which were in his time, affirmes, that of thoſe three but one of them held the doctrine of the Chiliaſts:<note place="margin">Juſtin in Dial. cum Tryphone.</note> The firſt of theſe three ſorts was, as he deſcribeth, <gap reason="foreign">

beliefe, for ſo he expreſſely ſtileth them; the third and laſt ſort were ſuch as denied the reſurrection, and were therefore cenſured by him to be Chriſtians rather in name then in reality, and juſtly to be compared with the Sadduces amongst the Jewes. Thoſe of the firſt ſort he telleth did hold the doctrine of the thouſand yeares. The ſecond ſort, as he expreſſely witneſſeth, although they were ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and good, yet did not hold that doctrine. Thoſe of the third ſort, as he ſaith, were Chriſtians, but feignedly, and in name alone, and reſembling the Sadduces, yet not for their denying the errour of the thouſand yeares, for what relation could that have unto the <hi>Sadduces?</hi> But, contrariwiſe, for their denying the reſurrection, as the <hi>Sadduces</hi> did, and all this appeares clearly, within the compaſſe of a few lines, in the Greeke text of Saint <hi>Juſtine;</hi> Beſides, if all at that time had beene perſwaded of the truth of the <hi>Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> fancy, what needed Saint <hi>Ireneus</hi> have laboured ſo much, as he did, and spent ſo many Chapters in the proving of it? This being ſo, it appeares as plainly that the Enquirer and alſo his Partner Master <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> were both of them deceived in ſeeking to father upon Saint <hi>Juſtin,</hi> that all Orthodoxall Believers of his time received the doctrine of the <hi>Chiliaſts,</hi> and that ſuch as did not, were held as <hi>Sadduces,</hi> or Heretiques; for, in the Text of <hi>Juſtin,</hi> there is no ſuch matter, but rather the quite contrary to it, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare fully by the Text it ſelfe, and partly by the words before reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of him; for, without all doubt, Saint <hi>Juſtines many of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pure judgement or beliefe, and were no Chiliaſts,</hi> muſt needs be Orthodox, and could not be Heretiques, nor as the Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces amongst the Jewes, unleſſe we will ſay that with one breath, he called them by both contrary names. Againe, if, as theſe men ſay, all the whole Church were Chiliaſts during the firſt, ſecond or third hundred yeares, how could or durſt <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> have oppoſed them, either without forcing his owne Conſcience, or incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the blame of Hereſy? Now, it is certaine he was not counted an Heretique; and againe, very unlikely he would ſtraine his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by oppoſing any doctrine, received as orthodoxall by the whole Church. Againe, it is probable Saint <hi>Dionyſe</hi> the Areopagite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that doctrine, therefore it cannot be certaine, that during the firſt <hi>200.</hi> yeares, it was not oppoſed: that Saint <hi>Dionyſe</hi> did it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the workes now extant bearing his name; and, that theſe works
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55236:44"/>
be his, is very probable, firſt, becauſe they are received for ſuch by the major part, both of the Westerne and the Easterne Church; ſecondly, becauſe they were cited for his a thouſand yeares agoe, and numbred amongst the rest of the Fathers antient and undoubted Monuments, by an intelligent Author, Philoponus, <hi>l. 2. de Operib. Creat. c. 21. &amp; l. 3. c. 9. &amp; 13.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of the pretended tradition of the <hi>Quarto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decimanes</hi> touching the celebration of Easter after the manner of the Jewes, which was wholly rejected and forbidden in the firſt <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Councell, and before that time oppoſed by many, and principally by Pope <hi>Victor,</hi> who, as <hi>Ciacconius</hi> conceives, did not cut <hi>Polycrates</hi> and his Aſſociates from the body of the whole Church, but only threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, or, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſeemes to ſay, did doe it, but, yet at the inſtance of Saint <hi>Ireneus,</hi> and ſome others, if he had once paſt it, did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the cenſure againſt them, but let it fall; and, that it was ſo, is very probable, becauſe there is no memory made how the ſentence was received, whether with obedience, or otherwiſe; which particular, doubtleſſe, would never have beene omitted by Hiſtorians, no more then the ſentence it ſelfe, or the intention of it was, if there had beene any thing to regiſter; and beſides, becauſe we finde not by any record, but that all proceeded with thoſe Aſian Churches, as formerly it had done, without any note or alteration. And, by this, is ſolved all that <hi>Chillingworth</hi> with ſo much animoſity, objecteth againſt the learned Cardinall <hi>Perone.</hi>

               <p>The Enquirer ſeemes to be troubled not a little, becauſe we will not ſay with him, that men may be ſaved in a falſe religion, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we doe not thinke our religion falſe, or any other religion true beſides our owne; and in the ſame veine <hi>Chillingworth</hi> his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatour runnes very fluently, and upon this ill ſounding ſtring is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping continually. Yet for all this harping, it will not be eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what offence againſt Charity it can be for us to judge, either that Chriſtianity alone is the ſaving religion, or that our religion is the onely true Chriſtianity. For ſay we ſhould be deceived in making this judgement, yet this ſame at the moſt can be but a want in our ſelves of right underſtanding, and not any breach of charity towards others, or any matter of exclamation, as ſome frivolous men of late have made it. Wherefore, if we will ſtate the queſtion rightly, we are not to enquire whether we want charity in holding that none but Catholickes and true Chriſtians can be ſaved, or in our holding that we onely are of that ſort; or againe, whether our adverſaries for their accuſing us, want not wit and charity together, or at leaſt one of them; but the queſtion betweene us ought to be, whether there be more ſaving religions then one? or whether ours be not that one? and this is the old controverſy in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others, and may be diſputed without any anger, or without diſguiſing, or multiplying of controverſies on ſet purpoſe, done by theſe Novelliſts, as it ſeemes, for making more buſineſſe then needed, or cauſing more diſtaſt and alienation then was before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:55236:49"/>The Enquirer is much diſpleaſed with us for damning, as he cals it, all that are not of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But for pacifying of his angry ſpirit, I demand of any for him, what ſinne he thinkes it in us to judge that all who die out of the Church of God, die in an evill ſtate; or what other, to thinke that our Catholique Church, which he diminitively cals the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is the only Church of God. Let him ſatisfie me in this, and I will eaſily ſatisfie him in the other. In the meane time we are not nice to declare, That there is but one ſaving Religion. That there is but one true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and that one is the ſaving religion. That there is but one Catholicke Church, and that this one Church is, by the inſtitution of Chriſt, and according to the conſent of antiquity, to be governed by the See Apoſtolique, and by the Succeſſour of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> as chiefe Paſtour and Preſident of the reſt. Now what hurt is there in all this, or what want of Chriſtian charity? It is not unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to ſay that ſome offenders ſhall be damned, and if any, then why not thoſe who are truly and really Sestaries and men obſtinate, for it is like that they deſerve it as well as any. There wanted not one of this Enquirers confraternity, who fancied ſometimes to himſelfe, that all the damnation that was to fall upon the wicked, was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation of them and extinction, and not a perpetuity of torments; which conceit is ſo charitable, that it exceeds the charity even of God himſelfe, and controules his revelations made to the contrary in the Holy Scripture, and condemnes them as guilty of too much rigour and ſeverity, and therefore no marvaile though we poore mortals cannot eſcape their cenſure.</p>
               <p>But now, leſt any man ſhould thinke our doctrine to be harſh and rigorous, he may pleaſe to be inform'd, that we doe not hold every man for a Pagan and an Infidell who embraces Paganiſme, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo many of them as be guilty of their errour through affected, or culpable ignorance; which defect though it be a formall ignorance of the truth, yet it is a virtuall knowledge of their errour, and an interpretative rejection of the truth, and alſo a reſiſtance to God and his divine veracity, manifeſted in his revelations; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all theſe, whether Pagans os Heretiques, be hainous offenders, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is to ſay, judged and condemned by their owne conſciences, of which doctrine it ſeemes both this Enquirer, and after him his ſecond Maſter <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> were ignorant,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55236:50"/>
by their inſinuating that no man is an Heretique, or ſelfe-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but onely ſuch as adhere to a doctrine which he formally knowes to be erroneous, that is to ſay, onely ſuch as doe that which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be done; which concluſion is a covert affirmation that there be no Heretiques at all, nor can be any; and ſo all is ſafe, whether ſound or no.</p>
               <p>In like manner we doe not hold to be an Heretique, or to be out of the Catholique Church every one who embraces an hereſy, but ſuch a number of them onely as doe it with an obſtinate mind, and without preparation to be reformed, or to hearken unto reaſon when it is told them. By which doctrine it appeares, that we are not ſo ſtrict as we may ſeeme, nor yet ſo large as ſome would have us. For on the one ſide, we doe not maintaine that Heretiques can be ſaved, or that hereſy is not a deadly or damnable ſinne, as ſome Socinians and other Libertines would have us thinke; And on the other ſide, we dilate the ſpaces of the Church Catholique farther then every body conceives we doe, and by that meanes comprehend within it many that in the eye of the world, ſeeme aliens unto it; ſo that our charity is not irregular in judging Heretiques to be in good ſtate, but it is rather in concluding that very many are not Heretiques really and interiourly, though outwardly they ſeeme to be. And thus you ſee we doe not cry all men downe to hell, not yet any more then we are compelled to doe by the doctrine delivered to us about that point in Holy Scripture.</p>
               <p>After this damning and firing men in the other world, of which the Enquirer hath wrongfully accus'd us, he proceedeth to blame us for ſending Heretiques to the fire in this, and therefore ſaith that he beleives that throughout antiquity we ſhall not finde the putting to death of any (for religion) but onely of ſuch as began to kill firſt.</p>
               <p>This provocation to antiquity, howſoever the matter be, can be of no force, unleſſe antiquity did condemne that practice as unlawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe antiquity did not all it might doe, but left divers things for poſterity to adde as it ſhould ſee expedient.</p>
               <p>Beſides foraſmuch as concernes puniſhment of impious men and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novatours both by death and other wayes, if the Authour had lookt better into antiquity, he could not but have beleived otherwiſe, as our Authours doe ſhew at large; for it is cleare that amongst the Jewes in was the practice to puniſh impious people very ſeverely, and all ſuch
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55236:50"/>
as with new doctrines ſought to infect others, puniſhing according to the preſcript of <hi>Moyſes</hi> law, ſome with death, other ſome by other temporall puniſhments.</p>
               <p>The Canon law alſo and the Imperiall decree the ſame, to all which the practice of the Church accords; and laſtly, reaſon her ſelfe, and the common rules of equity and justice doe permit, yea and preſcribe the ſame: and theſe ſuffrages are ſo powerfull and prevailing, as they ſuffice, not onely for the juſtification of the Churches preſent practice, but alſo for the condemnation of high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and arrogance of all who ſhould be ſo hardy as to impugne or queſtion it.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe this ſame practice of infliction of temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon offenders againſt religion, is not generall without any limitation or reſtraint, as ſome may imagine it to be, as if forſooth none of a different religion from ours could be exempted from them; but contrariwiſe it admits exception in many caſes, as we are about to declare preſently.</p>
               <p>Know therefore that whereſoever any Kingdome or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is ſetled in a juſt and a peaceable poſſeſſion of Catholique religion, without any notable commixture of contrary profeſſions, as for example, in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spaine,</hi> at this preſent. In this caſe it is no cruelty or rigour to inflict temporall puniſhments upon all ſuch as ſhall adventure to diſturbe that ſetled peace by introducing thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any new doctrines upon pretence of whatſoever reformation; and that this may be done ſtands with ſo much reaſon as cannot be probably contradicted. Neither is this courſe of ſeverity any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence unneceſſary, foraſmuch as vitious and over-weening ſpirits are moſt efficaciouſly repreſſed and withheld from evill by feare of temporall puniſhments in this life, becauſe their chiefe aime is at temporall contentments in the ſame, being moved more with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, then with thoſe other that are spirituall and to come, conſcience and religion having little influence into what they doe. <hi>In fine,</hi> they are governed more with ſence then reaſon, with ſtripes then with Philoſophy, inſomuch, that neither the ſchooles of Philoſophers, nor the Temples of God, can worke halfe ſo much with theſe wormes of the earth, as temporall tribunals can. Now though the enemy be never ſo deſpicable, is he therefore to be neglected becauſe the meaneſt Seducer may doe miſchiefe, as we finde by the effects of

the Tubmen; and againe, becauſe the groſſeſt errours, if they tend to liberty, or be but new, may be perſwaded to the multitude, as, by the ſucceſſes of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> it is manifeſt; and the rather in this caſe of ours, becauſe we experience daily, that our people having been once poſſeſt, that the Religion of the See Apoſtolique, and of their own forefathers was ſuperſtition, they are eaſily perſwaded, that the farther they depart from that Religion, the more pure and reformed they ſhall be, and ſo will be forward to run blindly on, till they paſſe all the bounds of Chriſtianity, and reforme all to nothing; for with ſuch bewitched minds as theſe, every new nonſenſe will be more acceptable, and be received ſooner, then any old ſenſe, and this is the effects of thoſe raylings againſt Rome which they have heard continually out of the Pulpits now for ſo many yeers together, without any intermiſſion.</p>
               <p>But, although this courſe of ſeverity be neceſſary for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of diſturbances by innovation, yet nevertheleſſe it is not to be extended unto all that any where amongst us doe teach, or profeſſe erroneous doctrines, or Religions different from our own, but only againſt corruptors or invaders, that is to ſay, ſuch as break in by fraud or violence, and diſturbe the quiet of the Church. For, after ſuch time at the invaſion is paſt, and the invaders gone, and that they are ſucceeded by another generation, which is not guilty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any irruption, but, with whatſoever errour they are tainted, it is contracted by the vice of education from their Parents and other ſuch inſtructors, and withall doe behave themſelves peaceably, I ſay that againſt ſuch as theſe the Church doth not proceed, nor execute the ſeverity of the Lawes in force againſt Heretiques; of this ſort be at this day, the deſcendents of firſt Proteſtants in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whoſe ancestors that were the invaders lived about King <hi>Edward</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> Againſt theſe deſcendents the Church doth not preſſe the Canon Law, though againſt the former ſort it did, and had juſt cauſe given ſo to doe. Conformable to this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Proteſtant and Proteſtant, doe the Catholiques in France and Polonia ſuffer the Proteſtants to live with them, without moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to enjoy the liberties and Priviledges of the Kingdome, as formerly they had done in Auſtria, Stiria and Carinthia, till ſuch time at they became ſeditious, and conspired against thoſe who gave them freedome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:55236:51"/>But now let it be noted and borne in memory, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this gentle proceedings of Catholiques towards the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants after ſo many loſſes and injuries fuffer'd from them, the ſame Proteſtants being themſelves but juniors, and living by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, fall hotly upon perſecution of Catholiques whereſoever they grow to be the ſtronger ſide, and that alſo in moſt Provinces, after a very violent, mercileſſe, and deſperate manner, ſlay, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, robbe, baniſh, defame, in fine ſuffer Catholiques in no place where they are predominant, and this againſt all right and common equity. Which manner of proceeding I muſt tell the Inquirer, is much worſe and more unreaſonable then Turkiſh, for the Turkes though aliens, Barbarians and Conquerours, are ſenſible of the right the Chriſtians of their conquer'd Provinces have for the free exerciſe of their Religion, and therefore do not goe about to reſtraine them from it, but let them continue quietly in that right of theirs, and ſo they doe even to this day, to the great ſhame of Proteſtants and Puritans here in theſe Kingdomes, may it be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without offence, being, as all men ſee plainly exceeded in juſtice and civility by the Turkes.
Wherefore no marvaile that our Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is forced to confeſſe that <q>
                     <hi>Calvin</hi> is too blame in this point, and the Church of England a little, which is a little too much for, addeth he, <hi>Negare manifeſta non audeo, &amp; excuſare immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica non poſſum.</hi>
                  </q>
Sure this Inquirer came with very little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency to give his judgement here, when he ſaith, the Church of England is guilty but a little, I would know of him what is a great deale, if all that we have ſuffer'd from it be but a little. But it is well he would acknowledge thus much, for it is more then others have done, and more ingenuity appeares in him, then in them, and perhaps he would have ſaid more, if it might have beene well taken, though in confeſſing this little he inſinuates all. Doubtleſſe, no manner of proceeding can be more unworthy then for a latter generation to forget from whoſe Ioynes they came, and to become harſh and contumelious to their owne fore-fathers chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and perſecute them with all rigour, as if they were enemies and invaders, and aliens, onely for their honourable continuing in that faith which their Anceſtours did leave them and commended to them as chiefe inheritance in that faith, which hitherto they which aſſaile it have never beene able by any argument to prove
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55236:52"/>
it falſe; nor yet on the other ſide, to evict by any unanſwerable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration that their owne new faith was true. Wherefore ſince, if any have more right one then another for the exerciſe of their Religion in this Kingdome,it is we, and this right cannot be taken from us by any power under heaven, and againe were your reaſons never ſo good, yet you are not to ſchool us, or to be our Tutors, or to compell us unto change. Therefore the ſeverity that hath been uſed over us hath no warrant for it, no preſident or example, nothing wherewith to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it in the ſight of the World, or to juſtifie it in the ſight of God, but is every way abominable and foul, ſuch in fine as neither the Chriſtians uſed to the Pagans their predeceſſours, nor Catholiques to the deſcendents of the formoſt and invading Proteſtants, nor any civil man would offer to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If the Religion, ſaith the Inquirer, had alwayes remained the ſame, it would not be defended by wayes ſo contrary to thoſe by which it was propagated.</q>
But now what wayes are theſe? he means force and violence, and ſaying, <hi>To the fire with him,</hi> and <hi>To he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<q>You profeſſe, ſaith <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> c. <hi>2. §. 101.</hi> that it is lawfull for you to uſe violence and power whenſoever you can have it for the planting of your Doctrine, and extirpation of the contrary.</q>
Thus he, but becauſe he cites no Author for this ſo heinous an accuſation, we may juſtly ſuſpect that you your ſelves hold it lawfull for you to ſlander and calumniate for the defence of your own bad cauſe, and the overthrowing of the contrary whenſoever other means of doing it does faile you, as indeed it falls out continually. The ſame heavy charge he in foul tearmes reiterates, c. <hi>5. §. 96.</hi>
                  <q>You, ſaith he, teach plainly you may propagate Religion whenſoever you have power, by depoſing of Kings, and invaſion of Kingdomes, and think when you kill the adverſaries of it you doe God good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For clearing of us againſt this malitious charge, I call into the Court Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquine</hi> and all his with him in <hi>2.2.</hi> q. <hi>10.</hi> art. <hi>8.</hi> as witneſſes ſufficient to justifie our cauſe, and ſhew our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, even againſt the Devill himſelfe that great calumniator of our Brethren, and to them I adde <hi>Acoſta</hi> in his booke <hi>De procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa

Beſides though in ſome caſes we, as other profeſſions alſo doe, make uſe of penall Lawes wherewith to keep off invaders, and yet not for any interior preſervation or defence: In like ſort we ſeek, by the help of the ſword and force of Armes to keep the Turkes out of Chriſtendome, ſhall we all be blamed for doing ſo, or ſhall it be ſaid therefore, that we defend the Chriſtian Religion by Armes and violence, and by other meanes then it was propagated at the firſt? nothing leſſe, we uſe reaſons to perſwade and plant our faith, we uſe the like to defend it againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, Soci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ians, and all other Sects, how then is our Religion plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, propagated, or defended by violence? It is one thing to be fenced exteriorly and a farre off with Statutes of temporall ſeverity againſt invaders, which courſe is a thing expedient and avowed both by us and all, and it is another thing to defend it interiorly by the ſame meanes, that is to ſay, to juſtifie the right truth of Religion by them, and this we diſavow, neither doe we practice it any where, as it is moſt manifeſt.</p>
               <p>The Inquirer was very provident when he deſired that, in theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations of violence, no recrimination ſhould be uſed, for he muſt needs ſee there was more matter returnable, then either could be gratefull, or they could juſtifie, yet ſince he will needs talk of killing, and caſt the blame upon our ſide, he muſt be content if we make ſome reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the miſdemeanors of the Adverſary, as well as upon our own innocency. I deſire therefore, the intelligent reader to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this laſt age, the Catholiques have put to death more Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or half ſo many, as the Proteſtants of England have done Prieſts, who it is well known they have ſlaine and butchered with great bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſme and immanity.</p>
               <p>But ſetting aſide theſe heavy crimes of bloud deliberately ſhed, who is it have afflicted others more in their Estates and Fortunes, they, or we? and for proof of this, we will offer fair, let them reſtore all they have taken with a ſtrong hand from us in livelyhoods, both ſpirituall and temporall in all the Provinces of <hi>Europe,</hi> and we will reſtore all we have taken from them, and in that goe no farther then this Seventeenth age which is now paſſing, be it in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or in thoſe about it. It is well knowne that in all thoſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55236:53"/>
Provinces, where both Religions are profeſſed and live inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled, none be on the ſuffering hand but we, none perſecutes but they; and it is we who are the <hi>Aborigines,</hi> as I may ſo tearm us, and thereby have at much right for all indemnity as our Ancestours could divolve upon us.<note place="margin">Maſter <hi>Pym</hi> in the Parliament Houſe.</note> We are not inſenſible of the wrong we ſuffer daily by having it printed and pronounced in publique Aſſemblies, on purpoſe to countenance injuries, and to excite againſt us the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant multitude, that our religion it deſtructive of all others, and that amongst us it is a maine principle or maxime, that all other are to be invaded and deſtroyed by us, and this it affirmed confidently, though againſt all probability and experience. It cannot indeed be denyed but truth is deſtructive of falſhood by the owne power, as light is of darkneſſe, and one contrary of another, but for externall coaction or violence, we leave that to the Accuſers, and doe not owne it.</p>
               <p>By this it is not hard to make a judgement who have been the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachers, and who have propogated and maintained themſelves by violence, you, or we? And who are the deſtructive party and live by the ſpoiles and oppreſſion of others, let not thoſe who poſſeſſe other mens goods cry out of wrongs, or make any brags of just dealing, for neither of theſe can come well out of their mouthes.</p>
               <p>This Enquirer confeſſeth both ſides are in fault, but we in more, and for this aſſertion of his brings in ſome light ſophiſtry, becauſe forſooth Proteſtants hold that they may erre, but we maintaine we cannot, and ſo will be ſure never to mend. That Protestants may erre is granted him, and needs no other probation then experience, whereby we finde thy have filled all this Kingdome with diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and theſe diſſentions with civill warres, ſo that by this that you have erred, we know you may. But ſo frequent poſſibility of erring doth not extenuate but aggravate your crime. For if you may erre ſo foulely, how dare you undertake to tutour others? how preſcribe Lawes? with what face Perſecute? If your rule be ſo weak as it cannot containe you all in one body, but lets you diſperſe into multitude of Sects, and fall in pieces as now you doe; why doe you not forſake it and ſeeke a better for it, or elſe have none at all; if you can finde out a ſurer, why doe you not learne wit by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but wallow on ſtill in the ſame mire? If this Enquirer ſpeake ſo ill for his Clients, we will not entertaine him for our Advocate.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55236:53"/>
The Proteſtants ſide ſets downe for a rule of religion every ones pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate judgment in the interpretation of Scripture, and ſo doth Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> the diſciple of <hi>Volkelius.</hi> We doe all that, yet we doe not pleaſe them; nay more, we muſt be puniſhed by them for the reſult; what is this but to bid us doe a thing, and then puniſh us for doing it? Is not this extreame perverſity? certainly if the rule they give be a ſufficient warrant for their receding from the faith of their Anceſtours, and for their breaking off from the Church, and ſtanding in defiance of her, then doubtleſſe much more may it warrant us to continue on and to keep off from any new doctrines, either of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, or any other Innovatours whatſoever, and ſure this is great reaſon and cannot be gainſayed.</p>
               <p>Beſides if we were to yeild, to whom were it to be done? There is a world of diſtracted Sectaries now in this Kingdome, all ſprung from the ſame roll, or from the rule of faith which it common to you all, of which one ſort imagines there is no Papacy, and theſe were the firſt ring-leaders of all the rout; another, that there is no Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy; a third, that there is no Clergy, but that Lay-Elders is all in all, and muſt rule the roaſt; a fourth, that there is no Church nor Church-government at all, but that the Church is like a Schoole of Philoſophers, where every man may believe and doe what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes without being accountable to another, or any obligation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; and peradventure the Inquirer was one of this number together with his confederate M. <hi>Chillingworth;</hi> a fifth ſort that there is no Trinity; a ſixth that there is no Sacrament, or at leaſt none neceſſary, or effectuall. Is it not fit thinke you that theſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Chriſtians ſhould come and write Lawes to others, or puniſh any man for non-conformity? nothing more improbable. It is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to ſee D. <hi>Featly</hi> a Proteſtant, and <hi>Page</hi> a Puritan make Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Inquirer charges us that becauſe we pretend to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we have leſſe reaſon to preſcribe to others; but on the contrary, me thinkes we ſhould have more, for, as he who is really infallible is fitteſt to guide and governe others, ſo he that thinkes himſelfe to be, is at leaſt in his own judgement more fit than he that does not.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55236:54"/>
He addes that this pretence of infallibility makes us ſure never to mend, or as his Schollar <hi>Chillingworth</hi> ſpeaketh, makes us incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible. True if it were a meere pretended one, but that is not yet proved, either by him, or any, although he ſay here in this <hi>28.</hi> Section, he undertakes to give reaſons why the Church of Rome is fallible. But, if, on the other ſide, it be a reality, and that the Inquirers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are but pretended, then ſurely will not this infallibility keep us from mending, but contrariwiſe from erring or having any thing to mend, or, which is all one, from any errours to correct. And thus we ſee that our Religion is maintained by the ſelfe ſame arts that bred it, that is to ſay, not by force, or violence, but by reaſon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and ſpirituall induſtries, contrary to the ſurmiſes of this Inquirer.</p>

This guide teaches things contrary to God's goodneſſe, therefore it is not appointed, by God; as to ſay, it is agreeable to God's goodneſſe there ſhould be a guide, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is one. So he.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Enquirer ſeekes to delude us with a fallacy, by altering his tearmes; for in the firſt place, he ſpeakes of a thing contrary to God's goodneſſe, not abſolutely, but according to his underſtanding.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55236:61"/>
In the ſecond place he ſpeakes of it, not as it is in his underſtanding, but as it is ſimply in it ſelfe, which is a thing quite different from the former; for many things may be in his underſtanding thus or thus, or as he ſaith, contrary to God's goodneſſe, which in themſelves are not ſo, but rather, quite otherwiſe, for indeed it is no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to argue on this ſort. This in my underſtanding is contrary to God's goodneſſe, therefore it is ſo, becauſe your underſtanding is ſubject to errour, and therefore ſome things may ſeeme to it to be, which are not. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> who followeth this Author's footſteps, argues after the ſelfe ſame manner, and hath beene anſwered elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where by himſelfe. I grant then the conſequence when as he ſaith, this guide teaches ſomewhat contrary to God's goodneſſe, therefore it is not appointed for a guide. But I deny the Antecedent; and afterwards when he proves it, ſaying, it ſeemes ſo to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, therefore it is ſo, I deny the conſequence, and admit the Antecedent.</p>
               <p>At leaſt, ſaith he, if it ſeeme ſo to my underſtanding, whether in the meane time it be ſo or not, I am not to receive it, becauſe I am to be guided by my owne reaſon and underſtanding. If it ſeeme ſo to your underſtanding after ſuch time as you have weighed all things as rightly as you can, I grant it; But if it ſeeme ſo onely before you have done that, then I deny it, for then it is not to be followed but forſaken, or reformed if it be found erroneous, as in this caſe of yours it is. For in this caſe your underſtanding is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult other underſtandings wiſer then your owne, if you can finde any ſuch; and according to that is to determine of the matter, and not to rely wholly upon your owne ſingle underſtanding. But if you doe ſo, you will finde your owne ſingle underſtanding was deceived, and that the guide of which we treate, teacheth nothing that is againſt the goodneſſe of God. For it is to be ſuppoſed her underſtanding is brighter and more capacious then yours, and therefore is to be thought knowes much better what doctrines be agreeable to the goodneſſe of God, then yours can doe what is againſt it; and therefore your owne reaſon and underſtanding teaches you, that the Churches underſtanding is to be preferred, and that yours muſt ſubmit; and againe, that this is the rationall way, and not the other: this the way of underſtanding, and that of errour. And ſo much in anſwer to this fallacy, wherein I perceive, both he and Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> confide very much.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:55236:62"/>As for particular doctrines, it is true, as you ſay, you may examine whether they agree with the Principle, that is foundation, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe cannot you from thence conclude any thing againſt the doctrines or Infallibility of the Church, but rather for it, and this for the reaſon before ſpecified. Neither doe we, therefore, ſend you to a witneſſe, and bid you not believe it, but rather, to believe it as farre as in right reaſon you are to believe it, and not farther, that is to ſay, you are to truſt to your owne particular diſcourſes, as to particular diſcourſes, and no farther, but to the reſolves of the Church as to the dictamens of a higher underſtanding, by the light of which you are to judge and cenſure of the reſt, and by doing thus, you are ſure you doe wiſely and ſafely, and, in fine, ſo, as although you ſhould chance to erre, you might anſwer the buſineſſe at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day, by ſaying, I did in this caſe what I ought to doe, for I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed what my reaſon taught me, and more then this was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at my hands. But if I follow my owne judgement, and in confidence of that doe adventure to condemne the Church, In that I offend againſt my reaſon and true judgement, and ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make a good apology for my ſelfe, or any way make it good that I followed my reaſon, which faculty is the rule that God hath ſet mee.</p>
               <p>For a concluſion of this diſpute, I anſwer in briefe, that put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Inquirers argument as he ought to have put it, namely, thus as followeth. This guide, to my underſtanding; or, to my ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, teaches things contrary to Gods goodneſſe, therefore it is not appointed by him for a guide, putting I ſay, the argument on this manner, it is nothing ſo good, or ſo concluding an argument, as this other is, videlicet; This guide teaches ſuch and ſuch doctrines, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not againſt the goodneſſe of God, and therefore againe, my underſtanding was deceived in holding them to be ſo; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laſtly notwithſtanding all this, ſhe may be an infallible guide and appointed by God for ſuch: Note, that we inferre hence ſhe may be, but not that ſhe is, as the Inquirer would impoſe upon us: for, we doe not ſay that the Church is appointed a guide therefore, becauſe it is agreeable with God's goodneſſe to make her ſo, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we for other reaſons know he hath ſo made her: becauſe we are not now to learne but that many things are agreeable to Gods goodneſſe to be done, which yet are not done, nor peradventure ever
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55236:62"/>
will be. Wherefore, when we are to judge what is, or will be, we are to conſider, not what his goodneſſe may admit, but what his will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines ſhall have a being, for of that laſtly depends the exiſtence of things, and not of the other.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Section</hi> is ſpent in the enquiring whether a man ſhall be damned for making a diligent and impartiall enquiry after the true religion, of which he finds the infallibility of the Church to be a part, ſuppoſing that his reaſon, when all is done, will not aſſent. This is his Quaere, and the ſame may be made concerning any other verity, or point of doctrine; as namely, of the holy Scripture, whether or no it be the word of God; and what ſhall become of that man whoſe reaſon, after an impartiall ſearch made, will not aſſent; or againe, about the truth of Chriſtian Religion, unto which, after ſuch a ſearch made, his reaſon will not condeſcend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:55236:64"/>I anſwer first, that it is a mockery to aske whether or no any Man ſhall be damned for making a good enquiry without ſucceſſe; and in effect it is the ſame as to enquire whether a Man ſhall be damned for doing a deed that's commendable and good. For this Queſtion ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that either the Enquirer, or we were very ſimple Creatures, and did not underſtand our ſelves, or elſe that the Gentleman-deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was not in earneſt, but propounded it only for his recreation, though at a time ill choſen and unſeaſonable, and alſo in a matter about which there ought to be no jeaſting.</p>
               <p>I anſwer ſecondly, that in a place where inſtruction and informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be had, the caſe he puts is morally impoſſible to happen out; for we deny that where the ſearch is diligent, impartiall, and without prejudice, and where againe information ſufficient is to be had, that there the reaſon ſhall not be able to aſſent, and that whereſoever it cannot, that ſame happens, either through weakneſſe, or inhability of judgment and capacity, or elſe by reaſon of ſome diſordinate paſſion of the will, by which the underſtanding is miſled and darkened, as in thoſe, who are refractary, it for the moſt part falls out. Which paſſion and prejudices ariſe, ſometimes from cuſtome and education, ſometimes from vitious inclinations, ſometimes from a crookedneſſe and perverſity of nature, which doth refuſe inſtruction. Wherefore as it is no ſufficient excuſe for an Infidel to ſay, I have ſearched dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently whether or no Christ be the true Meſſias, or whether the Scripture be the word of God or no, and after all endeavours uſed, my reaſon will not aſſent; ſo in like manner it is as little ſufficient to alleage, that after enquiry made about the true Church and her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, your reaſon would not aſſent, for in theſe caſes, we cannot grant any ignorance invincible; or free that errour which poſſeſſes them from guilt. Now what ſhall become of others who want in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſufficient, and have no crookedneſſe or backwardneſſe in their will, and die in ignorance, is another point, and different from this of ours, and is to be reſolved in the Queſtion about the efficacy of Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite faith, to which I referre my Reader.</p>

               <p>Whoſoever admits of truth upon no better grounds than others doe admit of falshood, doth not receive it rightly, ſolidly, and as he ought, but after a way defective and infirme. Againe, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſearches and is loath to finde, and would not ſee it when he might, this Man refuſeth truth as badly and weakly as the other
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55236:65"/>
doth receive it; and as the truth will not benefit the one, ſo the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry will not advantage or excuſe the other. As for ſuch as are bred up in a true Religion, and which, without particular exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they accept, it were raſh judgement to ſay all theſe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved truths upon no better grounds, then others did falſhood; for firſt, according to this account, the greateſt portion of Chriſtian men on all ſides would be in a hard condition: amongst whom the ſimple and illiterate, who are not able to read <hi>Evagrius</hi> either in Greeke or Latine, nor yet the Bible either in Hebrew or Greeke, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to make any ſtrict ſearch into antiquity, for their making diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries which faith was the Antient and Apoſtolique. But though they be unable to doe this, yet doe they not therefore take up their Religion at randome and by chance, or conſult paſſion about it, and not reaſon, but contrariwiſe, doe finde their reaſon ſatisfied each one according to their ſeverall models, or meaſure of capacity, by the preſent view of the majeſty and divine perfections of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church and faith therein profeſſed, together with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances from publique fame and creditable relations. By meanes of which the divine providence and veracity ſhewes them infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly what wayes they are to take, and what doctrines to receive as revealed from above. And thus, regularly ſpeaking amongst ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Believers, where Religion may appeare like it ſelfe, every Man of capacity, though illiterate, may ſee ſufficient to reſolve him, which ſatiſfaction from any falſe Religion he could not receive; for though to a heedleſſe eye, and before a diligent exquiry made, ſome grand falſhoods may ſeeme more probable than truths, and that as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teacheth, <hi>multa falſa ſunt probabiliora veris,</hi> many falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods are more probable than truths; yet, not to a diligent Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer after the ſearch is made, and eſpecially, in buſineſſes of great concernment, becauſe God and nature have laid theſe kinde of truths more open to our view, and ſet markes upon them by which they might be knowne and diſcerned from falſhood. Wherefore, in the law of nature, it was more credible, even to the illiterate, that there was a God, then that there was none; and now Judaiſme is not ſo probable as Chriſtianity is, though ſometimes it hath been, nor Mahumetiſme at any time ſo perſwaſible as Chriſtian Religion, or Hereſy ſo credible and ſatisfactory as orthodoxall Chriſtianity, or the Greeke ſchiſme as the Greeke unity; wherefore though the Parents
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55236:65"/>
beliefe, and the Religion prevalent in the Countrey have great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into the minds of Man, and are great and powerfull Perſwaders, yea oftentimes Seducers alſo, and thoſe very dangerous; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe in thoſe places where truth is taught, they doe not hinder Men from the right apprehenſion of it, and from making true judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about it, but rather like a proſperous gale of winde to Veſſels under ſayle, cauſe them to move towards the Port deſired more ſwiftly than otherwiſe they would. And thus much may ſuffice for taking off the ſlander and ſcandall which this Enquirer, and after him <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth,</hi> with great acerbity, have almoſt in the very ſame tearmes, labour'd to caſt upon right believing Chriſtians, therewith to diſparage their faith, as if forſooth, they beleived truths invalidly and upon no better reaſons then others beleive falſhood. Thus have both theſe conſpired againſt the truth, for both indeed are but one Author in effect, one the Text, and the other the Commentary; wherefore the Publiſher of this ſmall worke hath ſhewed us all the well head to which <hi>Chillingworth</hi> went to draw, which Well before was unknowne to the moſt part of Men, and ſo might have ſtill remained, had it not been for this Publiſhers unſeaſonable diligence.</p>

It is improbable, for if it were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, it would in knowing Men, not ſtay within the narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of an implicite aſſent, but quickly dilate it ſelfe, and become explicite. Indeed this great profeſſion of believing in a preparation of minde all which God would have believed, and goes no farther, ſeemes in moſt Men to be but feigned and deluſory, and ſo no great truſt can be repoſed in it.</p>

               <p>We Catholiques doe not diſagree in points of faith, neither where there is fire to keepe us in awe, nor where there is none, and therefore this exception againſt our unity is frivolous. It is the cleareneſſe and perfection of our rule that drawes us all to unity, and not any of the foure Elements. If we follow this rule we are at peace, and we doe well know how to follow it: contrarywiſe, follow your rule as well as you can, and yet you are at variance; wherefore you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne a rule, which though it in it ſelfe be not uncertaine, yet which is as bad, you are uncertaine of it. Now as in Logicke a maxime, or axiome, if unknowne, or uncertaine, is no good principle of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation; ſo in matter of beliefe, a rule not certainly diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible and underſtood, is no good rule of faith, though never ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in it ſelfe: and this is juſt your caſe.</p>
               <p>The differences amongst thoſe of our Church are not differences in matters of faith or religion, as it is evident; but on the other ſide it is manifeſt and confeſſed, that yours are. Our differences are in Philoſophy onely, or in ſome Scholaſtique and undefined point, and ſuch in particular is, that now ſome yeares agitated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Dominicans, and ſundry of their party on the one ſide, and the Jeſuits, and Sorbon Doctours, and many more, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For theſe contend not as we doe, with the Calviniſts, namely, whether we have free will or no: all of them agreeing in that verity of faith, but they contend about a queſtion onely Philoſophicall, which hath ſome relation to it, namely whether with this freedome of will acknowledged by both ſides, Phyſicall predeterminations or praemotions can conſiſt: which queſtion is no queſtion of faith. Now admitting as many thinke, that theſe predeterminations could not ſtand with the doctrine of free will, yet the ſaid doctrine of faith
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55236:68"/>
is not hurt thereby: for the oppoſition betweene them and free will, is either diſcovered by the Dominicans, or not. If not, then is it dormant, and ſo, though never ſo ill, it cannot doe hurt to faith, or worke it any prejudice. If it be diſcovered, then it can worke nothing, foraſmuch as thereupon it will be relinquiſht and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd preſently: becauſe the doctrine of free will is received by an aſſent of faith, and the other but by a philoſophicall or opinative; the former being the ſtronger, muſt needs command and expell the latter, aſſoone as they begin to fall at variance. Wherefore it would in that caſe be a good conſequence with them, viz. Man hath free will, therefore there is no predetermination and not contrarywiſe, (as it is with the Calviniſts) there is predetermination, therefore no free will. Therefore in the holding of predeterminations there is a vaſt difference betweene a Calviniſt and a Dominican, even as much as betweene an obedient Catholique, and a perverſe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Heretique, and that is difference enough. And ſince you would needs know, this is the reaſon why theſe arguments make you Heretiques, and not the Dominicans. That the Church ought to have reſolved the point in difference, betweene thoſe two orders, is more then the inquirer can prove, for neither of their doctrines doe hinder conformity with the ancients in any one thing, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity was requiſite; for men are not bound to conforme with the ancients in the reaſons of their beliefe, but in their belief onely. The <hi>42.</hi> Section we grant as making nothing againſt our doctrine. And thus <hi>Chillingworth</hi> is alſo anſwered who inſiſts upon this ſame point, and alſo in the ſame faſhion with this Inquirer, ſo that all things conſidered, both theſe make but one Author and require but one anſwer to what they have objected.

               <p>In theſe foure <hi>Sections</hi> the Enquirer buſily endeavours to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade that errours might ſecretly creep into the Church by degrees, as a Child waxes bigger, and as the index of a Clock moves about. Be it ſo as the Enquirer ſaith, yet nevertheleſſe, might all ſuch creeping errours, if there were any, be eſpied, at leaſt, when they had once got in, if not while they were ſtealing thither. Thus the growth of a Child is ſeene plainly, though not the growing, and the hand, or ſhadow of a Diall is ſeene at what houre it is, though the ſlow pace thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not perceptible; and Men may give a judgement whether it goe falſe or true. Why then could not errours be espied as eaſily after they were once ſtolne in, though by never ſo ſmall degrees, they made their approaches thither? Thus were the errours of <hi>Arius, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius, Wicliffe, Socinus,</hi> and others, preſently diſcovered, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their Authours counterfeiting and ſlie manner of divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them; even as tares, which were ſown while Men ſlept: as ſoon as grown up were ſeen and noted. What then ſhould hinder all other pretended errours of the Church from being ſeen and regiſtred, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though crept in never ſo inſenſibly?</p>
               <p>What matter is it that ſundry Bookes are loſt? Are they more loſt for thoſe errours, then for others? or were theſe more inviſible then all the reſt? It is ſtrange with what improbable conjectures this Enquirer deludes himſelfe.</p>
               <p>He tells us afterwards of another ſlie way of breaking in, that is to ſay, under old names and titles, altering the ſignification, but not the words. But I would know how the errours of the Church could by this art be concealed, more than the errours of <hi>Calvin,</hi> who ſought with old appellations to palliate his new Doctrines.</p>
               <p>But, in concluſion, his principall device is, that if no precedent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition were a note of the being taught from the beginning, that then the doctrine of the Chiliaſts would paſſe for right and Apoſtolicall, becauſe, as he affirmeth, it was not contradicted till two hundred yeares after the coming in. But my anſwer is, it is more than any Man can prove, that it was contradicted no ſooner: nay, it is more than probable, that it was contradicted in the time of S. <hi>Juſtin,</hi> as we have ſhewed before, and alſo highly probable, that it was oppoſed and rejected in the time of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Arcopagite, as alſo hath been noted before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:55236:72"/>Beſides, it is no way neceſſary that every caſuall or innocent opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be forthwith contradicted, or noted as an errour againſt faith; and of this ſort was the errour of the Chiliaſts during the time it was held but as an opinion, without cenſuring or condemning others, to which height, aſſoone as it arrived, it was cryed downe preſently and rejected.</p>
               <p>The <hi>48</hi> Sect. containes but a recapitulation of what was before propounded, and therefore requires no new anſwer to it.</p>
               <p>The laſt Sect. containes nothing that deſerves not commendation, or is unworthy of the Author, but is rather to be extolled and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by all that make Enquiries after truth, and his reſolves there be ſuch, that if they be truly and ſincerily put in execution by any, no man can have reaſon to be offended with him in this world, nor is it likely that God will be diſpleaſed with him in the next. But whether the Enquirer was not very unhappy in his ſearches after truth, or no, I leave it by the ſearcher of all hearts to be determined.</p>

               <head>The Concluſion.</head>
               <p>The generall reſult of all that which hath beene debated hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to betwixt the Enquirer and me, is, in effect, no other but that, Firſt, the Catholique Churches infallibility is a ſoveraigne preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative againſt errour; and againſt all diſſention or diſ-union in believing, unto all thoſe who doe acknowledge it, and yeild ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereunto. Secondly, that each new verity defin'd by that Church is to them a new path to heaven, though on the other ſide, to all ſuch other as refuſe to be directed by her, it may prove juſt as the Enquirer is pleaſed to expreſſe himſelfe, a new path to walke in towards the Devill, or one ſteppe more unto damnation. And in this he was in the right, and ſpoke truer then he was aware. Now it is well knowne that all we Catholiques are guided by that ſame infallibility; and againe, that on the contrary all Anti-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55236:73"/>
doe reſiſt it, and what will follow out of this, is no hard matter to collect. Moreover, this ſame infallibility, a quality ſo unpleaſing to the Enquirer, cannot, as he ſurmiſes, make us ſure, if we be in errour, never to mend, for we all doe offer freely that if either he, or any of his ſide be ſure to disprove ſoundly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the infallibility, we will be as ſure to mend and forthwith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh it; by which expected act of theirs we ſhall be reduced unto ſuch good tearmes, in which all Anti-Catholiques continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are, that is to ſay, to believe at randome, reele wildly up and downe unconſtantly, and fall at variance amongst our ſelves, as they doe; and then I hope the Enquirer will be contented with us.</p>
               <p>But the want on their behalfe of ſuch an efficacious proofe as this, hath beene the true reaſon why we have not hitherto thought of any alteration, or comming towards them. Certainly it is much better to be perſwaded though falſly, of an infallibility, then to be ſure to have none, as you now are, but to be wrangling perpetually, falling out and fighting amongst your ſelves; whereas, before you were, when as our Religion prevailed, this inconvenience happened not. So that, <hi>in fine,</hi> all the goodly fruits you have reaped from your impugning Church and Councels, and in bringing in inſtead thereof a new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of your owne, is but the making of your ſelves and your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try miſerable, which daily, by deare experience we finde. And ſo much for the Enquirer's unadviſed impugnation of the infallibility of the Catholique Church.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That there are ſuch, the Reader will give credit to his owne eyes, if he review the latter part of your firſt Chapter, as alſo the cloſe of the 8 and of the 15 Chapter; And that you ought to <hi>know</hi> them, <hi>i. e.</hi> acknowledge and reform them, as being contrary, the former to that <hi>Charity,</hi> the latter to that <hi>Meekneſſe,</hi> which our <hi>Saviour</hi> left in charge with thoſe that would be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his <hi>name,</hi> I hope you will diſcerne, and confeſſe with me.</p>
            <q>C. <hi>2.</hi> B. <hi>the Annotation is</hi> [I doe not treat here what is done by ſome, but what in propriety of ſpeech ought to have beene done.]</q>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:55236:76"/>To this I anſwer, firſt, That it being true (as this Reply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes) that ſome Romaniſts uſed that ſtile of <hi>Catholique Roman Church,</hi> (though this Apologiſt did not) This is fully ſufficient to juſtifie his Lordſhips title, becauſe he was not bound to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that this Apologiſt would reforme the ſtile of others; And ſecondly, though it be not propriety of ſpeech, yet was that no argument neither, becauſe his Lordſhip that holds that <hi>Church fallible</hi> in greater matters, might conceive it poſſible for them to be ſo in matter of <hi>propriety of ſpeech,</hi> nay was confident that ſo they were, being not able to disbelieve his eyes and eares, that of this they were guilty, as <hi>improper</hi> as it is. But then third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the matter is yet more cleare againſt the Apologiſt, for though his Lordſhips title did not <hi>preſage,</hi> yet I which had read that Anſwer, could ſee that he himſelfe ſaid that the <hi>Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> was the <hi>Roman,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> the <hi>Catholique,</hi> and that is the thing which I affirm'd from his owne words in that place to which that Annotation is prefixt. And therefore for him to ſay, that in <hi>propriety of ſpeech this ought not to be done</hi>] as it is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of himſelfe, who was guilty of that <hi>impropriety,</hi> ſo is it not a confutation of me, who onely ſaid he was ſo.</p>
            <q>Ib. C. [We ſpeak here according to the rules of formall predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not for reprehenſion of the Enquirer, but for rectifying the manner of ſpeaking, and ſtating the Queſtion rightly.]</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis not imaginable how this note could advantage the Writers cauſe. In the very place to which this note is affixt, I am a proving by rules of <hi>formall predication,</hi> that, by what is ſaid by the Romaniſts, and particularly by your ſelf, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that you affirme the <hi>Roman Church to be Infallible,</hi> though not <hi>quatenus Roman.</hi> this concluſion you deny not to follow from thoſe <hi>rules,</hi> but ſay [<hi>you ſpeak according to thoſe rules.</hi>] And truly I have as yet no neceſſity to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ny that you doe ſo, nor ſhall I, untill having affirm'd the <hi>Roman Church</hi> to be the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique,</hi> you proceed to deny the <hi>Roman</hi> to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> though the <hi>Cathol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55236:76"/>
When you doe ſo, I ſhall make bold to put you in mind of thoſe rules, and in the meane onely to take notice of your owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that what you ſaid was <hi>not for reprehenſion of the Enquirer:</hi> which I muſt affirm to be a retrataction of your former writing, which pretended to prove that in truth it <hi>was not ſo, as in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer's title it is called.</hi> This was then ſurely a <hi>reprehenſion</hi> of the <hi>Enquirer,</hi> and if now you ſay you meant not to reprehend him, this is to ſay you did not meane to doe what you did, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>Thus much I had briefly ſaid to you before, but now have been forced to lay downe more largely; and let me tell you, that when I had not onely <hi>affirmed,</hi> but <hi>proved</hi> you guilty of this <hi>Sophiſme,</hi> you ought either by denying my premiſes, or by ſome other way to have anſwered my proof.</p>
            <p>And in ſtead of ſo doing, To ſay onely [<hi>you are not guilty</hi>] is a <hi>denying my concluſion,</hi> and <hi>petitio principii</hi> againe. And from this you cannot be cleared by what you adde [that <hi>you deny what the Enquirer aſſumed as true and granted</hi>;] For Firſt, I ſay you were to have <hi>anſwered</hi> or <hi>denied</hi> my <hi>premiſes,</hi> and you one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſay to prove your owne <hi>concluſion</hi>; Secondly, your way or <hi>medium</hi> of proving that, is not concluding neither; For the thing aſſumed (by his Lordſhip) being this, [That <hi>the meanes brought to prove your Infallibility were fallible meanes, and ſo granted by you</hi>] his Lordſhip did not aſſume this as granted or true in it ſelfe immediately or without proofe, but proceeded to prove it to be true and granted by you, and that by this <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> becauſe with you nothing was conceived <hi>infallible,</hi> but the <hi>Church:</hi> That concluſion then (being not ſet downe as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or principle of probation, but as a <hi>concluſion</hi> proved by that <hi>medium)</hi> you againe profeſſe to deny, (remember I ſay you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the <hi>concluſion)</hi> and then ſure we want no <hi>tryall</hi> to diſcover the juſtneſſe of ſo doing; and whereas you ſay his <hi>proofes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after,</hi> I anſwer, that ſome other proofes follow after, but one ſufficient proofe is brought in that place; and the denying the concluſion without anſwering of that one proofe, is it which
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55236:78"/>
brought all this charge and inconvenience upon you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you now ſee I doe not require of you (as you ſay I doe) to <hi>prove againſt the Enquirer,</hi> but onely to anſwer his proofs; But if in ſtead of doing ſo, you will take upon you to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion which the <hi>Enquirer</hi> hath diſproved, and doe that onely by a bare ſaying ſomewhat which you know he denies, this is a <hi>petitio principii</hi> ſtill. And your ſecond Argument that it is not, taken from your being <hi>Defender,</hi> or <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> or <hi>Apologist,</hi> will no more quit you from that charge; for though an Anſwerer as long as he doth no more but either deny the <hi>major</hi> or <hi>minor,</hi> or anſwer to either of them by <hi>diſtinguiſhing, limiting, &amp;c.</hi> cannot be guilty of that fault, yet if he deny none but the <hi>concluſion,</hi> he doth in effect, and <hi>interpretativè begge</hi> the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> and if inſtead of denying of, or anſwering to the premiſes, he go about to prove the Queſtion in hand, or any part of it, he doth by ſo doing, take the place of an Opponent upon him. Now becauſe 'tis poſſible for an <hi>Anſwerer</hi> to doe one of theſe, though he ought to doe neither, it followes, that by either of thoſe waies the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> may <hi>begge the Queſtion,</hi> and both thoſe are your caſe at this time, as hath, I conceive, already been manifeſted, and therefore I muſt be excuſed, if I ſtill conceive my concluſion is regular, the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> is <hi>guilty of that Sophiſme.</hi>

And if this were your caſe, I ſhould be unjuſt to require any proofes from you. But you muſt be a very great Deſpiſer of my Papers, if you did not take notice in that place, that I was forced to be plaine with you, and tell you that you had not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered (either by <hi>denying</hi> or <hi>diſtinguiſhing, &amp;c.)</hi> any one word to his Lordſhip in your whole fifth Chapter, but fell into other diſcourſes of your owne, which courſe as it is not the part of

an Anſwerer ſtrictly taken, ſo if it be permitted him at all, it muſt oblige him to give proof for all ſuch aſſertions as he ſhall bring in thus caſually, or elſe never to expect, or require to be heeded by his Adverſary.</p>
            <p>And of ſuch aſſertions as theſe, (which were caſuall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall to your diſcourſe, and by me conceived falſe) it was, that I required proofe from you, and you are ſtill my Debtour for it.</p>

            </p>
            <q>Ibid. <hi>B.</hi> Our Authours have proved all that we in defending doe affirme, and if the Enquirer had impugned their proofes, we then would have tryed to defend; wherefore that which we affirme and declare, doth not reſt upon a bare affirmation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

            <q>Ibid. <hi>B.</hi> I doe not diſclaime Scripture, though I doe not hold it to be the firſt or formoſt proof either of the Church or of Chriſtian Religion, and would know how you your ſelfe would convert an Infidell or Atheiſt by Scripture, beginning with that proof.</q>

On this ground I muſt conclude (and thinke it proved by that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) that you doe diſclaime Scripture, as farre as I ſaid you did, <hi>i. e.</hi> not to all purpoſes, but to that of which the diſcourſe was, <hi>viz: to prove your Church to be the true Church.</hi> And 'tis not enough to ſay that you doe <hi>not hold it to be the firſt or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt proofe, &amp;c.</hi> For if it be uſed by you as any proofe at all, that will alſo be a very probable meanes, (beſides that it makes it evident, that his Lordſhip was not miſtaken in ſuppoſing it ſo) to bring you into the circle which you were ſo carefull to avoid. You ſee I am cleare from your Animadverſion, and ſo have no occaſion to enter into that new controverſie, whether the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture be the formoſt proof either of the Church, or of the Chriſtian Religion,</hi> (though ſure it may be one without being the other, it may be the <hi>formoſt proofe</hi> of evidencing which is the <hi>true Church</hi> to them that are ſuppoſed Believers (and none elſe will

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There was here very little occaſion for this note. For the buſineſſe of <hi>Anathema's,</hi> I had ſufficiently reſtrained; Firſt, by limiting them onely to <hi>excommunications,</hi> as an act of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall</hi> diſcipline upon the refractary; and therefore Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not for matter of ſimple beleiving or disbeleiving; but Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for matter of diſobedience to our lawfull Superiours, and that diſobedience againe not in refuſing to ſubmit our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, but our wils, and our conſequent actions: and Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all this with ſtubborneneſſe and perverſeneſſe, after the uſing of all milder courſes. And with theſe and the like limitations there will be no more difficulty to ſay an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate</hi> may <hi>excommunicate</hi> a diſobedient refractary perverſe Gain-ſayer, without undertaking to be infallible, then to ſay a civill Magiſtrate may puniſh a Malefactour without being <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errable.</hi> And therefore when you talke of <hi>binding to believe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paine of Anathema</hi>; there is ſome miſtake in that, or if there were not, yet <hi>Truth</hi> (if it were on grounds of Scripture belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be ſo) would be as ſufficient a foundation of ſo doing, as the <hi>infallib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I had no occaſion to ſay it did. I was ſpeaking (as your anſwer called me to it) of <hi>diſcipline,</hi> and <hi>unity,</hi> or ſuch <hi>unity</hi> as <hi>diſcipline</hi> produced, which is <hi>outward unity,</hi> as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to diviſion and <hi>Shiſme</hi>; and yet let me tell you, it were not unpoſſible to extend my ſpeech to <hi>inward unity,</hi> and <hi>ſatisfying of the minde.</hi> For ſuppoſe a particular <hi>Church</hi> to have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent meanes to worke in the hearts of her ſonnes this inward unity, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſetting up the authority of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and receiving with due reſpect, and obedience all <hi>Apoſtolicall Traditions</hi>; Theſe, if duely revered by all Sonnes and Subjects, would be able to keepe all of one minde in all matters of <hi>Faith</hi> (and for lower points ſome kinde of <hi>liberty</hi> being allowed, would preſerve <hi>Charity</hi> as well) and then while that Church were in this happie temper, you may farther ſuppoſe the <hi>ſword of violence</hi> to come in, and diſturbe all, wreſting out of her hands the uſe and exerciſe of thoſe meanes, and beating downe the <hi>authoritie,</hi> and taking away the <hi>reputation</hi> of them.

this ſence; and if you marke it, we ſpake it not in any other. And yet once more, if we had, we might have beene juſtified perhaps in our ſaying. For <hi>Hereſie</hi> being a piece of carnality in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles judgement, 'tis poſſible that the outward <hi>ſmart,</hi> that comes from the exerciſe of the <hi>power of the ſword, i. e.</hi> from temporall puniſhments, may cure that diſeaſe, and perſwade them, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of pleaſure from their <hi>hereſie,</hi> reap nothing but paine, and ſorrow, to make better proviſion for their owne <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> and thinke of hearing that reaſon, to which other honeſt mens eares are open, and then that may produce inward unity alſo, and theſe mens minds may be ſufficiently ſatisfied with that truth coming thus to them <hi>tempore congruo, at a fit ſeaſon of working,</hi> which at another time had beene rejected.

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sir, you cited three places out of <hi>Philoponus,</hi> to prove that <hi>Dionyſius Arcopagita</hi> wrote thoſe workes now extant bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his name: This teſtimony I told you would be nothing to your purpoſe, unleſſe it teſtified (if not all thoſe Bookes, yet) of ſome one wherein he wrote againſt the <hi>Chiliaſts.</hi> But this I ſhewed you was not done, becauſe thoſe places mention nothing of his, but an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> and in that I advertized you there was nothing againſt the <hi>Chiliaſts.</hi> This it ſeems you cannot deny, but being willing to ſay ſomething, ſay that <hi>elſwhere</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponus <hi>numbers him amongst the famous Doctours,</hi> &amp;c.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The paſſage to which this annotation was affixt, was about the <hi>pictures of Papall approbation of Maſſacres,</hi> to be ſeen at <hi>Rome.</hi> Which if they were, as you now ſay, <hi>tumultuous</hi> and <hi>outrages,</hi> then it ſeemes there is <hi>papall approbation</hi> for ſuch; and then either that or you are <hi>fallible.</hi> But ſince you ſee it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to adde another limitation, that the <hi>Maſſacres</hi> ſo approved were not for <hi>religion,</hi> I would faine perſwade my ſelfe that you diſclaime <hi>maſſacres for religion</hi> (the lawfulneſſe of which you were ſo long defending.) And if you be now in that good mood of mercy, I ſhall not goe about to confute or provoke you out of it, but rather pray that God confirme you and all your friends in it for a longer ſpace, then your charitable not damning us did laſt in the former part of the Chapter.</p>

Our <hi>ſtories</hi> have told us otherwiſe, If you have any authenticke records in your <hi>Archives,</hi> I pray make us partakers of the truth; In the meane, I feare a Proteſtant ſonne of a <hi>Romaniſt</hi> father, may when opportunity ſerves, paſſe for ſuch a <hi>wild boare</hi> and a <hi>ſpoiler.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Ib. <hi>G.</hi> My ſence is that religion may not be planted by armes, but being once planted and in quiet poſſeſſion it may. And this I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe no learned man will deny.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I may believe you that this is now your ſence, but that it is the ſence of thoſe words of yours, which I was then confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I ſhall be confident to deny, not only becauſe the words bear no ſuch ſence, but becauſe you did there your ſelf interpret them thus, that the thing which you diſclaimed the deſigning by <hi>armes,</hi> was onely the juſtifying the right and truth of religion by them. Which I then conceived to ſignifie, that your ſwords doe onely force men to be of your minds, doe not give them reaſons why they ſhould. Yet if after all this, you tell me in earneſt, that this was not your meaning, I ſhall cry you mercy for the miſtake, but not now enter into a diſpute with you of that new queſtion now propoſed by you, [<hi>Whether religion</hi> (that muſt ſignifie your doctrines as they are diſtinguiſht from, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ours, or elſe 'twill not be pertinent to our purpoſe) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing planted and in quiet poſſeſſion, may</hi>] becauſe I cannot imagine what verbe that ſyllable [may] is the moode of. [Plant] it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, for that which is in poſſeſſion, is already planted: But what it ſhould be, I muſt not divine for you. Only at an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture I ſhall make a plaine ſtate. If your doctrines were in quiet poſſeſſion here, and you ſhould know of any man that taught the contrary to them, muſt your ſword be drawne againſt him, or no? I beſeech you anſwer out of the ſence of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that we may know what to expect from you. For my own part, I ſhall make no ſcruple to tell you, that though the <hi>defender of the Faith</hi> have the power of the <hi>ſword</hi> given him by God to that end, to governe in <hi>godlineſſe</hi> and <hi>quiet,</hi> and may
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55236:89"/>
therefore draw it effectually againſt any that raiſe ſedition to bring in ſome other religion againſt that which is by law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht, or that vent doctrines that are in themſelves <hi>ſeditious,</hi> yet ought he not, onely in caſe of any ſingle doctrine or difference in religion (where none of the civill intereſts are concerned, no violent aſſault made, or feared from the diſſenters) to unſheath his ſlaughtering ſword againſt any ſuch diſſenter, provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes that that doctrine be not blaſphemous. (And they that conſenting to this truth, will yet tyrannize over mens ſoules <hi>in ordine ad temporalia,</hi> as you and ſome others have done over mens <hi>bodies and eſtates in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> ſhall never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by me) and of this opinion I conceive there might be vouched as learned, and as primitive-tempered <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as any that are more zealouſly, and ſo more bloudily minded.</p>
            <q>Ibid. <hi>H.</hi> Aſperſions be eaſily caſt, but ſhould not be admitted, when there are ſtrong preſumptions to the contrary, without evident proofe; The Catholiques were knowne good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots under our former Kings, and under this our moſt gracious Prince we have good teſtimony, greater then which cannot be given.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The caſe is not here of aſperſions, but of matters of <hi>fact,</hi> or attempts of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> whereby <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> was known to have beene in danger. On which provocation the lawes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding all ſuch to come into the Kingdome, made it ſuch a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall <hi>preſumption,</hi> that if they did, they ſhould incurre that ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and ſentence of the law. And ſo every man knowing what meaſure to expect from the lawes, were farther to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed either traiterous or madde, if on thoſe tearmes he would adventure on ſuch a forbidden journey. As for evident proofe, which you require, it belongs little to this matter, becauſe the very being in the Kingdome was a demonſtration of contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law, and an evidence that they were the men that were under that legall preſumption; which is farre more then <hi>a proof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe aſperſion, with evidence to the contrary.</hi> As for the fidelity of your Patriots under our formoſt Kings, when they were of their opinions, I ſhall not queſtion it; neither in like manner

your behaviour to our preſent <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> but onely tell you, that the <hi>Queen Elizabeth lawes</hi> might be juſt for all that; (which was all we had now in hand) and for the execution of them in latter times, I before gave you an account.</p>
            <q>Ibid. <hi>I.</hi> We doe profeſſe our beſt reaſon hath brought us to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, not our paſſion, and we have as much reaſon to be believed as any others can.</q>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis poſſible you may not; for if mens actions give in any teſtimony againſt their words, there will not be ſo much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe ſuch, as when there is a concordance of them; But if upon ſerious ſhrift you are able to profeſſe this ſincerity, I ſhall be ſo charitable to believe you and allow you any hope of mercy for your <hi>errours,</hi> which you can wiſh; but yet tell you, that by making this profeſſion in the plurall number, you doe ſomewhat prejudge it; no man being ſo privy to the hearts of his fellow profeſſours, as to be a fit voucher for them, every man muſt <hi>ſtand</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> to his owne <hi>Maſter.</hi>

            <q>Ibid. <hi>K.</hi> I was to anſwer and not to prove, and therefore might in right deny what the Enquirer falſely ſuppoſes without proofe. It is the respondents right to affirme the very point in queſtion, or to deny it, without caring whether it be granted or no, ſo he himſelfe be ready to defend it; and ſo he that can exact this as his owne, ſhall not need to begge any thing, and if he doe, he cannot begge more then what he hath, and what he affirmes or denies already. For example, I deny against <hi>Copernicus</hi> that the earth moves, or I affirme that it is quiet, and I ſtand to maintaine my ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Certainly this is no begging, but yet to ſay that it is ſo, may be a begging, or if I ſhould ſay it ſtood ſtill, becauſe it doth not move, were a frivolous speech, but yet for all that no begging of the queſtion.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This vindication of your beloved <hi>petitio principii,</hi> (that ſtands you in ſuch ſtead, and returnes ſo frequently upon you) I have already examined, and diſcovered the miſtakings of it; and muſt now tell you againe, that when the queſtion is by the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent proved by any <hi>medium,</hi> it muſt never be lawfull for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55236:90"/>
to deny it againe any farther then by denying the proofe on which it was inferred; for this would be the denying the concluſion, and <hi>petitio principii</hi> againe. The reſpondent in this caſe cannot <hi>exact the queſtion as his own,</hi> nor any otherwiſe defend it, then by repelling the weapons brought againſt him. As for your great ſimile of denying the <hi>motion of the earth,</hi> and your ſtanding to maintaine your ſaying; if you doe this by any other meanes then by denying or anſwering the proofes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced againſt you, this is not the reſpondents part, but will, when you have done what you can, appeare to be that vulgar <hi>Sophiſme.</hi> It being certaine that when a thing is queſtioned betwixt two, the affirming without proofe is <hi>begging</hi> it, and it being not the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondents</hi> part to prove (or if he doe, he becomes <hi>opponent</hi>) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes neceſſarily, that the reſpondent that in time of diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion affirmes, muſt either ceaſe to be <hi>respondent,</hi> or elſe <hi>begge the queſtion.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the very thing which is diſproved in that place, and then the bare repeating it over againe, will be but a meane kinde of vindication.

            <q>Ibid. <hi>B.</hi> I have ſhewed the reaſon why.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> When an argument is framed on a double <hi>ſuppoſition</hi>; without diſputing the truth of either, 'tis not to be allowed the <hi>reſpondent</hi> to anſwer, by denying the truth of either of the things <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> for they are <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> in that diſpute, but not <hi>diſputed</hi> of. As for example, if the queſtion were, [<hi>Whether ſuppoſing Adam were not falne, and Chriſt were come, the coming of Chriſt could be for the ſinne of Adam.</hi>] doe you thinke 'twould be tolerable for the reſpondent to avoid ſome argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55236:90"/>
brought againſt him, by ſaying that it was abſolutely falſe to ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> was not falne, whereas 'twas true that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was come? This would certainly be ſo groſſe and impoſſible to be juſtified, that I ſhould ſuſpect any mans fidelity, that ſhould tell me, he had rendred a ſatisfying reaſon why this ſhould be. And this is your caſe at this time.</p>
            <q>Ibid. <hi>C.</hi> Whether ſhe be infallible or no, ſhe is like to be wiſer than any private man. And this point cannot be in controverſie with a wiſe man, and therefore here is no <hi>petitio principii.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a rare way of replying, when a diſcourſe hath been proved guilty of a <hi>petitio principii,</hi> to ſay 'tis impoſſible it ſhould, and when a thing is denied, to ſay it cannot be in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, I ſhall yeild you the <hi>Church</hi> may be wiſer than any private man, yet not conceive it to follow (unleſſe ſhe be alſo <hi>infallible)</hi> that when a private man and the Church differ, ſhe muſt alwaies be in the right. He that is much wiſer than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may yet in ſome particular be miſtaken, when that other is in the right, yea and may be adviſed and reformed in ſuch a particular, by one that is not ſo wiſe as he. This you may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the matter in hand, not ſo farre as to preferre the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of any one man before the Church in generall, but onely ſo, as not to pronounce it <hi>infallible.</hi> I might tell you farther, that a member of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> aſſenting fully to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of that <hi>Church,</hi> and ſo diſcharging the duty of a private man in preferring the judgement of the <hi>Church</hi> (whereof he is a member) before his owne judgement, may yet doubt of ſome things affirmed by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not make the compariſon between a private mans judgement, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Church,</hi> but onely betwixt one particular <hi>Church</hi> and another. But after all this, I might have ſpared any, or all theſe Anſwers, and doe now onely deſire you to looke back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, and you will ſoone ſee what no ground is to be found there of your Annotation.</p>

            <q>Ib. <hi>E.</hi> This argument which the Inquirer impugnes, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his owne making, and none of ours, yet for all that, the argument is not like a Ballad as good backward as forward, as M. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> putting it a little differently from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer, would have it.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a darke ſpeech which I doe not clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: if the meaning be, that you judge the ill <hi>ſucceſſe of his Lordſhips ſearches by the event,</hi> and the <hi>fault</hi> of them by the <hi>ſemblance, &amp;c.</hi> I muſt then tell you, that the firſt is a very ill grounded judgement, for no event hath proved the ilneſſe of that ſucceſſe, (unleſſe like thoſe in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> you count them the <hi>greateſt Sinners on whom the Tower of</hi> Siloah <hi>fell</hi>; or like him of late, that being willing to paſſe his opinion on a learned mans choice of a ſide in the differences in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> ſaid onely this, <hi>Illud notum eſt, partes quas ſecutus non eſt praevaluiſſe; ſi quis infelicitati hoc tribuat, ego prudentiam non probo minus fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licem</hi>; and <hi>Buſbequius</hi> tels us ſomewhat like of the Turkes judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of good and bad enterprizes) but rather on your owne principles I have already proved, that they muſt be <hi>good</hi> in the <hi>ſucceſſe,</hi> which were ſo happy in propoſing.</p>
            <p>But then what you meane by the <hi>ſemblance</hi> of <hi>his making a ſearch in manner as he ought,</hi> by which you judge the <hi>fault</hi> in his <hi>ſearches</hi>; I muſt confeſſe I doe not at all underſtand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be faine to confeſſe my ſelfe overcome and maſtered, though not by the reaſon, yet by the obſcurity of your writing; and if that be a victory, I wiſh you much good of it.</p>
            <q>To the Concluſion. <hi>A.</hi> I here contend no more, but that our Church may be infallible, notwithſtanding any thing the Enquirer hath objected. That ſhe is ſo, hath in due place been proved by others.</q>

            <q>Ibid. <hi>B.</hi> If you would doe it, we then would thinke it more than poſſible.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The meaning of this annotation if it be ſence, muſt be this, that if we Proteſtants could or would finde place in you for Scripture and Reaſon to make <hi>impreſſion,</hi> you Papiſts would then thinke it more then poſſible you might be deceived. Which if it be the meaning, I muſt then onely reply by prayer, that God would ſo ſoften your hearts, that they might be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of that <hi>impreſſion.</hi> But if the words be indeed no ſence, but yet miſtaken for ſome other words, which would be ſence, then the likelieſt thing that I can imagine, is, that you would have ſaid ſomewhat to this purpoſe. [<hi>If you Proteſtants could by Scripture or Reaſon diſprove our Doctrines, we then would thinke it more than poſſible for us to be deceived</hi>] Which though it were no huge Conceſſion, yet I ſhould be glad to have it from you, for then in effect your grounding of Faith on your <hi>Infallibility</hi> would be laid aſide, and then there would be no more truth in any individuall Doctrine of your <hi>Church,</hi> than <hi>Scripture</hi> or Reaſon would inferre, abſtracted from the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> which is all that at this time we demand from you.</p>
            <p>And in that we are a little importunate (ſeeing we have you now in a ſeeming good humour:) Firſt, becauſe there is ſo much danger in inſiſting on that priviledge of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> even in any particular, wherein men are in the right, becauſe he that really doth <hi>ſtand,</hi> yet may (and therefore ought to <hi>take heed leſt he) fall,</hi> but moſt eminently, when a man chances to be in the wrong. He that miſtakes firſt in a piece of Divinity, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a perſwaſion that he cannot <hi>miſtake,</hi> ſealeth up that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, obſtructs all entrance, all approach, all poſſibility of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> is fortified impregnable againſt all aſſaults either of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55236:95"/>
reaſon, or even the ſpirit of truth; and by that one errour hath a kind of propriety in all other that can by the ſame hand be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to him. Secondly, becauſe we cannot but obſerve the prudence of your <hi>fellow-Champions,</hi> Maſter <hi>Knot</hi> &amp;c. now of late, who have choſen to vary the method from inſiſting on the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall points of difference betwixt us, and them (proving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the onely true <hi>Church</hi> from the particular truths profeſt by them, and by no others) to this other more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious way of putting off all together by whole-ſale, of conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the truth of all their aſſertions from the unerrableneſſe of the Aſſerter, manifeſting that they are in the <hi>right,</hi> becauſe 'tis impoſſible they ſhould be in the <hi>wrong,</hi> uſing all skill to perſwade this one point, and then confident on good grounds, that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be reſiſted. Theſe two things put together, will adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe you, how ſeaſonable an admonition it is to you, that you will beſtow a little paines on your Brethren, to perſwade them they are <hi>mortall</hi> or <hi>fallible</hi>; and then againe Reaſon and Scripture may finde reception, and be agreed on the umpire betwixt us and we ſhall promiſe ſincerely, that whatever that ſhall, <hi>ſententiâ latâ,</hi> award to you, we will moſt gladly yeild, and never breake with you, till you breake from that umpirage.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this place, whereto your Annotation was affixt, the diſcourſe was upon a ſuppoſition, that your <hi>Infallibility</hi> were an <hi>errour,</hi> (which I in that caſe affirm'd, would be the moſt <hi>dangerous,</hi> becauſe moſt <hi>prolificall</hi> complicated errour imaginable) and will you ſay that upon that <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> there would be a <hi>probability of fewer errours</hi>? Will the thinking I cannot fall make me ſtand the longer? is there no advantage to be made of <hi>care,</hi> and <hi>caution,</hi> and <hi>feare</hi>? or is there a diſadvantage in them? This is brave <hi>fiduciary doctrine,</hi> I muſt thinke <hi>infallibly</hi> I ſhall be ſaved, and that I cannot fall away, and the thinking that, will make it more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that I ſhall be <hi>ſaved,</hi> and ſhall <hi>not fall.</hi> I confeſſe I had thought that <hi>humility</hi> were a readier way both to truth and Heaven, then either of theſe <hi>preſumptions.</hi> What you meane by adding (by way of proofe of that ſaying) that if your <hi>Church</hi> were <hi>fallible,</hi> ſhe would not be <hi>fallible</hi> as a private man, I confeſſe I cannot gueſſe. If ſhe would not, I conceive, this would be but little advantage on her ſide, for her <hi>fallibility</hi> would be a greater ſnare and ſcandall, and more apt to draw into errour thoſe that conceived her <hi>infallible,</hi> than any private mans <hi>fallibility</hi> would doe. For that which you adde of <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>unity,</hi> if it were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be joyn'd with fewer errours, I grant it would be an advantage, but at a time, when that <hi>infallibility</hi> was ſuppoſed to be one errour, and that prov'd moſt apt to produce a multitude; ſurely this ought not to have been ſuppoſed, any more, than that we ſhould have more errours ſtill, though 'twere not at the ſame time ſuppoſed that we have.</p>

Though therefore theſe motives make our faith but credible in an eminent and a high degree, yet the veracity of God is at hand to ſupply, ſeale and confirme all, and with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority thereof, to make the aſſurance abſolute. This method of reſolving and reducing faith,<note place="margin">Iren. l. 3. c. 4.

               <p>Secondly, ſo much veneration is due to lawes, though never ſo unjuſt, that they are nevertheleſſe in conſcience to be obeyed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they ſhould be publiquely and knownely found contrary to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter authority then that was by which they were enacted; that is to ſay, to the law of God, or Nature, Therefore they are not to be judged or cenſured by any private man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, being diſcovered to be unjuſt, they derogate nothing at all from the authority of the reſt, no more then the unjuſt lawes of ſome Emperours did from the body of the law Imperiall. For though all of them were made by the ſame Authors, yet not by the ſame authority; becauſe for the making of one ſort, there was good authority derived from God; but, for the making of the other, there was none at all, but ſuch as could not make it.</p>

               <p>Firſt, to the 1 <hi>Sect.</hi> That for the matter of fact which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes this treatiſe, I have already averred thoſe truths, that will not permit any reaſonable man to believe that this was ſo indeed, [<hi>a firſt draught, &amp;c.</hi>] for it was confeſt by him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. to be a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond draught.

Fourthly, For the <hi>licenſe</hi> I can ſay nothing, (but that I conceive it might as eaſily be gotten, as to what you have already made publique, if you had a minde to it) nor indeed force you to acknowledge or vouch any line of this booke, but onely tell you, that thoſe words in your firſt Chapter of complaint, [<hi>That there was no notice given of licenſe for it be publiſhed, and have the advantage to be diſperſed abroad in many copies</hi>] and that [<hi>for want of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters helpe it ſhall lie concealed, and in much reſtraint, yea and be in danger to periſh</hi>] ſeemed to me to ſignifie your willingneſſe then to make it publique; and if you have ſince retracted that deſigne, I hope ſo weake an anſwer, as ſome of your friends boaſt this to be, did not diſcourage you. I ſhall rather thinke it was modeſty, or elſe deſigne, that you choſe rather to have diſclaimed, then commended your owne, and thought it would appear more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for you to have it extorted from you, or (if it ſhould prove leſſe ſplendid) yet more tolerable, to have beene raviſht from you then proſtituted.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond <hi>Sect.</hi> I anſwer, that you had ſaid that before in <hi>annot.</hi> to the <hi>concl.</hi> A. And the anſwer there belongs to this <hi>Sect.</hi> and if you had made good what you ſay was your drift, you ſhould be pronounced conquerour.</p>
               <p>To the third <hi>Sect.</hi> You have taken a good courſe to defend
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55236:100"/>
                  <hi>infallibility,</hi> by ſetting up for it your ſelfe, and affirming that no reply can be made to you in that matter, becauſe it depends onely upon your judgement, which none can know but whom you tell it; But, good Sir, your Authors do tell us, that there is nothing <hi>infallible</hi> but the <hi>Church,</hi> and when they have done ſo, we may know your <hi>outward</hi> acts, for ſuch are your writings, though your <hi>inward</hi> we pretend not to pry into.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. I anſwer, that one argument of his <hi>Lordſhips,</hi> taken from your affirmed <hi>fallibility</hi> of <hi>Reaſon, Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> is moſt prodigiouſly by you call'd <hi>three pillars.</hi> And how <hi>Sampſon-like</hi> you have broken them downe, the Reader muſt judge; if you are ſo confident, I have here expreſt my ſelfe your ſervant, by helping you to a publique tryall.</p>

               <p>To <hi>Sect.</hi> 8. Be you alſo pleaſed to produce your conſent of <hi>Antiquity</hi> certainly expounding <hi>Scripture</hi> to inferre your <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>; and that ſhall be yielded you alſo, but I conceive thoſe writers of yours have not done it, and whenſoever you pleaſe, I ſhall be ready to examine their teſtimonies with you.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. I anſwer. That we have allowed a ſence, wherein the <hi>Church univerſall</hi> may be ſtiled <hi>infallible,</hi> and that to ſave my ſelfe the paines of examining your teſtimonies (though ſome without examining I know to be ill cited) I ſhall grant it in that ſence to be ſo; But then to your ſecond propoſition, (be

it either [<hi>I deny that they teach not</hi>] or [<hi>I affirme that it holds</hi>] it matters little) <hi>that the Roman Church is the true Church,</hi> I anſw. That if there be emphaſis in the particle [<hi>the</hi>] in the praedicate, ſo that it ſignifie the [<hi>Catholick] Church</hi> in the former propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis then abſolutely falſe, that the Fathers ſay any ſuch thing. And you are prudent to cite none to that ridiculous purpoſe. But if you meane, that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is a <hi>true Church,</hi> (ſo you doe not meane that all it ſaith is true) as we grant that, ſo we challenge you to prove, that ever the <hi>ancient Church</hi> thought any ſuch <hi>particular Church</hi> of one denomination to be <hi>infallible,</hi> When you pleaſe to produce your teſtimonies, you ſhall receive anſwer to them.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. Concerning the motives of <hi>Faith,</hi> You might have ſpared that paines, it being not at all concluded by you here or before, that that <hi>infallibility</hi> is built on the ſame grounds with <hi>Chriſtanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. If you had never ſuch ſolid reaſons to perſwade you; that your <hi>Church</hi> had the truth (as I ſhould not need to deny, were it not for your denying the <hi>cup</hi> to the <hi>Laity</hi> againſt Scripture, and your keeping the <hi>Scripture</hi> in an <hi>unknowne tongue,</hi> and ſome other ſuch defects <hi>in faciendis,</hi> but rather charge you that you have more then the truth, <hi>viz.</hi> many errours mixt with the truth) this would prove but a very weake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, that your <hi>Church</hi> is [the <hi>true Church</hi>] in the excluſive notion, <hi>i. e.</hi> that no other is the <hi>Church,</hi> but that: for <hi>having the truth,</hi> doth not ſignifie a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> or incloſure of it, or that no body elſe can have it; And if by [the <hi>true Church</hi>] you meane no more, but a true part, you know we doe not queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, nor affirme that your errors though many, have turn'd you <hi>in non Eccleſiam, into a no Church.</hi> As for your Concordance with the Fathers which you ſay you have, I anſwere, that in thoſe things wherein you and we conſent, we ſhall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to grant it to you (but yet muſt remember you, that you would not allow that to be a proofe of your being <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>) but in thoſe other which we call errors in you, we chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge you to produce an <hi>univerſall Concordance.</hi> You goe on; that you proue your Church by no other way then <hi>Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is perſwaded unto <hi>Infidels.</hi> I hope your meaning is, that

you prove your Church to be a <hi>true Church,</hi> and that ſhall be granted you without your proofe: but that it is the <hi>only true</hi> one, or the <hi>infallible</hi> one, I hope you have not <hi>miracles</hi> for that, (if you have, you have trifled away a great deale of time in not telling us of them) nor <hi>revelation</hi> from Heaven, nor uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall <hi>tradition</hi> to aſſure you, (what you affirme ſo confidently) that the <hi>Infallibility of your Church is the whole frame of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi> And therefore what you learnedly adde about the <hi>verba ſignorum,</hi> or <hi>ſigna realia, ſignes</hi> and <hi>oſtenſions, &amp;c.</hi> by which you go about to prove <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> I muſt profeſſe to edifie me but little in point of the <hi>infallibility</hi> of your <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe that is ſo diſtant a thing from it.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. Your affirmation, that the true <hi>Catholique Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is the true <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> (if that be the onely thing you aime at) ſhall be willingly granted you, all the queſtion will be, whether all your doctrines, <hi>that of denying the cup to the Laity &amp;c.</hi> be that <hi>Catholique Religion.</hi> And ſure to him that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that, all the <hi>characteriſmes,</hi> &amp;c. all your <hi>Propheticall predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi> will give but little ſatisfaction, and no more will the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Faith, perfection of heroick actions of profeſſors,</hi> nor the <hi>conveyance from age to age,</hi> by the <hi>Prime Eccleſiaſticall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Pastors in the Sea of Rome,</hi> becauſe that of the <hi>ſub u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicâ ſpecie, &amp;c.</hi> which we quarrell at in you, might as well be pretended to have teſtimonies out of the preſent Articles of our <hi>Church,</hi> as out of theſe. If there be any of theſe evidences, or moreover of <hi>Reaſon, Scripture, Antiquity,</hi> on your ſide for ſuch controverted particulars, I beſeech you let them be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, or elſe you may be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but yet corrupt in theſe particulars, your being a true Church will not pronounce you <hi>infallible,</hi> your <hi>Church of Rome Primitive</hi> may have the truth, and your <hi>Moderne Rome</hi> be filled with errors. And therefore you may ſpare the paines of proving (what we have no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at this time to deny) that God engages <hi>his veracity to make good thoſe things, for which he gives us ſuch rationall meanes of proofe to induce our aſſent,</hi> For what ever elſe is, your <hi>infallibility,</hi> or your other errours, for which we charge you, are none of theſe things. And if you mark it, that which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your diſcourſe) gives us ſuch aſſurance of the truth

of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> is the <hi>oſtenſions, miracles,</hi> publick acts of <hi>Gods providence,</hi> not the <hi>Infallibility</hi> naturally inherent either in your <hi>Church,</hi> or in any particular ſociety of men, nor the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God that any ſuch ſociety ſhall be <hi>infallible,</hi> and <hi>viſible</hi> to all that it is that <hi>infallible.</hi> As for that which you covertly caſt into the heape of the motives of <hi>Faith, [that 'twas conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from age to age in the ſucceſſion of Paſtors in the chiefe ſeat</hi>] that is no more a ground of the truth of <hi>Chriſtanity,</hi> then its <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> in all other ſeats, as I conceive you have your ſelfe let fall alſo. The truth is the Preaching the Goſpel over all the world, and the reception in ſo great a part of it, is an argument of the truth of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> (among many others) becauſe it is the fulfilling of a Prophecy of their <hi>ſounds going out into all Lands,</hi> But this is farre from concluding the peculiar priviledge of <hi>infallibility</hi> of thoſe, who are under the <hi>Roman ſubjection.</hi> By which 'tis cleare, that what you cite out of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and Saint <hi>Aug.</hi> comes home no better to your point of <hi>infallibility,</hi> then <hi>Ariſtotles Analytick principles,</hi> which in the ſame place (and elſewhere) you cite alſo. And therefore if all you ſay in that long Section were yeelded, (concerning the motives to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> and your way by <hi>bringing to the Church,</hi> &amp;c.) yet would you be as farre to ſeek as ever, concerning your pretended <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</hi>

And what if in ſome paſſages of <hi>Antiquity</hi> the <hi>Sea of Rome</hi> ſhould be found to be the <hi>Praetorian</hi> or <hi>Admirall,</hi> in your ſtile, <hi>i. e.</hi> the prime or principall Sea, would this prove her <hi>infallible,</hi> the <hi>Praetorian</hi> may ſpring a leake, as well as any other, and in caſe it ſhould, I doe not conceive, that all other Ships of that fleet, were bound to doe ſo too, or elſe be counted <hi>fugitive,</hi> becauſe they are unwilling to run that unhappy fate of ſinne, or errour with her.

way, more <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> becauſe more <hi>humble</hi> and more <hi>charitable,</hi> (and beyond all, probably the moſt <hi>peacefull</hi> too) Is, to make the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as 'tis interpreted by the <hi>antient Fathers,</hi> the ground of our belief for all the <hi>ſubſtantiall, i. e.</hi> plaine parts of <hi>Faith</hi>; to define as few of this nature, as the <hi>Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> may be diſcerned to have done, to command and require obedience, and aſſent to theſe from all our Inferiours under our authority, and to proceed to <hi>Eccleſiaſticall admonitions, in caſe of errour, to cenſures,</hi> in caſe of <hi>contumacy,</hi> but to <hi>blood,</hi> never purely for <hi>Religion,</hi> nor too often for Religion <hi>in ordine ad tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralia</hi>; To tolerate with meekneſſe, thoſe that are contrary minded, in all things that are not either of the number of theſe few, very few <hi>neceſſariò credenda,</hi> or that have not a neceſſary connexion and immediate influence on practice, and good life; This as it is farre from either pretending to <hi>infallibility,</hi> or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting looſe the reines to licentiouſneſſe, ſo is it the happieſt, moſt laſting, durable temper of a <hi>Church,</hi> moſt agreeable to all thoſe ends that Chriſt hath made moſt eſtimable to us in his <hi>Gospel,</hi> and ſo will be farre from that feare of yours, of betraying us to a deſerting of the <hi>Chriſtian faith</hi>

As for your judgement upon his <hi>Lordſhip, that he was able to ſay more againſt an infallibility then for it, and that in the one he hath ſhewed his ſtrength, in the other not,</hi> I eaſily believe, and muſt thinke my ſelfe bound to confeſſe, becauſe I have ſeen a Booke of his <hi>againſt Infallibility,</hi> but never any for it. If this muſt be thought a fault in him, I muſt be content to lie under your ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt cenſure for the ſame crime alſo, and <hi>ſic habes confitentes reos,</hi> patiently expecting what you will pronounce againſt us.</p>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55236:103"/>
I cannot readily ſatisfie my Reader. The moſt I can gueſſe is, that in our meeting we fell into ſome diſcourſe and difference about the nature of <hi>unjust Lawes,</hi> whether they might be ſaid to be <hi>Lawes,</hi> or no. And perchance your charity led you now out of your rode to informe me in this matter; if 'twere onely ſo, I muſt acknowledge it an obligation, and ſhall thanke you for that, though I chance to diſſent from you.</p>
               <p>And that matter I perceive will be ſoone ſtated: Thus: That Lawes, if (conſidered in reſpect of the matter of them) they be found to command me to doe ought, which by any ſuperiour law, 'tis unlawfull for me to doe, they are then unjuſt Lawes, be the <hi>Legiſlatour</hi> never ſo lawfully my <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>; and in this caſe 'tis true, that God hath not given him <hi>power</hi> to make them; meaning thereby ſuch a power, that he may make them without being <hi>unjuſt</hi>; but yet another power he hath given him, to wit, ſuch an one, as that, if he exerciſe it thus againſt God the Doners will, yet it ſhall not be lawfull for any man, or ſociety of men on earth, to call him to account, and puniſh him, to reſiſt violently, or reduce him <hi>in ordinem</hi>; Onely God that hath given him <hi>poteſtatem in genere</hi> (which is <hi>libera ad utroſque actus,</hi> power to make good or evill lawes, but withall reſtrained by a command from the law of <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> and limited by that law onely to the lawfull exerciſe of it, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>good lawes)</hi> is to receive an account of the <hi>Talent</hi> given him to trade with as his <hi>Steward,</hi> and to enquire whet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er he hath uſed it well or no. Thus much, unleſſe I am miſtaken, your diſcourſe gives me reaſon to thinke granted by you. And from thence I muſt conclude, that any ſuch <hi>abuſe</hi> of <hi>power</hi> in the <hi>Law-giver,</hi> though it be in him aberration from the rule in reſpect of God, yet ſtill is an act that hath ſome effect on the man which is borne, or lives under that law, though not to oblige him to doe what is commanded him, yet to oblige him to non-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and ſuffering patiently, if the <hi>Law-giver</hi> be ſo wicked to tyrannize over him. Which obligation to <hi>paſſive,</hi> though not <hi>active</hi> Obedience, is the reſult of a Law, if not properly ſo called in your notion of it, yet very lawfully and intelligibly ſo called, as I have interpreted it; And for the <hi>propriety</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety</hi> of the word, I ſhall not much contend with you, ſo the ſubſtance be agreed on; and yet 'twere eaſie enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay

you with the quotations of <hi>Schoole-men</hi> and <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> which make no ſcruple to uſe the word in my ſence, and to anſwer the places you have produced, and ſhew that 'twas onely in that ſence which we yeild that they did deny it. But enough of this.</p>
               <p>For your 15 <hi>Section.</hi> What it ſignifies, or whether it would, I cannot I confeſſe divine; 'twas I conceive in you an exceſſive act of liberality, that you thought might be for my turne; and, though I know not how at this time I ſhall reap profit by it, yet I cannot but accept your good intentions. And ſo being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly weary of a very thankleſſe taske, I bid you heartily farewell.</p>
