            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Earing, when I was beyond Seas, <hi>Herauldry</hi> look'd upon as the <hi>Science of Gentlemen,</hi> and finding it taught as such in the <hi>Academies,</hi> I resolved to know somewhat of it, upon design, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to serve my Countrey, then to satisfie my Curiosity: For it was justly admir'd, that We on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of all Nations had never publish'd any thing, to let the World know what marks of Honour our Predecessors had gain'd. And having had great Intimacy with a most learned Advocat at <hi>Bourge</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd over all <hi>Europe</hi> for his skill in this Art, it was easie for me to find that there was one Book yet wanting upon this Subject; for some had treated this <hi>Science</hi> as meer Law, without understanding the practice of Blazon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Bartolus, Chassaneus,</hi> &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> whilst others handled it as a part of the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> as <hi>Guilim, Menestrier, Colombier,</hi> and others, without being bred to the <hi>Law,</hi> which requires a whole Man, and his whole Age. To reconcile which two, I was induced to write some Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, whilst I was young, to joyn the Theory with the Practice, and to examine and polish the Principles and Terms of that excellent Art: And if these serve to Please or Instruct you my Country-men, I have satisfied my Ambition, and got my Reward. Having also

design'd to learn from our old Rights and Evidents, the <hi>Origin</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of our Stiles, and by what steps they arrived at their present Perfection, (in which Work I have made considerable Progress) I did from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Papers I saw, and from the old Chartularies of our <hi>Abbacies,</hi> draw an account of our Families; But because I want time to fit them for the Press, I resolve to leave the Manuscript, as a new Testimony of my kindess, to my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey.</p>

            <head>THE SCIENCE OF HERALDRY. BOOK 1.</head>
            <head>CHAP. 1. The Origin and Use of ARMS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ERALDRY is that Science, which teacheth us to give or know Arms; suteable to the Worth or Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bearer.</p>
            <p>Arms may be defin'd to be Marks of Hereditary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, given or authorized by some Supream Power, to gratify the Bearer, or distinguish Families.</p>
            <p>The first name given to such Bearings, was, <hi>Imagines, scutis qualibus apud Troiam pugnatum est, continebantur imagines, Plin. lib.</hi> 35. <hi>c.</hi> 3. The <hi>Grecians</hi> called them, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Conan. l.</hi> 9. <hi>com. jur. civil. c.</hi> 2. <hi>n.</hi> 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Cujac. observes, ad l.</hi> 13. <hi>f. ad l. Cor. de fals.</hi> The <hi>Civilians</hi> call them, <hi>Insignia; l.</hi> 2. <hi>in princip. f. de his qui not. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fam. l. eos. sect</hi> 2. <hi>f. defalsis.</hi> But <hi>Bart.</hi> is tax'd for, <hi>insigniis &amp; insigniorum</hi>; whereas the true Latine is, <hi>insignibus &amp; insignium,</hi> us'd in the former texts. Some call them, <hi>Insignia Armorum,</hi> the Latine of which is also doubted by <hi>Tiraquel. cap. num.</hi> 19. Others call them, <hi>Tesserae Gentilitiae</hi>; and in the civil Law they are called, <hi>Tituli, arg. Rub. &amp; l. un. C. de his qui potent. nom. &amp; ibi Bart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> call them <hi>Wappen,</hi> or <hi>Clenodia</hi>: The <hi>Italians, Carmas</hi>: The <hi>French, Armoiries</hi>: The <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English, Arms</hi>; from the Latine, <hi>Arma,</hi> which was us'd in this sense even amongst the <hi>Romans, Virgil,</hi>
               <q>Et genti nomen dedit, armÃ¡que fixit Troiae.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These Arms are distinguished from <hi>Hieroglyphicks, Symbols, Emblems</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,</hi> in that, these require no fixt colours, as Arms do.</p>
            <p>The Emblem represents some moral lesson, but Arms are the testimony
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64440:7"/>
of some noble action: Arms are Hereditary, but these are assum'd, and altered at pleasure.</p>
            <p>Some think, that the giving of Arms arose from the example of <hi>Iacob</hi> blessing his children; in which he gave them Marks of distinction; as <hi>Iudah,</hi> a Lyon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And certain it is, that the Tribes did bear these upon their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs. Others ascribe their invention to the <hi>Germans,</hi> and some to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> Some think, the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> gave the first Arms, to excite their Souldiers to noble actions, upon their invading <hi>Italie.</hi> Others ascribe the exactness of this Invention to <hi>Charles</hi> the Great; <hi>Aldrovan. l.</hi> 1. Others to <hi>Henry</hi> I. in <hi>Anno</hi> 986. <hi>Hop. cap.</hi> 3. But by comparing all these opinions, it is clear, that the wearing thir Marks of distinction, is a <hi>Iure Gentium,</hi> and a part of the Law of Nations: For even the barbarous Nations, such as the <hi>Cimbri, Teutones, &amp;c.</hi> were observed by <hi>Plutarch in vita Marii, gessisse in armis pictas ferarum imagines</hi>: And <hi>Hopping</hi> asserts, <hi>That he hath seen a shield from China, charg'd with a Panther in a field, Orr</hi>: yet certainly, the digesting these Customs into an Art, and the subjecting them to Rules, must be ascribed to <hi>Charlemaign</hi> and <hi>Fredrick Barbarossa</hi>; for they did begin and grow with the <hi>Feudal</hi> Law, <hi>Paul, Iov. &amp; Mart. Crus. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>part.</hi> 2. <hi>cap ult.</hi> And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not here forget, that some learned men have ascrib'd the first wearing of colored Shields, to the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi>: And that the wearing of Clothes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse colours, rose from their conforming their clothes to the variety of their shields, <hi>Limneus lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de jur. pub. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>num.</hi> 6. <hi>Speidel in not. jurid. histor. verb. Wappen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reasons of inventing this Art, and giving such Marks of distinction, and the advantages arising from the knowledge of Heraldry and Arms, are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The great design that men had to perpetuate their own great Actions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The desire that Governours had, to encourage others to do great things by rewarding with a cheap kind of Immortality what their deserving Subjects did. Thus <hi>Marshals</hi> predecessors got three <hi>Pales gules,</hi> on <hi>a chief, Orr,</hi> by the Kings dipping his finger in <hi>Camus</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> blood, and drawing three <hi>Pales gules</hi> upon his shield, after that <hi>Camus</hi> was defeat in a battel, in which the first <hi>Keith</hi> fought most generously, <hi>Anno</hi> 1006.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The advantage of distinguishing Friends from Enemies, who could not be better known, then by their several Bearings, and thus <hi>Vegel lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de re milit.</hi> tells us, That the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions were thus distinguished, <hi>Virgil. lib.</hi> 2.</p>
            <q>Mutemus clypeos, Danaumque insignia nobis Aptemus.</q>
            <p n="4">4. To show a respect to Religion. Thus the Christians bore the Cross, at their expeditions into the Holy-land, which were therefore called, <hi>Croissads</hi>: And the <hi>Pringles</hi> and others, bear Escalops, to show their devote Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: Of which these shells were the Badges, and for which Pilgrimage, the <hi>Pringles</hi> were first called Pilgrims, and thereafter by corruption <hi>Pringle.</hi> For the same reason doth the <hi>Dowglass</hi> carry a Heart, in remembrance of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to the Holy-land, with King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce</hi>'s heart; which was to be, and is buried there, at the special command of that pious Prince, about the year, 1328.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To show from what Country the Bearers came: Thus the <hi>Maxwels</hi> and <hi>Ramsays</hi> bear the Eagle, to show their descent from <hi>Germany.</hi> The <hi>Ruthvens</hi> the Arms of <hi>Portugal</hi>; from which King they are said to be descended: And the name of <hi>Marjoribanks</hi> bear the Cushion, to show that they were <hi>Iohnstouns</hi> originally.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64440:7"/>6. To show their Alliances. Thus we quarter Arms; and by this means, the memory of great Families, and even of Clans and Sirnames, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preserved. Thus <hi>Scotland,</hi> by bearing a double Tressour flori, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre flori, is remembred of their League betwixt <hi>France</hi> and them in the Reigns of <hi>Achaius</hi> and <hi>Charlemaign.</hi> Thus there is no Monument of the <hi>Randolphs,</hi> but by quartering their Cushions with the Arms of the <hi>Dumbars</hi>; nor of the <hi>Pepdies,</hi> but by the <hi>Pepingoes,</hi> born by the Earle of <hi>Hume</hi>: Nor of the <hi>Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords,</hi> but by the three Bars <hi>Ermine,</hi> born by the Earle of <hi>Tweddail,</hi> as their Arms: Nor would have any known that there had been a Lord <hi>Brechin</hi> of the name of <hi>Wishart,</hi> if the Marquess of <hi>Dowglass</hi> had not quartered his Arms, as having married the Heretrix.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To remember Princes of their obligations to some Families. Thus King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce</hi> gave the house of <hi>Winton</hi> a falling Crown supported by a Sword; to show, that the <hi>Seatons</hi> had supported the Crown when it was in a distrest condition: which <hi>Seaton</hi> of <hi>Barns</hi> yet bears, because he got the Land which was dispon'd, with the Arms: And to <hi>Veitch,</hi> a Bullocks head, to remember posterity, that the Bearer had assisted that King with Aliment, in bringing some Bullocks in His great distress.</p>
            <p n="8">8. To instruct descent by blood; and therefore Arms are called <hi>Tesserae Gentilitiae.</hi> Thus the <hi>Weems</hi> and <hi>Fyfe,</hi> are known to be Cadets of <hi>Macduff,</hi> and the <hi>Colquhouns</hi> and <hi>M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>farlans</hi> Cadets of the Family of <hi>Lennox,</hi> by their Arms; and these are surer Marks of Consanguinity than the Sirname, as may be known by many instances; and among others the <hi>Shaws</hi> in the North, are known to be <hi>M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>intoshes</hi> by their Arms.</p>
            <p n="9">9. To show, that the Bearers possest once great Imployments. Thus the Earle of <hi>Southesks</hi> Predecessours did bear a Cup in an Escotcheon, upon the Eagles breast, to show, that his Predecessours were Cup-bearers, <hi>Regi olim Ã  Pateris, ut praelibaret &amp; auro, Ista notis certis perhibent insignia gentis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Largo</hi> two Ships, to show, that his Predecessours were Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals. Thus <hi>Burnet</hi> carries a Hunting-horn in his shield, and a High-lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a hunting garb, and Grew-hounds for his supporters; to show, that he was His Majesties Forrester in that northern Forrest, as <hi>Forrester</hi> of that ilk is in the South: for which he also carries three Hunting horns. The Earle of <hi>Holdernesse, Ramsay,</hi> carried a sword Pale-wayes, to show, that he and his Successours had right to carry the Sword of State, the day of <hi>Gowries</hi> Conspiracy, as a reward for killing <hi>Gowrie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. These shew ofttimes to the Bearers, to whom they have been oblidged. Thus the <hi>Dundasses</hi> bear for their Supporters, the Lyon, which was the Arms of the Earls of <hi>March,</hi> to show, their Support they got from that Nobleman; and they show the intimacy and friendship of the Giver. Thus King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce</hi> having carried as a privat Badge three Lawrel leaves, with this word, <hi>Sub Sole, sub Vmbra virens</hi>: He gave to <hi>Irvin, Drum</hi>'s Predecessour, who had been constantly His Armour-bearer, the three Hollen leaves, which is a kind of Lawrell.</p>
            <p n="11">11. These shew the Bearers Antiquity, and thus <hi>Macdowal</hi> (for though <hi>Macdou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> may be <hi>Macdonald,</hi> yet <hi>Macdowal</hi> is not) is known to be amongst the ancien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Sirnames of <hi>Scotland,</hi> because he bears a Lyon collard, with a broken Crown about his neck, in remembrance of <hi>Dovallus,</hi> his Predecessours (as is alledg'd) killing <hi>Nothatus,</hi> who was a Tyrant, and who liv'd many years before Christ: which (if true) are the ancientest Arms I ever saw, belonging to any private Family in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64440:8"/>12. These let us know, if the Bearers be Noblemen or Gentlemen, and what their Dignity is; as will appear by several Casques and Crowns.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Shield, and ofttimes the Signet, made the Bearers, who were kill'd in the crowd, to be known, that they might be honourably buried.</p>
            <p n="14">14. They being appended, inform us of the true Sirnames of the Granters, which are become illegible; and thus by the Seals I have found some Charters to be granted by <hi>Menzies</hi> of <hi>Weems,</hi> when we could hardly read the Name: and I have been in Processes, wherein Charters were alledg'd to be false and forg'd, because the Granters true Arms and Seal were not appended.</p>
            <p n="15">15. By these Arms, we are instructed of the right Originations, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Sirnames: And thus we know the name of <hi>Tarbet</hi> to be wrong writ; and that it should be writ, <hi>Turbett,</hi> seing they have three <hi>Turbetts,</hi> fretted proper, for their Arms. And thus we find that <hi>Buchannan</hi> erred, calling the <hi>Winrams, Viniramus</hi>; which gave occasion to some of that name lately, to take a Vine branch for their Arms; for the old Arms is a Ram passant, and were given the first of that name, for being incomparable at a Game wherein men were to wind and turn a strong Ram from the sheep with one hand: whereupon he was also called <hi>Winramme.</hi> Thus the <hi>Trumbles</hi> are <hi>Turnbulls</hi> to their names; and <hi>BoÃ«tius</hi> sayes, <hi>That they were so called, because the first of that name, did turn and divert a mad Bull from killing King</hi> Robert <hi>the</hi> Bruce. Of which Antiquities and Games there is no Record but Heral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry.</p>
            <p n="16">16. These Arms show who have been Founders of Towns, Castles or Churches. Thus the Church of <hi>Durham</hi> is known to be built by the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Erfort</hi> is known to be built by the <hi>French</hi> King, because it bears their Arms, <hi>Dresser</hi> pag. 227.</p>
            <p n="17">17. These inferr a presumptive right of Superiority, <hi>Quando Arma in Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis vel Curiis pinguntur, Bart. tract. de insig.</hi> And thus when the <hi>Millaners</hi> did ingage to be Vassals to the Emperor <hi>Fredrick</hi> the first, they undertook to carry the Arms of the Empire upon the Steeple of their chief Church, <hi>Limn. dejure publ. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>num.</hi> 126. And when <hi>Orknay</hi> and <hi>Zetland</hi> were fully resign'd to the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it was agreed, that the Arms of <hi>Scotland</hi> should be affixt in their publick Courts: And thus the Dukes of <hi>Venice</hi> are known not to have an absolute Jurisdiction, because they are not allowed to represent the Arms of their Family upon the Coin of the publick, <hi>Alberi. ad l. Si qui C. de oper. publ.</hi> And one of their Dukes was severely censur'd by the State, for having contraveened this rule in Heraldry, <hi>Tessaur. decis.</hi> 270. Arms do presume Propriety in moveables especially, to which men have only right by Possession, and not by Writ, <hi>Hopping, cap.</hi> 13. And this is an ordinary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption in all Judicatures, <hi>Nam sicut ex signis signatum, ita ex insigniis Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini rerum cognoscuntur, Tusk. tom.</hi> 1. <hi>conclus.</hi> 516.</p>
            <p n="18">18. These Arms are also most necessar for signing Articles of peace amongst Princes, and Contracts and other Writs amongst private persons; and by them also Knights and Warriours did find out one another in Battels and Tiltings: An example whereof our History gives, in the Lairds of <hi>Drum</hi> and <hi>M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>lean</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Harlaw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. By these the Ships of Enemies are known, and are accordingly confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if taken at Sea; which Lawyers extend so far, that if a Ship carry the Flagg of an enemy, it will be declared Prize, though it belong to a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in amity with the Taker, <hi>Iason. consit.</hi> 163. <hi>h.</hi> 19. Many likewise took
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64440:8"/>
a part of their Superiour or Over-lords Arms, as is observ'd in <hi>Camdens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, Pag.</hi> 157. And thus most of the Sirnames in <hi>Annandale</hi> carry the Arms of the <hi>Bruce</hi>; in <hi>Murray,</hi> some part of the <hi>Murrays</hi> Arms; and in <hi>Tevidale,</hi> the <hi>Dowglass</hi> Arms, or some part thereof.</p>
            <p n="20">20. I confess that Arms are sometimes derived from the Names of the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as <hi>Peacock</hi> bears a <hi>Peacock, Cockburn</hi> a <hi>Cock,</hi> &amp;c. And these are called, <hi>Arma cantantia,</hi> by the Latine; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, by the <hi>Grecians; Des armoiries par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,</hi> by the <hi>French; rebus</hi> or <hi>canting Arms,</hi> by the <hi>English</hi>: and are never presum'd to be Noble Arms, because, it is presumed that if the Bearer had done any generous actions, which deserved Arms, they had never recurred to their Names; yet this Rule holds not still true: for of old, some men got their lands as rewards of great Acts, and Sirnames came not in the mode with us, till the Reign of King <hi>Malcolm Canmor,</hi> who gave Sirnames to all his Nobles, and then many took their Sirnames from their Lands they possest, as the <hi>Cockburns</hi> and others, and suited their Arms to their names to the end it might be known that they were Heritors of such places: For which cause likewise we find, that Chiefs of Families are ordinarly of that ilk, that is to say with us, That their Names and Lands are the same. Some also derive their Names as well as their Arms from some considerable action: and thus a second son of <hi>Struan Robertson,</hi> for killing of a Wolf in <hi>Stocket Forrest</hi> by a durk in the Kings presence, got the Name of <hi>Skein,</hi> which signifies a durk in <hi>Irish,</hi> and three durk-points in for Pale for his Arms. Some likewise got Names from their Arms, for being strangers, the people amongst whom they came, not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing their Arms, gave them names from their Symbols or Arms they did bear. Thus, the <hi>Fowllis</hi> were called, from the <hi>leaves</hi> they carried: Monsieur <hi>Des Feules,</hi> and the <hi>Herrises</hi> or <hi>Herrisons,</hi> with us got their names from the <hi>Porcupine,</hi> or <hi>Herrison</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> which was their Arms, as Brothers of the House of <hi>Vendosm</hi>: And Historians observe, that the <hi>French</hi> were called <hi>Galli, ex eo quod gallos in conis galeae, seu pro cristis gerebant</hi>: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Limneus, cap.</hi> 6. <hi>num.</hi> 1. concludes, That <hi>Omnia arma quae cantant, non sunt insignia illiberalia, sive vilium hominum.</hi> Arms are ordinarily assum'd by Kingdoms, and Towns, either to represent what they glory most in: Thus the Kingdom of <hi>Granada,</hi> take a <hi>Pome-granate.</hi> Thus the Earle of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> took three garbs, or sheaves of corn, because <hi>Buchan</hi> was more fertil in Corn than other places of <hi>Scotland</hi>; which though very fertile now in grain, yet were then full of Woods: or else Kingdoms, and Towns take something which resemble the Situations of their Countrey. Thus <hi>Holland</hi> takes a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>Paris</hi> a Ship, because the ground upon which it was built, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the figure of a ship: and ordinarily with us, Towns took for their Arms the most remarkable thing belonging to their Towns; as, <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> their Castles: or else the Saint, which was their Patron, as <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinweem,</hi> St. <hi>Adrian</hi>; and <hi>Tayn,</hi> St. <hi>Duthacus</hi>; or else the badge of that Saint, as St. <hi>Iohnstoun,</hi> the <hi>Holy Lamb,</hi> which is the badge of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>: and <hi>Dundee,</hi> the <hi>Pot</hi> and the <hi>Lillies,</hi> which is the badge of the <hi>Virgin Mary.</hi> Which invention was borrowed from the Ancients, for we find that <hi>Diana</hi> was represented upon the coyn of <hi>Massilium,</hi> now <hi>Marsels,</hi> because that City was founded by <hi>Phocea. Alexandria, Napoli,</hi> (now <hi>Naples</hi>) and other Towns built by the <hi>Romans</hi> had, in memory of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> a wolf sucking two young ones upon the reverse of their coyn. In imitation of which custom, I find, that not only the <hi>Roman Medals</hi> did thereafter bear
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64440:9"/>
reverses, but some of even our Towns do bear them till now. Thus <hi>Aberdeen</hi> gives their for Arms three Towers, triple towr'd; and for their reverse, St. <hi>Michael,</hi> standing in the Porch of a Church.</p>
            <p>I have seen the Books of Arms of most Nations, and I have in general ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that every nation hath shewed their humour, as much in Heraldry, as in their other Characters: For the Arms of almost all the Families in <hi>Spain,</hi> are given, to signifie some undertaking for the Christian Religion, against its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the <hi>Moors, Turks,</hi> or other <hi>Hereticks.</hi> And their Shields of late are fill'd with <hi>Ave Maria</hi>'s, <hi>I. H. S.</hi> and such other devote Characters. The Arms of the <hi>Italians</hi> are ordinarily Emblems and witty Hieroglyphicks. The <hi>German</hi> Atchievements consist of multitudes of Coats, marshall'd in one, to gratifie the humour of their Countrey; who are vain of nothing so much, as of their Pedegrees. Those of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> are as wilde and monstrous as the People are who bear them. But the <hi>French,</hi> who are great Artists, wherever they study, do suffer their natural volagenesse to be consin'd and fixt by Rules of Art. And the <hi>Scots,</hi> to expresse their friendship to the <hi>French,</hi> have of old, imitated them in their Heraldry, asmuch, as we do the <hi>English,</hi> since we were happily united with them under one Monarchy. The <hi>Turks</hi> take oftentimes Letters of the Alphabet, as a cognizance; because their Religion discharges them to use Images. And it is observed, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> use oftentimes Letters, in imitation of the <hi>Turkish Moors</hi> their Neighbours: or else, these have been left with them since the <hi>Moors</hi> possest their Countrey.</p>

Thus I have seen an Charter granted by the Lord of the <hi>Isles</hi> to the Abbacy of <hi>Aberbrothock,</hi> which sayes, <hi>Et quia meum sigillum est minus notum in Scotia, ideo apposui sigillum Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi Rossensis.</hi> Commissions from Shires, to their respective Commissioners

in <hi>Parl.</hi> were also to be sealed, <hi>Act.</hi> 101. <hi>Parl.</hi> 7. <hi>I.</hi> 1. and this custom of sealing Papers without subscriptions, continued in vigour till <hi>March,</hi> 1540. At which time, King <hi>Iames</hi> the 5. by the 117. <hi>Act.</hi> 7. <hi>Parl.</hi> did ordain, that because men might lose their seals, or their seals might be counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that therefore all Evidents should for the future be subscrib'd, as well as sealed. And yet Queen <hi>Mary</hi> did thereafter, <hi>Parl.</hi> 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 29. appoint that all Reversions, Bands, and Discharges of Reversions should be sealed: and thereafter, <hi>I.</hi> 6. by the 80. <hi>Act. Parl.</hi> 6. appointed all papers importing he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retable title, to be both sealed and subscrib'd. And though by the 4. <hi>act. Parl.</hi> 9. <hi>Iames</hi> 6. Papers which are to be registrated, need not be sealed, because the seal was supply'd by the Registration. Yet, I see no posterior Law dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing (without Registration) in other cases: and it would be a further check upon forgers of Papers, that the Granters seal were to be appended. For many can forge a subscription, who cannot forge a seal. So that each for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, behoov'd to associat at least another with himself; which would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them before the cheat, or help to discover the forgers after the cheat were perpetrat: But Retours must yet be seal'd with the seals of the inquest, Satut: <hi>Rob.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.4. and Decreets of apprisings, with the seals of the Assizers and Verdicts of the Justice-courts, are also to be seal'd by the Regulations, 1670.</p>
               <p>I cannot here forget to inform, that of old, Our Acts of <hi>Parl.</hi> had often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Kings great seal appended to them: Upon the right hand were appended all the seals of the Ecclesiasticks, and upon the left, all the seals of the Nobility; with which the whole Act was surrounded. Of these I have seen many, and particularly, a ratification, granted by King <hi>Iames</hi> 4. to <hi>Hepburn,</hi> Earl of <hi>Bothwel,</hi> upon the forfeiture of the <hi>Ramsay, Anno</hi> 1480. Which bears, <hi>In quorum omnium fidem, ac corroborationem, &amp; laudationem earundem praefatus supremus Dominus noster Rex, &amp; regni status per se singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lariter requisiti sua sigilla, quorum nomina sigilla representant, praesentibus appendi jusserunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conceive that Seals, may very well represent, not only the bearing it self, but the colours; which I first order'd to be practised: for the Seal may be varried in its cut as the other figures of this Book are, which may be very useful, seing many mens Arms differ only in the colours.</p>

            <p>SOme Lawyers (though vers'd in Herauldry) have been of opinion, that every man can assume Arms to himself at his pleasure, without authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, providing he assume them not, <hi>in emulationem alterius,</hi> to the prejudice of another: and if this judgement were, <hi>Bartol. tract. de arm. num.</hi> 5. and <hi>Panorm. c. delectis, de exces.

                     <p>OVR Soveraign Lord, and the Estates of this present Parliament, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the great abuse that has been amongst the Leidges of this Realm, in their bearing of Arms, usurpand to themselves such Arms as belong not unto them; so that it cannot be distinguished by their Arms, who are Gentlemen of blood by their Antecessors, nor yet may be discern'd what Gentlemen are descended of noble Stock and Lineage: For remeid whereof, his Highness, with advice of the saids Estates, has given and granted, and by this present Act, gives and grants full power and commission to <hi>Lyon</hi> King of Arms, and Brethren Heralds, to visit the whole Arms of Noblemen, Barons and Gentlemen, born and used within this Realm; and to distinguish and discern them with congruent diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and thereafter to matriculat them in their Books and Registers, and put inhibition to all common sort of People, nought worthy by the Law of Arms to bear any signs Armorial; that none of them presume to take upon hand, to bear or use any Arms in time coming, upon any their insight and houshold-gear; under the pain of escheating their Goods and Gear, so oft as the samine shall be found, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or painted, to our <hi>Soveraign Lords</hi> use: and likewise, under the pain of one hundred pounds, to the use of the said <hi>Lyon,</hi> and his Brethren Heraulds; and failying of payment thereof, that they may be incarcerat in the nearest Prison-house: therein to remain upon their own Charges, during the pleasure of the said <hi>Lyon.</hi>

            <p>From which Act, we may draw these Conclusions, 1. That only such as are Gentlemen by Blood can carry Arms; which opinion is also received now into the Law of Nations, <hi>Hopping, cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Par.</hi> 10. But it was first
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64440:12"/>
enacted by <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>feud. tit.</hi> 27. <hi>De pace tenenda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is observable, that the Lyon cannot give Arms to such as are not Noble by descent: for the reason inductive of this Statute, is, That there may be a difference betwixt such as are Noble, and such as are not; but there would be none, if it were lawful to the Lyon to give Arms even to such as are not Gentlemen by birth: For as he cannot Nobilitate, so neither can he bestow the marks of Nobility. Likeas, by that Act, he is commanded to inhibit all such as are not Noble to carry Arms. But yet the Prince may still bestow Arms, without any restriction, though he cannot properly make a Gentleman: for that comes by Blood, and not by Patent. And <hi>Camden</hi> informs us, That of old there was a distinction betwixt Gentlemen of Blood, and Gentlemen of Coat-armour; and that the third from him, who first had Coat-armour, was to all effects and purposes a Gentleman of Blood, <hi>pag.</hi> 157.2. Albeit the Letter of that Law doth only forbid, to wear, and use Arms without Authority, as said is, upon In-sight, or Houshold-gear; yet, <hi>per paritatem rationis,</hi> they cannot use them upon Tombs, Seats in the Church, or else-where: <hi>&amp; de praxi</hi> the Lyon with us, doth raze and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face all such Arms: But whether the users of false Arms, do incur the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in such cases, may be doubted; seing <hi>penae sunt restringendae,</hi> and are not to be extended beyond the Letter of the Law.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By that Act, the Lyon is to distinguish, and discern Arms with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruent differences; from which words it may be inferr'd, that not only Arms must be originally given by the Lyon, but that marks and differences amongst the Cadets, and Descendants of the same Family, should be given by the Lyon; and that these Cadets cannot assume them: And this is suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the opinion of the Doctors, who teach, that <hi>non solum Potestas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferendi nova insignia, sed Potestas augendi, mutandi, diminuendi, &amp; confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandi insignia Vetera, est penes Principem &amp; ejus Heraldos, Hopping, cap.</hi> 8. <hi>membro</hi> 5. But it may be doubted, if prescription of Arms by Predecessors, be not sufficient to infer a right to the bearing of Arms, and to defend against the penalties of this Act: as to which points, the Doctors deliver these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That no man can prescrive the right of using Arms belonging to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Noble Family without immemorial possession, but that they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrive a right to bear indefinitely, or to bear the Arms of any other private person, <hi>per spatium decem annorum inter praesentes, &amp; viginti annorum inter absentes, vult. consil.</hi> 17. <hi>volum.</hi> 3. But by our Law, where prescription is not allowed, except in the cases wherein it is introduced by a special and express Statute, It is probable, that prescription might well have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended before that Act, <hi>Iacob.</hi> 6. But since that time it should not, seing that Act ordains all Arms to be matriculate in the <hi>Lyon</hi>'s Books, and Registers.</p>
            <p>The penalty appointed by that Act, to be inflicted upon such as carry false Arms, is, That the Moveables and Furniture whereupon these Arms are graven, and painted, shall be confiscated: which words must be taken disjunctively, and not copulatively, notwitstanding of the Particle (and;) for if the Arms be either graven or painted, they are to be escheated: as also, the Contraveeners are to pay one hundred pounds to the <hi>Lyon,</hi> and his Brethen Heralds: But by the Civil Law, he who bears and uses another
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64440:12"/>
another mans Arms, to his prejudice, <hi>vel in ejus scandalum &amp; ignominiam,</hi> is to be punished arbitrarily at the discretion of the Judge, <hi>l. eorum f. de falso</hi>; But he who usurps his Princes Arms, loses his head, and his goods are confiscated, <hi>l. sacri asflatus, C. de divers. rescript.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suitable to which Law, the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> was forfeited, and execute by <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. for no other cryme, but because he did bear the Arms of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> though his Predecessors had born them 100. years.</p>
            <p>Hovv sacred the <hi>Lyons</hi> Office is with us, appears among many other instances from this, That the Lord <hi>Drummond</hi> was in <hi>anno,</hi> 1515. (as <hi>Leslie</hi> observes in his storie) forfeited, for striking the <hi>Lyon, vita ac dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate aegrÃ¨ concessis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But seeing the Patent given to the <hi>Lyon</hi> gives him power, to give Arms to such a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> are Virtuous, and worthy Persons; And since, by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Statute, the <hi>Lyon</hi> is only discharg'd to suffer any to bear Arms, who are not worthy by the Law of Arms, to bear any signs armorial: It is therefore worthy of our enquiry, to know who are such Persons, as may by the Laws of Heraldry have Arms given them by the <hi>Lyon,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a special commission from the Prince. And first, it is uncontraverted, that a Gentleman may bear without a warrand the Arms of his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, and such as are descended by three generations from him, to whom Arms were given are Gentlemen. But this holds only in the eldest, for Cadets must have marks of Cadency, and differences assign'd them by the <hi>Lyon,</hi> and cannot assume them as was formerly observed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though the Patent allows the <hi>Lyon</hi> to give Arms, <hi>Personis virtute praeditis,</hi> and <hi>Philosophers, Poets,</hi> and <hi>Orators</hi> say, That Vertue is the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Nobility, which is allowed by the <hi>Cannon Law, cap. nos. qui, &amp; cap. pen. ext. de praeben.</hi> Yet Lawyers distinguish betwixt Nobility Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or Civil, which they assert; is not bestowed by Vertue only, and Moral Nobility which Vertue doth destow. <hi>Bald. in l. Nobiliores, C. de commerciis:</hi> From which Text, they prove clearly this distinction. And therefore<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the Patent joyns these two Persons, <hi>Virtute praeditis, &amp; de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis meritis</hi>; for certainly, such as have deserved well of the Prince, may have Arms given them by the <hi>Lyon:</hi> For the first institution of that Office was (as I formerly proved from <hi>Laz.</hi>) design'd to reward such as had done great service to the Prince: and the <hi>Lyon</hi> is Judge competent to the bearers merit, in order to this effect; nor can the Law presume, that the <hi>Lyon</hi> will transgresse so grosly, as to assert that he has served the State, who never did: For that were in him, <hi>crimen falsi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Riches do not Nobilitate, nor do they warrand the <hi>Lyon</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow Arms upon the Possessors. <hi>Tiraqueil de Nobilitat. cap.</hi> 3. though, as <hi>Ierom</hi> observes, Nobility is nothing oftimes but ancient riches.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The being an Heritor of Land doth not Nobilitate in all cases, even though the Heritage be very considerable; for else a Rich man might Ennoble himself: but these <hi>feuda</hi> only render the possessors Noble, which are bestowed by the Prince, or confirmed by him. For a <hi>few</hi> in either of these cases make the receivers Noble, seeing the Prince is the Fountain of Honour. And a few in those cases is a sufficient warrand to bear Arms, <hi>Tiraqu. cap.</hi> 7. And this remembers me of a custom in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is but gone lately in dissuetude, and that is, That such as did hold their Lands of the Prince, were called Lairds; but such as held their Lands
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64440:13"/>
of a subject, though they were large, and their Superiour very noble, were only called Good-men, from the old French word, <hi>Bonne homme,</hi> which was the Title of the Master of the Family; and therefore such Fews as had a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction annext to them, a Barrony, as we call it, do ennoble: For Barro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are establisht only by the Princes erection or confirmation. And thus it was found by the <hi>Parl.</hi> of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> That <hi>qui possident castrum cum terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torio, &amp; omnimoda jurisdictione sunt exempti Ã  contributione subsidiorum, ut Nobiles, licet non sunt Ã  Nobili Progenie,</hi> Guid. pap. decis. 385.</p>

The employment of a Souldier doth enoble, if it be honoured with any considerable Command, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>C. de Primicier,</hi> calls it, <hi>Praeclarem nobilio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remque militiam; &amp; l.</hi> 2. <hi>c. ut nemo prim. aliter miles, aliter plebeius punitur.</hi>

Hopping. pag.</hi> 443. and <hi>Vaschal. pag.</hi> 712. warrands this by a decision of the Courts of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nobility and the right of bearing Coat-Armours, being thus acquired, is lost many wayes; as First, By leading a vitious and profligat life, <hi>l. Si qua c. de secund. nupt.</hi> Where it is ordain'd, that <hi>ob scelera &amp; vitae turpitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, honestae nobilisque decore privetur.</hi> And the reason given for this is, <hi>quia nulla sine honestate est Nobilitas</hi>: and Nobility thus is not re-assumable by their Children: but this, with many other vertuous Laws, is gone in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetude: For only Crimes and a Sentence, doe now take off the Sacred Character of Honour. And with us, upon reading the Sentence of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, the Arms are torn, and the Decreet of forefeiture bears an order for this, but no other sentence for other Crimes discharges the bearing of Arms with us: albeit by the Civil Law it seems, that all Crimes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges the bearlng of Arms, <hi>Statuas detrahendas scire debemus, l.</hi> 24. <hi>f. de Pen. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>c. decis.</hi> 130.

               <p n="1">1. It is fit to use the ordinar termes, and not to be too inventive and curious; for else every one out of vanity should invent a peculiar way, and new terms: and not any two Heralds should understand one another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There must be no reiteration of words in Blazoning the same Coat; and therefore the <hi>English</hi> say not, He bears <hi>argent<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> a Lyon gules, collard, argent,</hi> but they say, <hi>Collard</hi> of the first, because <hi>argent</hi> was the first colour; yet the <hi>French</hi> repeat the colours after, and observe not this rule, and it is the better way for eviting confusion: for when there are many pieces in the Shield, it is most difficult and tedious to remember alwayes what is first, and second, third, and fourth; and all this trouble serves to no purpose, and it is not at all natural.</p>
               <p>The Third Rule is, to evit as much as is possible, the words, <hi>of, or,</hi> and <hi>with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In blazoning a Coat, you must begin with the Field, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the charge; and if the Field be charg'd with moe things, you must name first, that which lyes nearest the Shield. The <hi>English</hi> say in blazo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he beareth <hi>

                     </gap>zur,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> never say, he beareth <hi>a-zur,</hi> and the word, <hi>beareth,</hi> is superfluous: the <hi>English</hi> sometimes say, the Field is <hi>argent, vid. Guilims, pag.</hi> 285. But that is likewise superfluous: and it is better, with the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> to expresse, 1. The bearers name,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64440:15"/>
and then to expresse the colour of the Field, <hi>v g. Winram, gules,</hi> a Ram passant, <hi>argent,</hi> whereas <hi>Guilims</hi> would have blazon'd these Arms thus, he beareth <hi>gules,</hi> a Ram paussant, <hi>argent,</hi> by the name of <hi>Winram</hi>: which way of blazoning sounds not so well as the first, nor is so short and proper. Naked Shields were sometimes born without any Charge, upon many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: Thus <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> did take five Shields plac'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the first of the name of <hi>Hay,</hi> got three Shields in a Field <hi>argent,</hi> because He and his two Sons did gallantly defeat the <hi>Danes</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Loncart,</hi> 942.

            <head>CHAP. IV. Of COLOURS and METTALS.</head>
            <p>HEralds do not expresse all Colours by our ordinar terms, nor do they admit all Colours in blazoning but they use ordinarily two Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, to expresse two of the ordinary Colours, <hi>viz.</hi> white by argent, and yellow by or; and that because silver is white, and gold is yellow. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> call such fields as are all Mettal, <hi>Campo de Plata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The use of thir Mettals and Colours, and the difference betwixt them, did in Coat-armours arise, from the several Colours us'd by Souldiers, and others in their habits whilst they were in Armies, as <hi>Pet. Sanct.</hi> proves by many Citations. And because it was the custom, to embroider gold or sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver upon silk, or silk upon cloath of Gold, or Silver; therefore the Heralds did thereafter appoint, that in imitation of the cloaths so embroyder'd co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour should not be us'd upon colour, nor mettal upon mettal.</p>
            <p>The colours us'd by them are only Blew, which they call <hi>azur</hi>; Red, which they call <hi>gules,</hi> from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>gulude,</hi> a piece of red cloath, or from the <hi>Arabick</hi> word, <hi>Gule,</hi> which signifies a rose, which are ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly red, as <hi>Menestier</hi> observes. Black, which they call <hi>sable,</hi> because the best <hi>sable furrs</hi> are black; and green which they call <hi>vert</hi>: which is the <hi>French</hi> word of green, or <hi>sinople</hi>; for so the <hi>French</hi> term green, never using the word <hi>vert</hi>: and the reason why it is called <hi>sinople,</hi> is from a Town in the <hi>Levant,</hi> called <hi>Sinople,</hi> where the best materials for dying green are found, and not from the <hi>Greek</hi> words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, because it being contraverted at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whether green was a proper colour to be us'd in Heraldry, It was determined, that it suted with Heraldry, <hi>cum armis. Menestier</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives <hi>sinople</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, green arms, by suppressing the first syllable as the <hi>Greek</hi> often do. The <hi>French</hi> admit purple in Heraldry, though <hi>Favin</hi> and some Heralds in that Nation, think that Purple is but argent worne, which by occular inspection turns purple: they likewise allow carnation or flesh colour <hi>Colomb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> observe, that the <hi>English</hi> use <hi>taunie,</hi> which Heralds call <hi>tenne</hi>; and is composed of <hi>gueuls</hi> and <hi>sable</hi>: and the <hi>English</hi> observe, that the <hi>French</hi> use it, <hi>Guilims, pag.</hi> 21. But <hi>Guilims</hi> is here in a mistake; for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64440:16"/>
the <hi>French</hi> use it not, but the <hi>English</hi> do. <hi>Colombeir</hi> likewise observes, that the <hi>English</hi> use <hi>sanguin</hi>; which is made up of pure <hi>lacque</hi> and <hi>orange,</hi> which is compos'd of <hi>leed</hi> and <hi>tin:</hi> But <hi>Colombeir</hi> is mistaken here, for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> use not <hi>orange,</hi> but the <hi>Germans</hi> do sometimes. The ordinar colours and mettals in use, are, <hi>or, argent, gules, sable, azur, vert</hi> and <hi>purpure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why Heralds choosed these five colours only, I can give no surer reason, then that they thereby resolved to fix the uncertainty of vagrant and capritious Artists; even as Lawyers have fixt prescription to forty years, and mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to twenty one; but yet there are some original colours. <hi>Aristotle</hi> redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to four, <hi>White, black, yellow</hi> and <hi>red. Cardan</hi> makes them seven. <hi>Albus, Croceus, Purpureus, Puniceus, Viridis, Caeruleus, niger. Scaliger</hi> chooses, <hi>album, flavum, rubrum, purpureum, viridem, caeruleum, &amp; nigrum, Exercit.</hi> 325. But the <hi>Chimists</hi> observe, that <hi>white, blew, red, green</hi> and <hi>yellow,</hi> are the original colours, and from them Heralds have choosed thir.</p>
            <p>These colours have their own mystical representations in Heraldry. For <hi>Or</hi> is us'd to expresse the bearers faith, justice, temperance, riches, genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, or prosperity: <hi>Argent,</hi> his humility, innocency, beauty: and a <hi>white Shield</hi> was given to <hi>novices,</hi> when they went to the War, and before they had done any glorious action, <hi>Virgil. Parma. inglorius, alba azur:</hi> his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, victory: <hi>Gules,</hi> his magnanimity, courage, love and charity: <hi>Sable,</hi> his grief, prudence, honesty. <hi>Sinople</hi> or <hi>Vert,</hi> his courtesie, civility, youth and abundance. Yet sometimes these colours are us'd to disguise and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the bearers <hi>Origin.</hi> Thus, some were originally <hi>Murrays,</hi> but being forc'd to change their Name, and leave their Countrey, they retain'd their Arms, but chang'd their Colours. For whereas the <hi>Murrays</hi> bore <hi>azure, three stars argent,</hi> they bear now <hi>arg. three stars azur:</hi> and yet colours have been chang'd upon very honourable occasions: And thus <hi>Ker</hi> of <hi>Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord</hi> did bear <hi>G.</hi> Till their chief was kill'd at <hi>Gambspath,</hi> upon the border fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing valiantly for his Countrey: whereupon <hi>King Iames</hi> the fourth appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that for the future, the House of <hi>Cesfoord</hi> should carrie <hi>Vert,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of that Green Field whereupon he was kill'd. Sometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so Colours were chosen by Knights to their Arms, because at Tiltings, they us'd to appear in that Colour; and for that reason, the first <hi>Crichtoun</hi> chois'd his <hi>Lyon</hi> that he bears to be <hi>Azure.</hi> Sometimes also the things born are allow'd in their natural Colours, if they be of many Colours, and then the things born are said to be born proper. As the <hi>Peacocks</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> bear three <hi>Peacocks</hi> proper, that is to say, in all their ordinar Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. But though this be allow'd in the charge, yet it is not allow'd in the field; for that must be of either the ordinar mettals, or colours. Yet this suffers some exceptions, as in the Arms of the Count <hi>de Prado</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> who bears a <hi>meadow proper,</hi> that is to say, <hi>a green field charg'd with flowrs of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral colours. Or is writ, O; argent, ar Gules. G. azur, az; Sable, S. vert.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Sin; purpur, P.</hi> Some fantastick Heralds have blazon'd not only be the ordinar colours and mettals, but by flowrs, dayes of the weeks, parts of a mans body, as <hi>le feron</hi> and <hi>Bara,</hi> and have been condemned for it by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds of all Nations: Yet the English have so far own'd this fancy, that they give it for a rule, <hi>That the Coats of Soveraigns should be blazon'd by Planets, those of Noblemen by precious Stones,</hi> and have suited them in the manner here set down.</p>

            <p>BUt I crave leave to say, that thir are but meer fancies, and are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise unfit for the Art in which they are imploy'd: which is clear from these reasons, 1. The <hi>French,</hi> from whom the <hi>English</hi> derive their Heraldry, and to whom they conform themselves, not only in principles and terms of Art; but even in extrinsick words of the <hi>French</hi> language, do not only not use thir different wayes of Blazoning, but constantly treat them <hi>en ridicule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Italian, Spanish,</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Haralds, use no such different forms: But Blazon by the ordinary Colours<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and Mettalls, <hi>Non variari no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina debent mettallroum, vel colorum in Magnatum, aut in Regum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signiis pro hac re provoco ad scriptores caeteros, qui Gallice, Germanice, aut Latine hac de re disseruerunt, Pet. sanct. pag.</hi> 58.</p>
            <p>And one of the great designs in Heraldry, is to have the Art universal, and to have the Arms they describe generally understood in all Nations<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> yea, and even Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> their Countrey man, do's condemn this way as fantastick.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Art should imitate nature, and as it were an unnatural thing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon discourse, not to call red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>punc; red, because a Prince wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s it: So it is unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to use these terms in Heraldry: and it may fall out to be very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus and unnatural in some Arms. As for instance, if a Prince had for his Arms an <hi>asse couchant</hi> under his burden, <hi>gules</hi>: It were very ridiculus to say, that he had an <hi>asse couchant mars,</hi> for the word <hi>mars</hi> will agree very ill with <hi>asses,</hi> Sheep, Lambs, and many other things which are to be Painted red in Heraldry. And a hundred other examples may be given, but it is enough to say, That this is to confound Colours with Charges, and the things that are born with Colours.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As this is unnecessar, so it confounds the Reader, and makes the Art unpleasant, and deters Gentlemen, and others from studying it, and strangers from understanding what our Heraldry is: Nor could the Arms of our Princes, and Nobility be translated in this disguise unto the <hi>Latine,</hi> or any other language.</p>
            <p>But that which convinces me most, that this is an error, is, because it makes that great Rule unnecessar, whereby Colour cannot be put upon Colour, or Mettall upon Mettall; for this cannot hold, but where Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls and Colours are imploy'd.</p>
            <p>It was of old impossible to know the Colours of Arms, except they had been Blazon'd, or Illuminated; and yet Arms differ only by their Colours: As we see in our <hi>Lyon,</hi> which <hi>Scotland</hi> carries Red; <hi>Kinghorn,</hi> Blew; <hi>Rosse</hi> of <hi>Balnagoun,</hi> White; and therefore, the <hi>French</hi> have found out this device, for discovering even in Taliduce, or Carving what the Colours are. For they make <hi>or</hi> pointe <hi>O, arg.</hi> plain, <hi>Azur</hi> is represented by Lyns in <hi>Fasse,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64440:17"/>

            <p>I have thought fit, to represent <hi>tenne,</hi> by Lyns in Band and Barr, and Sanguine by Lyns in Face and Barr; as will more clearly appear by the figures: and I could wish that Gentlemen would cause cut Seals in this fashion, So that not only the bearing, but the colours of the bearing might be known by the Seal.</p>
            <p>It is an uncontraverted rule in Heraldry, that colour cannot be put im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly upon colour, nor mettal upon mettal: that is to say, That if the Field be <hi>argent,</hi> the immediat charge must not be either, <hi>Or,</hi> or <hi>argent</hi>; but must be of some colour, as <hi>Azur, Gules, &amp;c.</hi> And if the Field be of any colour, as <hi>Azur, Sable, &amp;c.</hi> then the immediate Charge must be either, <hi>Or,</hi> or <hi>arg.</hi> The reason why I add the word immediat here, is, because, though the Field be <hi>or,</hi> yet the immediat Charge may be a Lyon, or any thing else: If that Lyon be Charg'd with another Charge (which He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds call Super-charge) then, that Super-charge may be <hi>Or</hi>: This rule was not observ'd amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Pier.</hi> observes, <hi>cap</hi> 19. <hi>nam Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leani Seniores gerebant ceruleam aquilam alis utrim<expan>

            <p>Where he shows us, that the Origin of differencing Mettals, from Colours, was from the differences which fell out in the <hi>Trojan Wars,</hi> betwixt the followers of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Ulisses</hi>: Whereupon <hi>Achilles</hi> friends Blazon'd only Mettals, and <hi>Vlisses</hi> his friends Colours. And in commemoration of that difference, Heralds appointed that<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Mettalls, and Colours, should thereafter be no more divided, lest Heraldry should become, or be made a Badge of discord, in Courts or Armies: but I prefer <hi>Petr. Sanct.</hi> his conjecture above related.</p>
            <p>Albeit this rule be very Universal in Heraldry, yet it suffers its own exceptions, as 1. Heralds gave to <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Colour. The 3. exception is of marks of <hi>Cadencie</hi> in Royal Families: Thus the House of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> carry Battons <hi>Gules,</hi> on a Field <hi>azur</hi>: The like is in our privat marks to younger Brothers, of <hi>Cadencie,</hi> such as our <hi>mollets, cressents &amp;c.</hi> given.</p>
            <p>The 4. exception is, of the Colour <hi>Purpure</hi>; for <hi>purple,</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Mettal, when it is upon Colour; and Colour, when it it is upon Mettal: The reason of which exception seems to be, either because is a Royal Colour, and therefore to be priviledg'd, or more probably, because <hi>Purple</hi> is thought by some Heralds (as was formerly observ'd) to be oftentimes, <hi>argent</hi> worn off by use, and time. So that it is hard to know when it was at first design'd to be a Mettal, and when a Colour. Sometimes also a Chief will appear to be so contriv'd, as to be Mettal, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mettal or Colour, upon Colour: but then the <hi>French</hi> call it <hi>Cousu,</hi> a Chief sew'd to the Shield. And thus they evite that objection, The <hi>French</hi> also claim the priviledge to their <hi>Flowerdeluce,</hi> as <hi>Desvarennes</hi> observes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it being given frequently by the Prince, to such as had formerly Fields of Colour, or Mettal: the rule could not be observ'd. But in this I differ from them; For it may still be plac'd upon some other figure, so as to salve the Rule; and if they plead this priviledge to their <hi>Flowerdeluce,</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> may to their <hi>Lyon,</hi> and the <hi>Germans</hi> to their <hi>Eagle</hi>: but in my opinion, it is better to shun the breaking of Rules, then to be vext making apologies.</p>
            <p>Some Heralds debate what Colours are Noblest in Heraldry, and <hi>Bart. de insig. num.</hi> 29. gives it for a Rule, <hi>aureum esse nobiliorem, posteum<expan>

And therefore, there can be no precedencie. For that colour is best, which is fittest; but otherwise it seems, that those colours which have most resemblance to light, are the best colours; seing light is the author and cause of all colours: And therefore white is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to all colours, but in Heraldry <hi>Or</hi> is preferred to it, seing white is not a colour in Heraldry, but an Mettals and Mettalls are by the principles of this Art still preferred to colours, and Gold is preferable to Silver.</p>
            <p>Though ordinarily colours are not only preferrable, as they suit best with what is represented; as for instance, in the <hi>Keiths</hi> Arms, <hi>three pales, Gules</hi>: being to represent three bloody draughts drawn by the King, and a hand <hi>Gules</hi> in the <hi>Mcfersons</hi> Arms for killing the <hi>Cumming,</hi> could not have been so honourably represented by any other colour; yet if the bearing require no special colour, it is given as a Rule, that the Shield should be of a nobler colour than the bearing: and if the Shield be compos'd only of different colours, as will be seen hereafter, in Shields, parted <hi>per pale,</hi> or <hi>per fesse,</hi> that the Nobler should be in the upper part, or upon the right side: <hi>quoties arma fiunt ex diversis coloribus, semper nobilior color nobiliori in loco ponendus, Hopping, cap.</hi> 11. <hi>lex.</hi> 4.

            <head>CHAP. V. Of FURRS.</head>
            <p>SHields were anciently either Painted, or covered with Skins, as the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets, or Shields of our <hi>Hig-hlanders,</hi> yet are: The Painting gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Colours formerly treated of, and the covering to the <hi>Furrs,</hi> or <hi>Skins</hi> mentioned in this Chapter. And this I take to be a better ryse for their being in Shields, then to say, that they were used in Mantles and Garments; and that therefore Heralds use them as <hi>Guilims</hi> observes: For this may be a good reason why they are us'd in Mantlings, but not in the Shields. <hi>Pet. Sanct.</hi> calls these <hi>Furrs Vellera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two <hi>Furrs</hi> allow'd by Heralds, <hi>viz. Ermin,</hi> and <hi>Vair. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> is a little Beast, lesse then a <hi>Squirrell</hi>; so call'd, because it lives or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily in the Woods of <hi>Armenia</hi>; the colour of its body is a pure white, and its tail is black: And therefore our Heralds make <hi>Ermines</hi> to be a <hi>Furr,</hi> whereof the ground is white, distinguish'd with black spots; but it is not naturally of the form represented in this figure, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of these black spots being only invented by <hi>Furriers,</hi> who mix for beautie the blacknesse of the tail with the whitenesse of the body. But because the black spot of the tail, was not sufficient, to spot the whole Skin; therefore <hi>Furriers</hi> do take the wool of <hi>Italian Lambs</hi> shorn out of the Bellies of their Dames, by which they beautifie the Skin with various spots, as <hi>Varennes</hi> observes, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. It is hotly debated by <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estier,</hi> and his namelesse adversare, whether these be whole Skins of Ermins, or only the tails of <hi>Ermines,</hi> that are; represented in blazoning: But I think both erre, for it cannot be the intire Skin, with its own natural spots only, for some are very frequently spotted: nor can it be the tails of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> only, as <hi>Menestier</hi> asserts; For these tails are so little, that they would make ill Furring: But I think that these spots are added by Heralds, not only in imitation of the spotted <hi>Furrs</hi> used by Ladies, for these are regularly spotted, and in Heraldry they are not, but to diversifie the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Coats of Arms: And thus some bear one spot in the middle, some two, some three, some one in chief; some dispose them as a Crosse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are call'd by the <hi>Italians, Armelini,</hi> and the <hi>Latine</hi> expresse them <hi>per maculas nigras muris pontici.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first user of this <hi>Furr</hi> in Arms was <hi>Brutus</hi> the Son of <hi>Silvius,</hi> who having by accident kill'd his Father, left that unhappie ground, and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in <hi>Bretaigne</hi> in <hi>France</hi> fell asleep; and when he awoke, he found this little Beast upon his Shield, and from that time wore a Shield <hi>Ermins,</hi> which is the Arms of <hi>Bretaigne</hi> to this day: and when the Field is charg'd with nothing but <hi>Ermins,</hi> we say, he carries of <hi>Bretaigne</hi>; and the <hi>Mushets</hi> cary <hi>Ermins,</hi> to show their descent from <hi>Bretaigne.</hi> And I observe, that many sirnames, who alledge they came from <hi>France,</hi> bear <hi>Ermine</hi>; and therefore, I presume they came from <hi>Bretaigne</hi>: for that Countrey being upon the Sea, its inhabitants were more inclin'd to travel, than the other <hi>French</hi>: but some Families, as the <hi>Coupers,</hi> do for more security, cary the

               <hi>Flourdeluces,</hi> and <hi>Ermins,</hi> in one Shield, to signifie their descent from <hi>France</hi> and from <hi>Bretaigne</hi> in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Where the Ground or Field is black, and the pouldring white, we call it <hi>Contre-Ermine, Colomb. pag.</hi> 52. Though <hi>Guilims</hi> call it more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly <hi>Ermins</hi>: making no difference, betwixt the names, but the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Letter <hi>s.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> write still <hi>Hermins, Guilims</hi> sayes, that where the Field is <hi>Or,</hi> and the pouldring black, it is call'd <hi>Erminois,</hi> and cites for this <hi>Bara, pag.</hi> 14. But there is no such thing to be found in <hi>Bara.</hi> and where the Field is black pouldered with <hi>Or,</hi> He calls it <hi>Pean</hi>: but I find no such term us'd in the <hi>French</hi>; for they call <hi>Furres,</hi> or <hi>doublings, des pannes</hi> or <hi>pennes,</hi> which possibly gave occasion to this mistake, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, in such as understand not the <hi>French</hi> tongue; for the <hi>French</hi> say only <hi>Hermine,</hi> if it be proper, <hi>viz.</hi> white pouldered with black; but if the colours alter, they expresse the same as <hi>Sable</hi> pouldred with <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins, Or</hi>; as also they say, <hi>Or</hi> pouldred, with <hi>Ermins sable, semÃ© D. Or. Hermins de sable, Bara. pag.</hi> 14. and <hi>Colombier, pag.</hi> 53. If there be but one hair of red in each side, <hi>Guilims</hi> calls it <hi>Ermenits</hi>; but these are but fancies, for <hi>Erminits</hi> signifies properly little <hi>Ermins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other <hi>Furr</hi> is call'd <hi>Vair, vellus petasite,</hi> where all the several pieces are made in form of little Glasses, and, as some think, are call'd <hi>Vair,</hi> from the <hi>French Verre,</hi> a Glasse; or as some say, from the Variation of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; and therefore, the <hi>Latine</hi> say, <hi>Arma variata ex pellibus albis &amp; cerulis.</hi> The Field of it is <hi>arg.</hi> and <hi>az.</hi> and if so, it is simply call'd <hi>Vair</hi>; but if the colours alter, or be moe, the alterations must be exprest: And therefore our Heralds have ill Blazon'd <hi>Straiton</hi> of <hi>Lauristons</hi> Arms, <hi>verri arg.</hi> and <hi>az.</hi> for here the naming the colours was superfluous.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Furr</hi> must be still of Mettal and Colour, and in Blazoning, you must begin at the Mettal as he carries <hi>Verry Or,</hi> and <hi>Sinople:</hi> Nor is there any difference betwixt these words, <hi>Vair, Verry,</hi> and <hi>Verrey,</hi> though Sir <hi>Iohn Fern, pag</hi> 86. assignes to every word its particular difference; but <hi>Guil. pag.</hi> 28. condemns this justly as a meer fancie, and founded upon no Authority; and I wish he had adverted to this himself in other places. <hi>Vair</hi> is ordinarily of six ranks<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> if they be moe or fewer they must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest: This rule the <hi>French</hi> still observe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> likewise observe, that if the pieces be of Mettal, and made not in form of a Glasse, but of a Bell, then they are to be call'd <hi>Beffroy Colomb. pag.</hi> 58. <hi>et on dit a la band de Beffroy de Vair: d, une seul tire,</hi> that is, of one rank.</p>
            <p>The origin of <hi>Vair</hi> in <hi>armorie</hi> is from the <hi>Furr</hi> of a Beast, called <hi>Varus,</hi> whose Back is a blew-gray, its Bellie being white: and therefore Heralds have exprest it in blew and white colours, and when the Head and Feet of that Beast is taken from its Skin, it resembles much the figure of <hi>Vair,</hi> us'd by the Heralds, <hi>vid, Aldrovand de quadruped. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. And the reason why they are never used in Heraldry, in the natural colour of blew-gray, is, because Heraldry admits no mix'd colours; and therefore it has chosen blew, because that is the nearest colour to blew-gray: and the reason why it is never used all blew, or all white, is, because the whole Skin is parted into these different colours: the first use of them in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldry is said to be from <hi>le Segneur de Coucies,</hi> fighting in <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and seeing his Army flee, did pull out the doubling or lyning of his Cloak,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64440:20"/>
which was of those colours, and hung it up as an Ensign: whereupon the Souldiers knowing his courage, and confiding in it, did return to the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and did overcome their enemy. <hi>Colomb. pag.</hi> 58. <hi>Leigh, fol.</hi> 132. is of opinion that <hi>Ermine</hi> is not a colour, but may be lookt upon, and should serve in Heraldry as a mettal: But <hi>Guilims, pag.</hi> 24. taxes him in this of an error, (saith he) it is us'd as the doubling or lining of mantles, and mettal is not fit for that employment: and therefore he concludes that it must be a colour: but in this I think they err both, for seing it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of Mettal and colour, I think it should be lookt upon, as neither the one nor the other, and so may be put indifferently upon Mettal or colour without offending the rules; for seing it is Mettal and colour, it can no more be put upon colour then upon Mettal, and so it must be us'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently as both, or not put in a Coat with either Mettal or colour, which were impossible: but in the practice of Heraldry, they are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently us'd, as may be seen by the <hi>tresor armori<expan>

            <head>CHAP. VI. Of the Principal Points of the SHIELD.</head>
            <p>BEfore I descrive the Charge, that is to say, the things born in the Shield, I must advertise my Reader, what the several points of the Shield are; for the same things make different Arms, according as they are plac'd, and therefore, by the Doctors call'd, <hi>Alveoli, seu Cellula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reason of the Names, and designations of the several points, is from the several parts of a man, who is in Heraldry, <hi>Architecture,</hi> and <hi>Painting,</hi> the true measure of all <hi>Simetrie,</hi> and Perfection: Imagine then a man standing in the Field, his highest point is his head, which in <hi>French</hi> is <hi>Chef,</hi> and so chief Point is not so call'd in Heraldry, because it is the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, but because it is the head of the Shield; and the <hi>English</hi> writ it wrong, for it should be writ <hi>Chef</hi>: It is allow'd three Points A, B, C.</p>
            <p>The second Point, is call'd Honour Point, because a man wears all the Badges of his Honour, about his Neck: As is to be seen in the Knights of the <hi>Holy Ghost, Saint Esprit,</hi> and even in the Knights of the <hi>Garter,</hi> who wear their Coller about their Neck, on St. <hi>Georges</hi> day; though for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie they wear it otherwise, at ordinary occasions.</p>
            <p>The third Point E is call'd <hi>caeur,</hi> or <hi>centre</hi> Point, the heart Point; but by <hi>Guilims,</hi> and other <hi>English</hi> Heralds, is erroneusly call'd <hi>fesse</hi> Point: and yet in this they follow <hi>Bara,</hi> as I conceive: but he calls it <hi>fesse,</hi> or face: which last is more proper, because face, which is one of the ordinaries, as shall be said hereafter, passes through this Point: For <hi>fesse</hi> signifies the flank, or the buttocks, and these are not the middle part of a man: And the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Ceur</hi> Point, <hi>il centro,</hi> and the <hi>Latine, centrum parmae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth E, is <hi>nombrill</hi> Point, the Navel Point; for <hi>nombrill</hi> signifies a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, in ordinary <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> use it also; but I wonder why <hi>Les fesse sont plus hautes, que le nombrill,</hi> the next Point to <hi>nombrill</hi> are the two flanks G.H.
<pb facs="tcp:64440:20"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:64440:21"/>

H. acording to the <hi>French,</hi> and under them the base Point; but the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> have no flank Points, but make all the three to be the <hi>dexter base, middle base,</hi> and <hi>sinister base</hi>: Which in my humble opinion is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper; for by <hi>occular inspection,</hi> it appears that a Shield has but one <hi>base</hi> Point, or <hi>basis Ferne,</hi> constantly: and some of our <hi>Scotish</hi> Books of Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonrie following his mistake, call the <hi>base</hi> Point <hi>bast.</hi> And since the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> follow the <hi>French</hi> here generally, both, as to the names, and situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; why they should not follow them, in what is most reasonable seems strange: Especially seing the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Authors agree with them, as is clear by <hi>Petra Sancta, cap.</hi> 20.</p>
            <p>The use of these Points, is, to difference Coats exactly: for Arms having a <hi>Lyon</hi> in <hi>Chief,</hi> differ from these who have a <hi>Lyon</hi> in <hi>nombrill</hi> Point and all the Points have their different significations: For bearings which argues Precedencie, or Wit, are plac'd in Chief Point: These which are given as additions of Honour, are plac'd in honour Point: These which are given to reward Courage, are given in <hi>caeur</hi> Point, or <hi>centre</hi> Point: These that are given in Reward of Supplie, or Support, are given in one of the flank Points; because a mans thighs or flanks are his great Suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The learned <hi>Spelman</hi> divides the Shield in three Regions, the highest, he calls <hi>cephalica,</hi> the middle he calls <hi>centrica</hi>; and the lower <hi>perigaei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. But these (not being followed by other writers and differing only from others in the way of expression) are not to be used.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Menestrier</hi> the <hi>Iesuite</hi> divides the Shield in 16 points, distinguisht in five threes, and a single base point.

And the single and lowest point he calls the base point. And thus he designs the several situations of any Bearing exprest in the Shield, by saying it is placed in such a point, or in the <hi>canton dextre</hi> or <hi>sinistre</hi> of such a point: if it possess all the three, he terms them <hi>couch'd,</hi> or <hi>laid alongst the cheife,</hi> or <hi>nombril,</hi> &amp;c. sometimes also they are said to be placed in <hi>Pale</hi> or <hi>pale-wise,</hi> or <hi>Saltire-wise, &amp;c.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. VII. Of Lyns used in HERALDRY.</head>
            <p>THe Charge or Bearing is compos'd of several and different forms of Lyns, of which, though the <hi>French</hi> do not treat separately; yet seeing they are common to all Bearings, I thought fit to premise to the knowledge of them an explication of different Lyns; of which they are compos'd, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Guilims, Cartwright,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> Heralds.</p>
            <p>The figure explains it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:64440:22"/>The chief reason why the Lyns are thus used in Heraldry, Is to difference Bearings, which would be otherwise the same; for a chief wavÃ© differs from a chief simple, as much as if the one bore a Chief, and the other a Lyon Rampant: But though this be the general reason, yet there are particular reasons for these differences, as shall be observed hereafter.</p>
            <p>The difference betwixt <hi>invecked</hi> and <hi>engraild,</hi> is, that they are opposite, the one being the other turned out, <hi>indented and daunsette,</hi> differ, in that the one is the other inverted; but I think them all one: And so the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> calls them promiscuously <hi>dentatus, vid. Skinner.</hi> But for difference, because the one is large and the other small, therefore indented is term'd <hi>dentata</hi> absolutely, and <hi>daunset dentes decumani</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> and <hi>di non ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria grandezza</hi> by the <hi>Italian, Pet. Sanct. pag.</hi> 181.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Invecked,</hi> is so called by the <hi>English</hi> from the <hi>Latine Invehor</hi>; because it carries in its corners upon the thing whereupon it borders; But I finde no such word used by the <hi>French</hi>: yet I think it is useful, seeing <hi>ingraild</hi> which they make use of, to signifie both, is of a contrary figure. The word <hi>ingraild,</hi> is said by <hi>Upton</hi> and <hi>Guilims,</hi> to come from <hi>ingredior, quia ingreditur rem circumscriptam</hi>: But this is a mistake, for then <hi>invecked</hi> and <hi>ingraild</hi> should not differ, though they be contrair in their figure; but the true origination of it, is from the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>graile,</hi> which <hi>signifies hail,</hi> and <hi>engraile</hi> in ordinary <hi>French,</hi> signifies <hi>struck, and cut by hail</hi>: which <hi>hail,</hi> being round, pinches and cuts the leaves of trees, or any thing else in the form represented by that lyne, which is called, <hi>Linea striata,</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> and <hi>Skanellata,</hi> by the <hi>Italians. Waved</hi> is so call'd, from the <hi>waves</hi> of the Sea, which it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, and is therefore called <hi>undÃª</hi>; and is used for signifying that the Bearer got his Arms for service done at sea: Thus the <hi>Drumonds</hi> bear <hi>three faces undÃ©,</hi> or <hi>wavÃ©,</hi> because the first of that name came with Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> as Master of the Ship, and having suffered great storm, through which he by his skill conducted them; he did thereafter get <hi>three faces wavÃ©,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting those great waves: The <hi>Latine</hi> call it, <hi>Vndiformis</hi> or <hi>Vndulata, Pet.

            <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the Partitions of the SHIELD.</head>
            <p>AFter Battels were ended, the Shields of the souldiers were considered; and he was accounted the most deserving, whose Shield was either most, or deepliest cut; and to recompence the dangers wherein they were known to have been by these cutts, Heralds did represent those cutts upon their Shields. And those Bearings in general, are called the <hi>Partitions of the Shield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:64440:22"/>The ordinar Cuts did give names to the ordinar Partitions, of which the others are made by several conjunctions: If the Shield was cut from the <hi>chief</hi> to the <hi>base,</hi> it is called by the <hi>French, parti</hi>; if all over, <hi>coupÃ©</hi>; if from the right high angle, to the lowest left angle, <hi>tranchÃ©</hi>; if from the left high angle, to the right low angle, <hi>taillÃ©</hi>: But the <hi>English</hi> observe not these terms, nor have they followed the <hi>French</hi> in this; but they name the Partitions by the honourable ordinaries, and what the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>parti,</hi> they call <hi>parted per pale</hi>; for <hi>coupe,</hi> they say <hi>parti per fesse</hi>; for <hi>taillÃ©</hi> they say <hi>parti per bend sinistre</hi>; for <hi>tranchÃ©</hi> they say, <hi>Parti per bend</hi>: for a <hi>be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But where the Lynes cannot describe the several Cuttings of the Shield, there must be new terms, and there only they should have place; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>gyrons, quarters</hi> and <hi>cantons</hi> were first invented. A <hi>gyron</hi> is the <hi>French</hi> word of <hi>bosom,</hi> and these partitions are called <hi>gyrons,</hi> because they meet in the <hi>bosom:</hi> They were of old called, <hi>contrarie-conid,</hi> because they did meet in in <hi>cono; portat arma contra conata ex octo partibus, vid. Fern.</hi> 211. They are in the <hi>latine</hi> called, <hi>pinnulae octonae,</hi> and <hi>merli octango-laxi,</hi> by the <hi>Italians</hi>: And therefore if they be eight, they need not be exprest, but the number must be exprest if there be moe, or fewer: And <hi>Berengarius</hi> was so called, <hi>quia ejus arma erant benÃ¨ gyronata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Earl of <hi>Argil</hi>'s Coat should not be blazon'd <hi>gyronÃ©,</hi> for it may be blazon'd by the ordinary Lyns: and therefore I chuse rather to blazon it thus <hi>parted by pale, face, bend dextre, and sinistre, or, and sable</hi>; and as this is suitable to reason, so I desire any person to consider if the Earl of <hi>Argyl</hi>'s Coat does not differ from that of <hi>Grolle</hi> in <hi>Colomb. page</hi> 80. Why then should they not differ in the termes of art: and for authorizing me in this, I recommend the Reader to <hi>Colomb. fig.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. <hi>pag.</hi> 81.</p>
            <p>A quarter is the fourth part of the Shield, and is called <hi>canton</hi> from the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>canton,</hi> which signifies a corner. It represents the Banner that has been given to the Bearer, as a reward of his service, or at least is equivalent, as if a Baner had been given him. A <hi>pyle</hi> in Heraldry repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents that ingine whereby souldiers and others secured the foundations of their buildings; and have been given since to such as had been very useful in founding Common-wealths, Colonies, or Families: But three <hi>piles</hi> are oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mistaken (as I conceive) both in <hi>England,</hi> and with us for the <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion nailes</hi>; which where ordinarie simbols, assum'd by such as went to the Holy-landÂ· And thus I blazon the <hi>Wisharts</hi> Arms, <hi>arg. three passion nails, gules meeting in point,</hi> For they resemble exactly the Jesuites cognizance, which are three <hi>passion nails.</hi> And generallie in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> where these <hi>pyles</hi> are <hi>gules,</hi> and <hi>meet in point,</hi> they are called <hi>passion nails</hi>: And I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe this because <hi>Spelman pag.</hi> 572. relates, <hi>That the Wisharts got this name out of malice from the Sarazens, whom Robert the first of that name, did much persecute, about the time of the Norman conquest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We express still the place from which the <hi>pyle</hi> takes its beginning, by the word; <hi>issuing</hi> as issuing out of the <hi>chief,</hi> issuing out of the <hi>corner dextre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>flasque</hi> is the segment of a circle stretched alongst the straight side of the Shield. It is given as a reward for Learning, as <hi>Guilims</hi> alleadges, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64440:23"/>
has its name, as <hi>Skinner</hi> observes, <hi>Ã  similitudine uterum antiquorum: animicando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem notat, Herodian. in severo, pag.</hi> 223. But <hi>Spelman</hi> asserts, <hi>That they are the facings of gowns, which were of old so shapt.</hi> Others also there are wno think these <hi>flasques</hi> to be the proper rewards given by Princes, to such as have served them as domestick servants: for the <hi>voyder</hi> which is the diminution of the <hi>flasque,</hi> is acknowledged by <hi>Guilims,</hi> to be the reward for domestick service, <hi>&amp; eadem est ratio totius, &amp; partis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>flanch</hi> is yet as much larger than the <hi>flasque,</hi> as the <hi>flasque</hi> is than the <hi>voyder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a general Rule in blazoning all these <hi>partitions,</hi> that we must begin with that Colour or Mettal which possesses the highest <hi>part</hi> or <hi>corner dexter, descriptio harum partitionum</hi> (sayes <hi>Pet. Sanct. pag.</hi> 194.) <hi>inchoari debet ab eo fulgore, seu coloris, seu metalli, qui primus obversatur oculis in superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ore loco, vel in angulo dextro.</hi> Sometimes one colour is said to be cut upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which Bearing has been invented in imitation of cloaths, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in stuffs of one colour were ordinarily cut out after that fashion of old, in sumptuous varieties: But I likewise imagine, that this way of blazoning has been fallen upon to save some of the received Rules of Heraldry; for we then only say, That one Colour is cut upon another, when there is a Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and any honourable Ordinary of one colour; which Ordinary does not reach the extremities of the Shield, as it ought to do: An example whereof, <hi>Upton</hi> gives, <hi>pag.</hi> 248. where he calls such Coats, <hi>Arma duplicia &amp; jaggata, gules</hi> voided, <hi>Or</hi> by the three Barrs, <hi>portat de rubeo ablato, sive evacuato super aurum, ad modum trium barrarum.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. IX. Of the Honourable ORDINARIES in general.</head>
            <p>THe Bearing which is charg'd upon the Field, is either an Fowl or other creature, Tree, Flower, or some such thing, which depends not upon Heraldry, but has its name, and being independent from that Art, and these are call'd <hi>Common Charges</hi>: Or else it is one of these pieces which is properly invented, and has its Name, and Beeing from Heraldry, and those are call'd the <hi>Proper Charge.</hi> And such pieces are call'd the <hi>Honourable Ordinaries,</hi> because Heralds do ordinarily bestow them upon deserving persons. But <hi>Leich</hi> and <hi>Guilims</hi> do erre in calling them <hi>the most worthy Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,</hi> for Partitions, and Ordinaries are different, as shall be shown hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thir Honourable Ordinaries (or Piec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s Honorables, as the <hi>French</hi> call them) are numbred by the <hi>French</hi> to be ten, Chief, Pale, Band, Fasce, Barre, Crosse, Saultoir, Cheveron, Bordre, and O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>le; and express all the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of a mans intire Armour. as the Chef, the Helmet; the Pale, his Lance; the Band and Bar, his Sword and Belt; the Fasce, his Scarfe; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is but a Conjecture, or Fancy: and I rather think that these have been invented to be different Marks of different Qualities in the Bearer. As for example<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the Chief reward those actions which are the product of Wit, the Cross Religious Exploits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> make the Border, nor Orle, no Honourable Ordinaries, and so make them nine, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Cross. 2. Chief. 3. Pale. 4. Bend. 5. Fesse. 6. An Inescucheon. 7. A Cheve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. 8. A Saltyr. 9. A Bar.</p>
            <p>Each of these do in the <hi>French</hi> Heraldry fill a third part of the Shield; But the <hi>English</hi> give them more or less, or as shall be hereafter observed. In this the <hi>French</hi> agree with the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as <hi>Pet. Sanct.</hi> observes, and seeing all the honourable Ordinaries are of the same quality, I see not why they should not have equal room in the Field.</p>

            <head>CHAP. X. Of the CHIEF.</head>
            <p>THe Chief is call'd from its Position, which is <hi>Dans le chef de lescu</hi>; for <hi>chief</hi> signifies the <hi>head,</hi> in ordinarie <hi>French</hi>; and is term'd <hi>capitale,</hi> or <hi>coronis scutaria,</hi> by the <hi>Latine:</hi> And therefore it is ill writ <hi>Chlef</hi> by the <hi>English</hi>; for it is not so call'd, because the Head is the chief part, as <hi>Guilims</hi> observes. According to both, It is given as a reward for Wisdom and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and many out of respect to their Superiors or Over-lords have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a part of their Over-lords Coat, charg'd in <hi>Chief</hi>; which I conceive to be the reason why <hi>Chiefs</hi> are so frequently charg'd in <hi>Scotland</hi> with other Bearings. Both the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> conclude, that it containeth the third part of the Shield:

            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:64440:26"/>When there is a Partition in it, if the Partition be in the upper part, it is call'd a Chief surmounted of another, but if it be divided in its lower part, it is call'd a Fillet, as <hi>Guilims</hi> observes, who derives that word Fillet, from the Fillet that is put about the hair; but it is indeed a <hi>French</hi> word, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a small threed.</p>
            <p>A Chief cover'd by any thing which hangs over it, is call'd by the <hi>French un chef couvert,</hi> and sometimes the covering is like an <hi>Episcopal Chapperon</hi>: this Mr. <hi>Guilims</hi> not understanding the <hi>French,</hi> calls <hi>shapournet,</hi> or <hi>shapernet,</hi> as <hi>Cartwright</hi> writes; and by this, and many other errours it appears how different languages have occ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sometimes it is blazon'd a Chief <hi>crenelÃ©,</hi> sometimes <hi>wavÃ©, &amp;c.</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the lyns which compose it.</p>
            <p>There is much notice to be taken to the several wayes of Blazoning this Ordinarie, as will appear by the examples hereeo subjoyned.</p>

            <p>THe Bend (or <hi>Bande</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> write) is that honorable Ordinarie, which passes from the right angle of the Shield, to the lower left angle. the Bar is just contrare, for it passes from the highest left corner, to the lowest right corner; and is therefore call'd by the <hi>English</hi> a <hi>bend sinister.</hi> Both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a third part, according to the <hi>French</hi>; but according to the <hi>English,</hi> it comprehends the fifth part only of the Shield, when i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> is uncharg'd, but the third part when charg'd, But I see no reason why this should hold in the Cross, Saltyr and Bend, and not in the other Ordinaries, <hi>nam ubi eadem ratio, idem jus est statuendum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Bend represents the Belt of a Knight, and is call'd <hi>Baltheus</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> and in <hi>Italian, Benda</hi> or <hi>cingulo,</hi> and is born of different colours, and in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent forms by sundrie Nations: For the <hi>French</hi> wear their sword belt, as a Bend; the <hi>Germans</hi> as a face about their middle. The <hi>French</hi> wear their Bend white, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> red, the <hi>English Scots</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> blew, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> blackÂ· Such <hi>French</hi> as wear a bend in their arms with us, wear it white, to show their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. According to some Amorists it represents a Ladder, and is given to such as Scal'd first the walls of Castles or Towns. <hi>Guilims</hi> marks its divisions thus, The half of the Bend is call'd a <hi>gartier,</hi> from the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>gartier</hi>; a Cost is the fourth part of the Bend, and half of the <hi>gartier</hi>; a Ribband is half the Coast. <hi>Cartwright</hi> differs in this from <hi>Guilims,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> use no such fancies, but call all diminutives of the Bend, CotisÃ©, from Coste the side, because these Cotices are margin'd upon the side of the Bend. And if there be moe or less than six Bends in one Shield, they express the number. <hi>Guilims</hi> observes that the Bendlet differs from Bend; in that it is still limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the sixt part of the Shield, and in that it still begins at the corner, where the Bend is in the middle corner betwixt the Lyns.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> call half a Bend, sinister, a Scarpe; from the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>esharpe,</hi> a scarfe; and half a <hi>scarpe,</hi> a batton, if it be short of the Shield

in both its extremities: But the <hi>French</hi> call them Battons, though they be not cut, and gives us a rule, that there may be twelve Battons in one Field, but no moe; if they be but six, they say <hi>BarrÃ©,</hi> without numbring the pieces.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> have no such word as <hi>scarpe,</hi> but what the <hi>English</hi> call Scarp, they call <hi>counter cottice,</hi> and if any thing should be call'd a Scarpe, it should be the Bend, for it looks likest to a Scarfe; and a Bend in <hi>English,</hi> is <hi>un escarpe,</hi> in the <hi>French,</hi> or a <hi>scarfe.</hi> I finde <hi>bend sinister</hi> us'd but very seldom with us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> so much we have hated every thing which lookt like bastardry.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIII. Of the FACE.</head>
            <p>THe Face is that honorable Ordinary, which by two Lyns traverses the Face of the Shield, keeping the centre equally distant from both the Lyns, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64440:31"/>
comprehends a thrid part of the Shield. The <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> call it <hi>Fascia,</hi> or <hi>Benda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> writ it <hi>Fesse,</hi> and derive it from the loyns of a man; But <hi>Fesse</hi> is a <hi>French</hi> word, signifying the buttocks, which are much lower then the center, and therefore the <hi>French (Bara</hi> excepted) writ it still <hi>face,</hi> and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents the Scarfe of a Warriour, <hi>un Esharp, Colomb.

            </p>
            <p>The face hes no diminitive in the <hi>English</hi> Heraldry, which I admire, seeing they assigne so many diminitives to other Ordinaries: but the <hi>French</hi> call little Faces, <hi>trangls,</hi> if they be equal in number; but <hi>burels,</hi> if they be unequal in number, as five or seaven: In our <hi>Scotish</hi> the Face is call'd a Bar, as in the Earl of <hi>Perths</hi> Arms, who is said to bear O. three Barrs wavÃ© G.; those should be call'd Faces according to the <hi>French,</hi> and Fesses according to the <hi>English</hi>; and yet it appears that a Face of old was truly call'd a Bar, and it represents in its shape one of those Barrs which are us'd all over some doors; and therefore the <hi>Latine</hi> Authors call it <hi>Verris, Skinner verb.</hi> Bar. As also the name of <hi>Dempster</hi> carry a Sword arg. surmounted of a Bar Or, to show that they were heritable <hi>Dempters,</hi> who are criminal Officers; and therefore carry a Sword for power in criminals, and it is call'd <hi>Ius gladii:</hi> and because the Dempster us'd to stand at the Bar, and pronounce the Verdict; therefore they got the Bar; and this Ordinarie does in effect represent in its shape the Bars, which ly alongs in Judicatures.</p>
            <p>The House of <hi>Austria</hi> carry G a Face arg. because <hi>Leopold</hi> 2 Duke of <hi>Austria</hi> in the first Battel of the Holy War had his Coat, which was Cloath of Silver, so covered with blood, that it was all red, except that part which his Scarfe covered, which remain'd still of its native colour: this showes that this Ordinar represents the Scarfe, and shows why it is given by Heralds.</p>
            <p>When the Bar is above any Charge, so that the Charge in so far is not seen, we say he carries V. G. a Sword surmounted of a Bar, as <hi>Dempster</hi> does.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIV. Of the CHEVERON.</head>
            <p>A Cheveron is an ordinar <hi>French</hi> word, signifying a <hi>couple,</hi> by <hi>Vitruvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Capreolus,</hi> and therefore this Ordinar represents a <hi>couple</hi> in its Shape, fig. 1. by the <hi>Latine</hi> now it is call'd <hi>tignum</hi> or <hi>cantherius</hi>; by the <hi>Italian, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolo</hi> or <hi>caviletto,</hi> and is given by Heralds to such as have supply'd their Prince, Countrey, or Family: and thus the <hi>Hepburns</hi> carry G on a Cheve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron arg. two Lyons pulling at a rose: the reason of which was that when the <hi>Scots</hi> were near beat at the Battel of two Brothers of that name came in with a fresh Supply and recovered the Battel; (as <hi>Holins-bead</hi> also confesses) for which they got the Cheveron, to signifie the Supply they brought, the two Lyons to represent the two Brothers, and that they were <hi>Scots</hi> pulling at a <hi>Rose,</hi> which is the Arms of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64440:32"/>
               <hi>England.</hi> As also <hi>Robertsone</hi> of <hi>Struan</hi> got a Cheveron added to his Shield, for taking <hi>Graham,</hi> who kill'd King <hi>Iames</hi> the First; but he has not us'd it of late, because he thought it a mark of Cadency. <hi>Leigh</hi> sayes, <hi>That a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veron represents a womans attire for her head</hi>; but the conjecture is very groundless, and proceeds from wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> of <hi>French,</hi> and for the same want of <hi>French</hi> some use to say, <hi>a Cheveron rompÃ©,</hi> for a <hi>broken Cheveron,</hi> which is in <hi>French, un cheveron rompu,</hi> or <hi>brisÃ©.

                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>. It comprehends also the third of the Shield, and the reason why a Cheveron is taken broken in its top, is because the Principle House was ruin'd and sold, and therefore the Cadets, to show that they are fallen from the original height of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, take the Cognizance bruis'd in its top.</p>
            <p>If there be more Cheverons, they are call'd Cheveronells, of which <hi>Leigh</hi> and all the <hi>English</hi> write, that there can be three in a Field; but the <hi>French</hi> say three Cheverons, and why not three Cheverons as well as three Bends, Bars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>French</hi> mark 1.3.4. or 5. Cheverons at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and in this, as in many other things we follow the <hi>French</hi>: For the <hi>Mclellans</hi> bear, Or, two Cheverons sable.</p>
            <p>A Couple close contains the fourth part of a Cheveron, and are not born but by pairs, except there be a Cheveron betwixt them.</p>
            <p>If the Cheveron be turn'd down with the point to the base, it is call'd a Cheveron inverted.</p>
            <p>If two Cheverons be joyn'd together, the <hi>English</hi> call them Brazed from the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Bras,</hi> as I conceive, which signifies Arms, because they are interlac'd as Arms; the <hi>French, accrochete.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. XV. Of the BORDUR and ORLE.</head>
            <p>SHields had Bordurs for their ornament, and sometimes for their difference, as vestiments had fringes, and thence did the Bordur grow an honourable Ordinarie amongst Heralds: It possesses the fifth part of the Shield amongst the <hi>English,</hi> but the third amongst the <hi>French.</hi> An Orle is a little Bordur, from the <hi>Latine</hi> word <hi>Orula,</hi> which signifies a little Bordur; but both the one and the other are given to recompense such, as have given protection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: For the Bordur defends what is within it, and therefore <hi>Scotland</hi> got the Orle Flower deluc'd from the <hi>French,</hi> to recompense the assistance, the <hi>French</hi> got from the <hi>Scots</hi> in all the Wars: At which time, and for the same reason, the <hi>Scots</hi> got the guarding of the <hi>French</hi> King's body, which honour they retain to this day.</p>
            <p>It is now us'd as a mark of distinction by Cadets, because they ought to defend their elder Brothers Family, as the Bordur defends the Shield.</p>
            <p>All nations use few terms in describing Borders, except the <hi>English,</hi> who use very many, and such as are unnecessar, and have proceeded from affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>French</hi> words for terms of art: For if the Bordur be charg'd with dead things, it is call'd a Bordur entoire, as of Annulets, Besants, &amp;c. which word is from the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>entoure</hi> (about) corrupted; this word is also improper; for all Bordurs go about the Shield.</p>
            <p>If the Bordur be charg'd with Fowles, it is call'd by them <hi>enalauron</hi>; if it be charg'd with other beasts, it is term'd <hi>enurny</hi>; if with Flowers, Fruits, or Leaves, <hi>verdoi</hi>; and then the particulars, and their numbers are exprest, as <hi>Verdoy</hi> of eight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> if with furre, it is call'd <hi>Purflew</hi> generally, and then the Furr is specified, as he bears <hi>G.</hi> a Bordur purflew ermine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> say only, G. a Bordur Ermine, as also they say, he bears Or, a Bordur of 8 Pigeons.</p>
            <p>If the Bordur be of moe colours, it is said to be componed of such and such colours, when there is but one range of them: But if there be moe ranges, and these be counterly plac'd <hi>chequer wise,</hi> the Bordur is said to be compon'd, and counter-compounded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Skinner</hi> in his Dictionary thinks, that <hi>enalauron</hi> is a corruption of <hi>inoru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus</hi>; but I think it comes from the <hi>French,</hi> who say, <hi>un bordure en ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions,</hi> to describe a Bordure of <hi>martlets,</hi> so that <hi>enalauron</hi> is the corrupti- of <hi>en alerion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Fiblier</hi> is the <hi>French</hi> diminitive of a Bordur; but the <hi>English</hi> have no diminitive of it.</p>
            <p>He translates likewise a Bordur purflew, <hi>fimbria acu puta nam pourfiler</hi> is <hi>profilare, id est, aureo filo intexere,</hi> so that <hi>purflew</hi> is rather a Bordur em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broder'd, than furr'd.</p>
            <p>The Orle is an inward Bordur as in the figure 12. and the Tressure or <hi>Tresheur,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> call it, is the diminitive of the Orle, and where

            <head>CHAP. XVI. Of the CROSS.</head>
            <p>THe Cross has been in great esteem, since our Saviours death did make it so venerable amongst Christians: for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did ingrave it upon the breast of their god <hi>Serapis</hi>: And <hi>Caelius Rod</hi> teaches us, That the ancient, Philosophers and Mathematicians did highly esteem that Figure. But that which made this Ordinare so considerable in Heraldry, was the expeditions unto the Holy lands, and the Holy war; for both the Pilgrims after their Pilgrimage took the Cross for their Cognizance, and the Ensigne of that War was the Cross; And therefore these Expeditions were call'd <hi>Croissads</hi>: And in these Wars, the <hi>Scots</hi> carry'd St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Cross argent, the <hi>French</hi> a Cross arg. the <hi>English</hi> a Cross Or, the <hi>Germans</hi> sable, the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> azur, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gules, as <hi>Colomb.</hi> observes. Thus <hi>Montmorancy</hi> carry the Cross, because they were the eldest Christians amongst the <hi>Gaules</hi>; and the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> because they did assist the <hi>Rhodes</hi> against the <hi>Turks</hi>: And the <hi>Sibald,</hi> who are come from <hi>Sabaudia,</hi> carry the Cross, because <hi>Savoy</hi> or <hi>Sabaudia,</hi> from whence they came, carry'd the Cross; for <hi>Siban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> or <hi>Sibaldus</hi> is but the corrupted name of <hi>Sabaudus.</hi> Before the Holy War, the Cross was blazon'd four Cantons or Quarters.</p>
            <p>It has several Denominations, according to the several Persons, who did originally bear it: Thus the Cross of <hi>Calvary</hi> is long in the Pale, and short in the Arms, fig. 8. A Patriarchal Cross (or a Cross of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> bacause <hi>Lorraine</hi> wears it) as in the fig. 7. A Cross of <hi>Maltha,</hi> is that which is born by he Knights of <hi>Maltha</hi> for defending the Christian Religion, fig. 19.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64440:36"/>
A Cross Crosslet, is that which has all corners of it crossed as is the fig 9. A Cross Patee, is that which has large Extremities, though they be not fimbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated or doubled, as <hi>Guilims</hi> alleadges, <hi>pag.</hi> 90. A Cross fitched, is that, whose lowest point is sharpn'd, and fit to be fixed in the Earth, as in the figures 11. and 12. Fitched comes from <hi>FichÃ©e,</hi> which signifies fixed in the <hi>French</hi> Language; but the writing it <hi>fitchee</hi> with a <hi>t</hi> is the Errour: But such words though unnecessar, vex the Reader to purpose: and therefore it were better to say, a Cross fixable; and for the same reason it were better to say, a Cross crouch-wise, than to say, a Cross potent, or potence: For a <hi>potence</hi> signifies a crouch in the <hi>French,</hi> but <hi>potent</hi> and <hi>potence</hi> are the same terms: Nor could the <hi>French</hi> understand their own terms in those Books.</p>
            <p>I cannot here pass by a ridiculous remark made by <hi>Upton</hi> an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Writer, otherwise learned, the reading of whom might have possibly occasion'd some mistakes. <hi>Nota, quod istae cruces non sunt propriÃ¨ signa, sed differentiae signorum. Quare dic quod Rex Haraldorum videns aliquem cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entem portare arma, ignorans aliquam bonam, vel malam conditionem in eo, vel proprietatem, debet asignaere sibi de crucibus supradictis, quam crucem portare, signat portantem non habere aliquam causam, vel conditionem secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quam possent sibi arma assignari, sed signant hominem brutalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reason of Crosses fitched (or fixable, as I term them) was that the primitive Christians did alwayes carry crosses with them as marks of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and when they setled themselves in their journey at any place for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, they fixt these portable crosses in the ground.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XVII. Of the SALTYR.</head>
            <p>THe Saltyr <hi>crux transversalis seu decussis,</hi> is a Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> Cross, and is very ordinary in <hi>Scotland,</hi> because St. <hi>Andrew</hi> was our patron Saint; for St. <hi>Andrew</hi> appeared to <hi>Achaius</hi> our King upon that Cross, when he fought against the Picts. It was of old one of those Instruments which were us'd as Ladders, to scale the walls of Towns; and therefore it is call'd <hi>sautoir</hi> by the <hi>French,</hi> from <hi>sauter</hi> to leap, because it did help the souldiers to leap over walls: The <hi>English</hi> write <hi>saltyr,</hi> but I know no reason for that word: the former reason has in my judgement occasion'd that the Saltyr is with us, and all other nations born ordinarly engrail'd, or ragg'd, as we call it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Souldiers us'd to cut so those trees, for helping them to climb, and to support their feet or hands, upon its nicks.</p>
            <p>Upon the account, that the Saltyr is a St. <hi>Andrew</hi> cross, therefore the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersons</hi> carry ar. a Saltyr engrail'd sable betwixt four stars gules.</p>

            <p>The ordinar round figures approved by all Nations, are,</p>
            <p>The <hi>besants,</hi> which were the money of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and had their Name from that town, which was called <hi>Bizantium,</hi> and have been generally born of old by such as were at the Holy War; of late they are born by such as have been rais'd, by being Thesaurers or Customers: For these <hi>besants</hi> are still of Mettal.</p>

            </p>
            <p>If they be half Mettal, half colour, they are call'd <hi>besant torteaux,</hi> if the Mettal be in the highest place, or in the dexter side; if otherwise, they are called <hi>torteaux besants</hi>: This word <hi>torteaux</hi> is in <hi>Latine</hi> called <hi>limba torta &amp; rotunda</hi> (round Cakes) and thence sprung the term <hi>torteaux Leigh</hi>: calls them <hi>wastals.</hi> It is given by <hi>Chassaneus conclus.</hi> 75. as a Rule, That <hi>besantae nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur usque ad octo, si excedant dicentur besanteae &amp; tortellae numerantur sicut besantae</hi>: That is to say, If the <hi>besants</hi> exceed six, you should say, <hi>bestanted,</hi> and need not specifie their number.</p>
            <p>If these Roundlets be shadow'd, they are call'd Bowles; and the first who bore these, was the Family of <hi>Medicis</hi> now Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> because the first of that name, <hi>Edward de Medicis,</hi> who serv'd under <hi>Charles the great,</hi> kill'd <hi>Mugel</hi> a Giant, who wasted all about <hi>Florence,</hi> and murdered Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers by a mace of iron, at which were hung five iron bowles, and did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon take five bowles for his Arms.</p>
            <p>The four corner'd figures, are either Lozanges, which are exactly four squar'd <hi>para-lello grammata,</hi> and are born by <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> and ofttimes are the symbols of exact Honesty, and Constancy; that being a figure whose right side is alwayes highest, <hi>homus quadratus, Chas lib.</hi> 1. <hi>conclu</hi> 75. tells us, That <hi>Lozangiae factae sunt ad modum lozangiorum in vitriis.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>fusill</hi> is longer, and has its highest and lowest angles sharper than the Lozanges: it was the form wherein women carry'd their Arms of old, and by the old shape of it, and the present name, it represents a Spindle: If there be many of these, then we say, <hi>lozan'd</hi> or <hi>fusill'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Macle</hi> is also four square, but it is voided as in the fig. 3. some think they resemble the mashes of a net, and if so, they must still be voided, as <hi>Guilims</hi> well observes, <hi>pag</hi> 317. and they signifie the Bearer to have been pollitick, and fit to take others in his net, as Sir <hi>Iohn Fern</hi> observes<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but if the <hi>Macle</hi> represents a Mash, why was it cut as a <hi>Macle?</hi> and therefore I do rather believe <hi>Colomb. pag.</hi> 149. Who asserts, That these Macles were first used in the Arms of the House of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who chused them, because all the Carps, and Flints also of their Lands in the Dutchie of <hi>Rohan,</hi> are all markt with this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, which being a thing very extraordinary, and singular, gave occasion to them to use these in their Arms, and these Spots are called Macles in that Countrey from the <hi>Latine Macula</hi>: Whereupon the Dukes of <hi>Rohan</hi> have for their Motto, <hi>Sine MaculÃ¢, Macla.</hi> In my opinion they look like <hi>Mirrours,</hi> and seeing the Name of <hi>Purves</hi> carries three Macles, and that their Name in <hi>France</hi> is <hi>Purvoir,</hi> I think these Macles represents Mirrours in their Arms.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> call thir Figures Macles, without distinguishing whether they be voided or pierc'd; but if they be pierc'd round, the <hi>French</hi> call them <hi>rustres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have also set down the form of a <hi>Fret,</hi> which should consist of six pieces, if of moe, we say <hi>Fretted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Billets</hi> are also four corner'd, but are longer in the sides, than at the ends; they represent a <hi>Brick,</hi> and therefore are call'd <hi>Laterculus</hi> by the <hi>Latine</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds: Some ancient Families bear these, to show the antiquity of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as <hi>Varreus</hi> observes, for of old all houses were built of Brick. Some Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies with us use them, to show their Original was from <hi>England,</hi> where brick tyles are much us'd.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIX. Of living Creatures, Trees, Flowrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the General Laws of Heraldry relating to them.</head>
            <p>THere are some things proper to Heraldry, as the honorable Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nars, and of these I have treated particularly: but there are other things, which have only relation to Heraldry, as they are exprest as bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Shields of particular persons; as <hi>Planets, Meteors, Animals, Trees, Flowers:</hi> And thus, all things may be here comprehended, and Heralds to swell their Books, treat of those, either to show why such things are born: (But since that depends upon the actions done by the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that is rather the part of an Historian, then a Herald: But however in the second part of this work, wherein I have given an account of our Families and Arms, I have set down the reason of every Coat, as far as my enquirie can reach) Or else others make long discourses of the nature of the things born; but that belongs rather to a natural Philosopher, then to a Herald.</p>
            <p>I am then resolv'd only to trouble my self with the general Laws to be observ'd in bearing these things, which I have reduc'd to these Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first is, that every thing be plac'd in its natural form, if there be no special reason for doing otherwise. For nature is the chief model, and pattern of Art in all things, and Art only imitates Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That if a rapacious creature is to be set down, it is to be exprest in the posture that is most devouring; because then it is presum'd to shew most strength: and thus a <hi>Lyon</hi> is to be exprest, <hi>rampant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bart. de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sig. num.</hi> 16. <hi>animalia fera debent exprimi in act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> ferociori.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Other creatures that are not wild and ravenous, ought to be exprest in their noblest position, as a <hi>Horse salient,</hi> a <hi>grey-hound running,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64440:42"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:64440:43"/>
               <figure/>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:64440:43"/>4. Creatures, that are remarkable for any posture, ought to be born in that posture, as a <hi>Lamb passant,</hi> because it is naturally simple; a <hi>Serpent nouÃ©,</hi> or circling in a knot, because it is remarkable for that forme.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All Creatures must be looking to the right side of the Shield, and must have their right foot first; Which things <hi>Bartol</hi> founds upon, <hi>L. Qui clavum Â§ item sciendum F. de aedilit. edict.</hi> Yet I found it rather upon the general opinion that men have, that the heart is in the right side, and that therefore the right side in man is strongest, and so he has made it the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest side in all other things.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As the right side is nobler then the left, so the upper part is nobler then the lower: and therefore things that must look either up, or down, ought rather to be design'd looking upward.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But if two Creatures or things be looking to one onother, then these Rules are not to be respected, <hi>Bartol. num.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p n="8">8. When beasts are to be painted upon banners, the noblest position is to look to the staff; because that is the support of the banner: If upon hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that have chimneys, the noblest position is to look to the fire, because generally the worthiest persons are plac'd next to the fire: if there be no chimney, the noblest posture is to be plac'd, looking from the door: if upon <hi>Caparasons,</hi> they ought to look to the head of the horse, or beast that bears them.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. If they be born to expresse a Historie, they are to be painted in the posture that best expresses the historie.</p>
            <p n="10">X. In some things custom has allow'd a peculiar position in Heraldry; which ought to be observ'd: as two Keys are to be born like a Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews cross,</hi> because the Keys born by the <hi>Pope,</hi> are so painted: A Sword is to be born in <hi>pale,</hi> because the Sword of Honour is so carry'd before Kings and Magistrats. But these postures, and the special terms are to be found in <hi>Guilims, Carter, Morgan,</hi> and others; and many of them may be known by the explication of the Coats here set down.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XX. Why ARMS are chang'd.</head>
            <p>ARms once taken ought not to be chang'd without a sufficient cause. The ordinary causes of changing Arms are six. First, When the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer becomes subject to another, and thus <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror chang'd the arms of <hi>England.</hi> 2. The succeeding to a greater Fortune, and thus the Familie of <hi>Stewarts</hi> arms were chang'd by our Kings, when they succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Crown 3. Adoption, as by Tailies with us. 4. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable new exploit, and thus a Savoyard having preserv'd <hi>Francis</hi> 1. at the Battle of <hi>Pavie</hi> crav'd liberty to change his arms, and take a sword <hi>arg.</hi> accompany'd with a flower <hi>de luce.</hi> 5. Some new devote enterprise, as those who went to the holy War. 6. Marks of cadency, and defamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and marriage: of which three last, I shall treat in separate Chapters.</p>
            <p>What was meant by a Gentleman of Name and Arms in ancient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords is doubted: For some interpret this of those, who made profession of arms: Others do more justly interpret this of these, who came to the honour of having sirnames, and Coat-armour; for till <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror's time in <hi>England,</hi> and King <hi>Malcome, Canmor's</hi> Reign in <hi>Scotland,</hi> there were no sirnames; but men were call'd by their Fathers name, as <hi>Gulielmus, filius Iacobi</hi>: but thereafter they got sirnames from the lands they possest: and therefore it was a mark of Nobility in those dayes, to have a Few, or Lands. But now a Gentleman of Name and Arms, is he, whose Name and Arms are registrated by Heraulds, as <hi>Menestier</hi> observes.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXI. Marks of CADENCIE and DIFFERENCES.</head>
            <p>ARms are sometimes given upon a personal account by a Prince; thus Kings give sometimes to such Strangers, who have mediat happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Ambassadors, betwixt them, and their own Masters, the Arms of their Kingdom in a <hi>Canton</hi>; and generally in these cases, Arms are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal, and descend not to his Successors: And such Arms are called <hi>insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia personalia, Noal. de Transmis. casu</hi> 33. and <hi>Cartwright, pag.</hi> 20. gives an instance of this in the person of <hi>S. Henry,</hi> St. <hi>George,</hi> who got the Arms of <hi>Swede</hi> in a <hi>Canton,</hi> when he was Ambassadour there: and the <hi>Italians</hi> give many instances of this Rule, in arms given by Princes to Cardinals: But if Successors be not secluded; then Arms descends to his Heirs, though they be not exprest, <hi>Bart. ad l.</hi> 1. <hi>c. de dignit. Hoping. c.</hi> 7. Â§. 1. and these succeed to their arms, though the arms were bestow'd upon the Father af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their birth, even as they would succeed to a Crown falling to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after their birth, <hi>Tiraquel. c.</hi> 15. <hi>Hot. quaest. illust.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>But when they are given by the Prince to a man, or to his posterity,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64440:61"/>
then his Successors, who are descended of him, do carry the Arms, and have right thereto, and that though they renounce to be Heirs, <hi>Noal. ibid.</hi> Because these are marks of their Princes favour, and no lucrative parts of succession: And therefore, possiblie it is that our Nobility bear the Titles, and enjoy the honours of their Predecessors, though they renounce to be Heirs, and though these Honours and Titles were given at first to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors and their Heir.</p>
            <p>But it is here questioned by the Doctors, whether Daughters have right to bear arms of the Family: as <hi>Iason</hi> observes, <hi>consil.</hi> 63. <hi>Virile officium est arma &amp; insignia deferre,</hi> the carrying Arms belongs only to men; yet it is generally concluded, that Women who were never marry'd, may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their Predecessors arms, <hi>Tiraquel. de nobil. cap. ult. &amp; Tacit. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>annual. de funere juniae ait, Viginti clarissimarum familiarum imagines antilatae sunt, sed praefulge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But they should be born in a <hi>fusil,</hi> which is a figure longer then a lozen, and signifies a <hi>Spindle</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> which is a womanly Instrument: Yet when women have been once marry'd, they can no more carry their paternal Coat or Arms, because, by marriage, <hi>transeunt ex familia patris, in familiam mariti, Bart. ad l. quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties C. de privil. Schol. menoch consil.</hi> 197. and yet to show whence they sprung, they carry their paternal Coat marshall'd with their husbands, as shall be hereafter observ'd: But the children born by them cannot carry their grand-Fathers Arms, <hi>Noal: ibid.</hi> No man can bear his Mothers Arms; for Children follow the condition of their Father, not of their Mother; and yet the mother may by Paction or Testament provide, that they shall not succced, except they bear her Arms, in which case they may be forc'd to carry them if the Prince consent: For He only can bestow Arms; and without this the Son cannot bear them, <hi>Peleus act forens: c.</hi> 96. Whither <hi>agnati transversales,</hi> such as Nephews, Uncles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have right to carry the Arms that are given by the Prince to their Uncles, and those of his family may be doubted: and that they may is concluded by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; <hi>nam agnati intelliguntur esse de familia, l. pronunciatio, f. de verb. signif.</hi> But if the Arms be granted to a man and these descending of his body, they will thereby, or by any such expresse concession be secluded.</p>
            <p>It is most ordinar in <hi>Scotland</hi> to tailye Estates to the eldest Heir fernal, she marrying one who shall bear the name and arms of the disponers fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but whether the person who marries that Heretrix or Heiresse, as the <hi>English</hi> speak, may lawfully carry the disponners Arms, according to the Laws of Heraldry, wants not its scruple; seeing <hi>Arma gentilitia,</hi> which are presumed still to be granted to a man and his Heirs, <hi>non transeunt ad extraneos</hi>; else any man might give Arms, as well as the Prince or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds: Yet Lawyers are very positive that their pactions are lawful, <hi>&amp; qui liber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64440:61"/>
him, who is so assum'd or adopted by one of his own Predecessors, or Family; for these surely may bear the Arms of the adopter; And these who were strangers before the adoption; and they conclude that these cannot have right to the Arms: and this is asserted by <hi>Hopping. de jur. insig. cap.</hi> 7.5. <hi>num.</hi> 251. to be the common opinion of the best Lawyers. But I think it may be more justly distinguisht<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> whether the disposition be made to a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, she marrying one who shall bear the Name and Arms; for in that case certainly, the children may bear the Arms, for she was Heiresse her self: But if Lands were disponed to a meer stranger, not upon condition that he should marry a daughter, but that he should bear the Name and Arms; it may be in that case asserted, that the Receiver of the disposition cannot bear the Arms: for that was not in the disponners power to bestow, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Prince consent. And suitable to this it is observed by <hi>Co.</hi> 4. <hi>inst.</hi> 126. that <hi>Edmond de Eincourt</hi> obtain'd from <hi>E.</hi> 1. a liberty under the great Seal to assign his Name and Arms: but that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> did finde that such an assignation without the Kings consent, was voyd. And with us, if the King either confirm a right made of Name and Arms, or accept a Resignation upon that condition, this is thought equivalent to an original right. Though the descendent of him, to whom the Arms were first granted, may bear them; yet the eldest Son who represents the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver of the Arms, properly can only bear them intire by the Laws of <hi>Spain, Molim. l.</hi> 2. <hi>de hisp. primog.</hi> The same is observed in <hi>France, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomb. tit. de Brisurs</hi>: and <hi>Expilly</hi> relates <hi>Ã  decis.</hi> of the Parliament of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, anno</hi> 1496. wherein they found that the Cadets of the family, could not bear the Arms of it simply, and without distinction: the like was found by the Parliament of <hi>Tholouse, anno</hi> 1509. in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> the same is observ'd. In <hi>Piemount</hi> all the Sons of <hi>Counts</hi> bear the same Arms, without any other distinction, save that the eldest carrys the Crown of a Count, but the Cadets do not <hi>tessaur decis.</hi> 270. <hi>nu</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Germany,</hi> the several branches of great Families distinguish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves only by different Crests, without inserting any addition in the Arms themselves: as <hi>Menestrier</hi> observes, <hi>pag.</hi> 389. The eldest also of the three secular Electors, use in each of their Coats, the badge of their office as a mark of their office, rather then as a distinction, <hi>Hop. c.</hi> 7. and <hi>Gaspar. Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baci</hi> observes, that there are few or no differences us'd in <hi>Italy: che vuole essempi frequenti di arme di un medisimo liguaggio ln varie guise non sostantialmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te maaccidentalmente diversificate; bisogna que esca fuori d' Italia.</hi> And I think that the reason, why the <hi>Germans</hi> use none is, because all succeed equally there to the Honours and Estate. Likeas, it seems that in <hi>Italy</hi> the reason of frequent omitting them is, because there, the cadets are ordinarily Church-men; and these use, nor need no marks of difference or cadency; because they are to have no succession, and because ofttimes the cadet by his office, is greater, and more honourable then the eldest is by his birth, <hi>Menestrier, pag.</hi> 390. But our Church-men being allowed suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession ought to use these differences.</p>
            <p>These marks, whereby the Cadets or younger Sons do distinguish their Arms from those of the principal House, or the chief House, as we say in <hi>Scotland,</hi> are called <hi>Brisurs</hi> by the <hi>French</hi>: because Its <hi>brisent,</hi> they break the principle bearing of the Family. By the <hi>English,</hi> they are called diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64440:62"/>
and of late are call'd marks of Cadency by both when their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences were first instituted, is not easie to be determined; but that they are very old, may be conjectur'd from this, that <hi>Paradin</hi> makes <hi>Robert Count</hi> of <hi>Anjou</hi> who liv'd, <hi>anno</hi> 870. to bear the Arms of <hi>France</hi> within a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur Gules, for a difference.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Fern, pag.</hi> 155. Arms were divided into perfect, and abated Arms. Perfect were call'd abstract: But Arms fixal, and terminal were these of Cadets: This <hi>Guilims,</hi> and others have not noticed, and here he makes embording, as he calls it to be the difference of the second SonÂ·</p>

               <hi>Colombier</hi> relates, that in the <hi>Bibliotheck</hi> of the Count of <hi>Brien,</hi> he found those differences set down for Cadets, which are now received by the <hi>English,</hi> and ascriv'd to <hi>Vpton</hi>: to the eldest<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
               <hi>unlambeaux Ã  Trois pendans,</hi> a file of three <hi>Lambeaux:</hi> Which is not only a corruption, but a mistake of the <hi>French</hi>; for the beam is the <hi>Lambeau</hi>: But <hi>Guilims</hi> and others call the <hi>pendants lambeaux. Bartol.</hi> call them <hi>candela,</hi> and <hi>Upton lingulae sive labellae:</hi> This is given to the eldest son whilst his Father lives, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that he is but the third person, his Father being one, his Mother another, and himself being the third. I finde amongst our Arms, some bear this constantly; though they never were the eldest sons of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: as the Earl of <hi>Abercorn,</hi> who was at first but a second Son of the House of <hi>Hamilton</hi>: and <hi>Findaury,</hi> who was a second Son of the Family of <hi>Arbuthnet.</hi> I finde also, that at an Indentor betwixt <hi>David</hi> Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> Earle of <hi>Cranford, anno</hi> 1399. the Princes Coat is hung upon an oak tree, having no other Supporters, and the Coat is the ordinary Coat of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with a file of three <hi>labells</hi>; and I conceive that these files of three pendants, should be expunged out of these Coats: For though they be born sometimes as ordinary charges, and not as marks of difference; yet here they were originally given as marks of difference, as is clear from their blazone.</p>
            <p>The second Son has a Crescent, to show that he should encrease the Family, by adding to the Estate and Repute of the Family. The third an Mullet or Spur Ryal, to show that he should follow Chevalry. The fourth, a Martlet, because expecting no Patrimony, he should become a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and defend Castles, which were the only old Fortifications, in which Castles Martlets use to make their nests. The fifth, an annulet <hi>d' or,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him to atchieve great actions: the Badge whereof was in old times, <hi>jus aureorum annulorum.</hi> The sixth, a Flower <hi>de iuce,</hi> to remember him of his Countrey and Prince. The seventh, a double Rose, to remember him to endeavour to flourish like that excellent Flower. The eighth, an Cross Moulin, or the anchoring Crosse, to remember to grip when he can fasten<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> seing he has nothing else, to which he may trust. The ninth, a double quater foil, or a Flower of eighth leaves, to expresse that he is remov'd from his eldest Brother, and the Succession by eight degrees.</p>
            <p>The modern French, and generally all Nations do now reprobat these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected forms; and allow every privat person to take what mark of distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can sute best with the Coat, which his Chief bears. Against the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer differences these Arguments may be brought.</p>
            <p>First, that the <hi>French,</hi> from whom these were borrow'd, have rejected them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. No other Nation uses them: and uniformity should be very much
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64440:62"/>
studied in Heraldry, to avoid confusion; and that our Arms may be the more universally understood.</p>
            <p n="3">3. These, nor no constant differences can suit with all Arms; for if the Bearer had three Crescents proper, two, and one; it were very irregular to adject a fourth, which would wronge both the beauty and regularity of the former bearing. Sometimes also the whole Shield is <hi>semÃ© de fleuer de lis,</hi> all covered with flower de luces: In which case it were impossible that a flower deluce could be a distinction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is appointed by that Rule, that the mark of cadency shall be still placed in the centre of the Shield; as <hi>Colombier</hi> relates of that old forme, <hi>pag.</hi> 74. whereas in many Coats paternal, or in Coats Armours of chief Families, the Centre point is naturally charg'd with some of those same marks, as Crescents, Flower deluces, Annulets; <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The only reason why it is prest, that the differences should be known is, to the end that the degrees of Consanguinity may be clearly instructed; whereas if the degrees be not remote, then they are easily known without such cognizances; but if they be remote, then thir cognizances are ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: for no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>emoter degree than the grand child of the first Sons can be thus known: for though the second Son (for example) who is descended of a former second Son, may take a Crescent upon a Crescent; yet it is not conceiveable how this second Son, or his second Son can be thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished by his Arms.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This confounds all the ancient Coats, and has absurdly fill'd ours with moe Crescents and Mullets then are in the Arms of all <hi>Europe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
            <p n="7">7. These differences do respect <hi>France</hi> in some things, which are not communicable to <hi>Britain</hi>: For the Flower deluce was given at first to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the bearer of his Countrey; that Flower being the ordinary cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of <hi>France:</hi> But seing the Flower deluce is not the cognizance of <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>England</hi>; therefore that ground ceases with us.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Colomber</hi> does very well observe, that the old forms were contrare to the Rules alow'd in Heraldry, by the consent of all Nations; for no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject can take that for his Arms, much lesse for a distinction or diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is a part of the Soveraigns Coat; and therefore the Flower deluce being a Royal Bearing with us, no subject ought to bear it as a mark of difference.</p>
            <p>And lastly though these may show that they were once second Brothers, yet they are not perfect marks of difference: Because many Cadets wear the same difference, and thus many Families do bear Crescents, as Second Sons of <hi>Huntly</hi>: and there have been twenty second Sons of that Familie, which no Crescent could distinguish: whereas if they had taken another difference at pleasure, they might have shun'd that confusion; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrating the mark given Cadets in the <hi>Lyons</hi> Register, with the reasons why they are given to that son, and at what time, will clear much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the degrees of Consanguinity, then these differences can: and yet that was the only reason, why these differences were invented. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Colomb.</hi> concludes thus, <hi>mais quant Ã  m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> have constantly, and the <hi>Scots</hi> frequently taken such diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, or brisurs as might expresse at once some considerable alliance, or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64440:63"/>
action, and might likewise distinguish their Families from that of their Chief; for so we call the representative of the Family, from the <hi>French</hi> Word <hi>chef,</hi> a head: and in the <hi>Irish</hi> with us the chief of the Family, is call'd the head of the Clane. Thus the Lord <hi>Balmerrinoch</hi> cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ges the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veron, which the <hi>Elphinston</hi> carryes, with three Buckles; because his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>Monteeth,</hi> and daughter to the Laird of <hi>Carse,</hi> whose charge these are: and the Lord <hi>Couper,</hi> Brother to <hi>Balmerrinoch</hi> did charge the Cheve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, with three hearts, because his mother was daughter to <hi>Maxwel</hi> of <hi>Newark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes also they chang'd only the colour of any one part of their chiefs bearing, and sometimes they alter'd the ordinaries, taking on a bend these cognizances, which the Chief carry'd in chief, or upon a Saltire what he carry'd on a Crosse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is to be seen in the Families descended of the <hi>Craufoords, Rutherfoords, Purvesses, &amp;c.</hi> Our Predecessors also took marks of difference from their Employments: and thus <hi>Forbes</hi> of <hi>Corse,</hi> a Cross fitchÃ©, because they were Learned-Church-men for many generations: <hi>Bruce</hi> of <hi>Earls-hall</hi> a Flower deluce, given him as a reward by the <hi>French</hi> King; which the Patent yet showes: and there are no better differences<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> than any one of the ordinaries, or to alter the ordinary lines: Thus Sir <hi>William Bruce</hi> of <hi>Balcaskie</hi> got the lowest line of the Chief in the <hi>Bruces</hi> Arms wav'd, to show his kindnesse to, and his Skill in the art of Navigation. Sometimes also Cadets add to the number of what is born by their Predecessors; as if he carry two Stars, they add a third: and sometimes they diminish the Number, otherwise alter the position, so that if the eldest have five Crescents saltire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, the Cadet will dispose them on a Bend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Albiet every person may take any Cognizance he pleases to difference his own Arms, from these of the Chief, and all others of the name; yet there are some Rules here to be observed: as First, that they take no part of their Princes Arms, without his Majesties licence: Such as Lyons, nor the double tressure flower deluc'd, and contre flower-deluc'd, nor the flower deluce simple: for though his Majestie bears not these, as Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> yet they are still a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bearing: and the Doctors assert that this Rule holds in <hi>Spain,</hi> as to all the Kingdoms under that Kings subjection.</p>
            <p>The bearing, or charge of the Chiefs house should not be alter'd, as many Families in <hi>Scotland</hi> have done: Thus <hi>Auchinleck</hi> of <hi>Balmanno</hi> gives arg. a Cross embatled Sable; whereas <hi>Auchinleck</hi> of that Ilk gives arg. three Bars sable: and <hi>Scot</hi> of <hi>Balwyrie</hi> bears different Arms from these of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleuch.</hi> But this was occasion'd by Cadets, their marrying Heretrixes, whose Arms they assum'd without using their own, seing they got no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony from their Predecessors.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is irregular to alter the Chiefs Colours, as <hi>Campbel</hi> of <hi>Lundy</hi> does, who bears gyronie of eight pieces Er. and Sa. whereas the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> bears gyrone of eight peeces (as we erroneously blazen) <hi>O.</hi> and Sa: yet this was allow'd of old by our Custome, which may defend what was done, though it should be no precedent for the future, seing all Nations do now endeavourvery justly, not to differ, that so all Arms may be universally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was thought irregular to diminish any part of the Chiefs bearing, as <hi>Campbel</hi> of <hi>Cesnock</hi> has done, who fill'd the room of one of the <hi>Gyrons</hi> with a Cheveron: for how can he be said to bear the Chiefs Arms with a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64440:63"/>
difference, who diminishes them, and how can it be known that he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended of that Family when he bears not the Arms of it: For either of the alterations makes the bearings very different, and there are original Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies who differ only so; and yet such differences are ordinar abroad.</p>
            <p n="4">4. These Cadets, who have their Arms quarter'd with other Arms, need no difference: for the quartering, or empaling is a sufficient difference: as is clear in the example of <hi>Campbel</hi> of <hi>Glenarchie, Hoom</hi> of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>nton,</hi> and others: And therefore it was unnecessar for the Earle of <hi>Kellie</hi> to have born a Crescent for a mark of difference, as Second Son of the Earl of <hi>Mar,</hi> seing he bears quarterly with the Arms <hi>Aerskine</hi> 1. and 4. an Imperial Crown within a double Tressure <hi>Or:</hi> bestowed upon him for his assistance given to King James in <hi>Gauri</hi>'s conspiracy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is observable, that though a Cadet be descended of a Cadet, yet I think, he needs not express the difference of that Family, out of which he is immediatly come; for else the Coat should be fill'd with differences, and the use of differences, is only to distinguish from the chiefs Family. Albeit there be no stated, and constant differences in <hi>France,</hi> yet the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dets of the Royal Family have their certain and constant differencies: <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> carrys the label, <hi>aniou</hi> a bordur Gules, <hi>Alencon</hi> a bordure G, charg'd with eight besants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for by these they are known to the people in Coaches.</p>
            <p>It is also observable, That the Heralds of all Nations aggree, that Sisters should carry no mark of difference; the reason of which is by <hi>Guilims</hi> said to be, that when they are marry'd, they losse their sirname, and receive that of their Husbands. But I crave pardon to think this reason not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; for it would only prove that they should not at all bear their paternal Coats, and yet I have formerly demonstrated, that they may in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; nor does the reason prove, that daughters before their marriage, should not bear their paternal Coats with difference, seing till then they loose not their own sirnames. But the true reason of this rule is, that albeit amongst Sons, the eldest excludes all the younger from the Succession, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore differences are given for clearing the right of succession amongst Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yet Sisters succeed equally, and are Heirs Portioners, and so there is no use for thir differences amongst them, seing Seniority infers no priviledge.</p>
            <p>It is generally believed, that thir differences are excepted from that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule, whereby it is declared false Haraldry to place colour upon co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or mettal upon mettal (though <hi>Guilims</hi> nor <hi>Carter</hi> have not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it) But yet seing the instances of this exception, are only given in Royal Bearings, I conceive it is safer to avoid the exception in Coat-arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours of private persons: <hi>Sunt enim Principes legibus soluti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In what part of the Shield these differences should be born, is not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: But the point of Honour is the most proper place, in my opinion, to receive diminutions or additions of honour; and yet <hi>Guilims, Morgan,</hi> and others give us many different examples as to the place: for <hi>Wingfield</hi> bears for a difference a flower deluce in the sinister point of the Chief, <hi>Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> a Crescent for a difference in the midle point of the Chief, <hi>pag.</hi> 243. and in <hi>Scotland</hi> it is generally receiv'd, that the differences should be plac'd upon the point of honour; but to place them at liberty, may lessen much the easiness of knowing, when the things design'd for difference are not so; and yet it is impossible to place them in one fixt place in all Shields,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64440:64"/>
because that place may be charg'd with some figure in the paternal Coat, which cannot well admit the difference to be supercharg'd. But to evite all thir difficulties, it were to be wish'd, that the differences should still be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended to the base without the Shield; for by that means neither should the Shield be confounded, nor should we mistake the original charge for a difference, <hi>nec Ã¨ contra</hi>: or at least that exact Registers were kept of thir di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, which would much better clear the degree of Consanguinity.</p>

            <p>SUch as are not born in lawful marriage, are divided by Lawyers <hi>in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turales, spurios, &amp; ex damnatis complexibus procreatos</hi>: but by our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinar Stile, all of these go now under the general name of Bastards, <hi>Bartol. in l. Pronounciatio f. de verb. signif.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a received rule amongst Heralds, that Bastards should not bear their paternal Coat, <hi>nam de jure patrem demonstrare nequeunt:</hi> and therefore se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the common law determines not who is their Father, it were absurd that the Laws of Heraldry should allow them to bear any mans Arms, as their paternal Coat: This rule is allow'd by <hi>Hopping. de jure insign. cap.</hi> Â§. 3. <hi>Colomb. cap.</hi> 11. <hi>Guilims, pag.</hi> 72. <hi>Farin. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>tit.</hi> 2. <hi>quaest.</hi> 13. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch. concil.</hi> 117. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Boer decis.</hi> 127. But though this hold in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> where Bastards are not at all allow'd to bear the Arms of their supposed Fathers; yet it is otherwise in some Countreys, as in <hi>France, Britain</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>; in which their Heralds have allow'd, that they may bear the Arms of him who is alledged to be their Father with the difference of a Battoun.</p>
            <p>Some Lawyers call this Battoun <hi>Barra, sive baculum, Sintag. jur. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>num.</hi> 6. <hi>lib.</hi> 45. <hi>som tinea lutea, Hopping,</hi> Some <hi>linea Tepat. cap.</hi> 5. Some call it <hi>divisÃ¨ Mar: quest,</hi> 1140. The <hi>Germans</hi> call it <hi>strich,</hi> and <hi>Bacho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> most improperly calls it <hi>tignum</hi>; for <hi>tignum</hi> is a Cheveron.</p>
            <p>This Battoun is the fourth part of the bend sinister according to <hi>Guilims,</hi> and should extend to the Corners of the Shield: but it should be <hi>cupÃ©,</hi> or cut short of both, it represents a cudgel, and is given to Bastards to show that they were not free men, but lyable as slaves of old were, and servants yet are, to be beat and cudgell'd: And though in <hi>France</hi> the Brisurs, or differences of Princes of the blood differ from these of private persons, yet Bastards have in both the same cognizance as the <hi>French G</hi>: In <hi>England</hi> the Brisur of Royal Bastards is still of Mettal; but I think it may be varied in its colour, according to the colours or mettals of the Coat, lest there be colour upon colour, or mettal upon mettal: For, albeit some say that Brisurs should be excepted from that Rule; yet I think that the note of Bastardy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves no such priviledge.</p>
            <p>I cannot be so partial here, as not to reprove an error of my own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men, who make the mark of Bastardy to be a Ribban Sable, and make it to extend from the dexter Corner of the Shield to the sinister: For the mark of Bastardy should still be sinister, nor is it call'd a Ribband in any Nation, and though we have received an opinion, that the Bastards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64440:64"/>
may be after three generations born <hi>dextre,</hi> or omitted; yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the opinion is most unwarrantable: For <hi>jura sanguinis nunquam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribuntur,</hi> and in the bastards of great Families this were very dangerous, for the bastards might pretend to the succession by this means, albeit that mark was invented to exclude them.</p>
            <p>Yet, it is certain, that such as were once Bastards, but are Legittimated by subsequent marriage, may bear the Fathers Arms without any such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution: <hi>Menoch, Concil.</hi> 128.</p>
            <p>Whether such as are Legittimated by Letters of Legittimation, <hi>per rescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Principis,</hi> may cary their Paternal Coat, is much debated: Some think that they cannot: because the Prince cannot bestow the right of bloud, as he cannot make a stranger an <hi>agnat,</hi> and the bearing of Arms is only compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to such, nor can such as are Legittimated, <hi>per rescriptum Principis</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the feudal rights belonging to the defunct, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Feud. cap.</hi> 15. nor do such Legittimations as these, enoble the children of noblemen, who were formerly Bastards: <hi>Tiraquel. de nobilitat. cap.</hi> 15. <hi>num.</hi> 16. Others conclude that any Legittimation, empowers the person Legittimated to bear his fathers Arms; <hi>nam pro legittimis habentur &amp; jus sui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But a third sort unwilling to extend favours done to Bastards, beyond what is necessar, and yet unwilling to bound the power of Princes too narrowly, in the matter of honour, which flow'd originally from them, have concluded, that Legittimations by the Prince does not empower the person, who is Legittimated to bear his Fathers Coat, except that power were expresly contain'd in his Legittimation, <hi>nisi Legittimatio expresse ad delationem armorum facta fuerit, Hopping de jur. insignium, cap.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Albeit, Bastards be absolutely excluded from bearing the Arms of their suppos'd Father plain, and without a diminution; yet it is doubted if they may not bear their mothers Arms: <hi>Gothofred ad l.</hi> 2. <hi>de muncip.</hi> thinks they may because (sayes he) the Law must allow them some original, and the marks of it: But so it is, they are not allow'd to bear their fathers Arms. 2dly Bastards are admitted by the succession of the mother equally with her law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful children, <hi>l. pen.

            <p>These who writ as Lawyers upon this subject, do remark, that Arms are diminished, or lost, for murder, falshood, oppression, false witness, and a profligat life; and that they are many several wayes defac'd, or diminshed, such as abrasion, perforation; but the most ordinary way is by reversing and ryving: which <hi>Far.</hi> observes to be ordinary in the case of treason, <hi>de crim. les. maj. cap.</hi> 16. which punishment is in observance by the Laws, and Customs of <hi>Scotland</hi>; for when any person is forfeited in Parliament, the Lyon, and his brethren Heralds come in with their Coats, and formalities, and the Lyon does publickly tear the Arms of the person forfeited, and if he be a Cadet of a Family, he sayes openly that the tearing of these Arms shall be without prejudice to the Nobleman or chief, whose Arms these are; after which he and his brethren go to the Cross, and there he hangs up the Shield revers'd, turning the base, or lowest point upwards: Which <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an tract. crim. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 31. asserts to be us'd in imitation of the old form of hanging traitors by the feer.</p>
            <p>It is debated amongst Lawyers, whether the children of forfeited trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors loose thus the Arms of their predecessors, and the ordinar resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that either the Father who was forfeited, was the first who got Arms, and then he being forfeited, his Arms are not transmitted: But if his Arms pertained formerly to his Family; then his crymes does not debare his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from using them: For cryms should only infer punishment against the committers, <hi>vid. ant. Fabr. l.</hi> 9. <hi>tit.</hi> 29. <hi>&amp; Tiraquel de nobil. c.</hi> 35. But they advise them to crave restitution as the safer way. With us the children of forfeited parents do use their predecessors Arms without being restored.</p>
            <p>Not only in treason, but in other cryms this is allowed, as in the cryme of barratrie, or perverting of justice, <hi>Gigas quest.</hi> 2. <hi>n. i.</hi> and in the cryme of <hi>ambitus,</hi> or unjust acquiring of an office, <hi>Tiraquel. de nobilit. c.</hi> 6. And of murder, <hi>Laur. per. pag.</hi> 45. and in the cryme of falshood, where any man does falsly assume other mens Arms, <hi>l. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>With us, only treason forfeits Arms once given, except the sentence provide otherwise.</p>
            <p>The Lyon may judge with us if Arms be lawfully assum'd; but the Lyon cannot take away a mans Arms, upon commission of a cry me; But in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Heralds have power to take away Arms, upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

            <p>In these abatments, the <hi>French</hi> differ from the <hi>English,</hi> both in the form, and colour of their abatments: for the <hi>English</hi> assign a delf-<hi>tenne</hi> to him who revocketh a challenge.</p>
            <p>An inescutcheon revers'd <hi>sanguin,</hi> for deflouring a Maid.</p>
            <p>A point <hi>dexter</hi> for too much boasting in Martial Acts.</p>

            <p>A point plain <hi>sanguine,</hi> for telling lyes to a Soveraign, or General.</p>
            <p>The whole Coat of Arms revers'd is proper only to a traitor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Menestier</hi> calls these <hi>English</hi> fancies: for who would bear such abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor have I ever seen such abatements born by any: and therefore I rather think, that lesse remarkable Figures are to be us'd, and possibly beasts looking to the left hand, or broken cheverons, have at first been diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and I find that the Family of <hi>Tiepoli</hi> were for a conspiracy in <hi>Venice,</hi> by the Senate forc'd to quite the Tour arg<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> they carried, and take a Vipers Tail, <hi>anno</hi> 1310. And one of the Family of <hi>Fastrzenbeir</hi> in <hi>Pole</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accessory to the murder of St. <hi>Stinslaus, anno</hi> 1279. was forc'd to bear the horse shoes he bore pointing downward, whereas they pointed upward formerly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> call these abatements, <hi>des marques d'infamie,</hi> and call the Arms wherein these are born, <hi>des armes deschargees &amp; rompues,</hi> and to a <hi>Rodomontado</hi> or <hi>Hector,</hi> who boasts injustly of his pretended courage, they do gild the dextre point of the chief of his Shield.</p>
            <p>To him who kill'd his prisoner, the blunted point of his Shield.</p>
            <p>To him who broke his paroll, they gave a delph (which they call un-tablet) gules in caur point.</p>
            <p>To him who lyed betwixt the Prince, and his Subjects they coloured the point of his Shield <hi>gules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To him who was a coward they gave a gore <hi>sinister.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes Princes do for an abatment, diminish a part of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bearing: Thus St. <hi>Lewes</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> ordain'd, that <hi>Iean A'vesnes</hi> should bear no more a Lyon arm'd, and langu'd; because he had abus'd his mother in his discourse before the King: And <hi>Edward</hi> the third of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ordain'd of two sex Stars, which a Gentleman had in his Arms to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd; because he had sold a Sea-port, of which he was made Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXIV. MARSHALING.</head>
            <p>TIll now, I have only treated of distinct Coats Armours, and other abatments: in the next, my method obliges me to consider mo Coats Armours joyn'd together, the disposing of which is call'd to marshal. The <hi>French</hi> allow moe Coats to be marshall'd, to the number of 32. and the <hi>English,</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> to the number of 40. as <hi>Colomb</hi> observes, <hi>cap.</hi> 8. but I find not the number exprest by any <hi>English</hi> Heraulds in their own books. In <hi>Scotland</hi> we exceed not six; only the Viscount of <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (who was an <hi>English</hi> man) did bear 33.</p>
            <p>Coat-armours are marshall'd together either to signifie an additione by marriage, by estate, by office, or by dignitie.</p>
            <p>The learndest <hi>Antiquaries,</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> (who call quartring <hi>cumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio armorum</hi>) do observe that the quartring of Coats, did proceed at first from the vanity of Kings and Princes, who added the Arms of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, or acquired Kingdoms to these which they bore formerly, <hi>Bart. tract, de insign. num.</hi> 13. the first instance whereof is given, in the arms of <hi>Castill,</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> and they conclude, that when a person leaves his Estate to another, upon condition that he shall bear the disponers name, and arms; he who is to succeed, is not by condition oblidged to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side his own name and arms: but may quarter his own arms, with these of the disponer, except the disponer do, in the institution, prohibite the bearing of any arms, beside his own, <hi>Fachin. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Concil.</hi> 6. <hi>num.</hi> 3. and the Heir in <hi>Marshalling</hi> his own, and the disponers arms, may use what order he pleases, by giving the first quarter either to his own, or to the disponers; except the contrair be exprest in the institution, <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saur. decis. Pedemont.</hi> 270. upon which condition <hi>Percey</hi> got the Estate of the <hi>Lucies</hi> in <hi>England, Cambd. Brit. page</hi> 630.</p>
            <p>When a man joyns in the arms of his wife, with his own in one Shield, he does it by dividing the Shield <hi>per pale,</hi> in two parts; on the right side the mans, and on the left the wifes are plac'd; and therefore this form of bearing is call'd <hi>impaling,</hi> from the <hi>pale</hi> that divides the arms, and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> and <hi>femme</hi> from the different arms that are born; <hi>Barron</hi> signifies a man, and <hi>femme</hi> is the only <hi>French</hi> word for a woman: So that <hi>Barron,</hi> and <hi>Femme</hi> is a mixt expression; and man and wife would do much better: for now neither <hi>French</hi> nor <hi>English</hi> understand it.</p>
            <p>If a man marry an Heretrix, he himself <hi>impales</hi> only her Arms; but his children procreat of that marriage quarters them; the first, and fourth quarters should contain the fathers arms, and the third, and fourth, the mothers: Thus the Earl of <hi>Rothes</hi> bears two Coats quarterly, first and fourth, (some say last) <hi>arg.</hi> on a <hi>bend azur</hi> three <hi>buckles Or,</hi> by the name of <hi>Lesly</hi> his Paternal Coat: second and third <hi>Or,</hi> a Lyon rampand <hi>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>les,</hi> Surmounted of a Ribband <hi>Sable,</hi> by the name of <hi>Abernethie</hi>: and yet sometimes the Paternal Coat is not the first, which falls out upon many accounts, as for instance, when the Heirs derive not only their Heritage,
<pb facs="tcp:64440:67"/>
               <figure/>
               <pb facs="tcp:64440:68"/>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:64440:68"/>
but their Title and Dignity, from the Mother: And thus the Earl of <hi>Marr</hi> bears two Coats quarterly, First and Fourth <hi>azur,</hi> a <hi>Bend</hi> betwixt six <hi>Cross Cressets fitchÃ©e Or,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Marr</hi>; 2. and 3. <hi>arg.</hi> a <hi>pale sable,</hi> for his Paternal Coat as <hi>Areskin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes also there are four, or moe Coats marshall'd together upon this account, according to the number of the Heretrices, whom the Bearers predecessors have married, and then all the Coats are not twice born.</p>
            <p>Sometimes also (sayes <hi>Guilims</hi>) he who marries an Heretrix, may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her Arms in an Inescutcheon upon his own; because the husband pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that his heirs shall one day inherit an Estate by her; it is therefore called an Escutcheon of pretence: but this way of Bearing is not known abroad upon that occasion.</p>
            <p>With us in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in <hi>France</hi> also it is ordinar, where many Coats must be Marshal'd, That the Bearers own Arms are born in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escutcheon, as the <hi>English</hi> and we terme it improperly; for an Inescut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheon is properly that which is born within the Shield; but the <hi>French</hi> doe better terme it <hi>Sur-tout,</hi> a Shield over all, because it covers some piece of all the other Shields which are plac'd about it: Thus the Marquess of <hi>Dowglass</hi> beareth 4 Coats, 1. <hi>azur,</hi> a Lyon Rampant <hi>arg.</hi> crown'd Or, for the Name of <hi>Mcdowald.</hi> 2. <hi>Or,</hi> a Lyon Rampant <hi>gules,</hi> surmounted of a Ribband Bend-wise <hi>sable,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Abernethy.</hi> 3. <hi>Azur,</hi> 3 Pyles in point <hi>gules,</hi> for the Name of <hi>Wishart</hi>; I call them rather Passion-Nails; born by the <hi>Iesuits</hi> also, and an ordinar Bearing among such as went to the Holy-war. 4. <hi>Or,</hi> a <hi>Fesse checkie azur</hi> and <hi>arg.</hi> surmounted of a Bend <hi>sable,</hi> charg'd with three Buckles, above all his paternal Coat, which is <hi>arg.</hi> a crown'd Heart in the point of Honour on a Chief <hi>azur,</hi> three Mollets of the first. I must here take notice of an errour in some of our Heraulds, who call, a Shield above all, a Shield of pretence: for it is absurd to say, that a man carries his paternal Coat, as a Shield of pretence; and therefore I say only above all; this of old was call'd, a <hi>Fesse Target, Fern.</hi> 207.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the Arms of one of the Heretrices are born in a <hi>sur-toutes,</hi> or above all: thus the Earl of <hi>Sutherland</hi> bear <hi>Huntlies</hi> four Coats; and above all <hi>gules,</hi> three Mollets <hi>Or,</hi> for the Name of <hi>Sutherland</hi>; this our Heraulds terme erroneously, a Shield of pretence also, for a Shield of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is only born by him who marries the Heretrix; but not by the Heirs procreat of the marriage, who should quarter the Arms. Here there seem'd a necessity to place the <hi>Sutherlands</hi> in a <hi>sur-tout,</hi> or above all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there were four Coats born by him, as a son of the Earl of <hi>Huntly</hi>; but this is lately alter'd, and that of <hi>Sutherland</hi> is placed first and fourth, and the Coats of <hi>Huntly</hi> in the second and third place. I finde this Bearing us'd, where the Shield above all might have been in one of the Quarters: thus the Earl of <hi>Hume</hi> bears quarterly 1. and 4. <hi>vert,</hi> a Lyon Rampant <hi>arg.</hi> by the Name of <hi>Humes</hi> 2. and 3. three Pepingoes, by the Name of <hi>Pepdie,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all <hi>Or,</hi> an <hi>Orle azur,</hi> by the Name of <hi>Landells</hi>; but these Coats might have been better marshall'd thus, 1. and 4. <hi>Pepdies,</hi> 2. and 3. <hi>Landells,</hi> and the <hi>Humes</hi> Arms in a <hi>sur-tout,</hi> or above all; or 1. and 4. <hi>Hume,</hi> 2. <hi>Pepdies,</hi> and 3. <hi>Landells,</hi> either of which had been more proper.</p>
            <p>When the Arms which are quartered, are the Arms of private Families, we say not, That he bears the Arms of that Family in general, but we Blazon the particular Bearing; but when the Quarters are the Arms of great, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64440:69"/>
well known Families, then it is good Heraldry to say in general, He bears the Arms of such a Family in general, without Blazoning them: as in Blazoning the Earl of <hi>Sutherland</hi>'s Arms, we say, he bears the Arms of <hi>Huntly,</hi> without Blazoning the particulars of <hi>Huntlys</hi> Coats.</p>
            <p>That the Terms of Marshalling may be know in <hi>Latine,</hi> I have blazon'd the Earl of <hi>Wintons</hi> Coat thus, <hi>In solo quadrifido gestatur primo</hi> Setonius, <hi>nempe in auro tres Lunae crescentes Ambiente teniÃ¢ gemellÃ¢ exlil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>is utrinque florente rubicundÃ¢, in secundo Buchania, Umboni superinducitur Vintoniae ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulius insignitus Cometa ignescente tenia gemella florida aurea concepta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Shield above all had been an Escutcheon of pretence, the <hi>Latine</hi> had said, <hi>Pretenditur Clypeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was very ordinar in <hi>Scotland</hi> not to quarter the Heretrix's Coat, but to take a part of it into the Husbands paternal Shield; and thus <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> of <hi>Innerveik</hi> did take the Face <hi>checkie,</hi> when he married <hi>Stewart</hi> Heretrix of <hi>Bancreef:</hi> And this seems very proper, when the Husband is not tyed to bear the Father in Law's Arms by tailzie or express paction.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the Husband did of old assume only the Wifes Arms who was an Heretrix, as <hi>Scot</hi> of <hi>Balcleuch</hi> the Arms of <hi>Murdiston,</hi> and <hi>Naper</hi> the Arms of <hi>Lennox,</hi> and did not bear their own native Arms.</p>
            <p>Coat-Armours are Marshall'd sometimes for Honour, and signifie not Alliances, nor an Estate come by Heretrices; but when Earls are created, they get honourable Additions, which are quarter'd or impal'd with their paternal Coat, of Impaling I formerly gave an example in the Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness</hi> Coat.</p>
            <p>As to quartering we have many instances; Thus the Marquess of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trose</hi> bears two Coats quarterly, first and fourth <hi>arg.</hi> on a <hi>Chief sable,</hi> 3. Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calops Or, by the Name of <hi>Grahame,</hi> second and third <hi>arg.</hi> three Roses as <hi>Montrose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes the Coats of Augmentation are plac'd first, and fourth, and sometimes the paternal Coat is first plac'd; as to which these Rules should be observed, 1. If the person whose Coat is to be augmented be a person of an old Family, and its Representative, he ought to keep his own Coat 1. and 4. as <hi>Montrose</hi> doth; but a Cadet may place his Coat of augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 2. and 3. because his Honour is above his Birth: But if His Majesty bestow any part of His own Arms, even upon an ancient Family in their Coat of Augmentation, then the Coat of Augmentation is to be first.</p>
            <p>Some when they are advanc'd to dignities, if they be not obliged to quarter the Coat of some Heretrix, they do for a difference take Crest or Supporters of the Family out of which they are descended, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with their paternal Coat: As the Viscount of <hi>Kingston</hi> bears 1. and 4. the Arms of <hi>Seatoun,</hi> in the 2. and 3. <hi>arg.</hi> a wing'd Dragon <hi>vert.</hi> vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire, which Dragon is the Crest of his eldest brother the Earl of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton:</hi> But I approve not this way of Marshalling, and I would rather al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a second Brother, or any Cadet, when nobilitated, to bear the Arms of the house with a difference, except he were oblig'd by his marrying an Heretrix, to quarter her Arms, or had got some Symbole of his Majesties Favour to reward some great service done him.</p>
            <p>Some get Cognizances and Rewards of Honour from their Prince, not by way of impaling, or quartering, but in a Canton; thus the Earl of <hi>Annandale</hi> got from King <hi>Iames</hi> the sixth in a Canton, <hi>arg.</hi> a Thistle <hi>vert.</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:64440:69"/>
crown'd Or; and the Earl of <hi>Elgin</hi> got in a Canton, a Lyon rampant Gules, arm'd <hi>azur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes also a Shield over all is given, as a reward of Honour: thus the Earl of <hi>Stirling</hi> did bear two Coats quarterly, and over all, an Inescutcheon of <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> because he was the first Planter of it.</p>
            <p>When any Nobleman at his creation, takes or gets a new additional Symbole, as Earl, (as <hi>Montrose</hi> carries the Roses, not as <hi>Grahame,</hi> but as Earl) I think that these Coats, or Symbols, should not be transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Cadets; but are incommunicable, as the Honours are, to signifie which they were granted. And such as are descended from the Dukes of <hi>Lennox,</hi> may as well take the Symbole, which he bears as Admiral, as such as are descended from the Earl of <hi>Montrose,</hi> may take these Roses, which he bears as Earl: And yet custome has prevailed against this Rule.</p>

               <p>The reason why Bishops, and other Officers have their own Coats impal'd with those of their Office, is because they are in Law, in place of Husbands to their Office: and therefore the Canon Law calls a Bishop, or other benefic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>ONe of the chief parts of Armour is a Helmet: because it covers the chief part of man, which is his Head; and therefore it is made by Heraulds, one of the chief ornaments of their Coat Armours.</p>
            <p>It was of old called <hi>Galea,</hi> from the <hi>Greek</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, a Cats skin whereof it was made; <hi>Cassis</hi> by the <hi>Romans</hi>: It is now call'd <hi>Helm,</hi> by the <hi>Germans,</hi> from the <hi>Dutch</hi> word <hi>Helm,</hi> which signifies the Head; hence comes the <hi>French</hi> word <hi>Heaume,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> word <hi>Helmet,</hi> and the <hi>Italian, Elmo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who should bear Helmets, and in what manner they should be born, is much controverted; And whole Nations, rather than private Authors, do here disagree amongst themselves: and yet most of them agree in this, that it is nobler to bear an open Helmet, than a closs one; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the open Helm is given to, and is only fit for, such as have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and so must see what others do, and must speak to them, and tell them what they ought to do; Whereas, such as are obliged to thrust themselves into all dangers, and need little to see others, and speak none, should bear a Helmet closse: <hi>Nostri mores</hi> (sayes <hi>Besold thesaur. Pract. duplicem faciunt stech-vnd<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Thermer helm) illam ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beiorum, &amp; clausam; hanc nobilium, &amp; opertam:</hi> and yet this Rule is not without all exception, for <hi>Hopping. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp; Aldrovand. tom</hi>-1. <hi>pag.</hi> 91. observe, that in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> some great Families bear no Helmets upon their Coat Armours; and others bear their Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets closs; and gives an instance in the Dukes of <hi>Brunswick</hi>: but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all Nations use Helmets in their Heraldrie, and distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt open and closs Helmets.</p>
            <p>Because the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> do differ so much in their Rules here, I resolve to give an account of both their principles, and to begin with the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> allow a Gentleman to bear, a side-standing Helmet with the baver closs: which was the <hi>Roman</hi> custom, as appears by <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal.</hi>

            <p>To all Persons above the dignity of a Knight, and below that of a Duke, a side-Helmet with an open-fac'd guard visure.</p>
            <p>To Dukes, and all above them, a Helmet which is full forward o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen-fac'd with guard visures.</p>

            <p>To a Knight they allow, a side-standing Helmet, with 5 Barrs in his Guard <hi>vizur: Fenestras distinctas clathris seu cancellis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To a Barron, they allow, to carry his Helm half side-wise, half in Front, <hi>en Tiers,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> call it, with 7 Griles or Barrs.</p>
            <p>To Counts, Vidames, and Viscounts, a direct standing Helmet, with 9 Barrs.</p>
            <p>To Marquesses, a direct standing Helmet, with 11 Barrs.</p>
            <p>To Kings and Emperours, a direct Helmet, altogether open.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Scotland</hi> agrees with <hi>England,</hi> in the Bearing of their Helmets, yet I must confess, that both by the consent of all other Nations, and in reason also, it were fitter to give Kings Helmets fully open, without <hi>Garde visurs</hi> (as the <hi>French</hi> do) than to Knights, as we do; for Knights are in more danger, and have less need to command; and seing all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons agree that a direct standing, is more noble than a side-wise standing, I see not why the Helmet of a Knight should stand direct, and a Dukes only side-wise: <hi>Sculptura, sive ornament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is likewise this difference betwixt them, that the <hi>English</hi> make no difference, betwixt the Bearers, from the Metall of which the Helmets is made; whereas the <hi>French</hi> allow only the Knights, a Helmet adorn'd with Silver; to Counts, and all above them, they allow Helmets adorn'd with Gold; and to Kings, all the Helmet <hi>damasquin'd</hi>: But Limneus, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. sayes thus, <hi>Altora est differentia, quod Duces uti possunt aureis, Comites argenteis, reliqui verÃ² ferreis,</hi> Ovid.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXVII. of MANTLINGS.</head>
            <p>OF old, Knights, and such as did wear Helmets, took great pains to keep them very neat, and clear; and therefore they did cover them with Linning, or Stuff doubled with Silk, which served also to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them in the Battel: And when they went to Battel, these Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings being very much cut, and torn, they did thereafter paint them with their Casques in their Atchievement, or Arms; and these we call Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlings in <hi>English,</hi> which hang down cut now with Art and Curiosity: The <hi>French</hi> call them, <hi>Lambreqains,</hi> from the <hi>Latine, Lamberare,</hi> (it may be) which, as <hi>Festus</hi> observes, signifies <hi>to cut or tear,</hi> because these were torn; the <hi>Germans, Helm-de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sometimes Skins of Beasts, as Lyons, Bears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were thus born, to make the Bearer more terrible; and that gave occasion to the Doubling our Mantlings with Furrs.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Scotland,</hi> all the Mantlings of Noblemen, are <hi>G.</hi> doubl'd with <hi>Ermine</hi>; because the Robes of our Earls and above, are Scarlet doubled with <hi>Ermins</hi>: and therefore oftentimes in Blazoning we only say, With Crown, Helmet, and Mantling befitting his degree, without expressing the Colours: But since Mantlings represent only the Coverts of Shields, and must be represented all torn, I see no reason why they should with us represent the Robes of our Noblemen: and of old with us, our Mantlings were of the colour of the Coats, lin'd or doubl'd with the Metalls, which was more proper than that we now use.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the Atchievement stands within a Pavilion, as that of the Emperour, and King of <hi>France</hi>; this <hi>Petra Sancta</hi> calls, <hi>Tentorium,</hi> and is, as he observes, competent only to Princes, though all use them not. But I admire, why the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did not assume as well the Pavilion, as Arms of <hi>France</hi>; seing that is one of the special Honours of that Kingdom. But yet Subjects use Mantlings in form of a Pavilion, as is to be seen in the Atchievement of <hi>Belchier</hi> of <hi>Gilsborough,</hi> represented by <hi>Guilims, pag.</hi> 409. And these <hi>Pet. Sanct.</hi> calls <hi>Chlamys, Vmbella,</hi> or <hi>Palliolum, pag.</hi> 642. where he also informs us, that the General of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Armies, carries, <hi>ratione Officii,</hi> his Arms within a Pavilion or Tent.</p>

            <p>ABove the Helmet, immediately did stand the Wreath, which the <hi>French</hi> call, <hi>Burlet</hi>; and in our ancient <hi>Scots</hi> Herauldry, it was call'd the Roll, or Row, because of its shape: Sometimes the <hi>English,</hi> and we in imitation of them, do terme it, a <hi>Torse, Ã  torquendo.</hi> It was a Corde of their Mistresses Colours, as <hi>Favin</hi> relates, <hi>pag.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 24. and did hang and dangle to the very Cruppers of their Horses, the Extremities being tassl'd, and enrich'd. The use of it was, to fasten their Mantlings to their Helmet. Now these Wreaths should be of the colours of the Field, and Charge; and the Rule is, That the first should be that of the Field, and then that of the immediate Charge, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, the next mediate, and so forth, if there be moe Charges than one; yet some old Wreaths with us, differ from these, and possibly these have been at first Mistresses colours.</p>
            <p>Though the Earl <hi>Marshal</hi> bear, <hi>arg.</hi> on a Chief <hi>Or,</hi> three Pales <hi>gules</hi>; yet his Wreath is, <hi>Or,</hi> and <hi>Gules,</hi> whereas it should have been, <hi>Arg.

               <hi>num.</hi> 74. and now all such as are allowed to wear Helmets, are allowed to adorn them with Crests; and for Crests, men choose what they fancy; only it is not proper to choose such things, as could not stand, or be carry'd by Warriours upon their Helmets, such as Ballances, or such other things, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not either stand fixt, or wave with Beauty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> call the Crest, <hi>Cimier,</hi> because it stands upon the top of the Shield, <hi>sur la Cime de L'escu</hi>; but the old and proper term us'd in <hi>Scotland</hi> for a Crest was, a Badge, because our Noblemen in riding Parliaments, and at other Solemnities, do bear their Crest wrought out in a Plate of Gold or Silver upon their Lacquies Coats, which are of Velvet: And now the Crest is us'd upon all Seals and Plates, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is necessar for Noblemen amongst us, to carry differing Crests from the chief Family out of which they are descended.</p>
            <p>It is ordinar to bear for a Crest, a part of what is born in the Charge; thus the Crest of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is a Lyon; the Crest of <hi>England,</hi> is a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard; the Crest of <hi>France,</hi> a double Flower <hi>de lis</hi>: And with us the Earl of <hi>Dumfermling</hi> carrys a Cressent, and the Earl of <hi>Lothian,</hi> a Sun in his Glory: sometimes also the Crest is a part of the Suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; thus the Earl of <hi>Linlithgow</hi> carrys for his Crest, a Demy-Savage proper, holding a Batton in Hand <hi>dexter,</hi> and his Supporters are two Savages with Battons.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Weems</hi> carry's for his Crest, a Swan proper, and his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters are two Swans.</p>
            <p>Sometimes also the Crest is bestow'd by the Prince, as a Reward of Service done to the Crown; and the Royal Crest cannot be born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out special warrand; and thus the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale,</hi> bears the Crest of <hi>Scotland</hi> for his Crest, having a Flower <hi>de-lis</hi> in place of the Scepter.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it is relative to Alliances, and thus the Earl of <hi>Kinghorn</hi> bears for his Crest, a Lady to the West, holding in her right Hand, the Royal Thistle, and inclosed within a Circle of Laurells; in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the honour that Family had in marrying King <hi>ROBERT</hi> the second's Daughter. Sometimes it represents some valiant Act done by the Bearer, thus <hi>M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>clelland</hi> of <hi>Bombie</hi> did, and now the Lord <hi>Kirkcudbright</hi> does bear a naked Arm, supporting on the point of a sword, a <hi>Mores</hi> head; because <hi>Bombie</hi> being forfeited, his Son kill'd a <hi>More,</hi> who came in with some Sarazens to infest <hi>Galloway</hi>; to the Killer of whom, the King had promised the Forfeiture of <hi>Bombie</hi>; and thereupon he was restored to his Fathers land, as his Evidents yet testifie. Sometimes it respects the Title of the Bearer, thus the Lord <hi>Ross</hi> of <hi>Halk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> bears for his Crest, a Falcons head eras'd.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it relates to an Office or Employment, thus the Lord <hi>Iohnstoun,</hi> being Warden of the Marches, and very famous for repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

Robbery, took for his Crest, a Spurr with Wings.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it is <hi>Ã  rebus,</hi> that is to say, something borrow'd from the Name; thus the Lord <hi>Cranston</hi> has for his Crest, a Crane sleeping, with her head under her wing. And sometimes Crests are taken by No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen from the Name of the Countrey, as the Earl of <hi>Sutherland</hi> takes a Cat for his Crest, because <hi>Sutherland</hi> is call'd <hi>Cattu</hi> in <hi>Irish,</hi> and was so called from the great number of Wild Cats, which were of old, and yet are to be found, in that Shire. Sometimes Crests are taken from some considerable Deliverance: Thus the Laird of <hi>Anstruther</hi> gives two Hands grasping a <hi>Pole-axe,</hi> with the Word, <hi>Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is lawfull to change the Crest, and <hi>Colomb<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> pag.</hi> 4. tells us, that it is lawfull for such as change their Arms, to retain a part of their old Arms as a Crest. Cadets also do, and may change their Crests: Thus <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermling</hi> keeps not the Crest of <hi>Winton,</hi> nor <hi>Kellie</hi> the Crest of <hi>Marr</hi>; but it is most proper for Cadets, when they take Crests, to take a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or some small part of their Chiefs Crest, or Arms; as <hi>Ogilvie</hi> of <hi>Birnies</hi> has taken the Lyons Paw, though it be ordinar to retein the Chiefs Crest, markt by the ordinar differences, or of a different Colour.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:64440:77"/>As to the Crowns now born, they differ not only according to the Quality of the Bearer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, but according to the Nation wherein they are born; for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> differ much in this, though the <hi>English</hi> acknowledge that they owe their Heraldry to the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have here set down the different Shapes of the <hi>English</hi> Crowns.</p>
            <p>The first whereof is the Crown of the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> which is but little different from that of <hi>England,</hi> in the second, which is Imperial too<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
            </p>
            <p>The third is a Coronet of the Prince, which is the same with the Kings, only the Arches, Mound, and Cross, wanting.</p>
            <p>The fourth is a Crownet of an Arch-Duke, which is the same with a Duke, the Arch only added.</p>
            <p>The fifth is a Crownet Florial, only proper to a Duke</p>
            <p>The sixth is the Crownet of a Marquess, which differs thus; It is of Leaves and Points, the Leaves or Flowers above the points.</p>
            <p>The seventh is proper to an Earl, which hath Points and Flowers; but the Points are above the Flowers.</p>
            <p>The eighth is due to a Viscount, which is a Circulet pearl'd, and neither Flowers nor points.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Kings Crown is closs above, like the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial, and rais'd into eight Demy-Diadems, enriched with Diamonds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dolphine</hi> Crown differs only from the Kings, in that it rises up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on four Demy-Diadems, the Kings upon eight.</p>
            <p>The Circle of their Ducal Crown is enriched with Stones and Pearles, and is raised with eight Flowers.</p>
            <p>Their Marquess Crown has its Circle adorned only with Pearles <hi>(tempeste) de Perls,</hi> and raised into four Flowers betwixt 12 Points or Pearls, as the <hi>French</hi> call them.</p>
            <p>Their Counts carry only a Circle of Gold, raised unto nine Points, ane <hi>Cercle d' or garny de pier reries rehausse de 9 grosses perle de Comte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Viscount has only a Circle of Gold plain or enambled, and rais'd unto four Points, or as the <hi>French</hi> term them, four Pearls.</p>

            <p>The Bannerets carried only a plain Circle of Gold, adorn'd with three ordinar Pearls. Our Baronets cary no crown nor circle</p>
            <p>The Regal Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> hath Arches, Mound, and Cross, like to that of <hi>England,</hi> adorned with precious Stones and Pearls, and having four Flowers. <hi>de. lis,</hi> and as many Crosses <hi>pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. XXXI. Of SUPPORTERS.</head>
            <p>SUpporters are these Exterior Ornaments, which are plac'd without the Shield at its side, and were at first invented (as <hi>Pet.

O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as <hi>Menestier,</hi> think that when Knights hung up their Shields to provoke all Passengers to the Combat, they placed their Pages, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour-Bearer under the disguises of Wild-men, Lyons, Bears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to watch who offered to touch them, and thereafter they used these Figures as Supporters; but beside, that this Fancy seems as wild as the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, it may be asked, why some Men use Fowls, or Fishes? to which nothing can be answered, save that Beasts being once allowed, each man choosed thereafter any living creature he pleased.</p>
            <p>Shields are oft-times supported either by Living Creatures, and these are properly call'd Supporters, or by things inanimate; and these Arms are said to be <hi>co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colomb</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> distinguish not betwixt Supporters, and Cottises; nor did I ever see a Shield Cottis'd by things inanimate, and I believe these Cottises are mistaken for the lower parts of the Mantlings; but the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:64440:79"/>
distinguish, <hi>entre les Supports, &amp; les tenans,</hi> and call these only Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters which raise up the Shield somewhat, whereas these are <hi>Tenans,</hi> or Holders, which hold the Shield, but do not raise it; and such are ordinarily Angels, Men or Women; whereas Brutes, such as Lyons, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are said by them to be the proper Supporters. I acknowledge nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other Distinction, following in this, <hi>Chass. paict.</hi> 1. <hi>Num.</hi> 36. <hi>conclus.</hi> 49. <hi>Hopp. cap.</hi> 9. Â§ 4. and the other Civilians, who call all things which support Arms, <hi>Sustentacula</hi>: And albeit the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> assert, That Supporters are only due to persons who are invested with the highest Jurisdiction, and to great Princes, and that <hi>Guilims</hi> thinks that none under the degree of a Knight Baronet, and that it is believed now that none under Knight Baronets can have Supporters; nor do some Lawyers allow these to any, save such as have a particular warrand from the Prince, <hi>habendi Delatores sive Sustentatores, Zippaeus ad L.</hi> 12. <hi>C. de dignitate.</hi> Yet <hi>Chassaneus</hi> observes, that, <hi>Non interest sint ne alicujus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis Nobiles, vel minus, sed sufficit ut in magnÃ¢ aliquÃ¢ Dignitate sint constituti</hi>: so that according to his opinion, an Heretable Sheriff, or an eminent Judge may take Supporters; and I crave liberty to assert, that all our Chiefs of Families, and old Barons in <hi>Scotland,</hi> may use Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters: For besides that, to be a Chief, was of old, and is still, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute an Honour, though it be adorned with no mark of Nobility; yet these Chiefs have prescribed a right to use Supporters, and that such a right may be prescribed, I have proved formerly, and what Warrand is for most of our Rules in Heraldry, but an aged Custom: and that they have constantly used Supporters past all memory of man, even when they were Knights, is clear from many hundred Instances; Thus the Lairds of <hi>Pitcur,</hi> did, and do use, two wild-Cats, for their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters; <hi>Fothringhame</hi> of <hi>Powrie,</hi> two naked Men; <hi>Irwin</hi> of <hi>Drum,</hi> two Savages, wreathed about head and loyns with Hollin, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Battons in their hands; <hi>Moncreiff</hi> of that ilk, two Men armed at all points, bearing Picks on their shoulders: And many of our Noblemen have only retained the Supporters which they formerly had: And that of old, Barons might use Supporters, <hi>de Iure,</hi> seems most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; for they were Members of Parliament with us, as such, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lost that Priviledge, though for their convenience, they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be represented by two of their number, and therefore such as were Barons before that time, may have Supporters, as well as Lord Barons; nor should we be governed in this by the custom of <hi>England,</hi> seing there is <hi>Dispar ratio</hi>; and this is now allowed by the <hi>Lyon</hi> to such.</p>
            <p>Supporters are not Hereditary, but they may be altered at pleasure, <hi>Colomb. pag.</hi> 42. and it is fit, that these extrinsick Parts of Atchievements should not be Hereditary, to the end, men may have somewhat to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, or alter, upon considerable Emergents; but it Cadets keep their Chiefs Supporters, they use to adject some difference, as is to be seen in the Earl of <hi>Kellies</hi> Atchievement.</p>
            <p>Supporters have been given and taken in <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon many occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for sometimes the Royal Supporters are given, to signifie the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance the Bearer has got from the Crown: Thus <hi>Bruce</hi> of <hi>Clakman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> got the Royal Suporters. But without a special Warrand, none can assume, nor can the <hi>Lyon</hi> bestow the Supporters of the Prince. Thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<pb facs="tcp:64440:79"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:64440:80"/>

Sir <hi>Philip Moubray</hi> of <hi>Barnbugle,</hi> having been forfeited by King <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> the <hi>Bruce,</hi> the Lands were restored to his Daughter; in requital of which favour, the Husband and all the Family since, have a Man and Woman for their Supporters.</p>
            <p>Sometimes also, a part of the Benefactors Arms are taken as Suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: And thus the Lairds of <hi>Dundass</hi> did take the Lyons, which was the Earl of <hi>Marches</hi> Arms, to testifie how much they were obliged to that Family. Sometimes they are taken to signifie the Employment and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Chooser; Thus the Lord <hi>Rae,</hi> when he went to <hi>Germany</hi> with his Regiment, did take his Arms supported on the <hi>dexter</hi> side by a Pick-man arm'd, at all parts proper, and on the <hi>sinister,</hi> by a Musquetier proper. By Supporters, sometimes the occasion of the Bearers Honours is signified; and thus the Earl of <hi>Panmure</hi> changed his old Supporters to two Grew-hounds, because he was first noticed by King <hi>Iames</hi> upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his entertaining him with excellent sport in the Moor of <hi>Monrowman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some use to adorn their Supporters with a part of the Charge; and thus the Earl of <hi>Monteith</hi> adorns the collars of the Lyons, which are his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, with Escalops, which are a part of his charge; and the Laird of <hi>Innes,</hi> the collars of his Grew-hounds with three Starrs, which are the Charge.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> sometimes want Supporters, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times takes Supporters, which seems very irregular; for sometimes they have the head of a Lyon, or other Beasts, at the opposite corners of their Shields; and sometimes their Crest is a Serpent, whose body sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds the Shield; and sometimes their Shields are surrounded with the Banners which they have taken from the Enemies.</p>
            <p>It is given as a Rule by the <hi>French</hi> Heraulds, that only soveraign Princes, can use Angels for their Supporters; but I see no reason for that Rule, nor finde I it in the Authors of any other Nation; so that I believe this Rule holds only in <hi>France,</hi> where Angels are the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of the Prince, and so should not be used by any subject without permission: But in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Lords <hi>Borthwick</hi> and <hi>Iedburgh,</hi> have long had Angels for their Supporters, which were their old Supporters before they were Noblemen.</p>
            <p>The Compartment is that part of the Atchievement, whereupon the the Supporters stand, and though none have offered to conjecture what gave the first occasion to Compartments in Heraldry, yet I conceive that the Compartment represents the Bearers Lands and Territories; though sometimes they are bestowed in Recompense of some honorable Action: And thus the Earls of <hi>Dowglass</hi> got the priviledge of having their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters to stand within a Pale of Wood wreathed, because the Earl of <hi>Dowglass,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce,</hi> did defeat the <hi>English</hi> in <hi>Iedburgh</hi> Forrest, and that they might not escape, cause wreathe and impale in the night that part of the Wood, by which he conjectured they might make their escape.</p>
            <p>These Compartments were ordinarily allowed to soveraign Princes only, nor know I any subjects in <hi>Britain,</hi> whose Arms stood on a Compartment, save those of the Marquess of <hi>Dowglass</hi> above set down, and that of the Earl of <hi>Pearth,</hi> who hath for his Compartment, a Galtrap used in Warr; albeit of late, Compartments are become more common: And yet some Families in <hi>Scotland</hi> have certain Creatures, upon which their Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64440:81"/>
stands, as the Laird of <hi>Dundass,</hi> whose Atchievement has for many hundreds of years, stood upon a Salamander in flames proper; and <hi>Robert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone</hi> of <hi>Strowan</hi> gives, a monstruous Man lying under the Escutcheon chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which was given him for his taking the Murtherer of King <hi>Iames</hi> the first.</p>
            <p>Women generally use no Supporters; but they surround their Shields with a Corde of their colours, which the <hi>French</hi> call, <hi>Cordeliere,</hi> or <hi>las d'amour,</hi> the Lace of Love, <hi>Cingulus laqueatus in se insertus,</hi> born first by the Relict of <hi>Charles</hi> VIII. as some say, in veneration to St. <hi>Francis,</hi> Patron of the <hi>Cordeliers, Pet. Sanct. pag.</hi> 639. I find <hi>Muriel,</hi> Countess of <hi>Strathern</hi>; to have carried her Shield, <hi>Anno</hi> 1284. with one Supporter, <hi>viz.</hi> A Falcon standing upon the Neck of a Duck, which with the Neck lyes under the Escutcheon, and both Shield and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter are within a Lozenge.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XXXII. Of MOTTOS, or DEVISES.</head>
            <p>OF old, Men did choose some Sentence or Word, whereby they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest somewhat, and yet concealed somewhat of their genius and inclination: This being carried by Knights upon their Arms, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordinarily relative to them, or explicatory of them, did give ocasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Heraulds to account these as fit Ornaments of Armories. The <hi>English</hi> call this a <hi>Worde</hi>; the <hi>French,</hi> a <hi>Devise</hi>; the <hi>Italians,</hi> a <hi>Motto</hi>; the <hi>Scots,</hi> a <hi>Ditton</hi>; the <hi>Latine, Epigraphe</hi>; the <hi>Grecians,</hi>

            <p>It is placed by the <hi>French,</hi> in a scroll above the Atchievement; but in my opinion, if it relate to the Crest, it should be placed above; but if it relate to the Armour, it should be placed under the Atchievement, that so it may be near to the Armour to which it relates.</p>
            <p>That Dittons or Words relate sometimes to the Bearing, is clear by many instances; Thus the Earl of <hi>Glencairn</hi> bears, <hi>Arg.</hi> a Shake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fork <hi>sable,</hi> and his Word is, <hi>Over fork over.</hi> Sometimes, and most ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, to the Crest, as the Earl of <hi>Kinghorn</hi> has for his Crest, a Maid, holding a Thistle <hi>vert</hi> in her hand, within a Garland or Wreath <hi>vert,</hi> and <hi>or</hi>; and his Motto is, <hi>In te Domine speravi,</hi> for having gained the affection of King <hi>Robert</hi> the second's daughter, he was much crossed in his Match, but having at last married her, he took that Crest, and the Motto relative to it.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Galloway</hi> has for his Crest, a Pelican feeding her young ones in a nest, <hi>or</hi>; and the Motto is, <hi>Virescit vulnere Virtus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet <hi>Burnet</hi> of <hi>Burnetland,</hi> who has for his Crest, a Hand hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a pruning Knife, pruning a Hollen-tree all proper, hath the same Motto: and having pursued <hi>Burnet</hi> of <hi>Lees</hi> before <hi>Lindsay</hi> of the <hi>Mount</hi> then <hi>Lyon,</hi> to change his Motto; <hi>Lees</hi> did thereupon take for his Motto, <hi>Alterius non sit qui potest esse suus,</hi> alluding to the occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:64440:81"/>Sometimes it is relative to the Supporters: Thus the Supporters of <hi>Buccleugh,</hi> were two Ladies in rich and antique Apparel <hi>az.</hi> their lokes over their shoulders, and the Word is, <hi>Amo,</hi> which was assumed by his Predecessors, when he got his first Estate by marrying the Heretrix of <hi>Murdistone.</hi> Sometimes it relates to the Supporters and Compartment: Thus the Earle of <hi>Pearth</hi> gives for his Supporters, two Savages with Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons on their shoulders, and under their feet, a Galtrap, with this Motto, <hi>Gang warrily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes it is relative to the difference or mark of Cadencie: Thus the Earle of <hi>Kellie,</hi> a brother of the Earl of <hi>Mar,</hi> gave for his Word, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cori decus addit avito.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes the Word is relative to some considerable Action, and to neither Arms, Crest, nor Supporters: And thus the Earl of <hi>Stirling,</hi> having planted <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> the Word he took was, <hi>Per Mare per Terras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes they are but a meer <hi>Rebus,</hi> alluding to the Name,</p>
            <p>Sometimes to the Bearers Office, as <hi>Forresters</hi> Motto is, <hi>Blow Hunter thy horn</hi>; The Lord <hi>Iohnstoun,</hi> when Warden of the Marches, <hi>Light thieves all,</hi> id est, Light from your Horses and render your selves. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they serve to remember a family to be ware of a misfortune: Thus the Lord <hi>Maxwell</hi> being forfeited, and thereafter restored, took for his Motto, <hi>Reverisco,</hi> I stand in awe to offend.</p>
            <p>Sometimes they show the Bearers Origine more than the Arms do: Thus the <hi>M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>phersons</hi> have for their Motto, <hi>Touch not the Cat gloveless,</hi> to show they are of the <hi>Clanchattan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Dittons serve ofttimes to instruct us, what is the true Bearing: Thus the Earle of <hi>Glencairn</hi>'s Ditton, <hi>Fork over fork,</hi> showes that his Bearing is a Fork, and not an Episcopal Pale, as some would have it: and though <hi>Bailzie</hi> of <hi>Lamingtons</hi> Arms are by some blazoned Mollets, (Spurryals) yet that they are Starrs appears from the Motto, which is, <hi>Quid clarius astris.</hi>

            <p>NOt unlike these Motto's are our Slughorns, which are called <hi>Cris de guerre</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> The use of them is either to serve as a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word to all of one Family, or are the name of the place at which a Family should meet in time of Warr: And thus the <hi>M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>kenzies</hi> have for their Slughorn, <hi>Tulloch Ard,</hi> which is the place at which this Clan does meet; and the Name of <hi>Hume</hi> have for their Slughorn (or Slogan, as our South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Shires terme it) a <hi>Hume, a Hume:</hi> For it is most ordinar to have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Name of the Family who do meet, or the Name of the Place at which they do meet: And this Word or Cry was proclaimed every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, by a person who carried a Cross of wood burning, or a firie Cross, as we call it, by which and by the cry of War or Slogan, all the Cadets of the Family were advertised to meet at the ordinar place; For

            <head>CHAP. XXXIV. Of DEVISES.</head>
            <p>THough we confound Devises and Motto's, yet they differ much; for a Devise properly is a painted Metaphor, <hi>Metaphora in fatto,</hi> as the <hi>Italians</hi> call them, wherein one thing is represented by another to which it resembles: The painted Resemblance is called the body of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, and the Word whereby these are explained, the souls of the Devise: And thus it appears, that a Devise comprehends somewhat like to both Crest and Motto, and that some Authors are mistaken, who make De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises to be either such as are all soul, such as the Pathetick Sentences used by some, to express their Inclinations; or those that are all Body, such as the ancient Hierogliphicks; or such as are composed of Soul and Body, which are indeed the true Devises.</p>
            <p>Some believe that Devises are as ancient as <hi>Antisthenes,</hi> who gave <hi>Cephisolode</hi> for his Devise, Incense burning, with this Word, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is to say, I please whilst I consume. But others think that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises were no older than <hi>Paulus Iovius</hi>; and yet <hi>Petra Sancta, lib.</hi>

               </gap>. <hi>simbol. heroic.</hi> asserts, That the Thistle taken by <hi>Achaius</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> when he made his Alliance with <hi>Charlemaigne,</hi> with the Word, <hi>Nemo me impunÃ¨ lacesset,</hi> is the ancientest Devise now upon record and all praise it as very regular and pretty. But some think it ought to be <hi>Lacessit,</hi> because the present time shows best the nature of the thing, yet <hi>Lacesset</hi> has more of daring and Gallantry.</p>
            <p>The ordinary Rules in making Devises (which <hi>Scipione Ammirata,</hi> calls <hi>Filosofia del cavaliere,</hi> are these as to the Body of the Devise, 1. That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Monstruous be used, for the easilier it be understood, the better it is. 2. Things of different Natures ought not to be joined together, for else it were too easie to make Devises, and would also breed Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for the same reason too many things must not be represented, and moe than four are irregular, and even two or three are irregular, except

they relate to one Design. 3. No parts of a mans body must be taken for a Devise, because say they, that were to represent man by man; but I think this a mistake, for some one part of a mans body, may well with some posture or addition, represent the inclination or designe of a living man, such as a Hand with a Lawrel, or a Heart in Flames, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Devise should be a Noble and Pleasant Representation, therefore Devils, vile Animals, or rustick and mean Mechannick Instruments, ought not to be used. 5. For the same reason, the thing that is put in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, ought to be put in its n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They ought to be modest, and thus the present <hi>French</hi> Kings Devise, which is a Sun, with the Word, <hi>Nec pluribus impar,</hi> is very faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, because very vain. 7. The Body of the Devise should be things known and apparent, and therefore Flowers or Beasts not known amongst us, ought not to be used; and thus some blamed that excellent Devise ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> after the Death of <hi>Francis</hi> the II. of <hi>France</hi> her Husband, which was a Liquorish Stalk with this Word, <hi>Dulce meum terra tegit.</hi>

            <p>The Rules relat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ng to the words of the Devise are, 1. That they be not too general, and such as might be used to almost any thing. 2. That the words do not express as fully the things represented, as if you saw the thing it self; for else the representation were useless, as <hi>una Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundo non facit ver</hi>; and this is called an Embleme, and not a Devise: And therefore the words of a Devise must have still something that is mysteriously imperfect, as <hi>ut vivat,</hi> under a <hi>Phoenix</hi> burning; and <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus &amp; eminus,</hi> to a <hi>Porcupine,</hi> without adding the word <hi>ferit.</hi> 3. We must not for the same reason express the thing represented in the words of the Devise, so we must not say, <hi>ita Phoenix,</hi> or <hi>ut vivat Phoenix.</hi> 4. The words must relate to the thing, and not to the person, and thus where the Devise was gold in a Furnace, these words, <hi>Domine probasti me,</hi> are cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, because they are not applicable to the Gold. 5. The words must not be clenching, or equivocall, for that were to make Devises meer Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmata.</p>

               <p>The Royal Badges are, a Thistle of Gold crowned, for <hi>Scotland,</hi>

               <p>Thus have I for the Honor and Satisfaction of my Countrey, interrupted so far the course of my ordinary studies at spare hours, nor was this Book only necessary for them, but for all such as love this Science; since the Theory of our Civilians was not hitherto sufficiently illuminated by the knowledge of Blazoning, nor the practical and common knowledge of Blazoning rightly founded upon the civil Law and Law of Nations; our ordinary Practicians in this Art having been such as cited the civil Law without understanding it; and as it is much nobler to raise a Science, than to be raised by it; so having writ this Book as a Gentleman, I designe as little Praise or thanks, as I would disdain all other Rewards.</p>
