            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="1">1 First they expect with great desire the houre of this banquet, and giue theire di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent attendance that they come in decent and seemly manner, well adorned.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that nothing is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto the prince who inuiteth them, then to feede hartely on the meates prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they come with emptie stomackes and a desire to be satisfied.</p>

beware that they neither doe or speake any thing which may be offensiue to the person which hath called them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, they doe not by and by depart but stay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while and enterchaung fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier conference with the prince at one time praising his liberalitie, at on other the magnyficencie of the feast.</p>

               <head>The manifold effectes and fruites of this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</head>
               <p>WEe may remember, which we cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, that as man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of soule and bodie, so doth he also leade a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold life, the one temporall,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18525:48"/>
readie to fall into a thousand dangers and casualties. The other spirituall, subiect to as many and more. The life of the body consisteth of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Soule with the body. The life of the soule consisteth of another vnion, with grace in Christ. Both these, as they haue their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and casualties, so haue they also their remedies and sustentations. For the life na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turall, God hath ordained naturall sustenance; for the life supernaturall, supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nourishment, which is this most holy Sacrament. But that which at all times is most to bee lamented is, whereas the spirituall life is farre more excellent then the temporall, notwithstanding is more regarded and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. For what thing doth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18525:48"/>
not a sicke body doe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his health, hee neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all charges and griefes, he esteemeth nothing of the bitternesse of Medecines, he contemneth the sharpnesse of paines: the most experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Phisitions, the best preseruatiues are sought for, and all for bodily health, which endureth for a little time And are wee so carefull for the health of our Soule? would to God we were, then would we repaire with more deuotion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnto this most holy Sacrament, where our spirituall life is preserued and strengthened.</p>
               <p>Three things there are sayth one, necessarie for the life of man, the mother which brings him forth, the meate which sustaineth him, and the Phisition that cures
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:18525:49"/>
him when hee is sicke.</p>
               <p>The same three are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for the life spirituall. The mother is Baptisme, the meate is the holy Eucharist, the Phisition to cure is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Now then, as the body without meats cannot endure labours and liue, no more can the Soule without this spirituall repast, sustaine the labours of this Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the assaults of her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and liue. The ayre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrupted when we goe forth of doores, wee fortefie vs with some preseruatiue.
