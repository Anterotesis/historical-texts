         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Disciples to that necessary Duty of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
themselves,</hi> that is, of surrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up their Wills to the conduct of
his, and renouncing all their <hi>Worldly</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
when it comes in Competition with
their Duty, and of taking up their Cross,
and following him; that is, of preparing
themselves to endure Persecution for his

and Practice of his <hi>Religion</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Oppositions they should meet with

he urges this Argument, <hi>Ver. 25. For
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63657:5"/>
whosoever will save his Life shall lose it: and

Where the <hi>Greek</hi> Word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> which we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Life,</hi> may perhaps be better render'd
<hi>Himself,</hi> it being <hi>familiar</hi> both with <hi>Hebrews</hi>
and <hi>Syrians</hi> to call a man's Life and Soul
<hi>Himself:</hi> so the Psalmist, <hi>thou shalt not leave

<hi>Levit. 20. 25. Ye shall not make your Souls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable,
i.e.</hi> your selves; And that it should
be so render'd here is evident, because St.
<hi>Luke</hi> so expounds it, <hi>What is a Man profited,
if he gain the whole World and lose himself, or
be cast away?</hi> Luke 9. 25. And indeed the
Soul being the <hi>Principal</hi> Part of a Man and
that which advances him into a <hi>Species</hi> of
Being above that of a <hi>mere</hi> Animal, may very
well be called <hi>himself,</hi> according to that of <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erocles,</hi>

               </gap> 
               <hi>Himself,</hi> the
Words will be very <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>easy;</hi> for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
will save himself by renouncing me
and my <hi>Religion,</hi> shall lose himself forever;
and whosoever will be content to lose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for my sake, shall save himself forever.
And this he farther inforces in the Text,
<hi>What is a Man profited, if he shall gain the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63657:5"/>
whole World, and lose his own Soul? or what
shall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi>
that is, what will it <hi>avail</hi> a Man to <hi>gain</hi> the
whole World, if he <hi>forever</hi> ruin himself by it?
and when he hath thus <hi>ruined</hi> himself, what
would he give, if it were in his Power, to
save and recover himself again? The words
thus explained, I shall resolve the sense of
them into these five Propositions.</p>
            <p>I. That a Man; or the Soul of a Man is
a Thing of <hi>inestimable</hi> Price and Value; for
our <hi>Saviour</hi> here weighs it against the whole
World, that is, against all the <hi>Pleasures, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,</hi>
and <hi>Honours</hi> that this <hi>inferiour</hi> World
can afford; and declares that in the <hi>just</hi> Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of his Esteem it out-weighs them all.
And certainly that must needs be <hi>exceeding
precious,</hi> whose Worth the whole World
cannot <hi>counter-poise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. That this <hi>precious</hi> Soul may be lost.
This our <hi>Saviour</hi> plainly supposes in these
Words, <hi>if he lose his own Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. That our <hi>renouncing</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his
<hi>Religion</hi> will most certainly infer this Loss.
For these Words, as I have shewed you,
our <hi>Saviour</hi> urges as an Argument to dissuade
Men from <hi>Apostacy;</hi> but if without <hi>losing</hi> our
Souls, we might <hi>renounce</hi> him and <hi>apostatize</hi>
from him, there would be no <hi>Force</hi> in all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63657:6"/>
this Argument to dissuade us from it</p>
            <p>IV. That when this Soul is <hi>lost,</hi> 'tis <hi>lost</hi>
irrecoverably. <hi>What shall a Man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for his Soul?</hi> Where the <hi>Greek</hi> Word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which we render <hi>Exchange,</hi> is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the same sense with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which
signifies a price of Redemption, denoting
that if a Man should or could give never so
much to buy his Soul from Perdition, yet
no <hi>Price</hi> of Redemption will be <hi>taken</hi> for
it.</p>
            <p>V. That this <hi>irrecoverable</hi> Loss of a Soul
is of such a <hi>vast</hi> Moment, that the Gain of
the whole World is not <hi>sufficient</hi> to compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate
it. <hi>What is a Man profited,</hi> that is, he
is not at all <hi>profited,</hi> nay he is so far from
<hi>that</hi> that he is a <hi>vast</hi> Loser.</p>
            <p>I. That the Soul of a Man is a Thing of
an <hi>inestimable</hi> Price and Value. And for the
Proof of this Proposition, I shall endeavour
these <hi>two</hi> Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> To represent to you of what <hi>vast</hi>
Worth it is in Respect of its own <hi>natural</hi>
Capacities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To shew you of what <hi>vast</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
it is in the Judgment of all those who,
as we must needs suppose, do best <hi>understand</hi>
the Worth of it.</p>
            <p>1. I shall endeavour to represent to you
of what <hi>vast</hi> Worth it is in Respect of its
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63657:6"/>
own <hi>natural</hi> Capacities, particularly in these
<hi>four.</hi> (1.) In Respect of its Capacity of
<hi>Vnderstanding.</hi> (2.) Of <hi>Moral Perfection.</hi>
(3.) Of <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Delight.</hi> (4.) Of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Soul of Man is of <hi>vast</hi> Worth in
Respect of its Capacity of <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi>
For certainly to <hi>understand,</hi> is the <hi>greatest</hi>
and <hi>noblest</hi> Operation that a Being is <hi>capable</hi>
of; for it is this that gives Beauty and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
to all our <hi>other</hi> Operations whether
they be <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral:</hi> 'Tis this that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
the <hi>Ends,</hi> and directs the Course, and
Prescribes the Measures of all our <hi>other</hi> Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and tho we had never so much <hi>Force</hi>
or <hi>Power,</hi> yet unless we had <hi>Vnderstanding</hi>
to guide and manage it, it would be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
insignificant. For <hi>Blind</hi> Power acts at
Random, and if we had the Force of a
<hi>Whirl-wind,</hi> yet without a <hi>Mind</hi> to stear and
manage it, it would be an <hi>equal</hi> Chance
whether we did <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> with it. So that
unless there were some <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> either
<hi>within</hi> or <hi>without</hi> us to conduct our <hi>active
Powers,</hi> and determine them to our <hi>Good,</hi>
we were as good be altogether without them;
because while they act by <hi>Chance</hi> it is at least
an <hi>equal</hi> Lay whether they will <hi>injure</hi> or <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi>
us. Since therefore <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> is
the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Measure</hi> of all our <hi>other</hi> Powers,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63657:7"/>
it necessarily follows that <hi>it self</hi> is the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
and <hi>noblest</hi> of them all. What an <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi>
Being therefore must a Soul be, in
which this <hi>great</hi> and <hi>Sovereign</hi> Power resides?
a <hi>Power,</hi> that can collect into it self such <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious</hi>
Numbers of <hi>simple Apprehensions,</hi> and
by comparing <hi>one</hi> with the <hi>other,</hi> can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect
them into <hi>true</hi> Propositions, and upon
<hi>each</hi> of these can run such <hi>long</hi> and <hi>curious</hi>
Descants of Discourse, till it hath drawn out
all their Consequents into a Chain of <hi>wise</hi> and
<hi>coherent</hi> Notions, and sorted these into such
<hi>various Systems</hi> of <hi>useful</hi> Arts and Sciences;
That can discern the <hi>Harmonious</hi> Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Truths with Truths, the <hi>secret</hi> Links
and Junctures of <hi>coherent</hi> Notions, trace up
<hi>Effects</hi> to their <hi>Causes,</hi> and sift the <hi>remotest</hi>

which are altogether out of our sight whilest

<hi>Eagle-Eyes</hi> can <hi>gaze</hi> upon that <hi>glorious</hi> Sun,
and dive into the <hi>infinite Abyss</hi> of his <hi>divine</hi>
Perfections. What an <hi>excellent</hi> Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is that <hi>Soul</hi> that is endowed with such a
<hi>vast</hi> Capacity of <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and with its
<hi>piercing</hi> Eye can reach such an <hi>immense</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of Beings, and travail through so <hi>vast</hi>
an <hi>Horizon</hi> of Truth? Doubtless if <hi>humane</hi>
Souls had no <hi>other</hi> Capacity to <hi>value</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by, but only this, <hi>this</hi> were enough
to give them the <hi>Preheminence</hi> over all <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi>
Beings, and <hi>render</hi> them the most <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>
Part of all this <hi>sublunary</hi> World.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Soul</hi> of Man is of <hi>vast</hi> Worth in
Respect of its Capacity of <hi>Moral Perfection.</hi>
For by the Exercise of those <hi>humane Vertues</hi>
which are <hi>proper</hi> to it in this state of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the Body, it is capable of rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it self to the <hi>Perfection</hi> of those <hi>Angelical</hi>
Natures, which of all Creatures do most
nearly <hi>approach</hi> and <hi>resemble</hi> the <hi>great</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and <hi>Fountain</hi> of all <hi>Perfection.</hi> For by
keeping a <hi>due</hi> Restraint upon its bodily Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63657:8"/>
and thereby gradually weaning it
self from the <hi>Pleasures</hi> of the Body, it may
by degrees be <hi>educated</hi> and <hi>trained</hi> up to lead
the Life, and relish the Joys of <hi>naked</hi> and
<hi>immortal</hi> Spirits; it may be contempered to
an <hi>incorporeal</hi> State so as to be able to enjoy
it self without <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> and live
most happily upon the <hi>Fare</hi> of Angels, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</hi>
And then by governing its <hi>own</hi>
Will and Affections by the Laws of <hi>Reason</hi>
and <hi>Religion,</hi> it may be degrees improve it
self so far in all these <hi>Moral</hi> Endowments,
which are the <hi>proper</hi> Graces of every <hi>reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
Nature, as to be at last as perfectly <hi>wise</hi>
and <hi>reasonable</hi> in its own <hi>Choices</hi> and <hi>Refusals,</hi>
in its <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred,</hi> in its <hi>Desires</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,</hi>
as the <hi>Angels</hi> themselves are. For
though it cannot be expected that in this <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect</hi>
state a <hi>Soul</hi> should arrive to such a
Pitch as this, yet even now it may be <hi>grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
up and <hi>aspiring</hi> to it; which, if it doth,
as I shall shew you by and by, when <hi>this</hi> is
<hi>expired,</hi> it hath <hi>another</hi> Life to live, which
being antecedently prepared for by those
<hi>spiritual</hi> Improvements it hath made <hi>here,</hi>
will furnish it with Opportunites of <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
infinitely faster than <hi>here</hi> it did, or possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
could. For in that <hi>Life</hi> it shall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be <hi>freed</hi> from those many Incumbrances
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63657:8"/>
which do <hi>here</hi> retard it in its <hi>spiritual</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress,
nor shall it only be associated with a
World of <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi> Spirits, whose <hi>holy</hi>
Example and <hi>wise</hi> Converse will doubtless
wonderfully edifie and improve it; but be
also admitted into a more <hi>intimate</hi> Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with <hi>God,</hi> who is the <hi>Author</hi> and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of all Perfection; the sight of whose <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing</hi>
Beauty will <hi>inflame</hi> it with a most <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
Love to him, and <hi>excite</hi> it to a most <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous</hi>
Imitation of him: All which consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it is not to be imagined how much the
state of <hi>Heaven</hi> will immediately <hi>improve</hi>
those <hi>happy</hi> Souls that are prepared and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
for it. But then considering that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Perfection</hi> is as <hi>infinite</hi> as the <hi>Nature</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> in which there is an <hi>Infinity</hi> of <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> within this
<hi>boundless</hi> Subject, there will be Room enough
for Souls to make <hi>farther</hi> and <hi>farther</hi>
Improvements in, even to <hi>Eternity.</hi> And
then when they shall still be growing on
so fast, and yet be still <hi>forever</hi> improving, to
what a <hi>transcendent</hi> Height of <hi>Glory</hi> and
<hi>Perfection</hi> will they at last arrive? For tho no
<hi>finite</hi> Soul can <hi>ever</hi> arrive to an <hi>infinite</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
yet still it may be growing on to it,
because there will still be <hi>possible</hi> Degrees of
it beyond its <hi>present</hi> Attainments; and when
it is arrived to the farthest <hi>imaginable</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63657:9"/>
yet still it will be <hi>capable</hi> of farther,
and so farther and farther to all <hi>Eternity.</hi>
And if so, <hi>O blessed God,</hi> of what a <hi>Capacious</hi>
Nature hast thou made these <hi>Souls</hi> of ours,
which tho they will doubtless <hi>improve</hi> in
<hi>Goodness</hi> as fast in the <hi>other Life</hi> as is possible
for them, with all the Advantages of a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi>
State, yet will never attain to an <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Period,</hi> but still be growing <hi>perfecter</hi> and
<hi>perfecter forever?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The Soul of <hi>Man</hi> is of <hi>vast</hi> Worth in
Respect of its <hi>immense</hi> Capacities of <hi>Pleasure</hi>
and <hi>Delight:</hi> For its Capacity of <hi>Pleasure</hi>
must necessarily be as <hi>large</hi> and <hi>extensive,</hi> as
its Capacity of <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and of <hi>Moral
Perfection;</hi> because the <hi>proper</hi> Pleasure of a
Soul results from its own <hi>Knowledge</hi> and
<hi>Goodness,</hi> from its <hi>farther</hi> Discoveries of
<hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>farther</hi> Proficiency in <hi>inward</hi>
Rectitude and Vertue, and consequently as
as it Improves <hi>farther</hi> and <hi>farther</hi> in <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standing</hi>
and in <hi>Moral Perfection,</hi> it must still
gather <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> Fuel to <hi>feed</hi> and <hi>encrease</hi>
its <hi>own</hi> Joy and Pleasure. For the Pleasure
of every Being consists in the <hi>vigorous</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of its Faculties about <hi>convenient</hi> and
<hi>agreable</hi> Objects; but the <hi>Faculties</hi> of a Soul
are <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> to which the
only <hi>agreable</hi> Objects are <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness;</hi>
and therefore the more <hi>Truth</hi> there is in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63657:9"/>
               <hi>Mind,</hi> and the more <hi>Goodness</hi> there is in the
<hi>Will,</hi> the more vigorously will they <hi>imploy</hi>
and <hi>exercise</hi> themselves about them, and
consequently the more they will be <hi>pleased</hi>
and <hi>ravished.</hi> Since therefore, every <hi>new</hi>
Discovery of <hi>Truth,</hi> and every <hi>new</hi> Degree
of <hi>Goodness</hi> gives <hi>new</hi> Life to our <hi>Minds</hi> and
<hi>Wills,</hi> and renders both more <hi>sprightly</hi> and
<hi>vigorous,</hi> it hence necessarily follows that
our Souls are capable of as much <hi>Pleasure</hi> as
they are of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness;</hi> and how
vastly <hi>Capable</hi> they are of both these I have
already shewed you. So that it is not to be
imagined by us, who have here so <hi>little</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
what <hi>Heavens</hi> of Joy a Soul is <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi>
of; only at present we find by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that the more we improve in <hi>Knowledge</hi>
and <hi>Goodness,</hi> the more <hi>pleasant</hi> &amp; <hi>chearful</hi> we
find and feel <hi>our selves,</hi> and that our <hi>Faculties</hi>
still grow more <hi>active</hi> and <hi>lightsom</hi> the more
we disburthen them of that <hi>Ignorance</hi> and
<hi>Sin</hi> that <hi>cloggs</hi> and <hi>incumbers</hi> them. And
upon <hi>great</hi> Proficiencies in <hi>Knowledge</hi> and
<hi>Vertue</hi> we find a <hi>strange</hi> Alacrity within our
selves; we are as it were in <hi>Heaven</hi> upon
Earth, and do feel a <hi>Paradise</hi> springing up
within us, the <hi>Fragrance</hi> of whose <hi>Ioys</hi> grows
many times so <hi>strong</hi> that our <hi>frail</hi> Mortality
can hardly bear them. When therefore such
<hi>Souls</hi> do cast <hi>off</hi> this Mortality which now
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63657:10"/>
doth only fetter and intangle them, and have
made their Entrance into the <hi>invisible</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Blessedness,</hi> how <hi>sprightly</hi> and <hi>active,</hi>
how <hi>lightsom</hi> and <hi>chearful</hi> will they feel
themselves? For in the <hi>first Moment</hi> of their
Admission, all that <hi>Mist</hi> of <hi>erroneous</hi> Prejudice
which now interrupts their Prospect of
<hi>Truth,</hi> and all those Remains of <hi>irregular</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
that check and distract them in their
Choice of <hi>Goodness,</hi> will be <hi>forever</hi> chased
from their <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Wills</hi> by the <hi>clear</hi> Light
of the <hi>Heavenly State;</hi> and their Faculties
having thus disburthen'd themselves, and
shaken <hi>off</hi> every Clog, with what <hi>unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Vigour will they <hi>move</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Presence of such <hi>suitable</hi> Objects as
the <hi>Heavenly State</hi> will present before them?
When <hi>infinite Truth,</hi> and <hi>infinite Goodness</hi>
shall be always present to their <hi>free</hi> Minds
and undistracted Wills<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and nothing shall <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose</hi>
to hinder them either in seeing the <hi>one,</hi>
or in chosing the <hi>other,</hi> here will be work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for both to all <hi>Eternity;</hi> and both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
freed from all Incumbrance, the <hi>one</hi>
will be discovering every <hi>Moment</hi> farther
and farther into that <hi>infinite Truth</hi> which it
loves and admires, and the <hi>other</hi> will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
every <hi>Moment</hi> more and more in
that <hi>infinite Goodness</hi> which it chooses and
adores. And then every <hi>new</hi> Discovery
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63657:10"/>
and <hi>new</hi> Improvement will spring <hi>new</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
of Joy in the Soul, and by reason of
those <hi>new</hi> Acquests of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi>
which we shall every <hi>Moment</hi> make, we
shall every <hi>Moment</hi> be entertained with <hi>new</hi>
Pleasures, and so before we have spent <hi>one</hi>
Joy, <hi>another</hi> will succeed, and <hi>another</hi> that,
and so on <hi>forever.</hi> For when a <hi>God</hi> of <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> becomes the <hi>Objective
Happiness</hi> of a <hi>finite</hi> Nature which cannot
comprehend and enjoy him, but in an <hi>infinite</hi>
Succession, every <hi>new</hi> Delight the <hi>Injoyment</hi>
of him creates in us must necessarily raise a
<hi>new</hi> Desire, and every <hi>new</hi> Desire immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<hi>find</hi> a <hi>new</hi> Delight, and so round again
to all <hi>Eternity.</hi> Of what a <hi>vast</hi> Capacity
therefore is this Soul of ours, in which there
is room enough <hi>successively</hi> to entertain all the
<hi>ravishing</hi> Joys and Pleasures that make an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Heaven;</hi> That can drink in those
<hi>deep</hi> Rivers of <hi>Pleasure</hi> as fast as they <hi>spring</hi>
up and <hi>flow</hi> from God's right hand for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more?
What Tongue can express the <hi>innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
Joys that such a Soul can hold, whose
Capacity is so <hi>large</hi> as <hi>Heaven,</hi> and so <hi>near</hi> to
<hi>infinite</hi> as to be able to contain all those Joys
and Pleasures that <hi>infinite Truth</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
can create?</p>
            <p>4. And lastly, The Soul of Man is of
<hi>vast</hi> Worth in Respect of its Capacity of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:63657:11"/>
For by its Operations it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that the Soul is not composed of <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
matter,</hi> but is a <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>immaterial</hi>
Substance; for if it were <hi>Matter,</hi> it would <hi>act</hi>
and <hi>move</hi> only when <hi>other</hi> Matter presses up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, and not be able to determine the Course
of its <hi>own</hi> Motion, but would be forced to
move <hi>backwards</hi> or <hi>forwards</hi> according as it
was <hi>thrust</hi> on by that <hi>outward</hi> Matter that
continually moves and presses upon it, and
all its Motions would be as <hi>necessary</hi> as that
of a Stone in the <hi>Air,</hi> when it is thrust up by
an <hi>impressed</hi> Force, and <hi>pressed</hi> down again
by the weight of the <hi>Air</hi> above it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in this Soul of ours we sensibly <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi>
a <hi>natural</hi> Liberty of acting, a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to move it self and to determine its <hi>own</hi>
Motions which way it pleaseth; when it is
pressed <hi>forward</hi> never so vigorously by the
<hi>strong</hi> Impulses of <hi>outward</hi> Objects, it is in
its Power to <hi>go on</hi> or <hi>retreat,</hi> and to <hi>divert</hi>
the Current of its Thoughts into a quite <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>
Channel to that whereinto it is thrust
and directed by all the Impressions of its
Sense. For thus in the midst of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larums</hi>
and <hi>Shoutings</hi> of an <hi>Army,</hi> of the <hi>Noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
of Drums and Trumpets ringing in our
Ears, our Soul can recollect it self, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
its <hi>scattered</hi> Thoughts into <hi>profound</hi>
Contemplations of a <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>Blessed</hi> Peace;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63657:11"/>
and when it is <hi>pressed</hi> from <hi>without</hi> with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much Importunity to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
Choice, it is in its Power to <hi>reject</hi> the
Motion, and to <hi>choose</hi> the quite contrary.
By all which it is <hi>apparent</hi> that the Soul hath
an <hi>innate</hi> Liberty of <hi>acting,</hi> tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>she</hi> is not <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated</hi>
from <hi>without</hi> by the <hi>different</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
and Motions of the <hi>several</hi> Particles
of <hi>Matter;</hi> but that all the Diversity of her
<hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> is principally owing to
her <hi>own Freedom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of self-determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to make the <hi>least</hi> doubt of it is to
question the <hi>common</hi> Sense and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Mankind. Since therefore the Soul
is not determined in its Motions by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<hi>Pressures</hi> of <hi>material</hi> things as all <hi>other</hi>
Matter is, but hath power to <hi>swim</hi> against
the <hi>Torrent,</hi> and <hi>move</hi> quite counter to all
<hi>foreign</hi> Impressions, it hence necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that it is <hi>immaterial.</hi> And indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how much its <hi>Operations</hi> do exceed
the <hi>utmost</hi> Power of <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>passive</hi> Matter,
I cannot but wonder that any Man should
be so <hi>forsaken</hi> of his <hi>Reason,</hi> as to rank it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>material</hi> Things; for how is it <hi>possible</hi>
that a <hi>Piece</hi> of <hi>dull unactive Matter,</hi> that a <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
Grass or Dirt, or Mire, after all the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finings,
Macerations,</hi> and <hi>Maturations,</hi> that
can be <hi>performed</hi> by the help of <hi>Motion</hi>
should ever be able to make a <hi>thinking</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

That a Company of <hi>dead Atoms,</hi> which

into which they have thus awakened <hi>one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi>
and (which they are as <hi>incapable</hi> of
as a <hi>Musical Instrument</hi> is of hearing its <hi>own</hi>
Sounds, or taking pleasure in the <hi>harmonious</hi>

and consult together to make <hi>wise</hi> Laws,

to investigate the Natures of <hi>Things,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
from them the <hi>several Systems</hi> of <hi>Arts</hi>
and <hi>Sciences;</hi> in a word, how is it <hi>possible</hi>
that a Company of <hi>fluid</hi> Motes and Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of <hi>Matter</hi> should ever be so artificially
<hi>complicated</hi> and <hi>twisted</hi> one with <hi>another,</hi> as
to form an <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> that can <hi>lift</hi> up its
Eyes, and look beyond all this <hi>sensible</hi> World
into that of <hi>immaterial</hi> Beings, and conceive
<hi>abstracted Notions</hi> of things which can never
be <hi>Objects</hi> to any <hi>material</hi> Senses; such as a

out of it: That can correct the <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi>
of all our <hi>material</hi> Perceptions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
Things to be vastly different from
what they apprehend and report them; can
<hi>prove</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> for instance, to be one <hi>han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi>
and <hi>sixty</hi> times <hi>bigger</hi> than the <hi>Earth,</hi>
when to our Eye and Imagination it appears
no <hi>bigger</hi> than a Bushel; that can lodg <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>
it self all that <hi>Mass</hi> of <hi>sensible</hi> Things which
taketh up so much Room <hi>without</hi> it, and
when it hath piled them <hi>up</hi> upon <hi>one another</hi>
in <hi>vast</hi> and most <hi>prodigious</hi> Numbers is still
as <hi>capacious</hi> of more, as when it was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>empty;</hi> in a word, that can grasp the
<hi>Vniverse</hi> with a <hi>Thought,</hi> and comprehend
the <hi>whole</hi> Latitude of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
its <hi>own indivisible</hi> Center; how <hi>senseless</hi> is
it to imagine that such <hi>Noble</hi> Operations as
these can be performed by a <hi>meer</hi> Complex
of <hi>dead Atoms</hi> and <hi>senseless</hi> Particles of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
And if they cannot, as doubtless they
cannot, then from hence it will necessarily
follow that the Soul of Man is an <hi>immaterial</hi>
Thing. Furthermore we see, that tho the
Soul takes in <hi>Objects</hi> of all <hi>sizes,</hi> yet when
once they are <hi>in,</hi> they are not as <hi>Bodies</hi> in a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63657:13"/>
               <hi>material</hi> Place in which the <hi>Greater</hi> take up
more Room than the <hi>Less:</hi> For the <hi>Thought</hi>
of a <hi>Mile,</hi> or ten thousand Miles doth no
more <hi>fill</hi> or <hi>stretch</hi> a <hi>Soul,</hi> than that of a <hi>Foot</hi>
or an <hi>Inch,</hi> or a <hi>Mathematical Point;</hi> and
whereas all <hi>Matter</hi> hath its <hi>Parts,</hi> and those
extended <hi>one</hi> without <hi>another</hi> into <hi>Length</hi> and
<hi>Breadth</hi> and <hi>Thickness,</hi> and so is <hi>measurable</hi>
by <hi>Inches, Yards,</hi> or <hi>solid Measures;</hi> there is
no such Thing as <hi>measurable</hi> Extension in any
thing belonging to the Soul. For in <hi>Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
which is the <hi>Essence</hi> of a Soul, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Length,</hi> nor <hi>Breadth,</hi> nor <hi>Thickness,</hi>
nor is it <hi>possible</hi> to have any <hi>Conceit</hi> of a <hi>Foot</hi>
of Thought, or a <hi>Yard</hi> of Reason, a <hi>Pound</hi>
of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> or a <hi>Quart</hi> of Vertue. And if
what belongs to a Soul be <hi>immaterial,</hi> it will
necessarily follow that the Soul it self is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material</hi>
too, and as such <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</hi>
For <hi>immaterial</hi> Natures being <hi>pure</hi>
and <hi>simple,</hi> having neither <hi>contrary</hi> Qualities
nor <hi>divisible</hi> Parts in them, as <hi>material</hi> Things
have, can have no Priciples of <hi>Alteration</hi>
and <hi>Corruption</hi> in them; and being <hi>devoid</hi>
of these, they must needs be <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
and <hi>subsisting for ever.</hi> What <hi>Noble</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
therefore are the Souls of Men which,
together with those <hi>vast</hi> capacities of <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi>
of <hi>Moral Perfection,</hi> of <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>

consequently of <hi>improving</hi> in <hi>Knowledge,</hi> in
<hi>Goodness,</hi> and in <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Pleasure</hi> unto all <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity?</hi>
And therefore certainly a Soul must

            <p>Having thus shewn you the <hi>invaluable</hi>

Capacities, I proceed</p>
            <p>2. To shew you of what <hi>vast</hi> Esteem it
is in the Judgment of all those, who we must
needs suppose do best understand the <hi>Worth</hi>
of it; and that is the <hi>whole</hi> World of <hi>Spirits.</hi>
For to be sure <hi>Spirits</hi> must <hi>best</hi> understand
the Excellency of <hi>Spirits,</hi> because they have
a <hi>clearer</hi> In-sight into <hi>each</hi> others Natures,
and a more <hi>immediate</hi> Prospect of the <hi>Vertue,
Power</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> of <hi>each</hi> others <hi>Faculties.</hi>
For as for us, whilest we are in this <hi>imbodied</hi>
state, and do understand by <hi>corporeal</hi> Organs,
we generally judge of the <hi>Worth</hi> and <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi>
of Things by the Impression they make
upon our Senses, and as these are <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi>
gratified and affected with them, we set a
<hi>higher</hi> or <hi>lower</hi> Value upon them. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Spirits</hi> are a <hi>sort</hi> of <hi>Beings</hi> that cannot
touch or affect our <hi>Bodily</hi> Senses, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
we should be <hi>competent</hi> Judges of the
<hi>true</hi> Worth and Value of them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63657:14"/>
in this matter we ought to be guided by
the Judgment of <hi>Spirits,</hi> who must needs
be <hi>supposed</hi> to have a more <hi>intimate</hi> Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with <hi>one anothers</hi> Natures. And if we
will be guided by these, we shall find the
<hi>whole</hi> World of <hi>Spirits,</hi> even from the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
to the <hi>lowest,</hi> unanimously <hi>rating</hi> the Souls
of Men at an <hi>inestimable</hi> Price and Value.
And to make this appear, I shall shew you
the <hi>vast</hi> Price there is set upon them.</p>

and transmit them into <hi>terrestrial</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that so being compounded with a <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
Nature they might clasp the <hi>Spiritual</hi>
and <hi>Animal</hi> Worlds together; he being <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi>
of the <hi>vast</hi> Hazards and <hi>infinite</hi> Snares
they would be <hi>exposed</hi> to, was so deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for their Preservation, that he thought
nothing <hi>too dear</hi> to save and secure them. And
<hi>fore-seeing</hi> their Fall from that <hi>terrestrial</hi>
Happiness which he <hi>originally</hi> designed them,
notwithstanding the <hi>liberal</hi> Care he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63657:14"/>
to preserve them in the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Innocence,</hi>
he designed to remove the <hi>Scene</hi> of their
Happiness from <hi>Earth</hi> to <hi>Heaven,</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
if possible, to repair the Loss of a
<hi>terrestrial</hi> with a <hi>caelestial</hi> Paradise. For
which end, instead of the <hi>Covenant of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi>
the <hi>Blessings</hi> whereof by their <hi>Sin</hi> they
had <hi>for ever</hi> forfeited, he introduces the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
of <hi>Repentance,</hi> that so by the help of
this Plank after their <hi>general</hi> Ship-wrack, they
might be preserved, and go safe to the <hi>Shoar</hi>
of a <hi>happy</hi> Eternity, And that by this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
he might the more effectually recover
them, he designed to grant it to them in
such a Way, and upon such a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
Consideration, as might at once affect them
with the <hi>greatest</hi> sense of his <hi>Love</hi> and the
<hi>deepest</hi> Awe of his <hi>Severity;</hi> that so whilest
by the <hi>former</hi> he <hi>allured,</hi> by the <hi>later</hi> he might
<hi>terrify</hi> to Repentance: To which <hi>end</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
not to grant it to them upon any
<hi>other</hi> Consideration than that of <hi>anothers</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
for them, and <hi>undergoing</hi> the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Sin in their stead; that so
whilst he shewed his <hi>Love</hi> to them in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>another</hi> to <hi>suffer</hi> for them, he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
his <hi>Hatred</hi> to their Sin in not Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it without anothers suffering. And that he
he might manifest <hi>this</hi> his <hi>Love</hi> to them,
and <hi>this</hi> his <hi>Hatred</hi> to their <hi>Sin</hi> in the <hi>highest</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:63657:15"/>
Degree, as he admitted <hi>another</hi> to <hi>suffer</hi> for us
so he resolved to accept no <hi>meaner</hi> Suffering
than that of his <hi>own beloved</hi> Son. And that
<hi>this</hi> his <hi>suffering</hi> might be the more <hi>effectual,</hi>
he <hi>proposed</hi> to send him down to us into this
<hi>lower</hi> World <hi>cloathed</hi> in our Natures, that so
he might not only the more familiarly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct</hi>
us by his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Example,</hi> but the
more exactly <hi>personate</hi> us in <hi>undergoing</hi> the
Punishment of our Sin; and upon his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
to undergo it, the most <hi>Merciful</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
agreed to this <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Mercy,</hi> by
which he obliged himself to receive us into his
Favour upon our <hi>unfeigned</hi> Repentance, and
<hi>impower'd</hi> his Son to govern us according
to the Tenour of it, that is, to <hi>Crown</hi> us
with the <hi>Rewards</hi> of it if we Repented, and
<hi>instict</hi> on us the <hi>Punishments</hi> of it if we went
on in our Impenitence. And that there
might be nothing wanting to render this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of his Son <hi>succesful</hi> and us <hi>obedient</hi>
to it, he also agreed upon <hi>this</hi> his <hi>Mighty</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
to <hi>substitute</hi> to him the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>
to be the <hi>supreme</hi> Minister of his Government
that so by the <hi>Agency</hi> of this <hi>vicarious</hi> Power
he might <hi>bow</hi> and <hi>incline</hi> the Hearts of Men
to submit unto him, and comply with the
Terms of this <hi>Merciful</hi> Covenant in which
their <hi>everlasting</hi> Welfare is so abundantly
provided for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:63657:15"/>
This is the <hi>mighty</hi> Project which, for the
sake of the Souls of Men, the Father of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
hath contrived, and upon which he hath
acted and proceeded even from their <hi>first</hi>
Fall to this very <hi>Moment;</hi> And by this he
hath most plainly <hi>expressed</hi> the <hi>high</hi> and great
Veneration that he hath of them; for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
had they not been exceeding <hi>precious</hi> in
his Eyes, he would never have thought it
worth the while to project and act, such
<hi>mighty</hi> Things to redeem and save them:
He would rather have left them to their <hi>own</hi>
Fate, and not have concerned himself about
them, or not have concerned himself to that
Degree as to make them the <hi>Subjects</hi> of such
a <hi>vast</hi> Design. For all <hi>wise</hi> Agents measure
their Designs by the <hi>Worth</hi> and <hi>Value</hi> of the
Things they aim at, and do never lay <hi>great</hi>
Projects for the sake of <hi>little</hi> Trifles; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>God</hi> had a <hi>mighty</hi> Value for the Souls of
Men, his making such <hi>vast</hi> Preparations to
save them would be like that <hi>foolish</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
raising a <hi>numerous</hi> Army, only to go and
gather Cockle-shells.</p>
            <p>2. Let us consider the <hi>vast</hi> Price which
<hi>God the Son</hi> hath set upon Souls; For it is
plain he valued them at that <hi>mighty</hi> Rate, as
that for their sakes he willingly undertook
to execute this <hi>vast</hi> Design of his <hi>Father,</hi> and
that to save these <hi>precious</hi> Being he thought
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63657:16"/>
it would be very well worth his while to
come down from <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>vail</hi> his <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
in our <hi>Natures,</hi> to put on the <hi>Form</hi> of a
Servant and make himself of no Reputation;
to <hi>live</hi> a <hi>Miserable</hi> Life, and <hi>die,</hi> a <hi>painful</hi> and
<hi>accursed</hi> Death. And can we <hi>think</hi> he would
ever have layd down so <hi>vast</hi> a Price, as his
<hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Happiness,</hi> his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to for Things of a <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable</hi>
Value? Had he so <hi>low</hi> an Esteem of
his Father's Bosom and his own <hi>Heavenly</hi>
Glory as to <hi>part</hi> with them for <hi>Trifles?</hi> such
<hi>slight</hi> Apprehensions of <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,
Pain</hi> and <hi>Misery,</hi> as to cast himself into them
for the sake of <hi>Beings</hi> he had <hi>little</hi> or <hi>no</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of? Could any thing but what is <hi>inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable</hi>
countervail that <hi>Glory</hi> he <hi>parted</hi> with,
and that <hi>Misery</hi> he indured? Or, can you
think those Souls of <hi>little</hi> Worth which the
<hi>Son of God</hi> thought <hi>worth</hi> his dying for? No
certainly, if we knew nothing of our Souls
but this, that the <hi>Son of God</hi> thought them a
<hi>good</hi> Purchase at the <hi>dear</hi> Price of his <hi>Bliss,</hi>
his <hi>Glory,</hi> and his <hi>Blood;</hi> yet from thence
we have <hi>infinite</hi> Reason to conclude them
most <hi>precious</hi> and <hi>inestimable</hi> Beings, it being
<hi>impossible</hi> that he who doth so perfectly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the <hi>Worth</hi> and <hi>Value</hi> of Things,
should ever be so <hi>over-seen</hi> as to <hi>pay</hi> so <hi>vast</hi> a
Sum for <hi>slight</hi> and cheap Commodities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:63657:16"/>
3. Let us consider the <hi>vast</hi> Price which
<hi>God the Holy Ghost</hi> hath set upon Souls; For
'tis for their sakes that he doth so Industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
operate in the Kingdom of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi>
that he takes so much pains in it, as he
doth and hath always done, ever since it was
<hi>first</hi> erected, to drive on that <hi>blessed</hi> Design
of making the Souls of Men, <hi>the native sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of it</hi> happy. It is upon their Account
that he hath made so <hi>many</hi> Revelations of
God's Will to the World, and confirmed
them by so <hi>many</hi> Miracles, that so he might
extricate those <hi>precious</hi> Beings out of those
Labyrinths of Error in which they had invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and lost themselves, and direct them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the way to <hi>true</hi> Happiness. And it is for
their good that he still continues shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
forth his <hi>Heavenly</hi> Influences upon
them, that he still inspires them with so
many <hi>good</hi> Thoughts, importunes them with
such <hi>urgent</hi> Motives, presses upon them with
such <hi>earnest</hi> Struglings and <hi>vigorous</hi> Efforts,
not only of his <hi>preventing</hi> but of his <hi>assisting</hi>
Grace too, that if <hi>possible</hi> he may awaken
them into a Sense of their Danger, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
and quicken them to pursue the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of their <hi>own</hi> Safety and Happiness. So
infinitely <hi>jealous</hi> is this <hi>blessed Spirit</hi> lest these
<hi>precious</hi> Beings should Miscarry, that tho one
would think them sufficiently <hi>safe-guarded</hi> in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63657:17"/>
their Voyage through this <hi>dangerous</hi> Sea un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Convoy of their <hi>own</hi> Reason, yet he
dares not trust them to themselves, but bears
them Company all along, and keeps a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Eye over them, and when any Rock is
nigh he warns them of it, and when they
are beset with <hi>evil</hi> Spirits, those <hi>mischievous
Pirates</hi> that lie in wait to Captivate and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave</hi>
them, he presently comes into their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
and, unless they are resolved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
themselves, always brings them <hi>off</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriously.
Nay, tho they many times not
only yield to these <hi>Piratical Spirits,</hi> but joyn
their Forces with them to resist and beat <hi>off</hi>
their <hi>merciful</hi> Friend and Deliverer, yet he
doth not therefore presently abandon them,
but being infinitely concerned for their
Rescue follows them even to the Mouth of
the Enemies Harbour with his <hi>blessed</hi> Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Importunities, and never gives o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Pursuit of them till he hath either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
recovered, or lest them past all Hopes
of Redemption. And when he sees that they
are utterly lost by their <hi>own</hi> Madness and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and that it is in vain to follow them any
farther, he casts a <hi>sorrowful</hi> Look upon them,
and like a <hi>grieved</hi> Friend after the <hi>utmost</hi>
strugglings and <hi>extream</hi> Efforts of his <hi>affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
Goodness, unwillingly leaves them to
their own <hi>sad</hi> Fate, and gives them <hi>up</hi> as it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63657:17"/>
were with the Tears in his Eyes. And can
you think this <hi>blessed Spirit</hi> would be so <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious</hi>
as he is in his Ministry for Souls,
that he would take such <hi>infinite</hi> Pains to save
them, be so extreamly <hi>urgent</hi> and <hi>solicitous</hi>
for their Welfare, if He did not know them
to be a sort of Beings of an <hi>inestimable</hi> Worth
and Value? O <hi>blessed God,</hi> what are not our
Souls <hi>worth,</hi> that are worth all the Pains thy
<hi>blessed Spirit</hi> takes to save, and make them
<hi>happy!</hi> That not only <hi>thou</hi> thought'st <hi>worth</hi>
all those <hi>vast</hi> Thoughts and Counsels, which
thou hast spent upon them; that not only thy
<hi>Son</hi> thought <hi>worth</hi> all those <hi>vast</hi> Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he stooped <hi>to</hi> to put those Thoughts in
Execution; but thy <hi>blessed Spirit</hi> also thinks
<hi>worth</hi> all that <hi>unwearied</hi> Pains and Endeavour,
all that <hi>incessant</hi> Care and Importunity which
he employs about them to save and rescue
them from Sin and Misery? Doubtless those
Beings must needs be exceeding <hi>precious,</hi> for
whose Safety and Welfare all the <hi>blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
are so unspeakably concerned.</p>
            <p>4. Let us consider the <hi>vast</hi> Price which
the <hi>Holy Angels</hi> put upon Souls: For tho
they are the Crown and Top of all the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of <hi>God,</hi> and do by their <hi>essential</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
border <hi>nearest</hi> upon him, yet such is
their Opinion of the Souls of Men that they
think it no Disparagement to converse with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63657:18"/>
and minister to them; but from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the World till now have been always
ready to maintain a <hi>close</hi> Intercourse and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate</hi>
Correspondence with them; and so
far forth as they are permitted by the Laws
of their <hi>invisible</hi> World they are continually
attending to stretch forth a <hi>helping</hi> Hand to
them in all their Needs and Necessities.
Tho they are the most <hi>Illustrious</hi> Courtiers of
<hi>Heaven,</hi> yet they disdain not to be the <hi>Life-Guards</hi>
of Souls, <hi>to pitch their Tents round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> expresses it, <hi>Psal.</hi>
34. 8. And interpose between them and
their Danger; to prompt them <hi>to,</hi> and assist
them <hi>in</hi> their Duties; to strengthen them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
or to remove their Temptations; to
comfort them in their Sorrows, and chase
away from them those <hi>malignant Spirits</hi> that
are always about them watching all Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
to seduce and destroy them. Hence
<hi>Heb.</hi> 1 14. They are said to be <hi>ministring,
Spirits sent forth to minister for them, who
shall be Heirs of Salvation.</hi> And how much
they are concerned for the Safety and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of these <hi>precious</hi> Beings they are charged
with is evident by that Passage, <hi>Luke 15. 16.
There is joy in the presence of the Angels of God
over one Sinner that repenteth.</hi> So <hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
are the Lives of Souls to the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
that tho they are always entertained with the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63657:18"/>
most <hi>ravishing</hi> Pleasures, yet <hi>Heaven</hi> it self
cannot divert them from being overjoyed at
the Repentance of a <hi>Perishing</hi> Soul, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating
its Recovery with a <hi>new</hi> Festival.
And when-ever the <hi>happy</hi> News is brought
them that such a <hi>dying</hi> Soul is revived, they
not only attend to it in the <hi>midst</hi> of all their
Joys and Triumphs, but upon the hearing of
it they shout for Joy, and fill the Heavens
with a <hi>new</hi> Acclamation. And when-ever
such a <hi>Penitent</hi> Soul hath bidden adieu to
the Body, those <hi>blessed</hi> Spirits stand ready to
recieve and guard it through those <hi>Legions</hi>
of <hi>malignant Spirits</hi> that do always infest
these <hi>lower</hi> Tracts of Air, and to conduct it
safe to those <hi>happy</hi> Abodes where it is to lodge
till the Resurrection; for it is said of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s
Soul, <hi>Luke 16. 22. That it was carried
by Angels into</hi> Abraham'<hi>s Bosom.</hi> All which
is a <hi>clear</hi> Demonstration of the <hi>vast</hi> Esteem
which those <hi>blessed Angels</hi> have of Souls. For
can it be thought that such <hi>noble</hi> Beings who
have a <hi>God</hi> and themselves to converse with,
and have so <hi>immediate</hi> a Prospect both of <hi>his</hi>
Beauty and their <hi>own</hi> to exercise their Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and employ their Contemplation, would
be so <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> as they are to attend
upon Souls, and minister to their Safety and
Happiness, if they had not a <hi>mighty</hi> Value
and Estimation of them? Surely if these <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:63657:19"/>
Spirits within us were not unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<hi>dear</hi> and <hi>precious,</hi> those <hi>Angelical</hi> Beings
who have always the most <hi>sublime</hi> and <hi>enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing</hi>
Objects before them to employ and
entertain their Faculties, would never have
thought it <hi>worth the while</hi> to stickle so zealous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their Affairs, and concern themselves
so much about them. And thus our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
himself argues, <hi>Mat. 18. 10. Take heed
that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say
unto you that in Heaven their Angels do behold
the Face of my Father which is in Heaven;</hi> that
is, do not undervalue any Soul; for how
<hi>mean</hi> or <hi>little</hi> soever some of them may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to you, they are under the <hi>Guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
of those <hi>blessed</hi> Angels that are the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>God,</hi> and do always attend upon his
<hi>Majestick</hi> Presence.</p>
            <p>5. And <hi>Lastly,</hi> Let us consider the vast Price
which the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves do put upon
Souls; for ever since those <hi>malignant</hi> Spirits
through their <hi>own</hi> Pride and Ambition revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from <hi>God,</hi> and conspir'd to make War with
<hi>Heaven,</hi> and revenge their Expulsion thence,
the <hi>constant</hi> Drift of all their Designs and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
hath been to seduce and ruin them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conscious that of all the Beings that are
within the reach of their Power, there are
none so <hi>dear</hi> to <hi>God</hi> as these, and that by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
from him these his most <hi>precious</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63657:19"/>
they shall do him the <hi>greatest</hi> spight
and most effectually revenge upon him their
<hi>own</hi> Damnation. For doubtless were there
any Beings below the Moon more <hi>dear</hi> to
<hi>God</hi> than these, they would bend their Force
and Malice against them, and not make these
as they do, the <hi>only</hi> Centers of their <hi>mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi>
Activity. Had they any <hi>nobler</hi> Game
to fly at, their <hi>ambitious</hi> Malice would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
to stoop to the Quarry of Souls; but
because of all others These are the <hi>noblest</hi> and
best <hi>worth</hi> the ruining, therefore do these
<hi>malignant</hi> Spirits turn all their Artillery upon
them, and level all their <hi>fiery</hi> Darts against
them. And how <hi>ambitious</hi> they are of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
our Souls, and training them on to
Perdition, is evident by the <hi>infinite</hi> Wiles,
and Snares, and Stratagems they contrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them; by their <hi>unwearied</hi> Diligence to
watch all Opportunities against them; to
surprize them where they are <hi>careless,</hi> and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
them where they are <hi>weakest,</hi> and cheat
them with <hi>disguised</hi> Suggestions; to inspect
their Humours, and apply themselves to
their Interest, and nick their Tempers, with
convenient <hi>Temptations.</hi> And if after all
their Labour, Craft, and Contrivance they
can but seise the Game they hunt for, the
Blood of a Soul is so <hi>rich</hi> a Draught that
they think it a <hi>sufficient</hi> Recompence for all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63657:20"/>
their <hi>painful</hi> and <hi>mischievous</hi> Devices; for
St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us that <hi>they go about like roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Lyons, seeking whom they may devour.</hi> And
to be sure those <hi>malignant</hi> Spirits would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be so impertinently <hi>mischievous,</hi> as to
spend their time in catching Flies, and did they
not know our Souls to be <hi>noble</hi> Preys, they
would never go so far about as they do, nor
take so much Care and Pains to Catch and
insnare them. So that from their <hi>unwearied</hi>
Diligence to seduce and ruin us, we may
most certainly conclude either that they are
very <hi>foolish</hi> Devils, or that our Souls are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>precious</hi> Beings; but howsoever, their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
to destroy them is a <hi>plain</hi> Argument
that they esteem them <hi>precious,</hi> it being by
no means to be supposed, that such <hi>Wise</hi> and
<hi>intelligent</hi> Beings as they are would so much
concern themselves, as they do, about things
which they had <hi>little,</hi> or <hi>no</hi> Esteem for.</p>
            <p>And thus you see at what a <hi>vast</hi> Rate our
Souls are valued by the whole World of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
how from the <hi>highest</hi> to the <hi>lowest,</hi> those
<hi>best</hi> and <hi>wisest</hi> Judges of the <hi>just</hi> Worth of
Souls do all unanimously concur in a <hi>great</hi>
and <hi>high</hi> Estimation. So that whether we
value them by their own <hi>natural</hi> Capacities,
or by the Estimation of those who are best
able to judg of their Worth and Excellency,
we have <hi>abundant</hi> Reason to conclude them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63657:20"/>
most <hi>precious</hi> and <hi>inestimable</hi> Beings. And
now I shall conclude this Argument with
some Inferences.</p>
            <p>1. From hence I infer, by what it is that
we ought to value our selves, and estimate
the Dignity of <hi>our own</hi> Natures, <hi>viz.</hi> by our
<hi>rational</hi> and <hi>immortal</hi> Souls, those <hi>excellent</hi>
Beings that are so <hi>invaluable</hi> in themselves,
and so highly esteemed by the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>wisest</hi>
Judges. 'Tis this <hi>intelligent</hi> and <hi>immortal</hi>
Nature within us, that is the Crown and
Flower of our Beings; 'tis by this that we
are exalted above the Level of <hi>meer</hi> Animals;
by this that we are allyed to Angels, and do
border upon <hi>God</hi> himself: And he that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues
himself by any thing but his Soul, and
those things which are its <hi>proper</hi> Graces and
Ornaments, begins at the <hi>wrong</hi> End of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
forgets his Jewels, and estimates his
Estate by his Lumber. And yet, <hi>good God,</hi>
what <hi>foolish</hi> Measures do the Generality of
Men take of themselves? Were we not forced
by <hi>too</hi> many <hi>woful</hi> Experiments, it would
be hard to imagine that any Creature that
believes a <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>immortal</hi> Soul to be a
Part of its Nature, should be so <hi>ridiculous</hi> as
to value it self, by the <hi>little trisling</hi> Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of a <hi>well-coloured</hi> Skin, a suit of fine
Cloths, a Puff of popular Applause, or a
<hi>few</hi> Baggs of <hi>white</hi> and <hi>red</hi> Earth; and yet,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63657:21"/>
               <hi>God help</hi> us, these are the only things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
by which we value and difference our
selves from others. You are a much better
Man than your Neighbour; he, alas, is a
<hi>poor contemptible</hi> Wretch, a <hi>little, creeping,
despicable</hi> Thing, not worthy to be looked
upon, or taken notice of by such a one as
you. Why in the Name of God, what is
the Matter? Where is this mighty Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between you and him? Hath not he
a Soul as well as you? a Soul that is <hi>capable</hi>
to live as long, and to be as <hi>happy</hi> as yours?
Yes, yes, 'tis true indeed; but notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>God</hi> be thanked, you are another-guess
Man than he; for you have a much <hi>hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somer</hi>
Body, your Apparel is much more
<hi>fine</hi> and <hi>fashionable,</hi> you live in a more <hi>splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did</hi>
Equipage, and have a <hi>larger</hi> Purse to
maintain it, and your Name <hi>forsooth,</hi> is
more in Vogue, and makes a far <hi>greater</hi> Noise
in the World. And is this all the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between your <hi>mighty</hi> selves and your
<hi>pitiful</hi> Neighbours? Alas poor Men! A
few Days more will put an End to this,
and when your rich Attires are reduced to
a <hi>Winding-sheet,</hi> and all your <hi>vast</hi> Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to <hi>six Foot of Earth,</hi> what will become
of all those little Trifles by which you va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
your selves? Where will be the <hi>Beauty</hi>
or <hi>Wealth,</hi> the <hi>Port</hi> or <hi>Garb,</hi> which you are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63657:21"/>
now so <hi>proud</hi> of? Alas! Now that <hi>lovely</hi>
Body looks as <hi>pale</hi> and <hi>ghastly,</hi> that <hi>lofty</hi> Soul
is left as bare, as poor and naked as your
despised Neighbours. Should you now meet
his <hi>wandering Ghost</hi> in the <hi>wide</hi> World of
Spirits, what would you have to boast of
more than he, now your <hi>Beauty</hi> is wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
your <hi>Wealth</hi> vanished, and all your
<hi>outward</hi> Pomp and Splendor shrouded in
the <hi>Horrors</hi> of a <hi>silent</hi> Grave? Now you
will have nothing distinguish you from the
most <hi>Contemptible,</hi> unless you have <hi>wiser</hi> and
<hi>better</hi> Souls, and by so much as you were
more <hi>respected</hi> for your <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Wealth,</hi>
your <hi>Garb</hi> and <hi>Equipage</hi> in this World, by
so much you will be more <hi>despised</hi> for your
<hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Insolence,</hi> your <hi>Covetousness</hi> and
<hi>Sensuality</hi> in the other. Let us therefore learn
to value our selves by that which will abide
by us, by our <hi>immortal</hi> Souls and by those
<hi>heavenly</hi> Graces which do <hi>adorn</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish</hi>
them; by our <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,</hi>
by our <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Meekness,</hi> by our
<hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Iustice;</hi> all which are such
<hi>Preheminences,</hi> as will servive our Funerals,
and distinguish us from <hi>base</hi> and <hi>abject</hi> Souls
forever. But for a <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>immortal</hi>
Creature to <hi>prize</hi> it self by any such <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary</hi>
Advantages is altogether as vain and
ridiculous, as it was for the Emperor <hi>Nero</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:63657:22"/>
to value himself for being an <hi>excellent</hi> Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> From hence also I infer how much
we are obliged to live up to the Dignity of
our Natures. Should a <hi>stranger</hi> to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
be admitted into this <hi>busy</hi> Stage of
<hi>humane</hi> Affairs, to survey our Actions, and
the <hi>paltry</hi> Designs we drive at, certainly he
would hardly imagine that we believed our
selves to be such a noble sort and strain of
Beings as we are. If you saw a Man seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
imploying himself in some <hi>sordid</hi> and
<hi>beggarly</hi> Drudgery, could you imagine that
he believed himself to be the Son of a King,
and the Heir of a Crown? And when it is
so <hi>apparent</hi> that the <hi>main</hi> of our Design is to
prog for our Flesh, and make a <hi>comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Provision for a few Years Ease and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
who would think that we believed our
selves to be <hi>immortal</hi> Spirits that must live
<hi>forever</hi> in an <hi>inconceivable</hi> Happiness or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery?
When we consider the high Rank
which we hold in the Creation, the <hi>vast</hi>
Capacities which there are in our Natures,
and the <hi>noble</hi> Ends which we were made
and designed for, are we not ashamed to
think how <hi>poorly</hi> we prostitute our selves,
and vilify <hi>our own</hi> Faculties by the <hi>sordid</hi>
Drudgeries wherein we exercise and imploy
'em? When we think what a Reputation we
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63657:22"/>
have throughout all the World of Spirits,
what a <hi>vast</hi> Rate we are valued at by <hi>God,</hi>
and <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Devils,</hi> are we not confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to think how we <hi>under-value</hi> our selves
by those <hi>low</hi> and <hi>inglorious</hi> Ends, which
we pursue and aim at? <hi>O good God,</hi> that
thou should'st give me a Soul of an <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
Nature, a Soul that is <hi>big</hi> enough for all
the Joys which thy <hi>everlasting Heaven</hi> is
composed of, and I be such a Wretch to my
self, such a Traytor to the Dignity of my
<hi>own</hi> Nature, as to give <hi>up</hi> my self and all
my Faculties to the Pursuit of such <hi>vain</hi>
and <hi>wretched</hi> Trifles? That I who am akin
to Angels, should make my self a <hi>Muck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm,</hi>
and chuse <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s fate to
leave Crowns and Scepters, and live among
the <hi>salvage</hi> Herds of the Wilderness? That
having such a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>noble</hi> Nature, I
should content my self to live like a Beast,
and aim no <hi>higher</hi> than if I had been born
only to eat, and drink, and sleep, and wake
for <hi>thirty</hi> or <hi>forty</hi> Years together, and then
retire into a <hi>silent</hi> Grave, and be <hi>insensible</hi>
forever? Wherefore in the Name of <hi>God,</hi>
let us at last remember what we are, and
what we are born to. Let us consider, that
we have Faculties that are <hi>capable</hi> of exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themseves <hi>for ever</hi> in the most <hi>inravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Contemplation, and Love of the <hi>eternal</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:63657:23"/>
Fountain of Truth and Goodness; of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying
and transcribing his most <hi>adorable</hi>
Perfections, his <hi>Wisdom, Goodness, Purity,</hi>
and <hi>Iustice,</hi> from whence the <hi>infinite</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of his Nature derives; and thereby of
glorifying us into <hi>living</hi> Images of <hi>God,</hi> and
rendring us <hi>like</hi> him both in Beauty and
Happiness; in a word, that we have Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
to converse with Angels and with
blessed Spirits, to bear a Part in the <hi>eternal</hi>
Comfort of their Joys and Praises, and to
relish all those <hi>unknown</hi> Delights of which
their <hi>everlasting Heaven</hi> doth consist. And
having such <hi>great</hi> and <hi>noble</hi> Powers in us,
is it not a <hi>burning</hi> shame that they should
be always condemned to an <hi>endless</hi> Pursuit
of Shadows and Impertinencies? Let us
therefore rouse up our selves, and shake off
this <hi>sordid</hi> and <hi>degenerate</hi> Temper that sinks
and depresses us, and makes us act so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<hi>unbecoming</hi> the Dignity of our <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
Natures. And since we are descended
from and designed for the <hi>Heavenly Family,</hi>
let us learn to demean our selves upon Earth,
as becomes the Natives of <hi>Heaven,</hi> Let us
disdain all <hi>base</hi> and <hi>sordid,</hi> all <hi>low</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi>
Ends of Action, as Things beneath
our <hi>illustrious</hi> Rank and Station in the
World of Beings, and live in a <hi>continual</hi>
Tendency towards, and Preparation for
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63657:23"/>
that <hi>Heavenly State</hi> which is the <hi>proper</hi> Orb
and Sphere of our Natures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> From hence also I infer how much
they undervalue themselves, that fell their
Souls for the Trifles of this World. For
since we know before-hand that the Wrath
of God is revealed from <hi>Heaven</hi> against all
Unrighteousness and Ungodliness of Men,
and he hath plainly assured us that our Souls
must smart <hi>for ever</hi> for our Sins, it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
follows, that when ever we knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suffer our selves to be inticed into Sin,
we make a <hi>wilful</hi> Forfeiture of our Souls.
He that knows that such a Draught, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<hi>sweetned</hi> and made <hi>palatable,</hi> is yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
with the Juice of <hi>deadly Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shade,</hi>
and notwithstanding that will have
the <hi>poisonous</hi> Draught, is wilfully bent to
Murder and Destroy himself. And when
we see that the Pleasure of our Sin draws
after it the Ruin of our Souls, and yet will
Sin notwithstanding, we do in effect stake
our Souls against it, and with our Eyes
open, make this <hi>desperate</hi> Bargain, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Condition we may injoy such a <hi>sinful</hi>
Pleasure, we will willingly surrender <hi>up</hi> our
<hi>immortal</hi> Spirits to the Pains of an <hi>endless</hi>
and <hi>intollerable</hi> Damnation. And if so, <hi>O bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God,</hi> how do the Generality of Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate
and undervalue themselves? For
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63657:24"/>
how often do we see Men in their <hi>little</hi>
Frauds and Cozenages, sell their Souls for
a Penny gain; in their <hi>lascivious</hi> and <hi>intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate</hi>
Humours, barter their Souls for a
Moments Mirth or Pleasure; in their <hi>ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi>
Projects and Designs, part with their
Souls for a Blast of <hi>vulgar</hi> Breath and <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
Noise. For in every Temptation to Sin
the Devil cheapens our <hi>immortal</hi> Souls, bids
so much <hi>Pleasure,</hi> or so much <hi>Profit</hi> for
them; and in every Compliance with the
Temptation we take his Offer, and strike
the <hi>fatal</hi> Bargain; So that if we will Sin,
we had need Sin for something since we
must pay so dearly for it. But alas! there
is no Proffer the Devil can make us, that
is a <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elerable</hi> Price for the Blood of our
Souls; though he should offer us the <hi>whole</hi>
World for it, our <hi>Saviour</hi> assures us that
he would bid us infinitely to our Loss; and
if so, what <hi>wretched</hi> Sales do we make of
our Souls, when we Sin for Trifles, <hi>lie</hi> and
<hi>cheat</hi> to get a Penny, consent to a <hi>wicked</hi>
Motion for a Pleasure that will wither
while we are smelling to it, and expire in
the very Injoyment? For so much we va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
our Souls at, and do in effect declare,
that in our Esteem these <hi>precious</hi> Beings,
which <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> set so high a Price
on, are worth no more than what that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63657:24"/>
               <hi>Profit</hi> or <hi>Pleasure,</hi> for which we Sin, amounts
to. <hi>O good God!</hi> What <hi>cheap</hi> and <hi>worthless</hi>
Things then are our Souls in our Esteem,
who sell and barter them every Day for
such <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>worthless</hi> Trifles? How do
we part with our <hi>Gold</hi> for <hi>Dross,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
our <hi>Iewels</hi> for <hi>Pebbles?</hi> What <hi>sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did</hi>
Thoughts, what <hi>wretched vile</hi> Opinions
have we of our selves, that are so ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all Occasions to sell our selves for nought,
or, which is next to nought, for the <hi>sorry</hi>
Proffers of every <hi>base</hi> and <hi>infamous</hi> Lust?
O would to God we would at last make
but a <hi>just</hi> Estimate of our selves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
resolve, as it is most <hi>reasonable</hi> we
should, never to comply with any <hi>sinful</hi>
Motion, till we can get more by it than
our Souls are worth, and then I am sure
we should be <hi>for ever</hi> Deaf to all the Prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
which the <hi>Devil</hi> or <hi>World</hi> can make
us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> And <hi>lastly,</hi> from hence also I infer
how much we are obliged above all things
to take Care of our Souls: For since they
are Beings of such <hi>vast</hi> Capacities in
themselves, and of such an <hi>high</hi> Estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the World of Spirits, methinks we
should all be convinced that to take leave
of their Welfare, and prevent their <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi>
Miscarriage, is the <hi>highest</hi> Concern
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63657:25"/>
and Interest of a Man. And yet, <hi>God</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
us, if we consult the <hi>common</hi> Practice
of Mankind, we shall find that there is
scarce any thing in which we have any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
at all, that is more <hi>slighted</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded</hi>
by us. Our Body is the Darling
that hath our Hearts, and takes <hi>up</hi> all our
Care and Thoughts; and to entertain its
Appetite, and accommodate it with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and Conveniencies, there is no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
either of Labour or Time grudged,
or thought much of; but as for the Soul,
that <hi>precious</hi> and <hi>immortal</hi> Thing which will
be living and perceiving <hi>unspeakable</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
or Pains when this Body is <hi>dead</hi> and
<hi>insensible,</hi> that is overlooked as a Thing not
<hi>worthy</hi> our <hi>serious</hi> Notice or Regard. And
though we cannot but be <hi>sensible</hi> how much
it is diseased in all its Faculties, how much
its <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> is <hi>overloaded</hi> with <hi>Error</hi>
and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> its <hi>Will</hi> festered with <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>
Malice and Obstinacy, and its <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
oppressed with Loads of Guilt <hi>sussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
to sink it to the <hi>nethermost</hi> Hell; yet
we seem for the Generality to be no more
concerned at it; than if its Ruin or Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
were equally indifferent to us. We
can see it perishing before our Eyes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Remorse or Compassion; we can
pass Day after Day without making the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63657:25"/>
               <hi>least</hi> Offer or Attempt to recover it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offering <hi>up</hi> a Prayer for it, or entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>serious</hi> Thought what will become of it
<hi>for ever.</hi> O <hi>insensible</hi> Creatures that we are,
thus to neglect and abandon the most <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>
Part of our selves! The Part that makes
us Men, and by which alone we are <hi>capable</hi>
of being <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>miserable for ever.</hi> Let me
therefore beseech and conjure you, even by
all that is <hi>sacred</hi> and <hi>serious,</hi> by every thing
that is <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>precious</hi> to you, by your <hi>best</hi>
Hopes, and the most <hi>important</hi> Concern of
your <hi>everlasting</hi> Fate, to take pity upon your
<hi>perishing</hi> Souls, to consider the <hi>amazing</hi> Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
whereunto you have exposed them,
and to consult the Means of their Recovery;
to prick and affect your Hearts with the
Sense and Consideration of their <hi>impending</hi>
Ruin, till you have forced them to cry out
<hi>what shall we do to be saved;</hi> to bath their
Wounds with the Tears of Repentance, and
to pour into them that most <hi>sovereign</hi> Balm
of a <hi>serious</hi> Purpose and Resolution of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment;
to pray earnestly for them, and
keep a <hi>continual</hi> Guard about them, and to
strive vigorously with those <hi>sinful</hi> Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that threaten to sink and ruin them.
And if we will be but <hi>content</hi> to undergo
these <hi>necessary</hi> Cares and Pains to secure
them, we shall be sure when they leave
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63657:26"/>
these Bodies to reap the Fruits of all in the
Possession of an unspeakably <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>
Eternity.</p>
            <p>II. I proceed now to the Second Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
contained in these Words, <hi>that our
precious Souls may be lost.</hi> And this our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
here plainly supposes, <hi>If he gain the
whole World, and lose his own Soul.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi>
Word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which properly signifies to
receive a Mulct, or to suffer Damage; and
therefore it is here opposed to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>if he
shall gain.</hi> So that the Word doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
the <hi>absolute</hi> Loss or Extinction of the
Soul, but its undergoing some <hi>dreadful</hi>
Mulct, or suffering some <hi>irreparable</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.
For as <hi>Hierocles</hi> hath observed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>Immortal Substances cannot so die as to lose
their Being, but so, as to lose their Well-being
they may.</hi> And accordingly our <hi>Saviour</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
calls the Punishment of the Wicked in
Hell Fire, destroying them, <hi>Mat.</hi> x. 28. <hi>Fear
not them which kill the Body—but fear him
which is able to destroy both Soul and Body in
Hell.</hi> Where by <hi>destroying,</hi> he doth not mean
putting a <hi>final</hi> End to their Being, but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them into an <hi>irrecoverable</hi> State of Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being;
for in this State of Destruction, they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63657:26"/>
still continue to act, to <hi>weep</hi> and <hi>wail,</hi> and
<hi>gnash their Teeth,</hi> as <hi>Christ</hi> elsewhere tells
us, <hi>Mat. xiii.</hi> 42. which Actions plainly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their Continuance in Being, though in
a most <hi>wretched</hi> and <hi>deplorable</hi> Ill-being. So
that by the Loss of the Soul here is not
meant the Destruction of its Being, but its
being exposed to an <hi>irreparable</hi> Damage in
the <hi>other</hi> World. And to prove that in this
Sense a Soul may be lost, I shall endeavour
these two Things.</p>

of is to enjoy <hi>God,</hi> that is, to <hi>know,</hi> and
<hi>love,</hi> and <hi>resemble</hi> him; and to be admitted
into the <hi>noble</hi> Society of those <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
Spirits that do thus enjoy him; of all
which Happiness a Soul may be <hi>for ever</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
by its own <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>depraved</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
For besides that by such a Temper it
may provoke the <hi>just</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> God, who
hath the Disposal of the fate of Souls, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
it of, and banish it from this Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>for ever;</hi> it may thereby also utterly
<hi>incapacitate</hi> it self from ever enjoying it; it
may promote and raise that Temper to such
a Degree of <hi>Aversation</hi> and <hi>Antipathy</hi> to

                  </gap>anker</hi> it into such an <hi>inveterate</hi>
Enmity to all the Perfections of his Nature,
as that at last it may be utterly <hi>incapable</hi> of
any such <hi>beatifical</hi> Knowledg of them, as
can any ways incline it to love and imitate
him: For the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, that <hi>the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63657:27"/>
Mind is enmity to God,</hi> Rom. viii. 7. From
whence it is evident, that in every Degree
of Sin, there is a Degree of Aversation to
<hi>God,</hi> which Aversation may be improved
into such an <hi>implacable</hi> Malice against him,
as that our Knowledg of him, instead of
<hi>endearing</hi> him to us, or ingaging us to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
him, may only <hi>avert</hi> us from, <hi>provoke,</hi>
and <hi>irritate</hi> us against him, and by present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to us those <hi>immense</hi> Perfections, for which
he deserves our <hi>dearest</hi> Love, and <hi>deepest</hi>
Adoration, may only fill our Minds with
the <hi>greater</hi> Rage and more <hi>invincible</hi> Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
And when the Soul is arrived to such
a Degree of Malignity against <hi>God,</hi> it is as
<hi>impossible</hi> for it to injoy him, as to be <hi>recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated</hi>
with Torment, or delighted with the
Objects of its own <hi>Antipathies.</hi> And for
the same Reason also it must be <hi>incapable</hi> of
enjoying the Society of <hi>blessed Spirits,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it hath acquired a Temper that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<hi>repugnant</hi> to their <hi>Heavenly Genius;</hi>
so that if such a <hi>prejudiced</hi> Soul should, when
it is arrived into <hi>Eternity,</hi> find the Gates of
<hi>Heaven</hi> open to receive it, it would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
be so offended at every thing that is
<hi>Heavenly,</hi> so startled at the Sight of <hi>God,</hi>
and the Displays of his <hi>hated</hi> Perfections,
and seized with such a Horror against those
<hi>god-like</hi> Beings that dwell there, and are
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63657:28"/>
perpetually <hi>contemplating</hi> and <hi>adoring, loving</hi>
and <hi>imitating</hi> him, that it would fly away
of its <hi>own</hi> Accord from that <hi>blisful</hi> Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as Bats and Owls do from the Light of
the Day, and rather chuse to banish it self
into <hi>eternal</hi> Darkness and Despair, than be
shut up <hi>for ever</hi> in a <hi>Heaven</hi> so infinitely <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant</hi>
to its Nature. And certainly to be
thus excommunicated from the <hi>supreme</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of <hi>our</hi> Natures, and be forced to live
in <hi>everlasting</hi> Exile from <hi>God</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and wander about like <hi>wretched</hi> Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds
that are chased and driven from all
Hopes of Contentment, will be <hi>unspeakable</hi>
Damage to our Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The Soul of Man is <hi>liable</hi> to the most
<hi>dreadful</hi> Punishment and Correction of the
<hi>Father of Spirits.</hi> There is no Doubt but
<hi>spiritual</hi> Agents can strike as immediately
upon Spirits, as <hi>bodily</hi> Agents can upon Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
and though we who are Spctators only
of <hi>corporeal</hi> Action cannot discern the Manner
how <hi>one</hi> Spirit acts upon <hi>another,</hi> yet there
is no Reason to Doubt of the thing; and if
there be such a <hi>mutual</hi> Communication of
Action between them, there is no Doubt
but they can mutually make <hi>each other</hi> feel
each others Pleasures and Displeasures; and
if so, then it is only to suppose that the <hi>less
powerful</hi> Spirits are subject to the <hi>violent</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:63657:28"/>
Impression, of the <hi>more powerful</hi> ones, and
consequently that all <hi>finite</hi> Spirits are liable
to the Lash of an <hi>infinite</hi> one; for why
should it be more <hi>difficult</hi> for the Father of
our Spirits to correct our Spirits, than it is
for the Parents of our Flesh to correct our
Flesh? For though our Souls are no more
<hi>impressible</hi> with <hi>material</hi> Stripes than Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams
are with the blows of a Hammer,
yet are they liable to <hi>horrid</hi> and <hi>dismal</hi>
Thoughts, and to be as much pained and
aggrieved by them, as our Bodies are by the
most <hi>exquisite</hi> Torments. So that if <hi>God</hi> be
displeased with us, he can imprint his Wrath
upon our Minds in <hi>black</hi> and <hi>ghastly</hi> Thoughts,
and cause it perpetually to drop like <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sulphur</hi> upon our Souls. He can not
only abandon us to the <hi>furious</hi> Reflections of
our own <hi>natural</hi> Consciences, which, as I
shall shew you by and by, will be <hi>hereafter</hi>
extreamly <hi>painful</hi> and <hi>vexatious,</hi> but he can
also infuse <hi>supernatural</hi> Horrors into us, and
pour in such Swarms of <hi>terrible</hi> Thoughts
upon us as will give us no Rest, but sting
us perpetually Day and Night with <hi>inexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi>
Anguish. And of this you have a <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Example in that <hi>miserable</hi> Wretch <hi>Francis
Spira,</hi> who, upon that <hi>fearful</hi> Breach he
made in his Conscience by a <hi>cowardly</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of his <hi>Religion,</hi> was without any
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63657:29"/>
Symptoms of a <hi>bodily</hi> Melancholy immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
seised with such an <hi>inexpressible</hi> Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Mind as <hi>amazed</hi> his Physicians, <hi>astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
his Friends, and <hi>struck</hi> Terror into all
that conversed with him. For he was so
<hi>near</hi> to the Condition of a <hi>damned Ghost,</hi>
that he verily believed <hi>Hell</hi> it self was more
<hi>tolerable</hi> than those <hi>invisible</hi> Lashes that were
continually laid on upon his Soul; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wished he were in <hi>Hell,</hi> and would
gladly have dispatched himself thither in
hope to find Sanctuary there from those
<hi>vengful</hi> Thoughts which continually preyed
upon his Soul. And if in this World our
Soul is so <hi>liable</hi> to the Rod of the <hi>Father of
Spirits,</hi> we may be sure it will be so in the
<hi>other</hi> too, where <hi>God,</hi> if he pleases can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it an <hi>eternal Hell</hi> to it self by pouring
continually into it <hi>fresh</hi> Floods of <hi>horrible</hi>
Thoughts, which being thrust on by an
<hi>Almighty</hi> Power, and perpetually urged and
repeated on the Mind, must necessarily cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
in it not only a most <hi>exquisite,</hi> but <hi>unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted</hi>
Torment. And it being in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
thus to lash our Souls, to be sure when
once he is implacably incensed against them,
(as he will be <hi>hereafter,</hi> if we do not appease
him) he will let loose his Power upon them,
and make them feel his <hi>wrathful</hi> Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in those <hi>dire</hi> and <hi>frightful</hi> Thoughts
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63657:29"/>
with which he will Sting and Scourge them
<hi>for ever.</hi> And if the Soul carry into <hi>Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
with it those <hi>provoking</hi> Lusts which do
here incense Gods Displeasure against it, it
will there have no Shelter from the Storm
of his Vengance, which like a Shower of
<hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimstone,</hi> will be continually
pouring down upon it. For while it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
in this Shop of Vanities, it hath a <hi>great</hi>
Variety of Objects to divert those <hi>dismal</hi>
Thoughts which <hi>God</hi> many times infuses
into it; but in the <hi>other</hi> World all these <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi>
Objects will be removed, and then
every <hi>dismal</hi> Thought which <hi>God</hi> lets loose
will seise and fasten upon it, and like <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus</hi>'s
Vultures, prey on its <hi>wretched</hi> Heart
<hi>for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> The Soul of Man is <hi>liable</hi> to the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Violence of <hi>Devils,</hi> and other <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Spirits.</hi> For when ever the Souls
of Men do leave their Bodies, they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
flock with the Birds of their <hi>own</hi> Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and consort themselves with such <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate</hi>
Spirits as are of their <hi>own</hi> Genius and
Temper; for besides that Likeness doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<hi>congregate</hi> Beings, and cause them to
associate with their <hi>own</hi> Kind, <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi>
Spirits are by the <hi>eternal</hi> Laws of the <hi>other</hi>

no <hi>other</hi> Communication or Intercourse
but what is between <hi>two hostile</hi> Countries
that are continually designing and attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one against <hi>another.</hi> So that when <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
Souls do leave this <hi>terrestrial</hi> Abode, and
pass into <hi>Eternity,</hi> they are presently incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated

into the Nation of <hi>wicked</hi> Spirits, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined

their Condition be, who are damned to

It seems at least a mighty <hi>probable</hi> Notion
that that <hi>horrid</hi> Agony of our <hi>Saviour</hi> in

Terrors which the Devils, with
whom he was then in Combat, impressed
upon his <hi>innocent</hi> Mind. And if they had
so much Power over his <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>mighty</hi>
Soul that was so strongly guarded with the
most <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>unspotted</hi> Vertues, what
will they have over ours when God hath

Residence is in these <hi>lower</hi> Regions of

those <hi>infernal</hi> Powers under whose Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

to come abroad into this <hi>upper</hi> Region

they are, it is doubtless in some such <hi>horrid</hi>

expresly affirms that they shall be shut up

in this Life how <hi>vexatious</hi> our <hi>cross</hi>
and <hi>excessive</hi> Passions are; for when our Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

are divided, and <hi>contrary</hi> Objects have
raised <hi>contrary</hi> Desires and Appetites in us,
how do they rend and distract our Souls,
and cause <hi>perpetual</hi> Mutinies and Tumults
within us? But by Reason of those many
<hi>sensual</hi> Gratifications with which we now
make a shift to stop the Mouths of those
Daughters of the Horse-Leech, when they
cry out <hi>give, give;</hi> we cannot be so <hi>sensible</hi>
of the Trouble and Vexation of them; but
unless we now subdue and mortifie them,
we shall be forced to carry them into <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
along with us. For by being <hi>separated</hi>
from their Bodies the Souls of Men are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>separated</hi> from their <hi>prevailing</hi> Tempers,
but in their <hi>separated</hi> State are for the main
of the <hi>same</hi> Disposition as they were <hi>here;</hi>
and do retain the <hi>same</hi> Passions and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.
'Tis true, they cannot be supposed
to retain their <hi>bodily</hi> Appetites after they
have thrown <hi>off</hi> their Bodies, but when they
have wholly <hi>accustomed</hi> themselves in this
Life to <hi>fleshly</hi> Pleasures, and have never Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
<hi>spiritual</hi> ones, it is impossible but
that in the <hi>other</hi> they should be tormented

And this <hi>vehement</hi> Hankering of these <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized</hi>
Souls to return into their <hi>Bodily</hi>
State, is perhaps the only Sensuality that
a <hi>seperate</hi> Soul is <hi>capable</hi> of; but it is such
a Sensuality as must necessarily render such
Souls extreamly <hi>miserable;</hi> for in <hi>that</hi> State
it will be like the Hunger of a <hi>Starving</hi> Man
that is Immured between <hi>two dead</hi> Walls,
that is, it will be a <hi>fierce</hi> Desire without
Hope of Satisfaction, a <hi>corroding</hi> Hunger,
sharpened with Despair of Food, than which
there is nothing more intolerably <hi>grievous</hi>
and <hi>tormenting.</hi> For how will it vex the
<hi>wretched</hi> Spirit to look back from the Shores
of Eternity into this <hi>corporeal</hi> World, and
to ruminate thus with it self; <hi>O mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Creature that I am! here am I cast away
for ever upon a strange and desolate Shore,
where I must Famish for want of Food, pine
away a long Eternity, and wander to and fro
for ever tormented with restless Rage and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
unsatisfied Desires; where there is not one
Pleasure that I can relish, not an Object that
I can taste any sweetness in. Wo is me! yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
are all my Ioys and Comforts, all that is
dear and precious to me. O that I might go
back again, and be once more restored to the
Injoyment of them! but alas! between me and
them there runs an impassible Gulph, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives
me of all hope of returning!</hi> For thus
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63657:33"/>
will the <hi>unhappy</hi> Soul torment it self with
an <hi>outragious</hi> Longing for that which it can
never hope to enjoy. But then besides this
Appetite of Sensuality which it will there
be vexed with, it will also carry along with
it all that <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> that <hi>Wrath</hi> and
<hi>Impatience, Pride</hi> and <hi>Insolence</hi> which it here
contracted; which <hi>black</hi> and <hi>Hellish</hi> Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will prove <hi>perpetual</hi> Furies in its Bosom;
For in that <hi>wretched</hi> State it will not only
have Objects always <hi>present</hi> to excite them,
but such Objects <hi>too</hi> as will excite them all
at once to the most <hi>outragious</hi> Excesses. For
when all at once it shall see others advanced
to the <hi>greatest</hi> Heights of Glory and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and it self not only rejected but aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
to <hi>endless</hi> Misery, the Sense of this
must necessarily irritate all its <hi>devilish</hi> Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the <hi>highest</hi> Extremities, and cause
its <hi>Pride</hi> to swell, its <hi>Envy</hi> to burst, and its
<hi>Wrath</hi> to boil into a <hi>Diabolical</hi> Fury; and
what a <hi>continual Hell</hi> must this create in the
Soul, to be perpetually <hi>worried</hi> with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>black</hi> and <hi>rabid</hi> Passions, to have all its
<hi>inferiour</hi> Parts and Affections, like those of
the <hi>Monster Scylla</hi> whom the <hi>Poets</hi> talk of,
as so many Dogs continually <hi>barking</hi> and <hi>snar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
at <hi>one another,</hi> and yet remain <hi>unsepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
as being <hi>Comparts</hi> of the <hi>same</hi> Substance?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> The Soul of Man is also <hi>liable</hi> to the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63657:34"/>
               <hi>intolerable</hi> Anguish of its own <hi>guilty</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
<hi>The Spirit of a Man,</hi> says <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
can bear his Infirmities, but a wounded
Spirit who can bear?</hi> Intimating that of all
the Passions which <hi>humane</hi> Nature is <hi>liable</hi>
to, there are none so <hi>grievous</hi> as that of a
Mind awakened with a sense of Guilt. And
of the Truth of this we have some Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
even in this Life, tho now we can
make a shift either to divert our selves by
our <hi>sensual</hi> Mirth and Jollities, from listen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Clamours of our <hi>guilty</hi> Minds, or
else to deceive our selves into a <hi>groundless</hi>
Peace by <hi>indulgent</hi> and <hi>fallacious</hi> Principles;
but unless we expiate our Guilts here, we
shall carry them into Eternity with us, where
all those <hi>sensual</hi> Pleasures, with which we
now divert our selves from reflecting on our
Actions will be removed, and all those <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious</hi>
Principles, with which we cheat and
deceive our selves, will be baffled by a <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Experience. So that then our Souls will
be nakedly exposed to the Lash of its own
<hi>furious</hi> Thoughts, and having nothing to
guard or defend it self against the <hi>cutting</hi>
Reflections of a <hi>guilty</hi> Conscience, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
roused up and kept awake by the <hi>unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting</hi>
sense of our Misery will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
clamouring upon us, and continually
torturing our <hi>wretched</hi> Minds with <hi>sharp</hi> and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63657:34"/>
               <hi>vexatious</hi> Reflections: and besides, whilst
our Soul doth act by <hi>bodily</hi> Instruments,
and work in this Mire of Flesh, it is <hi>impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi>
it should be so <hi>nimble</hi> and <hi>expedite</hi> in
its Motions, as it will be when it is a <hi>naked</hi>
Spirit. For then its Perceptions will be
much <hi>clearer,</hi> its Convictions more <hi>strong</hi>
and <hi>evident,</hi> and all its Reflections <hi>active</hi>
as the Lightning, and <hi>quick</hi> as the Wing of
an Angel. So that whereas now the <hi>sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
Stings of our Conscience have an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
of Fancy and Imagination in them,
being <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>material</hi> Powers do dull and
rebate the Edg of them, and render them
less <hi>pungent</hi> and <hi>sensible;</hi> when we are <hi>strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi>
out of our Flesh, and sent <hi>naked</hi> into the
<hi>other</hi> World, we shall have no Clog about
us to break or allay those <hi>sharp</hi> Reflections
with which we shall be forced to lash our
selves <hi>for ever.</hi> And then our Conscience
will cut to the quick, and sting with a <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding</hi>
Venom; then will the Remembrance
of those Guilts which brought our Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
upon us, rouze <hi>up</hi> such a Swarm of
Horrors in our Minds, as we shall be <hi>able</hi>
neither to avoid nor indure. For the Sense
of our Misery will be every Moment sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting
those Guilts to our Minds that were
the Cause of it, and continually upbraiding
us with those <hi>desperate</hi> Follies by which we
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63657:35"/>
ran our selves into it; the Consideration of
which will cause us to hate and curse our
selves <hi>for ever,</hi> and to discharge our Fury
upon <hi>our own</hi> Heads, which will make our
Soul turn Devil to it self, and force it to be
its <hi>own</hi> Executioner. For it being now <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious</hi>
to it self that its Miseries are nothing
else but the <hi>rueful</hi> and <hi>pitiless</hi> Deserts of its
<hi>own</hi> Folly and Madness, it will be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
meditating <hi>horrible</hi> Reflections and sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Satyrs on it self. So that while it is
wandring among <hi>wretched</hi> Ghosts through
the <hi>dismal</hi> Shades below, it will never cease
lashing it self with its <hi>own sharp</hi> and <hi>stinging</hi>
Thoughts, till it hath chafed it self into a
Fury, and boiled up its <hi>self-condemning</hi> Rage
into <hi>everlasting</hi> Madness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly.</hi> And lastly, The Soul of Man is also
<hi>liable</hi> to endure all these <hi>dismal</hi> things <hi>for
ever:</hi> For that our Souls are naturally <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material</hi>
and <hi>immortal,</hi> I have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
so that if <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>infinite</hi> Justice
shall think fit to sentence <hi>wicked</hi> Souls irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably
to all these above named Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
they must by the Constitution of their
<hi>own</hi> Natures live in, and undergo them for
ever. And that he doth think to pronounce
and execute such a Sentence upon them, he
himself hath assured us; for so in <hi>Scripture</hi>
he hath plainly declared, that their Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63657:35"/>
shall be <hi>everlasting, Matth. 25. 7. These,</hi>
saith he speaking of the Wicked, <hi>shall go
away into everlasting Punishment:</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
the Fire in, and with which they are
to be punished, is called <hi>everlasting fire,
Matth.</hi> 25. 41. and that they shall subsist for
ever in this Fire, and be <hi>co-eternal</hi> with it,
is evident by those Passions and Actions that
are attributed to them in it; for <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 11.
they are said to <hi>have no rest day nor night</hi> in
it, but to be in a <hi>continual unintermitting</hi>
Fever, that will necessarily burn and scorch
them, and not allow them the <hi>least</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
of Ease or Comfort. And in <hi>Matth.</hi>
13. 42. the <hi>bitter</hi> Anguish vvhich they shall
endure in this Fire is described by their
<hi>weeping,</hi> and <hi>wailing,</hi> and <hi>gnashing</hi> their
Teeth; vvhich Actions are <hi>plain</hi> Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
not only of their subsisting in this <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Fire,</hi> but of the <hi>extream</hi> Horror and
Anguish that they shall therein endure. And
indeed vvhen <hi>God</hi> sentences any <hi>immortal</hi>
Being to Misery, its Misery must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to continue as long as it lives, and
consequently to continue <hi>for ever,</hi> since it
is to subsist and live <hi>for ever.</hi> And what
a <hi>fearful</hi> Accession is this to all those above
named Miseries? If we were to endure the
<hi>softest</hi> and most <hi>gentle</hi> Pain without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
for <hi>thirty, forty,</hi> or a <hi>hundred</hi> Years,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63657:36"/>
the Prospect of that which is to <hi>come</hi> would
render that which is <hi>present</hi> so <hi>intolerable,</hi>
that we should quickly grow weary of our
Lives, and wish our selves in our Graves.
<hi>Lord!</hi> what shall we then do when we
come to languish out a <hi>long Eternity</hi> in the
<hi>tormenting</hi> Agonies of <hi>damned</hi> Ghosts? How
will it imbitter every <hi>present</hi> Torment to us,
to think of that <hi>never-ending</hi> Duration of
Torment to come, that after we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
<hi>Millions</hi> of <hi>Millions</hi> of Ages on the
Rack, we have still an <hi>eternal H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll</hi> behind,
and are as far <hi>distant</hi> from the End of our
Misery, as we were when it <hi>first</hi> began?
O! now if we could die and be <hi>insensible
for ever!</hi> what <hi>welcome</hi> Tidings would it
be? how gladly should we receive that <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
Blow that could put an End to a <hi>woful</hi>
Eternity? But now it will be in vain for
us to cry, <hi>O Death, Death, have mercy upon
us, and dispatch us quickly into an eternal
Grave!</hi> For Death is <hi>deaf</hi> and cannot hear,
every Moment it stabs and wounds, but
<hi>woe is me!</hi> it cannot kill; it strikes and strikes
but cannot strike home, and so is forced to
continue as strugling under the Pangs of
an <hi>immortal</hi> Death. If there were any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of an End of our Misery, though it
were after a <hi>Million</hi> of Ages, this would
give some Ease to the <hi>languishing</hi> Sufferer;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63657:36"/>
But <hi>never, never</hi>—O how that <hi>fatal</hi> Word
stabs the <hi>wretched</hi> Soul, and rankles its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
into <hi>eternal</hi> Desperation! For to be in
<hi>extream</hi> Misery, and see no End of it, is the
Perfection of Hell, and the <hi>utmost</hi> Possibility
of Damnation.</p>
            <p>And thus have I endeavoured to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unto you the <hi>fearful</hi> Mulcts our Souls
are <hi>liable</hi> to in the <hi>other</hi> World; which are
such as, one would think, were <hi>sufficient</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
the most <hi>stupid</hi> and <hi>insensible</hi> Creature.</p>
            <p>II. I now pass on to the <hi>second</hi> thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
which was to shew you upon what
Accounts it is that our Souls are <hi>liable</hi> to these
<hi>dreadful</hi> Things; or what it is that exposes
us to the Danger of them. In general, it is
<hi>our own</hi> Sin and Wickedness, which doth not
only incense the <hi>holy God</hi> against us, who is
of <hi>purer</hi> Eyes than to behold Iniquity, and
provoke and urge him to inflict these <hi>endless</hi>
Miseries upon us as the <hi>just</hi> Retributions of
our <hi>desperate</hi> Folly and Obstinacy; but doth
also by its own <hi>natural</hi> Causality prepare
us for, and sink us into that <hi>miserable</hi> State
So that if <hi>God</hi> should not damn us, yet <hi>our
own</hi> Wickedness would; the Misery of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
being <hi>little</hi> else but the Perfection and
Consummation of Sin. For the Sting of
<hi>eternal</hi> as well as <hi>temporal</hi> Death is Sin, and
it is <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Wickedness</hi> that makes <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:63657:37"/>
and <hi>Hell,</hi> those two <hi>opposite</hi> Hemispheres
of the <hi>Invisible</hi> World; and as, if <hi>Goodness</hi>
were plucked out of <hi>Heaven,</hi> it would cease
to be <hi>Heaven,</hi> and be overcast immediately
with the <hi>dismal</hi> Shades of <hi>Hell;</hi> so if <hi>Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
were banished out of <hi>Hell,</hi> it would be
<hi>Hell</hi> no longer, but presently clear up into
Light and Serenity, and shine forth into a
<hi>glorious Heaven;</hi> But wheresoever Sin and
Wickedness reigns, there is Hell and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in its <hi>necessary</hi> Causes. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in <hi>necessary</hi> Causes that which is the Cause
of the Cause is also the Cause of the Effect,
our <hi>best</hi> way to be resolved what it is that
renders us <hi>liable</hi> to these <hi>future</hi> Miseries, will
be to enquire what it is that renders us <hi>liable</hi>
to fall into a <hi>sinful</hi> Condition at the <hi>present;</hi>
for whatsoever renders us <hi>liable</hi> to Sin, must
necessarily expose us to the Danger of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.
Now the Danger of our falling into
and continuing in a State of Sin, proceeds
from these <hi>following</hi> Causes.</p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>natural</hi> Liberty of our Wills
to <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> From the many Temptations to <hi>Evil</hi>
among which we are placed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> From the more <hi>close</hi> and <hi>intimate</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
which these Temptations have to us,
than the <hi>contrary</hi> Motives to <hi>Goodness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:63657:37"/>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> From the <hi>great</hi> Correspondence of
these Temptations with the <hi>corrupt</hi> Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> From the <hi>unwearied</hi> Diligence and
<hi>great</hi> Subtilty of the Devil to make Use of,
and apply these Temptations to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> From the <hi>plausible</hi> Pretences we are
furnished with to <hi>excuse,</hi> and <hi>justifie</hi> our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly.</hi> From the <hi>extream</hi> Difficulty which
this our Compliance brings us under to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
and <hi>vanquish</hi> them for the future.</p>
            <p>1. We are <hi>liable</hi> to fall into a <hi>sinful</hi> State,
and from thence into <hi>eternal</hi> Misery from the
<hi>natural</hi> Liberty of our Wills to <hi>Good</hi> and
<hi>Evil.</hi> If indeed we were necessarily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to <hi>Good,</hi> our Happiness would be
intailed upon our Natures, and it would be
as <hi>impossible</hi> for us to be <hi>miserable,</hi> as it is for
the Fire to <hi>freeze,</hi> or for the Ice to <hi>burn;</hi>
but to be so determined I am apt to think
is not <hi>consistent</hi> with the condition of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For to be <hi>good</hi> by a <hi>natural</hi> Necessity
requires an <hi>infallible</hi> Understanding, or a
Mind that is infinitely <hi>removed</hi> from all Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of being deceived and mistaken; and
this no <hi>finite</hi> Mind can be: But how should
the Will be in all particulars necessarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to what is Right, so long as it is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63657:38"/>
under the Conduct of a <hi>fallible</hi> Mind that
hath a <hi>natural</hi> Possibility of misleading it?
So that to be <hi>naturally, necessarily,</hi> and <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
good,</hi> seems to be an <hi>incommunicable</hi>
Prerogative of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> according
to that of our Saviour, <hi>There is none good
save one, and that is God,</hi> Luke 18. 19. For
since no Will can be <hi>essentially good</hi> but that
which is guided by an <hi>infallible</hi> Mind, and no
Mind can be <hi>essentially infallible</hi> but that which
is <hi>infinite</hi> in Knowledge, it hence necessarily
follows, that to be <hi>free</hi> to <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> is as
<hi>natural</hi> to <hi>reasonable</hi> Creatures, as it is to be
<hi>finite</hi> in Knowledge and Understanding.
'Tis true the <hi>greater</hi> Light of Knowledge
there is in the Mind, the <hi>less</hi> Freedom to
<hi>Evil</hi> there must be in the Will, unless it
hath some <hi>antecedent</hi> Biass and Inclination to
<hi>Evil;</hi> and consequently the Angels being
of far more <hi>intelligent</hi> Natures than we Men,
must needs be naturally less <hi>free</hi> to <hi>Evil;</hi> but
yet that even they are naturally <hi>free</hi> to it is
evident, for that some of them have actually
lapsed into Devils; and if they are so by their
Natures, then much more are we by ours,
who are so much their Inferiours in the <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi>
World. For as we are <hi>finite</hi> Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
we must necessarily have some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Freedom to <hi>Evil</hi> in us, but as we
are of the <hi>lowermost</hi> Rank of Intelligences,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63657:38"/>
we must naturally have <hi>greater</hi> Degrees of
this Freedom in us than any <hi>other</hi> Order of
<hi>intelligent</hi> Natures; And if this were all, yet
this very Condition of our Natures renders
us more <hi>liable</hi> to degenerate into an <hi>evil</hi> and
<hi>sinful</hi> State, than any <hi>other</hi> kind of <hi>reasonable</hi>
Creatures. If we were now in a State of
<hi>perfect</hi> Innocence, yet of all <hi>intelligent</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
we should have the greatest Reason
to apprehend the Danger of our Fall; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being the <hi>least intelligent</hi> we have the
<hi>greatest</hi> Freedom to <hi>Evil,</hi> and consequently
are on that Account in the <hi>greatest</hi> danger
of falling into it. By the very Condition of
our Natures we are of all <hi>rational</hi> Creatures
placed <hi>nearest</hi> to the Brinks of the <hi>fatal</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice,
and therefore have most Reason to
apprehend the Danger of falling <hi>headlong</hi>
into it. For doubtless among <hi>innocent</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
there are none so near the Danger of
sinning as those whose Wills are <hi>least</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
from it, and therefore though we
were now as <hi>innocent</hi> as the <hi>blessed</hi> Angels
are, yet our Condition would be unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
more <hi>unsafe;</hi> because by how much we
fall short of them in Knowledge and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
by so much we should exceed
them in our Freedom to <hi>Evil,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
by so much the more <hi>liable</hi> to it. But
this alas is the <hi>least</hi> of our Danger; For</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:63657:39"/>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> We are liable to fall into a <hi>sinful</hi>
State, and from thence into <hi>eternal</hi> Misery,
from the many Temptations to <hi>Evil</hi> among
which we are placed. For this State of
Being in which we now are, being intended
by <hi>God</hi> for our Tryal and Probation, it was
<hi>requisite</hi> in order thereunto that we should
be placed among Difficulties, that we might
have <hi>sufficient</hi> Opportunity to exercise our
Skill and Courage in <hi>Religion;</hi> for unless
we had some such Difficulties to encounter,
there could no Proof or Tryal be made of
our Virtue. Hence therefore hath <hi>God</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
our <hi>rational</hi> Souls in <hi>mortal</hi> Bodies, which
do naturally abound with <hi>brutish</hi> Appetites
and Desires, and compassed us round with
this World of <hi>sensual</hi> Goods and Evils, which
continually importunes and excites them, that
so we might have sufficient opportunity to
exercise those <hi>humane</hi> Virtues which consist in
the Dominion of our <hi>rational</hi> Faculties over
these our <hi>bodily</hi> Appetites and Desires, that we
might never want occasion to give the most
<hi>glorious</hi> Proofs of our <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Chastity,
Temperance</hi> and <hi>Equanimity, Meekness</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety;</hi>
all which are <hi>proper</hi> to us as Beings made
up of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> whence all those <hi>brutish</hi>
Appetites arise, in the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> Government
whereof consists the Nature of <hi>humane</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Vice. So that this <hi>present</hi> State of

               <hi>humane</hi> Life is intended by <hi>God</hi> for a Field
of Combat between <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Sense,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Law in our Minds, and the Law
in our Members; and that the Victory of
Reason might, through the Difficulty of it,
be render'd more <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>rewardable,</hi> he
hath furnished its <hi>Antagonist,</hi> viz. the <hi>bodily</hi>
Appetite with <hi>various</hi> Weapons, with the
Temptations of a World of <hi>sensitive</hi> Goods
and Evils to assault and oppose it, to try its
Metal, and exercise both its <hi>active</hi> and <hi>passive</hi>
Virtues; and upon the success of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
depends the <hi>everlasting</hi> Fate of the Soul.
If Sense prevail, and lead her finally Captive
into Vice and Wickedness, she is lost <hi>for
ever,</hi> but if Reason get the Victory, and
finally reduce the Desires and Appetites of
Sense under the Dominion of Virtue, when
this <hi>mortal</hi> Life ends She shall triumph <hi>for
ever,</hi> and be translated hence into a <hi>free</hi> and
<hi>disintangled</hi> State, where she shall be vexed
and inticed no more with the Importunities
of <hi>sensual</hi> Lusts and Affections, but to all
<hi>Eternity</hi> enjoy the Serenity and Pleasure of
a <hi>pure Intellectual</hi> Being. This being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>true</hi> State of Affairs, it is <hi>too</hi> to <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious</hi>
how <hi>liable</hi> the Soul is to miscarry when
it is placed in a Body among so many <hi>brutish</hi>

               <hi>sensitive</hi> Goods and Evils that are continually

Reason have we to look about us, when we
are placed in the midst of so <hi>many</hi> Dangers,
and have such <hi>numberless</hi> Snares on every side

                  </gap>ose</hi> and <hi>intimate</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
which these Temptations have to us,
than the <hi>contrary</hi> Motives to Goodness. For
the <hi>great</hi> Advantage which these Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to Vice have over the most <hi>powerful</hi>
Motives to Virtue is this, that they are all
of them <hi>present</hi> and <hi>sensible;</hi> for as for those
<hi>grand</hi> Motives to Goodness that are drawn
from the Consideration of our <hi>future</hi> State,
they propose to our <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> those
Master-Springs of our Motions, such <hi>Goods</hi>
and <hi>Evils</hi> as are a <hi>great</hi> way <hi>off,</hi> and beyond
the prospect of our <hi>bodily</hi> Senses, which
makes the Land-skip of them appear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<hi>dim</hi> and <hi>faint</hi> upon the Mind; their
Futurity, which is one sort of Distance, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them like Things afar <hi>off</hi> to look <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused</hi>
and <hi>indistinct,</hi> by Reason of which they
cannot affect us so powerfully, and draw
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63657:40"/>
such <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>lasting</hi> Draughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon our minds: For Goods, like
Magnets, have always the <hi>strongest</hi> Attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
when they are <hi>nearest;</hi> but as for those
<hi>invisible</hi> Goods of the <hi>other</hi> World, they are
at such a Distance from us that they can
hardly reach us who live upon the <hi>remot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
Circumference of the Sphere of their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.
And as Distance lessens all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to the Eye, and renders them much
<hi>smaller</hi> in Appearance than they are in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality;
so the <hi>remote</hi> Futurity of those <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Goods which the Motives of Vertue do
propose, detracts from their <hi>just</hi> Magnitude
and makes them, tho unspeakably <hi>vast</hi> in
themselves, appear exceeding <hi>small</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable</hi>
to our <hi>short-sighted</hi> Minds. And
the same is to be said of those <hi>future</hi> Evils
also, which they denounce against us; and
besides, being not only <hi>remote,</hi> but <hi>invisible</hi>
too, they cannot strike upon our Senses, by
which the most <hi>vigorous</hi> Impressions of
Things are made upon our Minds; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Temptations of Vice are all <hi>present</hi>
and <hi>sensible,</hi> and do so circle us round as soon
as we look abroad into the World, that
which way soever we turn our Eyes they
are still before us thrusting themselves into
our Minds, and with their <hi>constant</hi> Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
stirring and working our Desires.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63657:41"/>
So that when ever these <hi>outward</hi> Goods or
Evils do assault us, we lie <hi>bare</hi> and <hi>open</hi> to
them, and they continually press so close
upon our Senses, that we are not able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
their Impressions: When any <hi>outward</hi>
Good invites us to a sinful Action, it hath
the <hi>vast</hi> Advantage of being <hi>present</hi> and <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;</hi>
by Reason of which, it having a more
<hi>immediate</hi> Access to our Minds doth many
times prevail before we can Rally up a <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi>
Strength of Considerations against it;
and when we set our selves to resist and
struggle with it, the <hi>best</hi> of our Weapons
is a Company of <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>faint</hi> Notions of
Things a far <hi>off;</hi> Things that we never saw
nor felt; which whilst we are recollecting,
the Vice we are Tempted to, hath its Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ready to seize upon the Will, which
having oftentimes experienced the Pleasure
it invites to, is the more easily <hi>seduced</hi> to a
<hi>fresh</hi> Compliance. And whilst our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are so <hi>near</hi> us, and our Helps and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors
so far <hi>off,</hi> we must needs acknowledge
our Danger very <hi>great</hi> and urgent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> We are <hi>liable</hi> to fall into a <hi>sinful</hi> State,
and from thence into <hi>eternal</hi> Misery, from
the <hi>great</hi> Correspondence of these Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with the <hi>corrupt</hi> Inclinations of our
Natures. For by Reason of the Nearness
and Sensibleness of those <hi>outward worldly</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:63657:41"/>
Goods by which we are continually temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and solicited to Evil, they have the
Advantage of preingaging our Affections to
them before we arrive to the Use of our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
for in our <hi>tender</hi> years these are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Goods that we can relish, they are these
that do <hi>feed, clothe,</hi> and <hi>furnish</hi> us in hand
with whatsoever our <hi>natural</hi> Appetites do
gape for; that are the <hi>sole</hi> Entertainment of
our <hi>childish</hi> Fancies, and the <hi>only</hi> Objects
our yet <hi>unfledg'd</hi> Thoughts and Desires can
reach at, and our Youth being thus intirely
inured to them, by that time we are grown
<hi>up</hi> to the Age of Reason and the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Virtue and Religion, we have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
contracted such an <hi>excessive</hi> Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
towards them, and are so strongly bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ass'd
with the Love of them, that whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they beckon to us we are ready to
follow them through all the <hi>forbidden</hi> Tracts
that lead to <hi>everlasting</hi> Ruin. For our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
being thus <hi>vitiated,</hi> the Temptations
<hi>without</hi> us have a strong Party <hi>within</hi> us, a
Party of <hi>traytorous</hi> Inclinations which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every Summons sollicites us to yield,
and surrender up our Vertue and Innocence;
and no sooner can any Temptation from
<hi>without</hi> give the Alarm, but presently <hi>our
own</hi> Lusts are <hi>up</hi> raising a Mutiny <hi>within</hi> us,
and with the Heats of our <hi>corrupted</hi> Fancy
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63657:42"/>
do many times so disorder our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it cannot rally up its Considerations
against them. For before ever our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
could be Furnished with Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
our Hearts were prepossessed with
such an <hi>excessive</hi> degree of <hi>ambitious, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,</hi>
and <hi>luxurious</hi> Inclinations, that when
afterwards the <hi>Pleasures, Profits,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
without</hi> begin to hold forth their <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Lures to us, and to tempt us away to
<hi>Fraud</hi> or <hi>Treachery,</hi> to <hi>Vanity</hi> or <hi>Licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
those <hi>depraved</hi> Inclinations have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
such Head <hi>within</hi> us, that they prove
most commonly <hi>too strong</hi> for all our Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
and with their <hi>impetuous</hi> Current
carry us away, and drive us <hi>headlong</hi> down
towards <hi>eternal</hi> Ruin; and unless we put
forth all the strength of our Reason and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
and the Grace of <hi>God</hi> also come
<hi>in</hi> to our Aid, it will be <hi>impossible</hi> for us to
stem such a <hi>furious</hi> Tide when it is driven
by the Wind of an <hi>outward</hi> Temptation.
When therefore <hi>our own</hi> Inclinations do so
vigorously conspire with the Temptations
<hi>without</hi> to thrust us on into Sin and Perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
how can we be <hi>insensible</hi> of the <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>
danger we are in of Miscarrying for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever?
But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly.</hi> We are <hi>liable</hi> also to fall into a <hi>sinful</hi>
State, and from thence into <hi>Eternal</hi> Misery,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63657:42"/>
from the <hi>unwearied</hi> Diligence and <hi>great</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty
of the Devil to make Use of, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
these Temptations to us. For that the
Devil doth commonly, as an <hi>assistant Genius</hi>
to the Corruption of our Natures; excite
and provoke Men to Wickedness is very
evident from <hi>Scripture;</hi> where he is said <hi>to
work in the Children of Disobedience.</hi> Eph. 2. 2.
<hi>To fill the Heart of</hi> Ananias <hi>to lye to the Holy
Ghost.</hi> Acts. 5. 3. <hi>And to take away the Word
out of Mens hearts, lest they should believe and
be saved,</hi> Luke 8. 12. All which Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
do plainly imply that the Devil is a
<hi>constant</hi> Agent in the Sins of Men. And
being a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Agent, he must needs be
supposed to have a <hi>nearer</hi> Access to the Soul
than any <hi>material</hi> Cause whatsoever. For
tho he be totally debarr'd from all kind of
Intercourse with the <hi>immediate</hi> Operations
of the <hi>reasonable</hi> Soul, and can no more look
into the Thoughts than we can into the
Bowels of the Earth; yet he can easily get
into the Fancy which stands next to that
<hi>mysterious</hi> Chamber that is open to no Eye
but Gods, and make what use he pleases of
the <hi>infinite</hi> Images and <hi>Phantasms</hi> that are
in it, and dispose, and order, and distinguish
them into the Pictures of what Objects he
pleases, just as the Painter doth his <hi>numerous
Colours</hi> that lie confusedly before him in their
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63657:43"/>
               <hi>several</hi> Shells, and continue and repeat those
Pictures and Representations as <hi>long</hi> and as
<hi>oft</hi> as he pleases. And then considering
what the <hi>natural</hi> Use of the Fancy is, both
to the <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> how it prompts
the <hi>one</hi> with matter of Invention, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
it with Variety of Objects to work on,
and draws forth and excites the <hi>other</hi> to chuse
or reject those Objects it presents, according
as they are pleasing or displeasing; we must
needs suppose that the Devil hath a <hi>vast</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of insinuating his <hi>black</hi> Suggestions
into the Soul, by having such <hi>free</hi> Access in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Fancy. And accordingly he is said
to <hi>put it into the heart of Iudas to betray
Christ,</hi> John. 13. 2. But then he being not
only a <hi>spiritual,</hi> but also an <hi>intellectual</hi> Agent,
of a <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>capacious</hi> Understanding by
Nature, and particularly improved in the
<hi>black</hi> Art of tempting by a <hi>long</hi> Experience
of its Wiles and Stratagems, having been a
Tempter almost ever since he hath been an
Angel; he must needs be supposed to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
<hi>expert</hi> and <hi>sagasious</hi> in it; that after
having had <hi>five Thousand</hi> years experience of
the Methods of seducing Souls to increase and
perfect his <hi>natural</hi> Subtilty, he must by this
be fully instructed when and how to apply
himself to every Age and Constitution. For
this hath been his <hi>sole</hi> Business wherein he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63657:43"/>
hath been infinitely <hi>intent</hi> and <hi>active</hi> ever
since he became a Devil, and if from a Man,
then much more from a Devil of one Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
<hi>Good Lord deliver me,</hi> from a Devil
that for <hi>five thousand</hi> Years hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
making Experiments of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and drawing them into Rules to direct
and order his <hi>mischievous</hi> Practice on the
Souls of Men. But besides, as the Devil
is of a <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>intelligent</hi> Nature, so he
hath a <hi>vast</hi> Number of his <hi>black</hi> Angels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
roving about the World to seduce
and captivate us into Sin and Ruin. And
tho these <hi>malignant</hi> Spirits have no ligament
of <hi>natural</hi> Love between them to tie and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige
them to <hi>one another,</hi> yet by that <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
Hatred which they all bear to <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Men</hi> they are united together in an <hi>inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
League, and go hand in hand with <hi>one
another</hi> in pursuance of their <hi>desperate</hi> Design
to involve our <hi>wretched</hi> Souls in the same
<hi>eternal</hi> Ruin with themselves, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
their Force so much the more <hi>formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.</hi>
And when we have so many <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
subtil,</hi> and <hi>Powerful</hi> Adversaries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining
against, and continually wandring <hi>to</hi>
and <hi>fro</hi> like <hi>roaring Lyons</hi> to devour us, we
cannot but apprehend our Danger exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>great;</hi> especially considering the <hi>infinite</hi>
Temptations from <hi>without,</hi> that this World
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63657:44"/>
fords the great Variety of <hi>sensual</hi> Goods and
Evils which they have to object to our <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized</hi>
Minds. For these <hi>mischievous</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
having so <hi>great</hi> Insight into our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and so <hi>great</hi> a Choice of Objects to
suggest to our Fancies, can never be at a Loss
how they may nick us vvith a <hi>convenient</hi>
Temptation; and that which gives their
Temptations a <hi>vast</hi> Advantage over us is,
that vve knovv not hovv to distinguish
them from the Motions of <hi>our own</hi> Hearts,
For could vve see the Devil at our Elbovvs,
or hear him vvhispering at our Ears every
time he insinuates his <hi>wicked</hi> suggestions into
our Minds, vve should doubtless reject them
vvith an unspeakable Horror; but because
vvhen they are convey'd into us, vve knovv
not hovv to distinguish them from the <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
Births of <hi>our own</hi> Minds; therefore vve
do make no scruple to <hi>hug</hi> and <hi>dandle</hi> them
in our Thoughts and entertain them vvith
an <hi>actual</hi> Complacence. And vvhen the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
can convey his Poyson into us in such an
<hi>invisible</hi> manner, vvithout discovering his
Devils Face; vvhen he can thus prompt us
behind the Curtain, and so disguise his
Whispers that vve can't discern them from
the <hi>secret</hi> Lustings of <hi>our own</hi> Hearts; hovv
can vve be safe, vvithout great Care and
Watchfulness, from the Malice of such a
<hi>formidable</hi> Enemy? But</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:63657:44"/>
               <hi>6ly.</hi> We are also <hi>liable</hi> to fall into a <hi>sinful</hi>
State, and from thence into <hi>eternal</hi> Misery,
from the <hi>plausible</hi> Pretences we are furnished
with to excuse and justify our Compliance
with them. When by <hi>our own</hi> Folly and
the Devil's Malice we are actually betrayed
into any <hi>wilful</hi> Sin, a <hi>speedy</hi> Repentance
would recover us immediately, and heal the
Wound as soon as it is made; but instead
of that we have a <hi>thousand plausible</hi> Excuses
to palliate and skin it over; but alas! in the
mean time it rots inwardly, and is festring
apace into an <hi>incurable</hi> Gangrene. For when
our Conscience begins to fly in our Faces,
we have no <hi>other</hi> Way, but either presently
to repent of, or to excuse and cloak our
Wickedness; the <hi>later</hi> of which is usually
pitch'd on as being both the most <hi>easy,</hi> and the
most <hi>agreeable</hi> with our <hi>corrupt</hi> Inclinations.
And indeed there are so many Coverts which
Men have found out for their Lusts to shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them from the Persecutions of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
that this Way there are no Men can
be long to seek; for either they may blanch
them over with an <hi>innocent</hi> Name, and call
their Intemperances, <hi>Good-fellowship,</hi> their
Knaveries, <hi>ingenious Fetches;</hi> and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continences,
<hi>Tricks of Wit;</hi> or else they
may extenuate and mince them into <hi>Pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dillo's,</hi>
and smooth over their <hi>grossest</hi> Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63657:45"/>
with the softer name of <hi>humane</hi> Failings
and Infirmities; or else they may furnish
themselves with some Shew of Argument
to vindicate their Vices and assert them <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi>
as some of late have done in the Case of
<hi>Fornication</hi> and <hi>Vncleanness;</hi> or else they
may set up for <hi>Philosophical</hi> Sinners, and
quote Texts out of their Gospel, <hi>the Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
against the <hi>eternal</hi> Differences of <hi>Good</hi>
and <hi>Evil.</hi> But if their Consciences will not
be put off with such <hi>poor</hi> Pretences as these,
there are <hi>Religious</hi> Pretences enough in the
World to protect and give Countenance to
All their Impieties; and they may either fly
to the <hi>Romish</hi> Doctrins of <hi>Confession</hi> and
<hi>Penance,</hi> of <hi>Venial Sins,</hi> and of <hi>probable
Opinions,</hi> with any one of which they may
easily reconcile their Lusts and Consciences:
Or if they chance to have an <hi>Antipathy</hi> to the
name of <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> they may furnish
themselves with such Doctrins out of some
of our <hi>modern Enthusiasts,</hi> as will be as <hi>favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
to their Lusts as they need, or wish, or
desire; that will consecrate their <hi>irregular</hi>
Passions into Signs of Grace, and dwindle
their <hi>grossest</hi> Crimes into the Spots of God's
People; that will exalt a <hi>mechanick</hi> Train of
Fancies and Passions into a <hi>sincere</hi> Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and improve an <hi>Hysterical Fit</hi> into a
<hi>spiritual Experience.</hi> By these, and such like
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63657:45"/>
ways may Men easily excuse their Vices to
their Consciences; and when they are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with so <hi>many</hi> Expedients whereby
to inable themselves to sin on quietly, in
how much Danger are they of falling <hi>fast
asleep</hi> in the midst of their Guilts, and never
waking again till they flame out about their
Ears into <hi>everlasting Burnings?</hi> For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this Faculty of Conscience was implanted
within us by the Author of our Natures,
to be a Guard to our Innocence, and a
Scourge to our Lusts, the Generality of Men
have invented so many Tricks to shift and
evade it, that it is become almost totally
<hi>useless</hi> to them. And when they have thus
disabled their Consciences from defending
them against the Importunities of their
Lusts, in what <hi>unspeakable</hi> Danger must they
be, not only of <hi>falling</hi> into, but <hi>continuing</hi>
in them till they have utterly ruined and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7ly.</hi> And lastly, We are also <hi>liable</hi> to fall
into a <hi>sinful</hi> State, and from thence into
<hi>eternal</hi> Misery, from the <hi>extream</hi> Difficulty
which this our Compliance with those
Temptations brings us under, to reject and
vanquish them for the future. For every
<hi>new</hi> Compliance with Temptations to <hi>Evil</hi>
foments and inrages our <hi>evil</hi> Inclinations,
and when once these <hi>evil</hi> Inclinations are by

a <hi>mighty</hi> Assistance of <hi>divine</hi> Grace to

the <hi>former</hi> Accounts we are in extream
danger of falling into <hi>sinful</hi> Courses, upon
this Account we are in no <hi>less</hi> Danger of
continuing in them. For by complying with
<hi>this</hi> Temptation, I shall very much disable
my self from withstanding the <hi>next;</hi> and if
I yield to <hi>that too,</hi> the <hi>third</hi> will find me
much more <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>tractable,</hi> and so on,

Habit, <hi>the Lord have mercy upon me!</hi>
for now I am in the <hi>Suburbs</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> but one
Remove from the State of the <hi>Damned,</hi> and
am so far gone in a <hi>confirmed</hi> State of Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that I have almost lost my Liberty of
returning; and unless I am speedily rescued
by some Miracle of Grace, it is <hi>morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi>
I should ever escape. Thus as we
go on from <hi>one</hi> Degree of Wickedness to
<hi>another,</hi> we do as it were break down the
Bridge behind us, and do what in us lies to
disappoint our selves of all Hopes of any <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

                  </gap>ul</hi> Progress renders our Return more
<hi>difficult;</hi> and when once we have proceeded
into a Custom and Habit of Sin, we shall
find Repentance so <hi>irksom</hi> to us, and so much
against the Grain of our Nature, that it is a
thousand to one but that the Difficulty of it
will utterly dishearten us from attempting
it; and so rather than take so much Pains
as we must necessarily do in swimming
against the <hi>impetuous</hi> Stream of our Natures,
we shall tamely yield to it, and suffer our
selves to be born down by it into the <hi>dead
Sea</hi> of <hi>endless</hi> Misery. When therefore there
are so many Causes conspiring together to
betray us into <hi>sinful</hi> Courses, and when
there are so many Difficulties when once we
are <hi>in</hi> to oppose and hinder our Retreat,
what <hi>eminent</hi> Danger are we in of falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and persevering in Sin to our <hi>everlasting</hi>
Ruin! And thus you see how extreamly
<hi>liable</hi> we are upon all these Accounts to be
<hi>lost for ever,</hi> that is, to plunge our selves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all those <hi>endless</hi> Miseries which the Loss
of our Souls implies.</p>
            <p>What then remains but that being seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
affected with the Sense of our Danger,
we presently awake out of our Security,
and with the <hi>deepest</hi> Concern for our <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
Souls, cry out with St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Auditors,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63657:47"/>
               <hi>Men and Brethren, what shall we do to be saved?</hi>
Verily when I reflect upon the <hi>strange</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernedness
of Men about their <hi>future</hi>
Condition, I am tempted to think either that
they do not believe they have an <hi>immortal</hi>
Soul in them, or that if they do, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it is <hi>impossible</hi> it should <hi>for ever</hi> mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.
For how is it <hi>conceivable</hi> that Men,
who in <hi>other</hi> matters are so <hi>solicitous</hi> when
their Interest is at Stake, and exposed to the
<hi>least</hi> Hazard, should believe that they have
Souls in Danger of perishing <hi>for ever,</hi> and
yet take no more Care or Regard of them,
but (like the <hi>forgetful</hi> Mother, who, when
her House was on Fire, to save her Goods,
forgot her Child) lay out all their thoughts
upon the <hi>little</hi> Concerns of this <hi>frail</hi> and
<hi>mortal</hi> Life, and in the mean time forget
their <hi>precious</hi> Souls, and leave them perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Flames of Perdition? O <hi>stupid</hi>
Creature! what art thou made of that canst
consider that thou hast an <hi>immortal</hi> Soul
surrounded with so many Dangers of being
lost <hi>for ever,</hi> and yet be no more concerned
for its Preservation? Methinks if thou hadst
any Sense in thee, having a Prospect of such
<hi>endless</hi> Miseries before thee, the <hi>remotest</hi> Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of falling into them should be enough
to startle and awake thee; but when thou
art so near the Brink of those Miseries, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63657:47"/>
hast so many Causes round about thee
shoving thee forward, and thrusting thee
<hi>headlong</hi> down into them, and yet be no
more concerned at it, is such a Prodigy of
<hi>sensless</hi> Stupidity, as Heaven and Earth may
justly be astonished at. 'Tis true, if the
Danger thou art in were such as is <hi>impossible</hi>
to be evaded, it would then be the <hi>wisest</hi>
Course thou couldst take to concern thy self
as <hi>little</hi> as may be about it; but rather to
live merrily whilst thou mayst, and not <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedate</hi>
thy Misery, by thinking of the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi>
Futurity. But <hi>God</hi> be praised this is
not our Case, though our Condition be
<hi>dangerous,</hi> yet it is far from <hi>desperate;</hi> for
if we will use our <hi>honest</hi> Endeavour, and
vigorously exert the Faculties of our Nature,
we not only may, but shall escape. There
are indeed a <hi>great</hi> many Causes of our
Danger, a <hi>great</hi> many Enemies concurring
to our Ruin, but none of these are able to
effect it, unless we our selves joyn hands
in the <hi>fatal</hi> Conspiracy: If we will be but
<hi>faithful</hi> Friends to our selves and true to our
own <hi>eternal</hi> Interest, it will be beyond the
power of all those Causes together to do us
any <hi>material</hi> Injury. For <hi>blessed</hi> be the <hi>good

               </gap>ed with the most <hi>invincible</hi>
Motives; with <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> Promises,
that stand beckoning to us with Crowns of
Immortality in their hands, to call us <hi>off</hi>
from the Pursuit of our Lusts to the Practice
of Virtue and Religion; with <hi>direful</hi> Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
that are continually Alarming and
warning us of the <hi>dreadful</hi> Consequents of
our Sins; and sundry other such <hi>mighty,</hi> I
had almost said <hi>Almighty</hi> Motives, as, if we
would seriously attend to, would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
render our Souls <hi>impregnable</hi> against all
the Temptations of Vice. And besides our
Reason thus Armed and Accoutered, we
have on our side the <hi>Holy</hi> Angels of <hi>God,</hi>
who are always ready to prompt us to, and
assist us in our Duty, and to <hi>second</hi> us in all
our <hi>spiritual</hi> Combats against the Enemies of
our Souls. And besides all these we have
with us the <hi>Almighty Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our <hi>sincere</hi> Desires and <hi>honest</hi> Endeavours
is engaged to aid us, and <hi>co-operate</hi> with us
in working out our Salvation; whose Grace
is abundantly <hi>sufficient</hi> for us, to strengthen
us in our Weakness, to support us under
our <hi>greatest</hi> Difficulties, and carry us on vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoriously
through the most <hi>violent</hi> Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63657:48"/>
And being back't with such <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
Auxiliaries, how is it <hi>possible</hi> that we should
miscarry, unless we are resolved to betray
<hi>our selves,</hi> and give fire to the <hi>fatal</hi> Trains
of our Enemies; and if we are so bent there
is no Remedy for our Obstinacy, and it is
<hi>just</hi> and <hi>sit</hi> we should be left to the <hi>dismal</hi>
and <hi>pitiless</hi> Effects of <hi>our own</hi> Folly and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
For if, when we see our selves in so
much danger, and it is yet in our Power to
escape if we please, we will notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>precipitate</hi> our selves into Ruin; all the
World must agree upon an <hi>impartial</hi> Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
for the Blood of our Souls, that we
<hi>murdered</hi> our selves, that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>just,</hi> and that
his hands are <hi>clean</hi> from any stain of our
Blood, and that <hi>our own</hi> Ruin is wholly ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our own <hi>invincible</hi> Obstinacy.</p>
            <p>III. I proceed now to the <hi>Third</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
<hi>That our renouncing of Christ, and his
Religion will most certainly infer the loss of our
Souls.</hi> For, as I have shewed you, these
Words are urged by our <hi>Saviour</hi> as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to deter his Disciples from forsaking
him, as is plain from <hi>Ver.</hi> 24, 25. which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
supposes that upon their forsaking
him this Loss would most certainly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably
follow. In the Prosecution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of this Argument I shall endeavour these
<hi>two</hi> things.

1. To shew you what that forsaking of
Christ is, which Infers this Loss.</p>
            <p>2. Upon what Accounts our thus forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him infers it.</p>
            <p>1. What that forsaking of <hi>Christ</hi> is, which
infers this Loss. To which I answer, there
is a <hi>Four-fold Forsaking of Christ,</hi> which the
<hi>Scripture</hi> takes notice of as <hi>capital</hi> and <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi>
to the Souls of Men.</p>
            <p>1. When we <hi>forsake</hi> him by a <hi>total</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> When we cowardly <hi>renounce</hi> the
Profession of his Doctrine, or any Part of
it, notwithstanding we still belive and are
convinced of the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>3. When by <hi>obstinate</hi> Heresy we either
add to, or subtract from the Faith of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> When by any <hi>wilful</hi> Course of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
we do vertually <hi>renounce</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of his Laws.</p>
            <p>1. We lose and forfeit our Souls, when
we forsake Christ by a <hi>total</hi> Apostacy from
him: When after we have been Baptized
into his Name, and thereby have made a
<hi>visible</hi> Profession of our believing his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and obeying his Laws, we turn
Runagadoes, and cast <hi>off</hi> our Belief of the
<hi>one,</hi> and disown our Obligation to the <hi>other;</hi>
we do most justly incur the Loss and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of our Souls. For so <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:63657:50"/>
is the Evidence of <hi>Christianity,</hi> that it is
not to be supposed that any <hi>professed Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
can be either innocently or excusably se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into a Disbelief of it; For <hi>Religion</hi> being
a Matter of the <hi>vastest</hi> Moment and Concern,
he is a Traytor to himself that either takes up
his <hi>Religion</hi> without Examination, or that
upon Examination refuses to be swayed by
the <hi>strongest</hi> Reason; And I am sure it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi>
for any <hi>Christian</hi> to turn <hi>Infidel</hi> that
is but so <hi>honest</hi> to himself as <hi>first</hi> to examine
carefully the Reasons of his Faith, and then
to resolve sincerely not to reject it till bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Reasons appear to the contrary; But if
either through their <hi>wilful</hi> Ignorance of the
Evidence of <hi>Christianity,</hi> or <hi>vicious</hi> Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
against the Purity of it, they suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be seduced into <hi>Apostacy,</hi> they are
<hi>false</hi> Traytors to themselves, and as such are
justly <hi>liable</hi> to all those <hi>eternal</hi> Damages they
expose themselves to. And hence it is said
of those that <hi>draw-back,</hi> that is, <hi>apostatize</hi> from
<hi>Christianity,</hi> not only that God's Soul shall
have <hi>no pleasure in them,</hi> but also that they
<hi>draw back to perdition,</hi> Heb. 10. 38, 39. and
2 Pet. 2. 20. It is said of those <hi>Apostates,</hi> that
<hi>their later end is worse than the beginning; and
that it had been better for them not to have
known the way of Righteousness, than after they
have known it, to turn from the holy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:63657:51"/>
which implies that <hi>Apostates</hi> from
<hi>Christianity</hi> do not only forfeit their Souls,
but that without Repentance they will be
<hi>for ever</hi> forfeited to the most <hi>wretched</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
even to the <hi>nethermost</hi> Degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> We lose our Souls when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
we do still believe, and are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of the Truth of Christ's Doctrine, we
do cowardly <hi>renounce</hi> the Profession of it,
or of any Part of it. For when once we
have received the Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> we are
thereby obliged not to renounce the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of it whatsoever Hazard it may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
us to, our <hi>blessed Lord</hi> having assured
us that if we <hi>deny him before Men, he will also
deny us before his Father which is in Heaven,</hi>
Mat. 10. 33. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> also having warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us, <hi>that if we deny Christ, he will also deny
us,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 12. That is, that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and abandon us before God and Angels
to <hi>everlasting</hi> Misery and Damnation; for
so St. <hi>Iohn</hi> assures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 8. that the <hi>fearful</hi>
and <hi>unbelieving, i. e.</hi> the <hi>faint-hearted</hi> Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
that for fear of Persecution renounce
the Profession of the Gospel, <hi>shall have their
part in the lake which burneth with sire and
brimstone.</hi> Not that in Times of Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
we are always bound to make an <hi>actual</hi>
Profession and Publication of our Faith, to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63657:51"/>
run to the Tribunals of our Persecutors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are sent for, and accuse our selves
of those Doctrines for which we are Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted;
but whenever we are <hi>apprehended,
accused,</hi> and <hi>examined</hi> by them, either upon
knowledge or suspicion, we are bound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Penalty of <hi>forfeiting</hi> our Souls to <hi>own</hi>
and <hi>confess</hi> our Faith, and not to deny any
Doctrine or Article of it, whatsoever the
Consequence may be. For in this Case to
deny our Belief is not only a <hi>wilful</hi> Lye,
which is in it self a <hi>damnable</hi> Crime, but
an Act of <hi>High-Treason</hi> against our <hi>Lord</hi> and
<hi>Saviour;</hi> for by renouncing any Doctrine
which he hath revealed and committed to
us, we do not only betray his Trust, but
blaspheme his Veracity; to deny what we
believe he hath revealed being in effect to
declare him a Cheat and an Impostor. And
having thus incurred the Guilt of so <hi>black</hi> a
Treason against our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and wilfully
persisting in it, what can we expect the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
of it should be, but the <hi>eternal</hi> Loss
and Perdition of our Souls?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> We forsake <hi>Christ</hi> to the Loss and
Forfeiture of our Souls, when by <hi>obstinate</hi>
Heresy we add to, or subtract from that
<hi>Heavenly</hi> Doctrine which he hath revealed
to us. By <hi>Heresy</hi> I do not mean barely a
<hi>false</hi> Opinion in our <hi>Religion,</hi> whether it be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63657:52"/>
of <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>lesser</hi> Moment; for I doubt
not but the same Error may be an <hi>innocent</hi>
Mistake in <hi>one</hi> Man, and a <hi>damnable</hi> Heresy
in <hi>another;</hi> that in the <hi>one</hi> it may be the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of a <hi>weak</hi> Understanding, but in the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
of a <hi>perverse</hi> and <hi>obstinate</hi> Will; and
when the Understanding misleads the Will
it is Weakness, but when the Will misleads
the Understanding it is Wickedness. For
<hi>simple</hi> Error is only a defect of Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which in a <hi>fallible</hi> Creature is every
whit as <hi>inculpable</hi> as Sickness in a <hi>mortal one;</hi>
but Heresy is a Fault of the Will, which is
the only Subject of Vertue and Vice. When
therefore by the <hi>wicked</hi> Prejudice of our <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi>
Wills against the Purity of <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
our Understanding is betrayed into <hi>loose</hi>
and <hi>erroneous</hi> Principles; when we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by our <hi>vicious</hi> Affections, and adapt
our Opinions to the Interests of our Lusts;
when we believe for the sake of any <hi>darling</hi>
Vice, and suffer <hi>our own factious, covetous,</hi>
and <hi>extravagant</hi> Passions either to tempt us
to profess those <hi>erroneous</hi> Opinions which we
do not believe, or to prejudice us into a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of them; then is our Error no longer
to be attributed to the Weakness of our
Understanding, but to the Wickedness of
our Wills which Improves our Error into
a <hi>damnable</hi> Heresy. For he would be a <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:63657:52"/>
Man, though he were not an Heretick,
that harbours those <hi>sinful</hi> Lusts which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
him into Heresy; but by being an
Heretick he is much more <hi>wicked,</hi> because
now he is <hi>wicked</hi> under a Pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and cloaks his Impieties with the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Righteousness. And what <hi>greater</hi>
Prophaness can any Man be guilty of, than to
make his <hi>Religion</hi> a Baud to procure for his
Lusts? So that if out of a <hi>vicious</hi> Propensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Will we obstinately persist in any <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi>
Errors, we are not only guilty of
that <hi>wicked</hi> Propension which is of it self
<hi>sufficient</hi> to ruin our Souls; but we are also
<hi>accountable</hi> for <hi>vitiating</hi> our <hi>Religion</hi> with
those <hi>erroneous</hi> Mixtures by which we have
rendered it a Shelter and Protection to our
Lust. And what the Consequence of this
will be St. <hi>Iude</hi> will inform us, who speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>certain</hi> Hereticks, who to gratifie
their own <hi>wicked</hi> Inclinations, had <hi>sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
Christianity</hi> with sundry <hi>black</hi> and <hi>poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous</hi>
Principles, pronounces this <hi>fearful</hi>
Doom on them; <hi>for whom is reserved the
blackness of darkness for ever,</hi> ver. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> And lastly, We forsake <hi>Christ</hi> to the
Loss and Forfeiture of our Souls, when by
any <hi>wilful</hi> Course of Disobedience we do
virtually renounce the Authority of his
Laws. For whilst we continue in any
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63657:53"/>
Course of <hi>wilful</hi> Sin, we live in an <hi>open</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and do by our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
declare that we will not have him to
Reign over us. And accordingly <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16.
the <hi>abominable</hi> and <hi>disobedient</hi> are said to <hi>deny
God in their works,</hi> even while they profess
<hi>to know him;</hi> and what the Fate of such will
be, St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath forewarned us, <hi>Rom. 2.
8, 9. But unto them that are contentious, and
do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness;
indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish
upon every Soul of Man that doth evil, of the
Iew first, and also of the Gentile.</hi> And the
same <hi>Apostle</hi> speaking of these <hi>obstinate</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
who live and persist in an <hi>open</hi> Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
to our Saviour's Authority, tells us
that <hi>they shall be punished with everlasting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
from the presence of the Lord,</hi> 2 Thes.
1. 8, 9. But before we dismiss this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it will be requisite more particularly
to explain what those <hi>wilful</hi> Courses of Sin
are by which they thus renounce him; all
which may be reduced to these <hi>three</hi> Heads.
<hi>First,</hi> We renounce the Authority of his
Laws, when we sin against him out of <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Ignorance of them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> When we
sin on against him out of <hi>wilful</hi> Inconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of our Obligation to them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
When we persist in our sin against Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:63657:53"/>
1. We vertually renounce the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> when we sin on against
him out of <hi>wilful</hi> Ignorance of his Laws.
For the Laws of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> in which the
great Lines of our Duty are described, are
so <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>legible,</hi> that no man can be long
excusably <hi>ignorant</hi> of them. But if our Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
proceed either <hi>first</hi> from a <hi>profane</hi>
and <hi>profligate</hi> Mind that is altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardless
of <hi>God,</hi> and hath utterly worn <hi>off</hi>
its <hi>natural</hi> sense of Religion, and so neither
heeds it nor concerns it self about it, but
is become quite <hi>deaf</hi> to all the Means of
Instruction; or if it proceed, <hi>Secondly,</hi> from
the <hi>vicious</hi> Prejudice of our Wills, and we
Industriously set our selves, for the sake
of some <hi>darling</hi> Lust, to exclude from our
Minds all the Means of Conviction; and
either studiously to avoid all thoughts of
<hi>Religion,</hi> that so we may sin on without
disturbance, which is the way of those that
are openly <hi>Profane</hi> and <hi>Irreligious;</hi> or to
use all <hi>possible</hi> Arts to wheedle our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings
into the Belief of such Principles
as are most <hi>indulgent</hi> to our Lusts, which
is the way of <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>false Pretenders</hi>
to <hi>Religion:</hi> If, I say, our Ignorance of
Christ's Laws proceeds from either of these
Causes, it will no more excuse our falling
into sin, than the want of Light will a man's
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63657:54"/>
falling into a Ditch that shuts his Eyes at
Noon, and winks on purpose lest he should
see, and escape the Danger that is before him.
But then</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> We vertually renounce the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> when we sin on against
him out of a <hi>wilful</hi> Inconsideration of our
Obligations to obey him. For we being <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>
Creatures, are bound by the very
Constitution of our Natures to act consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratlely
especially in matters of <hi>Religion</hi>
which are of the <hi>greatest</hi> Moment and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to us; so that if we miscarry here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
through <hi>wilful</hi> Inconsideration, we are
every whit as <hi>inexcusable</hi> as if we had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderately
betrayed our selves. Now <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Inconsideration is either <hi>actual</hi> or <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual;
Actual,</hi> is either, <hi>first</hi> when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
we have been sufficiently warned
by <hi>precedent</hi> Surprizes, we take no care for
the <hi>future;</hi> for though it cannot be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
we should always keep so <hi>strict</hi> a Guard
upon our selves, as never to be surprized
by an Enemy; yet when we have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
there is all the Reason in the World
we should take warning by it, and grow
more <hi>wary</hi> and <hi>vigilant</hi> for the future; that
we should awaken in our Minds such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
as are <hi>necessary</hi> to prevent our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
surpized again, which if we do not, our
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63657:54"/>
               <hi>next</hi> Surprize will be <hi>inexcusable.</hi> And if
the sense of the <hi>Lapse</hi> which was perhaps but
an <hi>innocent</hi> Error, or at most but a Sin of
Infirmity, doth not make us more <hi>careful</hi>
of our selves for the future; the <hi>next</hi>
will be a <hi>wilful</hi> Fall: Or else in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Place, this <hi>actual wilful</hi> Inconsiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, when upon the <hi>presenting</hi> of any <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved</hi>
Temptation we either quench the
<hi>good</hi> Motions of our Minds, and refuse to
consider the Evil and Danger of the Sin we
are tempted to, lest we should be thereby
deterred from committing it; or purposely
contrive to baffle <hi>our own</hi> Consideration by
opposing it either with some <hi>ungrounded</hi>
Hope of Impunity, or some <hi>fallacious</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of <hi>future</hi> Amendment; and if to make
way for our sin, we do either of these ways
wilfully drive all good thoughts from our
Minds lest they should disturb and interrupt
us in the Injoyment of it, our Inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to be resolved into the Wickedness of
our Wills, and not into the Weakness and
Infirmity of our Natures. And he that will
not consider because he will sin, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
extenuate his sin by his Inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
urges <hi>one</hi> sin in excuse for another, and
makes that which is his Fault, his Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.
Whensoever therefore we sin out of
any <hi>actual</hi> and <hi>wilful</hi> Inconsideration, we
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63657:55"/>
sin wilfully, and consequently do thereby
vertually renounce the Authority of our
<hi>Saviour;</hi> the <hi>final</hi> Event of which, without
our Repentance, will be our <hi>everlasting</hi> Ruin
and Perdition. But then besides this <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
there is also an <hi>habitual</hi> Inconsideration,
which is <hi>wilful;</hi> and that is, when by often
stifling the Convictions of our Consciences
we have seared them into a <hi>deep</hi> Insensibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> so as that now we sin
on without any Remorse or Reluctancy, and
return to our Lusts with the same indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency
as we do to our Beds or our Tables,
without either considering what we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or reflecting on what we have done;
And this is so far from palliating our sin,
that it is one of the <hi>highest</hi> Aggravations of
it: For as it is no excuse that we sin out of
an <hi>evil</hi> Habit which we voluntarily contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by <hi>frequent</hi> Acts of sin, so neither will
it at all excuse us that we sin out of an <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual</hi>
Inconsideration which we <hi>wilfully</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by often refusing to consider. But
as <hi>vicious</hi> Habits have a <hi>proper</hi> Evil and
Guiltiness in them <hi>distinct</hi> from those <hi>vicious</hi>
Acts that produced them; so <hi>habitual</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideration
hath in it a <hi>peculiar</hi> Venom of
its own beyond what was in those <hi>actual</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerations
whereby it was acquired. And
accordingly it is described in the <hi>Scripture</hi> as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63657:55"/>
the <hi>worst,</hi> the most <hi>desperate</hi> and <hi>incurable</hi> state
of a Sinner: It is called a <hi>reprobate-Mind,</hi> Rom.
1. 28, 29. <hi>a seared Conscience,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 2. <hi>a hard
and unrelenting heart that treasureth up wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the day of wrath,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. So that if we
go on in sin without considering, with a Mind
habitually <hi>regardless</hi> &amp; <hi>insensible,</hi> we are <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
and <hi>inveterate</hi> Rebels, that have not only
renounced the Authority of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> but
have also forfeited our Selves, and that almost
irreparably against all his Methods of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
and subduing us. But then</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> And Lastly, We vertually renounce the
Authority of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> when we persist in
our sin against <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Consideration.</hi>
For to sin on obstinately against <hi>Knowledge</hi> &amp;
<hi>Consideration,</hi> argues an <hi>invincible</hi> Malice of
Will; for tho the Condition of the <hi>ignorant</hi>
and <hi>inconsiderate</hi> Sinner be very <hi>sad</hi> and <hi>deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi>
yet there is much more Hope of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath never yet the Force &amp; Efficacy
of <hi>Knowledge</hi> &amp; <hi>Consideration,</hi> which perhaps,
if ever he be brought to experience, may <hi>prove</hi>
a <hi>succesful</hi> Means of his Cure and Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But the <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>considerate</hi> Sinner hath
tryed and conquered the Remedy, hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimented
the only means of his Cure, and
yet it grows <hi>worse</hi> and <hi>worse</hi> under the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
he knows what his sin is, and considers
the Consequence of it, and yet sins on; which
argues a <hi>desperate</hi> Resolution of Will in him
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63657:56"/>
thus to run himself upon a <hi>foreseen</hi> Ruin, and
leap into <hi>Hell</hi> with his Eyes open. And
what Hope is there of dissuading <hi>him</hi> from
his sin, that knows and considers the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against it, and yet every day breaks
through them all at the Call of every <hi>sinful</hi>
Temptation? And as his Condition is most
<hi>desperate,</hi> so his Soul is most <hi>guilty</hi> and <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal;</hi>
for every Act of his sin is an <hi>open</hi>
Defiance to the Authority of <hi>God</hi> and his
<hi>Saviour;</hi> his Rebellion is <hi>barefac'd,</hi> and hath
no manner of Pretence wherein to mask or
disguise it self; and he knows and owns
himself to be in a Rebellion, and yet perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veres
in it, which extreamly aggravates and
inhanses the Guilt of it. For the <hi>Sinfulness</hi>
and <hi>Immorality</hi> of Actions is to be measured
by the Degrees of Will that are in them,
and the Degrees of Will in them are <hi>more</hi>
or <hi>less</hi> proportionably, as the Nature and
Evil of them is <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> known and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.
Hence is that of St. <hi>Iames 4. 17.
To him that knoweth to do good, and doth it
not, to him it is sin.</hi> Had he not known the
Nature of his Action, the Weakness of his
Understanding would have excused the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of his Will, and render'd it <hi>pardonable</hi>
at least, if not altogether <hi>innocent:</hi> But
when his Understanding hath discharged
its Office, and shewed him the Evil that he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63657:56"/>
ought to avoid, <hi>that</hi> hath fairly acquitted
its self, and can stand no longer <hi>chargable</hi>
for his Miscarriages: So that now the Man
chooses at his own Peril, and if he still choose
what he ought to avoid, his Understanding
is <hi>clear,</hi> and his Will alone is <hi>Culpable.</hi> And
when our Rebellion against our <hi>Saviour</hi> is
not only <hi>wilful,</hi> but the <hi>wilfulness</hi> of it is so
extreamly <hi>aggravated</hi> by our Knowledge
and Consideration, what the Consequen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
of it will be that <hi>fearful</hi> Passage will assure
us, <hi>Luke 12. 47. The Servant that knoweth
his Masters will and doth it not, shall be beaten
with many Stripes.</hi> And thus I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to represent to you what that Forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ is, which exposes us to the
Hazard of losing our Souls.</p>
            <p>II. I proceed in the <hi>next</hi> Place to shew
you upon what Accounts it is that our <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
of Christ</hi> infers this <hi>fearful</hi> Loss; of
which, I shall Briefly give you this <hi>four-fold</hi>
Account.</p>
            <p>1. Our thus <hi>forsaking of Christ</hi> infers the
Loss of our Souls, as it is a most <hi>inexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Contempt of the <hi>greatest</hi> Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> As it renders us the most <hi>unsitting</hi>
Objects of Mercy for the future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> As it is an <hi>open</hi> Violation of the <hi>fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
and <hi>stated</hi> Condition of Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> As it is an <hi>utter</hi> Rejection of our <hi>last</hi>
Remedy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:63657:57"/>
1. Our forsaking of Christ by any of the <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed</hi>
Instances infers the <hi>everlasting</hi> Loss
of our Souls, as it is a most <hi>inexcusable</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the <hi>greatest</hi> Mercy. For when
the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> came down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> he
brought from thence with him the <hi>largest</hi>
Offers of Mercy that <hi>Heaven</hi> it self could
make to a <hi>sinful</hi> World; he did not only
bring down with him a Grant of <hi>universal</hi>
Pardon and Indemnity under the <hi>Broad-Seal</hi>
of <hi>Heaven</hi> for every Sinner that would lay
down his Arms, and return to his Allegiance,
together with the most <hi>endearing</hi> Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>woo</hi> and <hi>win</hi>
us to accept it; but he also brought along
with him all that an <hi>everlasting</hi> Heaven
means, Crowns of <hi>Immortal</hi> Glory and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to encourage us to, and reward our
Acceptance of them. And what greater
Mercy could the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
to us, than to send down his <hi>blessed
Son,</hi> not only to tender to us an Indemnity,
but also to invite us to accept it with a
Promise of Heaven? So that if now we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
him, now he is come to us with such
<hi>vast</hi> and <hi>endearing</hi> Proposals, what an <hi>into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable</hi>
slight will it be to the tender Mercies
of <hi>God?</hi> When we shall declare by our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
that we will not exchange the sordid
Pleasures of our Lust for the Pardon of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:63657:57"/>
for the Favour of <hi>God,</hi> and for all the
Hopes of a <hi>glorious</hi> Immortality? How can
we expect any <hi>farther</hi> Relief from God's
Mercy, after we have put such an <hi>intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Affront upon it by preferring such an
<hi>unworthy</hi> Rival before it? When <hi>God</hi> hath
laid his Pardon, his Love, and his <hi>Heaven</hi>
in our Way to stop us in our <hi>sinful</hi> Courses,
what a <hi>barbarous</hi> Indignity will it be to
trample upon them all, and run over them
into Hell? With what Face can we hope
for any <hi>farther</hi> kindness from <hi>Heaven,</hi> after
we have treated its Kindness with so much
Rudeness and Contempt? Certainly for
<hi>sinful</hi> Men to reject and run away from their
<hi>Saviour,</hi> when he comes to them with so
much Kindness, when he courts them with
such <hi>astonishing</hi> Expressions of Mercy, is a
Provocation <hi>sufficient</hi> to incense an <hi>infinite</hi>
Goodness, and turn the <hi>tenderest</hi> Mercy into
an <hi>implacable</hi> Fury. And when <hi>infinite</hi> Love
is so infinitely provoked, what less Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can it claim and exact, than the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi>
Ruin and Perdition of our Souls?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> Our <hi>Forsaking of Christ</hi> infers the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi>
Loss of our Souls, as it renders us the
most <hi>incapable</hi> Objects of Mercy for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For when once we are arrived to that
Height of Wickedness as finally to reject
<hi>Christ,</hi> and the Mercies of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> there
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63657:58"/>
is no farther Mercy that we are <hi>capable</hi> of;
if after this God should be so <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>
as to pardon us, alas! what would it
signify? for we should still be <hi>wretched</hi> and
<hi>miserable</hi> in Despight of his Pardon; and that
<hi>wicked</hi> Temper of Mind which made us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
our <hi>Saviour,</hi> would be an <hi>everlasting</hi>
Hell to us though it should indemnify us.
What will a Pardon avail a Man that is dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Strangury?</hi> he can but
die if he be not pardoned, and die he must
though he be. And as <hi>little</hi> Advantage it
would be to a <hi>wicked</hi> Soul to be pardoned
and absolved by <hi>God,</hi> while she hath a
Disease within her that preys upon her Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
and hastens her to a <hi>certain</hi> Ruin. She
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould have been but <hi>miserable</hi> in the <hi>future</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>fe if she had not been pardoned, and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable</hi>
she must be if she continues <hi>wicked,</hi>
whether she be pardoned or no; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an <hi>everlasting Hell</hi> in the very Nature
of Wickedness, which no <hi>outward</hi> Act of
Pardon can quench or extinguish. Nay,
if after our rejecting <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Mercies
of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> God should not only pardon
but admit us into <hi>Heaven,</hi> and indulge us
the <hi>free</hi> Enjoyment of all its Pleasures and
Felicities; yet that <hi>vicious</hi> Temper of Mind
which finally <hi>seduced</hi> us from our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
would render us for ever <hi>incapable</hi> of relish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63657:58"/>
the Joys of it. Those Rivers of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi>
Pleasure would never agree with the
<hi>hellish</hi> Temper of our Minds, which, like a
<hi>feverish</hi> Tongue, would utterly disgust their
<hi>delicious</hi> Streams by Reason of its own <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lowing</hi>
Gall. So that after we have finally
rejected our Saviour, we are neither <hi>capable</hi>
of being indemnifyed from <hi>Hell,</hi> nor of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
<hi>Heaven;</hi> and having cast our selves
beyond the Reach of all Mercy into a State
wherein we can neither begin to be <hi>happy,</hi>
nor cease to be <hi>miserable,</hi> our Case is <hi>desperate,</hi>
and there is no Remedy but our Souls must
be lost and undone <hi>for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> Our forsaking of <hi>Christ</hi> infers the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi>
Loss of our Souls, as it is an <hi>open</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation
of the <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>stated</hi> Condition of
Mercy. The <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>immoveable</hi> Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Mercy of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is, that we
should constantly adhere to our <hi>Saviour</hi> by
a <hi>true</hi> Faith and a <hi>sincere</hi> Obedience, and
that whenever we fall <hi>off</hi> from him either
into Infidelity, or Heresy, or Disobedience,
we should remember from whence we are
fallen, and return again to him by a <hi>deep</hi>
and <hi>serious</hi> Repentance. And indeed this
Condition is so <hi>low</hi> and <hi>condescending,</hi> that it
was <hi>impossible</hi> for the <hi>wise</hi> God and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the World, to propose his Mercy to
us at a <hi>lower</hi> or <hi>easier</hi> Rate; and if God should
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63657:59"/>
have asked our Consent upon what Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he should propose to us the Mercies of
his <hi>Gospel,</hi> this would have been the <hi>utmost</hi>
Favour that we could in Modesty have cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of him, that he would be so gracious as
to accept our <hi>unfeigned</hi> Faith and <hi>sincere</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
and that whenever we fall off ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other,</hi> he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
us to Repentance, and receive us again
upon our Return and Amendment. And
should he have proposed his Mercy to us
upon any <hi>lower</hi> Terms, he must of Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
have let go the Reins of his Government,
and given us a <hi>free</hi> Toleration for all manner
of Wickedness. Had the Condition of his
Mercy been but one step <hi>lower</hi> than Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
it had totally dissolved the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Laws, and reduced the <hi>humane</hi>
World into a <hi>perfect Anarchy.</hi> For should
he have prostituted his Mercy to <hi>impenitent</hi>
Sinners, he must have made it a Refuge for
<hi>obstinate</hi> Rebels to fly to, and shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the Reach of his Authority;
and how <hi>inconsistent</hi> would this have been
with the Wisdom of his Government? This
therefore being the <hi>lowest</hi> Condition upon
which the <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>holy God</hi> can propose his
Mercy to us, there is no Ground to hope
that after we have rejected <hi>this,</hi> and are
finally fallen <hi>off</hi> from it, he will make any
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63657:59"/>
               <hi>new</hi> Proposal to us. For he hath yielded as
much already to the Weakness and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of our Natures, as he could possibly
do with safety to his Government; and if
this will not suffice, we may depend upon
it that he will rather consent to sacrifice our
Souls to his <hi>righteous</hi> Vengeance, than his <hi>own</hi>
Authority to our <hi>obstinate</hi> Wills. So that
when once we have finally rejected our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
and shaken hands <hi>for ever</hi> with Faith
and Obedience, and Repentance too, we
are quite beyond the Reach of any <hi>wise</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
and then how <hi>deplorable</hi> must our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
be, when Things are reduced to this
<hi>desperate</hi> Issue, That God must either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to be foolishly <hi>merciful</hi> to us, or to
abandon our Souls to <hi>everlasting</hi> Perdition?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> And lastly, Our <hi>forsaking of Christ</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
the <hi>everlasting</hi> Loss of our Souls, as it is
an <hi>utter</hi> Rejection of our <hi>last</hi> Remedy. For
the <hi>last</hi> Remedy which <hi>God</hi> hath prepared
for Mankind to heal the Malignity of their
Natures, and recover them from <hi>eternal</hi>
Misery, is the <hi>meritorious</hi> Death and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of his <hi>blessed Son,</hi> who voluntarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
to be the <hi>Attorney-General,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Representative</hi> of <hi>sinful</hi> Men, suffered
Death in our stead as a <hi>vicarious</hi> Mulct and
Punishment for our Sins; upon which the
most <hi>merciful</hi> Father hath granted to all <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:63657:60"/>
and <hi>truly penitent</hi> Sinners, a <hi>general</hi>
Indemnity from <hi>eternal</hi> Punishments, to
which they were bound over by their Sins
and Rebellions; by virtue of which Grant
as soon as we believe in <hi>Christ,</hi> and do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
sincerely repent of our Sins, we are
totally absolved from those <hi>everlasting</hi> Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whereunto they have exposed and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
us. And this Sacrifice of <hi>Christ</hi> being
the last Remedy which <hi>God</hi> hath provided
for our <hi>Guilt,</hi> and the Grant of Pardon which
<hi>God</hi> hath made in Consideration of it, being
confined to <hi>believing</hi> and <hi>penitent</hi> Sinners, it
hence necessarily follows, that they who final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
persist in <hi>Vnbelief</hi> or <hi>Impenitency,</hi> do thereby
<hi>for ever</hi> cut themselves off from all Interest
in that Sacrifice; and from all Title to that
Pardon that is granted upon it, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
leave themselves <hi>for ever</hi> destitute
of all Hope of Pardon and Indemnity for
the future. So that by renouncing <hi>Christ</hi>
we do renounce his Sacrifice, which is the
<hi>last</hi> and <hi>only</hi> Remedy we have to depend
upon. Hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. we are told, that
<hi>if we sin wilfully after we have received the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the truth, there remaineth no more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for sin;</hi> that is, if after we have been
baptized, and initiated into <hi>Christianity,</hi> we
relapse into Infidelity or <hi>wilful</hi> Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
we do thereby forfeit our Interest in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63657:60"/>
Christ's Sacrifice; and when we have once
rejected our Interest in that, there remains
no other Sacrifice for Sin, <hi>i.e.</hi> no other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
upon which <hi>God</hi> will pardon and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnify
us. So that now all that remains
to us, is that which follows in the next Verse,
<hi>viz. A certain fearful looking for of judgment,
and fiery indignation, which shall devour the
Adversaries.</hi> For when we have finally
baffled our <hi>last</hi> and <hi>utmost</hi> Remedy, the
Condition of our Souls must needs be <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
and <hi>incurable.</hi> When by our <hi>obstinate</hi>
Unbelief or <hi>final</hi> Impenitence we have <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinned</hi>
the Virtue of our Saviour's Sacrifice,
we are out of the Reach and Compass of
God's Pardon, and so consequently are sunk
beyond all Hopes of Recovery, into <hi>endless</hi>
and <hi>irreversible</hi> Damnation. For now that
<hi>precious</hi> Blood which, if we had believed
and repented, would have spoke <hi>better</hi> things
for us than the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> will rise in
Judgment against us, and, like the Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od
of those Souls that are under the Altar, will
charge and impeach, and be continually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precating
the Vengeance of <hi>Heaven</hi> upon us.
And when that which was prepared for the
<hi>last</hi> and <hi>utmost</hi> Remedy of our Souls shall be
converted into their Bane, and that which
was intended for their Advocate shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their Accuser; when that <hi>vocal</hi> Blood
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63657:61"/>
and those <hi>speaking</hi> Wounds which pleaded
for, shall plead against, and cry out instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for Judgment upon them; what can they
henceforth expect but <hi>everlasting</hi> Ruin and
Destruction?</p>
            <p>What then remains, that since our <hi>forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Christ</hi> will so infallibly infer the Ruin
of our Souls, we all return to, and cleave
<hi>fast</hi> to our <hi>Saviour</hi> in our Belief and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
That we, who are fallen <hi>off</hi> from him
into a Course of <hi>wilful</hi> Sin and Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
immediately return again by a <hi>deep</hi>
and <hi>serious</hi> Repentance. For the Way in
which we are walking leads directly to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;
every Step of it is a Descent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Hell, and next to the <hi>lowermost</hi> is the <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless</hi>
Pit, and for all we know, the very
<hi>last</hi> Step we took brought us to the Brinks
of the flaming Abyss; and if it did, one
Step further will set us beyond all Hope of
Recovery. For in our <hi>sinful</hi> Progress we
are wading forwards in a <hi>shelving Pool,</hi>
which the farther we go, the <hi>deeper</hi> it is,
and so <hi>deeper</hi> and <hi>deeper</hi> till we come to the
Bottom of it; so that at every Step we are
in Danger of going beyond our Depth, and
plunging our selves into an <hi>irrecoverable</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
for we know not how soon we may be
snatched away in our Iniquities; and if it
should so happen, that after we have sinned
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63657:61"/>
               <hi>this</hi> Moment, we should die the next, this
will determin our <hi>everlasting</hi> Fate, and sink
us into <hi>eternal</hi> Misery.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as we tender the safety of our
<hi>precious</hi> Souls, let us speedily forsake this <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi>
Road in which Perdition <hi>way-lays,</hi> and
<hi>Hell</hi> gapes to devour us every step we go;
and return unto our Lord in whom our safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
lyes. As yet the Opportunity of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is in our Hands, but before to morrow
Morning it may slip away from between
our Fingers, and vanish <hi>for ever,</hi> and we
that are <hi>this</hi> day wallowing in our Sins, may
before the <hi>next</hi> be roaring in <hi>Hell.</hi> So that
while we defer and put <hi>off</hi> our Repentance
from day to day, we do as it were cast Lots
for our Souls, and venture our <hi>everlasting</hi>
Hopes upon a Contingency, that is not in
our Power to dispose of. As yet the Gate
of Mercy is open to us, and our <hi>blessed Lord</hi>
stands ready with his Arms <hi>out-stretched</hi> to
welcome and receive us; but for all we
know if we enter not presently, the Gate
may be shut within a <hi>few</hi> Moments, and
then though we knock and cry till our
hearts ake, <hi>Lord, Lord open to us,</hi> we shall
receive no <hi>other</hi> Answer, but <hi>Depart from me
I know you not. O good God,</hi> how are we
besotted then, that rather than begin our
Repentance <hi>to day</hi> we will wilfully run the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63657:62"/>
Hazard of being eternally <hi>miserable</hi> before
to <hi>morrow Morning!</hi> For if this should be
the <hi>Evening</hi> of our day of Tryal, as for all
we know it may, our <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi>
depends upon what we are now doing; and
therefore one would think it should highly
concern us wisely to manage this last stake,
the <hi>winning</hi> or <hi>losing</hi> whereof may prove our
<hi>making</hi> or <hi>undoing.</hi> In pity therefore to our
<hi>perishing</hi> Souls let us return to our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
before it be <hi>too late,</hi> before our <hi>Feet stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
on the dark Mountains,</hi> and we fall down
into <hi>everlasting</hi> Darkness. And being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
and reunited to him, let us have a
Care we do not revolt again; for if we
draw back we cancel our Repentance, and
forfeit all its <hi>blessed</hi> Fruits and Benefits; and
unless we stedfastly persevere and hold out
to the end, all the Pains we have taken in
our Christian Course will be <hi>for ever</hi> lost,
and the Remembrance of it will only admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
to our <hi>future</hi> Misery. For how will
it vex us in the <hi>other</hi> World to consider the
Labour it cost us to take <hi>Heaven</hi> by storm?
How vigorously we strove to mount the
<hi>Scaling Ladder,</hi> through how many Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
we had forced our way to that
height of Vertue and Religion we were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to, and then when we are got as it
were to the <hi>topmost</hi> Rounds, and had laid
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63657:62"/>
our Hands upon the Battlements of <hi>Heaven,</hi>
just ready to leap in and take possession of
all its Joys; how basely we let go our Hold,
and so tumbled down from that <hi>stupendious</hi>
height into the <hi>bottomless</hi> Abyss of <hi>endless</hi>
Misery? Doubtless this Consideration must
necessarily sting our <hi>woful</hi> Souls hereafter,
and <hi>for ever</hi> inrage them against themselves.
Wherefore as we value the Safety of our
<hi>precious</hi> Souls, let us, who by our <hi>wilful</hi>
Rebellions have gone astray, return, and
constantly adhere to our <hi>blessed Saviour.</hi>
Alas, where can we be <hi>happier</hi> than in his
Service, who imposeth nothing on us but
what contributes to our Welfare? Where
can we be <hi>safer</hi> than in his Arms, and under
his Protection, who hath the Command
and Disposal of all Events, and to whom all
Power is given in <hi>Heaven</hi> and Earth? Where
can we be placed more to <hi>our own</hi> Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
than under his Guidance and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
who never permits any to serve him
for nought, but hath engaged himself to
recompence our Labour with a Crown of
Glory that fades not away? And is it not
<hi>strange</hi> that after so many <hi>advantagious</hi> Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
we should need to be <hi>scared</hi> to our
Duty? that after our <hi>blessed Master</hi> hath
enjoyned us such a <hi>reasonable, gentle,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<hi>beneficial</hi> Service, he should be forced
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63657:63"/>
to terrify us into it with the Flames of
Hell?</p>
            <p>IV. I proceed now to the <hi>Fourth</hi> Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>That when the Soul is lost, 'tis lost irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably;</hi>
where the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which we render <hi>Exchange,</hi> is used in the
<hi>same</hi> sense with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which signifies a
Price of Redemption, denoting that when
once a Man hath sold his Soul to Perdition,
it is <hi>unredeemable,</hi> and that no Price will be
accepted for its Ransom and Deliverance;
when a Man's Soul is in <hi>Hell</hi> under the
wretched Bondage of a <hi>damned</hi> Spirit, how
<hi>little</hi> soever he regards it now, he would
give all the World, if it were in his power,
to be released again; but if he had a <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi>
Worlds it will not do, his Bondage
being such as will admit no Ransom. For
these Words of our <hi>Saviour</hi> seem to have
been a <hi>common Proverb</hi> of the Age he lived
in, and that derived from those words of the
Devil in <hi>Iob, All that a Man hath, will he
give for his Life;</hi> that is, when a Man is
dying, he would willingly part with all to
redeem his Life, but all will not do. Which
<hi>Proverb</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> adapts to his <hi>own</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in which he proceeds from <hi>temporal</hi>
to <hi>eternal</hi> Life: If a Man would give so
much for his <hi>temporal</hi> Life, what would he
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63657:63"/>
not give for his <hi>eternal</hi> one? But as our
<hi>temporal</hi> Life is not to be redeemed, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is our <hi>eternal</hi> one when once it is lost;
for when once our Soul is <hi>lost</hi> or <hi>abandoned</hi>
to the State of the Damned, it is <hi>lost for
ever,</hi> and there is no <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Ransom
that will be accepted of by <hi>God</hi> for its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
thence. In the Prosecution of
which Argument I shall endeavour these
two things:</p>
            <p>1. To shew you that if <hi>God</hi> be so deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
he may, without any Injury either
to his <hi>Iustice</hi> or <hi>Goodness,</hi> detain <hi>lost</hi> Souls in
the Bondage of <hi>Hell for ever,</hi> and absolutely
refuse to accept any Ransom for them.</p>
            <p>2. That he is actually determined so to
do.</p>
            <p>1. That if God be so determined, he may
without any Injury either to his Justice or
Goodness, detain <hi>lost</hi> Souls in the Bondage
of <hi>Hell for ever,</hi> without accepting any Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
for them. And this I doubt not will
plainly appear upon the <hi>due</hi> Consideration of
these <hi>following</hi> Propositions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> That God being the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Being
of the World, hath an <hi>unalienable</hi> Right to
impose Laws upon all <hi>other</hi> Beings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> That having this Right, he may
justly inforce those Laws with whatsoever
Penalties he sees <hi>necessary</hi> or <hi>convenient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:63657:64"/>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> That when those Laws he imposes
are for the <hi>good</hi> of his Subjects, it is not only
<hi>Iustice</hi> but <hi>Goodness</hi> in him to inforce them
with the <hi>severest</hi> Penalty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> That the Penalty of <hi>eternal</hi> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
under Misery, is the <hi>severest</hi> and most
<hi>effectual</hi> Way to inforce those <hi>beneficial</hi> Laws,
and oblige us to the Observance of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> That if <hi>God</hi> think <hi>good</hi> to inforce
his Laws with this Penalty, he hath as much
Right to <hi>exact</hi> it when we disobey, as he had
to <hi>threaten</hi> and <hi>impose</hi> it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly.</hi> That his <hi>actual</hi> exacting of it can no
more impeach his <hi>Goodness,</hi> than his <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
and <hi>denouncing</hi> it.</p>
            <p>1. That God being the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Being
of the World, hath an <hi>unalienable</hi> Right to
impose Laws upon all <hi>other</hi> Beings. For
he being the <hi>greatest</hi> and most <hi>powerful</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
can himself be <hi>subject</hi> to no <hi>other</hi> Law
but only that of his <hi>own</hi> Nature; and his
<hi>Power</hi> being <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>unconfined</hi> as well as
his <hi>Wisdom, Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> doth
sufficiently warrant him to do whatsoever
is <hi>consistent</hi> with them. For to be sure a
Being of infinite Power and Greatness, can
have no Superior, but must be necessarily
exalted above all <hi>other</hi> Authorities by this
<hi>incommunicable</hi> Prerogative of his Nature;
and being raised above all Authorities, he
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63657:64"/>
must have Authority above all, and his <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential</hi>
Dominion having no <hi>other</hi> Law to
bound it, but only that of his own Nature,
he must necessarily have a Right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
whatsoever is <hi>consistent</hi> with his <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Goodness.</hi> His <hi>Will</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being by the <hi>infinite</hi> Pre-eminence of
his Power and Greatness <hi>supreme,</hi> all <hi>other</hi>
Wills are obliged to bow before, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
themselves to its <hi>Sovereign</hi> Authority;
and there is no Law whatsoever but he
may justly impose upon them, provided it
be not <hi>repugnant</hi> to that <hi>supreme</hi> Law that is
founded in his <hi>own</hi> Nature. This therefore
being premised, that God hath a Right as
he is the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Being to give Laws to all
other Beings; it hence follows,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> That he may justly inforce those
Laws with whatsoever Penalties he sees
<hi>necessary</hi> or <hi>convenient.</hi> For Laws without
Penalties are rather Petitions than Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;
and unless they carry force enough
with them to <hi>over-aw</hi> the Subject, and make
themselves obeyed, they want the <hi>formal</hi>
Sanction and Obligation of a Law. To have
a Power therefore of imposing Penalties
must necessarily be <hi>inseparable</hi> from the
Power of making Laws, because they are
the Penalties that make the Laws to oblige,
that give them Power to command, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63657:65"/>
them with an <hi>awful</hi> Authority. And
as the Power of giving Laws supposes the
Power of imposing Penalties, so it supposes
a Power of imposing such Penalties as may
be <hi>sufficient</hi> to incline and aw the Subject
into Obedience, against all Reasons to the
contrary. For unless the Penalty be <hi>great</hi>
enough to <hi>outweigh</hi> all other Considerations,
the Law which it inforces will be extreamly
<hi>defective</hi> in Point of Obligation, and leave
the Subject as much reason to disobey as to
obey. <hi>God</hi> therefore being by his own <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
Right the <hi>Supreme</hi> Lawgiver of the
World, must be supposed to have an <hi>equal</hi>
Right of inforcing his Laws with such Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
as in his own <hi>infinite</hi> Wisdom he shall
think <hi>necessary</hi> to oblige his Creatures to obey
him; and there is no Penalty can be too
<hi>rigorous</hi> or <hi>severe</hi> which is <hi>necessary</hi> to inable
his Laws to oblige and command us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
according as he sees his Subjects <hi>more</hi>
or <hi>less</hi> tempted, or inclined to disobey him,
so he will need <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>less</hi> Penalties to
oblige us to Obedience; and therefore fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
what a <hi>strong</hi> Propensity to Evil
there would be in our Nature, and with
what <hi>importunate</hi> Temptations this would
be excited and wrought upon, he could not
butx foresee that the <hi>severest</hi> Penalties would
be necessary to back and inforce his Laws,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63657:65"/>
and being <hi>necessary</hi> for that end, he must
needs have a Right to impose them, how
<hi>severe</hi> soever they might be; nor is this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
less <hi>good,</hi> than it is <hi>just;</hi> considering,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> That when those Laws he imposes are
for the <hi>good</hi> of his Subjects, it is not only an
Act of Justice in him to impose them with
the <hi>severest</hi> Penalties, but of Goodness. And
this is really the Case as to those Laws
which <hi>God</hi> hath imposed upon us; for the
Matter of them all is something tending to
our good, something or other that is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective</hi>
of our Natures, and conducive to our
Happiness; and being so, the <hi>greater</hi> the
Penalty is which they are backt and inforced
with, the <hi>greater</hi> Demonstration it is of
God's Care and Zeal for our Happiness. For
the End of Penalty is to oblige us to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and when all Obedience is for our
<hi>good,</hi> the more strictly he obliges us to it,
the more he befriends us. When a <hi>distracted</hi>
Man is endeavouring to mischief and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
himself, it is Kindness to bind him
though it be with Chains of Iron. When
therefore <hi>God</hi> found us so <hi>prone</hi> to injure our
selves by <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>mischievous</hi> Actions, it
was Mercy to bind our Hands with his
Threatnings of Punishment; and the <hi>stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
his Bands are, the more they express his
Kindness; because the more they oblige us
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63657:66"/>
to be <hi>kind</hi> to <hi>our selves,</hi> and <hi>true</hi> to <hi>our own</hi>
Interest. And certainly for <hi>God</hi> to lay us
under the <hi>strongest</hi> Obligations to be <hi>happy,</hi>
is so far from being a Blemish to his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that it is a most <hi>glorious</hi> Expression of
it; but if we will be so <hi>obstinate</hi> as to run
into the mouth of those Threatnings which
he hath levelled against us to scare us into
Happiness, it is <hi>just</hi> with him to discharge
them upon us, and make us feel the Effects
of our Folly and Madness. Since therefore
the Reason of the Penalty wherewith <hi>God</hi>
hath inforced his Laws is to oblige us to be
<hi>happy;</hi> and since the <hi>greater</hi> it is, the more
force it must have to oblige us, it hence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follows, that though it be not only
a <hi>great,</hi> but an <hi>eternal</hi> one; yet it is not at
all <hi>inconsistent</hi> with his Goodness; especially
if we consider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> That the Penalty of <hi>eternal</hi> Misery,
as it is the <hi>severest,</hi> so it is the most <hi>effectual</hi>
to inforce those <hi>beneficial</hi> Laws which <hi>God</hi>
hath imposed on us, and to oblige us to the
Observance of them. For to deter us from
Sin, who are so vehemently prone to it, it
was very requisite that the Penalty denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
against it should not only be <hi>great</hi> as to
the Degree, but endless also as to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of it; that so it might cut us <hi>off</hi> from
all pretence of Presumption, and leave us no
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63657:66"/>
ground of Incouragement to be <hi>wicked.</hi> For
we are exceeding <hi>apt</hi> to slight and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
those <hi>Evils</hi> which are proposed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
us from the <hi>Goods</hi> which we vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desire, especially when these <hi>Goods</hi> are
<hi>present</hi> and <hi>sensible,</hi> and those <hi>Evils future</hi>
and <hi>invisible.</hi> For thus we conclude, the
<hi>Good</hi> that is before us we may injoy a great
while; and, which is very considerable, we
may presently enter upon the Possession of
it; but as for the <hi>Evil</hi> that is <hi>consequent</hi> to
it, it may be a long while before it befalls
us; and when it doth, there is this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that it will at <hi>last</hi> have an end; and
therefore let what will follow, let us ever
seize the <hi>present Good,</hi> and make the <hi>best</hi> use
we can of it; and as for the <hi>future Evil,</hi>
whenever it happens, the Prospect of its
End, though it be never so <hi>remote,</hi> will
enable us to bear it more chearfully. For
<hi>ten</hi> Years <hi>present</hi> Pleasure vehemently desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
will far more effectually persuade us,
than a <hi>future</hi> Misery of <hi>double</hi> the Duration;
and therefore if the <hi>future</hi> Penalty denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
against our Sin were <hi>finite</hi> and <hi>tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
it would not be <hi>sufficient</hi> to ballance
those <hi>present</hi> Pleasures with which we are
continually importuned and sollicited; for
the Penalty being proposed to deter us from
Pleasures which we dearly love, we are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63657:67"/>
on that account inclined to make as <hi>light</hi> of
it as may be, and to flatter our selves with
the <hi>softest</hi> and <hi>easiest</hi> Representations of it;
so that to be sure if there were any one <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable</hi>
Circumstance in it, our Thoughts
would presently insist upon that, and urge
it as a Reason why we should not be afraid
of it. So that if the Penalty of our Sin had
in it but the Circumstance of being <hi>finite,</hi> to
be sure when ever it controuled our <hi>vicious</hi>
Desires, we should still make this a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to despise it; <hi>Well, let it be never so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
it will have an end.</hi> Wherefore to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
it to terrify us effectually, it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
that it should not only be <hi>great,</hi> but
<hi>endless;</hi> that it being stripped of all <hi>tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Circumstances, we might be <hi>able</hi> to find
nothing in it to qualify the Terror of it. But
now it being not only <hi>great</hi> but <hi>eternal,</hi> the
Threat of it, which, like a Cloud, hangs
<hi>lowering</hi> over us, hath no <hi>bright side</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
our Thoughts from the Blackness and
Horror of it; so that when-ever we think of
it, and weigh it in the Ballance with our
Sins, we must resolve to forsake them, or
chuse to be <hi>desperate.</hi> Since therefore an
<hi>eternal</hi> Penalty was so necessary to inforce
God's Law; and since his Law is for our
<hi>good,</hi> it is <hi>plain</hi> that his so inforcing it can
blemish neither his Justice nor Goodness.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63657:67"/>
Wherefore though we should smart <hi>for ever</hi>
for our Disobedience hereafter, we can have
no <hi>just</hi> Reason to complain of <hi>God;</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
considering,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> That if <hi>God</hi> shall think <hi>good</hi> to inforce
his Law with such an <hi>eternal</hi> Penalty, he
must be supposed to have as much Right to
exact it upon our Disobedience, as he had
to threaten and impose it. For as <hi>Supremacy</hi>
over all <hi>other</hi> Beings gives a Right to make
Laws, and inforce them with Threatnings
of Punishment; so when he hath actually
imposed Laws upon us, our Disobedience
to them gives a Right to inflict on us the
Punishments which he threatned when he
imposed them. For in all <hi>legal</hi> Punishments
the Right of Threatning them is founded on
the Power of the <hi>Sovereign;</hi> but the Right
of executing them in the Disobedience of the
<hi>Subject;</hi> and if the Penalty be such, as that
upon the Subjects Disobedience the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi>
cannot justly execute it, it was <hi>unjust</hi>
for him to threaten it; for to threaten le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally,
is to claim a Right to punish upon
Condition the Law be broken and violated;
and that <hi>Sovereign</hi> who upon Condition of
the Subjects Disobedience, claims a Right to
<hi>more</hi> Punishment than he can justly exact of
him when he disobeys, pretends to <hi>more</hi>
Right than he really hath, and so by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63657:68"/>
his Claim is <hi>unrighteous.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the Threat of his Law <hi>God</hi> may
justly claim a Right to punish us <hi>for ever</hi> if
we disobey, then doubtless when we have
actually disobeyed, he may as justly exact
it, and doth no more exceed his Right when
he inflicts what he threatned, than he did
when he threatned to inflict it. If he had
Right to say, <hi>I will punish you for ever upon
Condition you transgress my Laws,</hi> then upon
our performing that Condition he must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
have Right to do as he said. So
that our transgressing his Law being a <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
Condition for him to found a <hi>rightful</hi>
Claim to punish us <hi>eternally,</hi> by our doing
this Condition we justly forfeit our selves to
<hi>eternal</hi> Punishment, and by <hi>our own</hi> Act
and Deed voluntarily resign up our <hi>precious</hi>
Souls to the <hi>just</hi> lash of an <hi>everlasting</hi> Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance;
which as the <hi>Iustice</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is no
way obliged to suspend, so neither is his
<hi>Goodness,</hi> which now is our only Reserve;
considering,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly.</hi> And lastly, That God's exacting
this <hi>eternal</hi> Penalty of us can no more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
his <hi>Goodness</hi> than his threatning and
denouncing it. That it is highly <hi>consistent</hi>
with his Goodness to threaten it, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
proved; but if it were not also <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent</hi>
therewith to inflict it, to be sure his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63657:68"/>
own Wisdom would never admit him to
threaten it. For to what end should he
threaten to act contrary to the <hi>Goodness</hi> of
his Nature? Either he must design to make
us believe that he intends to act, or not; if
the <hi>first,</hi> he must thereby design to abuse,
and misrepresent himself in the Opinion of
his Creatures, to blemish the Reputation,
and expose the Honour of his own <hi>infinite</hi>
Goodness. But if he did not design to make
us believe it, to what end should he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it, since unless we believe it, it can no
more affect us than the firing of a <hi>Gun</hi> that
is charged with nothing but Powder, and
was designed to make a noise only, but to
do no Execution? So that if it be <hi>repugnant</hi>
to God's <hi>Goodness</hi> to execute this Penalty, it
must be <hi>repugnant</hi> to his <hi>Wisdom</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
it; but it being not only <hi>consistent</hi>
with, but an Expression of his <hi>Goodness</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
it, when he designs thereby to oblige
us more firmly to our Duty, in which our <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting</hi>
Happiness is included, it may be
no <hi>less</hi> an Expression of the same <hi>Goodness</hi> to
execute it upon us, when we by our <hi>obstinate</hi>
Persistence in Sin have render'd our selves
<hi>incapable</hi> of Mercy. For now there being
no more <hi>good</hi> to to be done upon us, it will
be an Act of <hi>Goodness</hi> in <hi>God</hi> to punish us
<hi>for ever,</hi> if thereby any <hi>good</hi> may be done to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63657:69"/>
               <hi>others</hi> by us; if by making us <hi>everlasting</hi>
Monuments of his <hi>just</hi> Indignation, he can
everlastingly warn and secure <hi>others</hi> from
those <hi>desperate</hi> Courses that ruined us. For
in this Case his punishing us <hi>for ever,</hi> may
be an <hi>effectual</hi> means to do that <hi>good</hi> to others
which he intended to do to us by threatning
to punish us <hi>for ever,</hi> and they may take
warning by our Punishment, though we
would take none by his Threatning. And
when by being obstinately <hi>deaf</hi> to the Threat
of <hi>eternal</hi> Perdition, which <hi>God</hi> denounced
on purpose to oblige us to be <hi>happy,</hi> we have
not only forfeited our selves to it, but have
also <hi>sinned</hi> our selves into an Incapacity of
having any <hi>good</hi> done upon us; the only
Use which the <hi>Divine Goodness</hi> can make of
us for the <hi>future,</hi> is to do <hi>good</hi> to others by us;
which it can no otherwise do, but by making
our <hi>everlasting</hi> Suffering an <hi>everlasting</hi>
Example for them to take warning by. For
though there is no doubt but every <hi>vertuous</hi>
Soul shall be hereafter so confirmed in its
state of Beatitude, as that it shall never fall
from it, yet shall it be confirmed no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than by the force of those Reasons and
<hi>invincible</hi> Motives which shall then conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
urge, and immovably determine it
unto that which is good: One of which
Reasons, as we may reasonably suppose,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63657:69"/>
will be their Prospect of the <hi>endless</hi> Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the <hi>Damned,</hi> which will be an <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi>
Monitor to them, and together with
their <hi>own</hi> sense of the <hi>ravishing</hi> Pleasures of
<hi>Goodness,</hi> will secure them <hi>for ever</hi> from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
For if the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> took
warning by the Fall and Ruin of their <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
Brethren,</hi> as doubtless they did, and
thereupon became more immovably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Goodness;</hi> why may
we not as well suppose, that one of those
Reasons by which the <hi>Spirits of just Men</hi> are
so immovably confirmed in their <hi>Heavenly
State,</hi> is the <hi>sad</hi> Example of the <hi>endless</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
of the Wicked? If therefore when
<hi>God</hi> hath denounced <hi>eternal</hi> Misery against
us on purpose to threaten us into Happiness,
we will take no warning, it is an Act of
<hi>Goodness</hi> in him to inflict it upon us, since
thereby he may so effectually contribute to
the confirming of <hi>others</hi> in <hi>eternal</hi> Happiness.
For if we will not be wrought on by such
a <hi>dreadful</hi> Denunciation, there is no good
can be done upon us; and when we are past
Recovery, and are forfeited by <hi>our own</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
into the hands of God's Vengeance,
it will be an Act of Goodness in him so to
dispose of us as may be most for the <hi>good</hi> of
others, and consequently to dispose of us
to <hi>eternal</hi> Misery, and by so doing to make
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63657:70"/>
use of us as Arguments to confirm and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
<hi>others</hi> in <hi>eternal</hi> Happiness; that so our
Sufferings may be to them what his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
were to us, Arguments to oblige us
to be <hi>happy for ever.</hi> And so I have done
with the <hi>First</hi> Thing propos'd, which was
to shew you that if <hi>God</hi> be so determined,
he may, without any Injury either to his
<hi>Iustice</hi> or <hi>Goodness,</hi> retain <hi>lost</hi> Souls in the
Bondage of <hi>Hell for ever,</hi> and absolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to accept any Ransom for them.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the <hi>Second</hi> Head of
Discourse, namely, to prove that <hi>God</hi> is
actually determined so to do. And this I
shall endeavour to demonstrate by these
<hi>three</hi> Reasons.</p>
            <p>1. Because he hath already exacted a
Ransom for the Souls of Men, to which no
<hi>other</hi> can be <hi>equivalent;</hi> from whence we
may reasonably infer, that if <hi>this</hi> be rejected
he will accept no <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Because he hath expresly declared <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
to be thus determined.</p>
            <p>3. Because having thus declared himself,
we must suppose that either he intended this
Declaration only for a <hi>Scare-crow,</hi> or that he
is determined to act accordingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> That <hi>God</hi> is determined to conclude
lost Souls under <hi>endless</hi> Misery, and admit
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63657:70"/>
no Ransom for them, appears from hence;
because he hath already exacted a Ransom
for them, to which no <hi>other</hi> can be <hi>equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;</hi>
from whence we may reasonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that if <hi>this</hi> be rejected, he will accept
no <hi>other.</hi> When by our <hi>first</hi> Apostacy from
<hi>God,</hi> we stained the Innocence of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and forfeited our Lives to the <hi>just</hi>
Vengeance of <hi>Heaven;</hi> so terribly was it
then incensed against us, that it would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
no <hi>meaner</hi> Ransom for us than the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi>
Blood of the <hi>Son of God;</hi> for so St.
<hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>That we were not redeemed with
corruptible things, as silver and gold; but with
the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
blemish, and without spot,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19.
And though this Ransom was of such a <hi>vast</hi>
and <hi>incomparable</hi> Value, that all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
in <hi>Heaven</hi> and Earth are <hi>insignificant</hi>
Trifles to it; yet was the Virtue of it to
extend no further than to those, who, by a
<hi>lively</hi> Faith, and <hi>unfeigned</hi> Repentance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from their Rebellion to their Duty
and Allegiance; which if we do not, but
instead thereof obstinately persist in our
Wickedness and Folly, we renounce all our
Part and Interest in the Blood of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;</hi>
and do in effect declare, that upon such
Terms as those we will not be beholding to
him for our Ransom; but that rather than
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63657:71"/>
accept of Redemption upon such <hi>ungrateful</hi>
Conditions, we will trust to the Courtesy of
the Vengeance of <hi>God,</hi> and abide the most
<hi>fatal</hi> Effects of it. When therefore by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
to the End in our Unbelief and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence,
we have finally rejected the Blood
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and utterly extinguish'd all our
Right and Title to it; what Pretence of
Reason have we to hope, that <hi>God</hi> will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
accept of any <hi>other</hi> Ransom for us?
When to the Sins, by which we made the
<hi>first</hi> Forfeiture of our Souls, we have added
the <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>horrid</hi> Impiety of trampling on
the Blood of the Son of <hi>God,</hi> and so are not
only not redeemed by it from the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
to come, but are a <hi>thousand</hi> times
more deeply inthralled to it by reason of that
<hi>additional</hi> Guilt we have contracted by
squandring away the Price of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
With what Face can we expect, in the
midst of such <hi>black</hi> Circumstances, that <hi>God</hi>
should accept of any Exchange for our Souls?
He that would not release us from the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of our <hi>first</hi> Guilts upon any <hi>less</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
than the Blood of his Son, what
<hi>likelihood</hi> is there that any Consideration
should move him to release us after we have
so prodigiously augmented our Guilt by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
his Blood, and finally renouncing all
our Interest in it? Doubtless he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63657:71"/>
so <hi>vast</hi> a Ransom for us when our
Guilt was so comparatively <hi>small</hi> and <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,</hi>
will account no Ransom <hi>sufficient</hi>
when we have so transcendently inhanced
and multiplied it. For if the Blood of
<hi>Christ,</hi> which is of such an <hi>unspeakable</hi> value
can give us no Relief without our <hi>willing</hi>
Acceptance of it upon the Terms it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to us, then when we have finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
it on those Terms, it must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is more <hi>valuable</hi> than his Blood
that must relieve us; something that is <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi>
not only to redeem us from those
Guilts which his Blood was a Ransom for,
but also to expiate the Guilt of our tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
on his Blood, which is the <hi>greatest</hi> and
<hi>blackest</hi> of all. But since the Blood of <hi>Christ</hi>
is incomparably the most <hi>precious</hi> Ransom
that <hi>Heaven</hi> and Earth could afford, what
hope is there that when <hi>this</hi> is rejected by
us, <hi>God</hi> should accept any <hi>other</hi> in exchange
for our Souls?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> That <hi>God</hi> is really determined to
conclude <hi>lost</hi> Souls under <hi>endless</hi> Misery, and
admit no Ransom for them, appears also
from hence, Because he hath expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
himself to be so determined. For so
our <hi>blessed Saviour,</hi> who was the <hi>great</hi> Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
of his Will to the World, hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
told us, that the <hi>final</hi> Sentence of the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63657:72"/>
Wicked shall be to <hi>everlasting Fire, Matth</hi>
25. 41. and that the Fate of <hi>obstinate</hi> Sinners,
whom he compares to Chaff, shall be to be
<hi>burned up with unquenchable fire.</hi> But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you may object, that these Texts only
prove the <hi>Everlastingness</hi> of the Fire in which
they shall suffer, and not their <hi>everlasting</hi>
Suffering in it; for this Fire perhaps may
immediately consume, and utterly destroy
them, and render them <hi>insensible</hi> of Misery
<hi>for ever.</hi> To which I answer, That the
contrary is most evident; for they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
said to live in this Fire, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Functions of <hi>living</hi> Beings in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery;
<hi>to weep and wail, and gnash their teeth,
Matth.</hi> 13. 42. and in the Parable of <hi>Dives,</hi>
he is said to <hi>lift up his eyes in Hell, being in
torments,</hi> and to <hi>see Abraham afar off, and
Lazarus in his bosom;</hi> and to <hi>cry out to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Father Abraham have mercy on me, and
send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his
finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am
tormented in this flame,</hi> Luke 16. 23.—A
<hi>plain</hi> Evidence that this Fire is to torment
and not to consume them. Well, but this
you will say imports no more than their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tortured in <hi>Hell</hi> for some period of Time,
after which, it may be, they may cease to
be, and consequently to be <hi>miserable.</hi> To
which I answer, That elsewhere it is expresly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63657:72"/>
asserted, that this Torture is to indure <hi>for
ever;</hi> for <hi>these,</hi> saith our <hi>Saviour,</hi> speaking
of the Wicked, <hi>shall go away into everlasting
Punishment, Matth.</hi> 25. 46. And how can
their Punishment be <hi>everlasting,</hi> unless we
suppose them to subsist everlastingly in it?
If you say it is <hi>everlasting</hi> only as it is an <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi>
Destruction, or Privation of their
Being: I answer, That in other Places of
<hi>Scripture</hi> it is expresly asserted, that this <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting</hi>
Punishment is a <hi>positive</hi> thing;
for it is said to be a <hi>Worm</hi> that never <hi>dieth,
Mark</hi> 9. 44. that is, that to all <hi>Eternity</hi> lives
and preys upon the <hi>wretched</hi> Sufferers; and
more expresly yet, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 10. those that
are <hi>cast into the lake of fire and brimstone,</hi> are
said to <hi>be tormented</hi> there <hi>day and night for
ever and ever:</hi> Where the <hi>Greek</hi> word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth plainly denote <hi>positive</hi>
Torment, and referring peculiarly to a
Rack, denotes the kind of this <hi>positive</hi> Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be such as is not designed to put an
end to our Lives, but to continue them
with <hi>inexpressible</hi> Pains. For this we know
is the <hi>proper</hi> Use and Design of a Rack; and
accordingly upon this <hi>tormenting</hi> Rack of
<hi>Hellish</hi> Punishment they are said to have <hi>no
rest day nor night, Rev.</hi> 14. 11. So that the
<hi>eternal</hi> Misery of <hi>lost</hi> Souls is as fully and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
asserted in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as it could well
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63657:73"/>
have been, had it been expressed with a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to leave no Pretence of Exception for
Gainsayers; and when a thing is as plainly
asserted to <hi>be</hi> as it could well have been if
it really were, either we must suppose the
Thing to <hi>be,</hi> or else the Assertion to be <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious.</hi>
So that if we think that God's <hi>own</hi>
Word doth truly signify his Determination,
we must from hence be forced to conclude,
that he is really determined to shut up <hi>lost</hi>
Souls in <hi>eternal</hi> Misery, and admit no Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> And lastly, This also appears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
if after he hath thus declared himself,
there were any Reason to think that he is not
determined to act accordingly, that Reason
would warrant us to believe that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
was only intended for a <hi>Scare-crow,</hi>
and consequently to contemn and despise it.
For against all that hath been said, it may
be (and is by some Men) objected, That
<hi>God</hi> is not bound to do as he threatens; that
when by our Disobedience we have incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Penalty he threatens, he hath an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted</hi>
Right indeed to inflict it upon us,
and consequently may, if he please, inflict it
without any Wrong or Injustice; but then,
if he please, he may dispense with it <hi>too</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the <hi>whole,</hi> or in part, as he sees conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.
For the Punishment being only a
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63657:73"/>
Debt which the Sinner owes to him, he is
no more obliged than <hi>other</hi> Creditors are to
exact the <hi>utmost</hi> farthing of it; but may
exact or remit the <hi>whole,</hi> or abate what part
soever he pleases; and therefore it is to be
hoped, that he being a <hi>merciful</hi> Creditor
will not be so <hi>extreme</hi> and <hi>rigorous</hi> as to exact
of us the <hi>utmost</hi> Punishment we owe him;
but that when he hath made us <hi>smart</hi> a
while for our Folly, he will either release us
into a more <hi>happy</hi> Condition, or put an end
to our Beings and Miseries together. To
which I might answer, That when by our
Sins we have forfeited our selves to the <hi>just</hi>
Vengeance of <hi>God,</hi> it is <hi>infinite</hi> Mercy and
Goodness to others, to punish us according
to his Threatning; and therefore when we
by our Sins have render'd our selves <hi>incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
of his Mercy, that Mercy which now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
him to do <hi>good</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> will then equally
incline him to <hi>good</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> by the <hi>dreadful</hi>
Example of our Punishment; and so he may
be a very <hi>mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iful</hi> Creditor, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
exact of us the <hi>utmost</hi> Farthing. But
this I have already largely insisted on, and
therefore, <hi>2dly.</hi> I answer, That what God
may do is not for us to determine when he
may, or may not, and is obliged to neither;
but when he hath expresly denounced what
he will do, we can have no Reason to hope

that he will be <hi>better</hi> than his Word. For if
after that he hath denounced, that if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in our Sin he will punish us <hi>for ever</hi> for
it, he should have left us any <hi>just</hi> Reason to
hope that he will not, he would thereby
have countermined himself, and baffled the
Design of his <hi>own</hi> Denunciation, which is to
terrify his <hi>rebellious</hi> Creatures from their
Sins, and to aw them into Obedience to his
Laws. But how much Reason soever he
hath given me to hope, that he will not be
so <hi>severe</hi> to me as he threatens, so much
Reason he must have given me not to be
afraid of his Threatnings. If I had any
<hi>just</hi> Reason to believe that he will be more
<hi>merciful</hi> than to inflict what he denounces,
it is an <hi>irrational</hi> thing for me to dread his
Denunciations; for I know <hi>God</hi> will do as
<hi>just</hi> Reason directs, and therefore I must
conclude either my Reason to be <hi>false,</hi> or
God's Denunciation to be a <hi>Scare-crow;</hi> for
if there be any <hi>just</hi> Reason why his Mercy
and Goodness should interpose, and avert
the Execution of his Threats from me, I
ought not to be afraid of them, because I
am sure he can do nothing that his Mercy
and Goodness forbids: But if there be no
Reason for such an Interposure, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonably
<hi>presumptuous</hi> to expect it. So that
either my Expectation must be <hi>groundless,</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:63657:74"/>
or my Fear of God's Threatnings <hi>irratio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And can it be imagined that the <hi>wise</hi> God
would ever go about to aw his Creatures
into Obedience by threatning their Sin with
such Punishments as he knows they have
<hi>just</hi> Reason not to be afraid of? Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
therefore <hi>God</hi> may do, I am sure if we
go on in our Sins, we can have no Reason
to hope that he will either not punish us at
all, or <hi>less</hi> than he hath threatned; or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
that he will abate us <hi>one</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that <hi>eternal</hi> Misery which he hath
so plainly and expresly denounced against
us. What then remains, but that since
when our Soul is <hi>lost,</hi> it is <hi>lost for ever,</hi> we
now take all <hi>possible</hi> care to secure it while
we may.</p>
            <p>V. I proceed now to the <hi>Fifth</hi> and <hi>last</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
<hi>That this irrecoverable Loss of the
Soul is of such VAST and VNSPEAKABLE
moment, that the Gain of all the World is not
sufficient to compensate it: What shall it profit
a Man if he shall gain the whole World, and
lose his own Soul?</hi> That is, It will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
him at all; nay it will be so far from
<hi>that,</hi> that it will turn to his <hi>unspeakable</hi> Loss
and Disadvantage: Though by renouncing
his Profession of my Doctrine, or his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of my Laws, a Man were sure to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63657:75"/>
make himself Lord of all the World, and
to possess and injoy it as long as he lived;
yet if for so doing he should afterwards
lose his Soul, as most certainly he will, he
will find in the issue that he hath made a
<hi>woful</hi> Bargain of it, and be forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
himself a <hi>vast</hi> Loser when he
comes to suffer those <hi>intollerable</hi> Damages
which the Loss of a Soul implies. For the
Proof of which, I shall run a Comparison
between the <hi>Gain</hi> and the <hi>Loss,</hi> and therein
endeavour to represent to you how much
the Evil of <hi>this</hi> Loss exceeds the Good of
<hi>that</hi> Gain; and this I shall do in these <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</hi>
Particulars:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> The <hi>Good</hi> that is in the Gain is <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary</hi>
and <hi>fantastical;</hi> but the <hi>Evil</hi> that is in
the Loss is <hi>real</hi> and <hi>substantial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The <hi>Good</hi> that is in the Gain is <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
and <hi>particular;</hi> but the <hi>Evil</hi> that is in
the Loss is <hi>large</hi> and <hi>universal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> The <hi>Good</hi> that is in the Gain is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible</hi>
into <hi>Evil;</hi> but the <hi>Evil</hi> that is in the
Loss is never to be improved into <hi>Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> The <hi>Good</hi> that is in the Gain is
<hi>mixt</hi> and <hi>sophisticated;</hi> but the <hi>Evil</hi> that is in
the Loss is <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>unmingled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> The <hi>Good</hi> that is in the Gain is <hi>full</hi>
of Intermissions; but the Evil that is in the
Loss is <hi>continual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:63657:75"/>
               <hi>6thly.</hi> The <hi>Good</hi> that is in the Gain is <hi>short</hi>
and <hi>transitory;</hi> but the <hi>Evil</hi> that is in the Loss
is <hi>eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> The Good that is in the Gain is <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary</hi>
and <hi>fantastical;</hi> but the <hi>Evil</hi> that is
in the Loss is <hi>real</hi> and <hi>substantial.</hi> For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
we gain of this World's <hi>Goods</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
what is <hi>necessary</hi> to serve the <hi>real</hi> Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
and <hi>modest</hi> Conveniencies of this
<hi>present</hi> Life, administers to no <hi>other</hi> purpose
but only to gratify an <hi>extravagant</hi> Fancy:
For all the <hi>real</hi> Need that a Man hath of
these <hi>worldly Goods,</hi> is only to maintain and
provide for his Body; for his Soul hath no
more need of them, than an Angel hath of
Money to buy Victuals and Clothes with:
and one would think so <hi>small</hi> a thing as an
<hi>humane</hi> Body is, could not need <hi>many</hi> things;
and that a piece of <hi>animate</hi> Matter, some
six foot long, might be very <hi>easily</hi> and <hi>cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
provided for: And indeed so it would be
if we could once forbear fancying its Needs
to be <hi>greater</hi> than they are; but if we let
loose the Reins to an <hi>ungoverned</hi> Fancy, That
will so extend its Needs beyond the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
of its Nature, that all the World will
be <hi>too</hi> little to content the <hi>extravagant</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
of this <hi>little</hi> Clod of Earth. Lay
but your Fancies aside, and you will want
no <hi>other</hi> Apparel but what is <hi>sufficient</hi> to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:63657:76"/>
keep you <hi>warm,</hi> and <hi>clean,</hi> and <hi>modest,</hi> and
with this you may be very cheaply pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided;
but if you will resolve to humour
that <hi>capricious</hi> thing, you will want the
Revenue of a <hi>Lordship</hi> to cover your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness.
Keep but your Fancies in order,
and your Appetites will be contented with
<hi>plain</hi> and <hi>wholesom</hi> Provisions, and this a
<hi>small</hi> Income will furnish you with; but if
once you let loose that <hi>roving</hi> Faculty, and
suffer it to grow <hi>wanton</hi> and <hi>delicate,</hi> that
will so stretch your Appetites, that the
stores of all the <hi>four Elements</hi> will scarce be
<hi>sufficient</hi> to gratify their Luxuries. And so
it is in all <hi>other</hi> things appertaining to the
Body; whose Wants according to Natures
Measures are <hi>small,</hi> but according to Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are <hi>infinite.</hi> So that if a Man had all
the World in his Possession, yet all but that
<hi>little little</hi> part of it that is either naturally
<hi>necessary,</hi> or rationally <hi>convenient</hi> for his <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily</hi>
Subsistence, would be <hi>good</hi> for nothing
but to humour the Desires of an <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi>
Fancy; which are so far from being
quenched, that they are but the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
by Injoyment. If I had all the
Wealth of <hi>Croesus,</hi> the <hi>good</hi> Fortunes of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
and the Dominions of <hi>Alexander,</hi> what
would it advantage me? I should only
have abundance of things that I have no
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:63657:76"/>
               <hi>real</hi> need of; things, that if I would my
self, I might easily be as <hi>happy</hi> without, as
I can be with them. For would I but
make my Nature and my Reason the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of my Wants, I might always live next
door to Satisfaction; and as for my Wants,
they would be so <hi>light</hi> and <hi>portable,</hi> that I
might easily take them, and carry them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with me, and lay them down almost
wheresoever I pleased. Whereas if I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
my Fancy to grow <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
I shall always find my Wants doubled
with my Injoyments; and whereas when I
had but <hi>five Pounds,</hi> I needed but <hi>five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred;</hi>
when I have <hi>five hundred,</hi> I shall
need <hi>five thousand;</hi> and so on till at last I
need beyond all Possibility of Satisfaction.
Since therefore all that this World can do
for me, besides the supplying of a <hi>few modest</hi>
Needs, which a very <hi>little</hi> of it will do,
what a <hi>miserable</hi> Loser shall I be, if merely
to gratify my Fancy, I forfeit my Soul,
and incur the <hi>real</hi> Miseries of a <hi>woful</hi> Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in Pursuit of the <hi>fantastick</hi> Joys of a
moment? If to purchase things which I
shall never be the better for, which while
I have not I do not need, and which when
I have I shall not injoy; I should not only
squander away the most <hi>substantial</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but plung my self into a <hi>vast</hi> Abyss
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63657:77"/>
of <hi>real</hi> and <hi>intolerable</hi> Miseries: O <hi>good God,</hi>
what a <hi>woful</hi> Bargain shall I have of it? For
though the Pleasure of our Sin doth always
vanish on the Brink of Fruition, and like a
<hi>golden</hi> Dream, concludes in a <hi>disappointed</hi>
Expectation; yet the Sting that is to follow
it will produce in us not only a <hi>real,</hi> but an
extreamly <hi>sharp</hi> and <hi>dolorous</hi> Perception; so
extreamly <hi>sharp,</hi> that it will pierce our very
Hearts, and cause us to roar out with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
for ever. And alas! what a <hi>poor</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
is it for a Man that must e're
long be enduring the Tortures of a <hi>tedious</hi>
Famine, to be entertained a <hi>few</hi> Moments
with the Picture of a Feast, or the Story of
<hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Banquet? Or what Man in his
Wits would ever forfeit himself, for the <hi>mere</hi>
Fancy of a Pleasure, to the <hi>lingering</hi> Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of a Rack? And yet, O <hi>wretched</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
thou actest a <hi>thousand</hi> times more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly;
who, by thy <hi>unlawful</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
of the <hi>imaginary</hi> Pleasures of this World,
betrayest thy Soul to the <hi>bitter</hi> Torments of
<hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The <hi>Good</hi> that is in the Gain of this
World is <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>particular,</hi> but the <hi>Evil</hi>
that is in the Loss of a Soul is <hi>large</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal.</hi>
'Tis but a Part of our selves, and
that the <hi>worst</hi> Part <hi>too,</hi> that this World's
<hi>Goods</hi> can benefit and advantage; they can
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63657:77"/>
only clothe our Bodies more splendidly, and
feed them more deliciously, and furnish
them with more Plenty of <hi>outward</hi> Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations;
but alas for the Soul, they are as
<hi>insignificant</hi> to her, as <hi>Musical</hi> Sounds are to
the Eye of the Body, or <hi>magnificent</hi> Shews
to the Ear: They cannot improve the
<hi>meanest</hi> Faculty about her, nor make her in
any respect either the <hi>better</hi> or the <hi>wiser.</hi>
And as for the Body it self, wherein all
their Lines do center, there are a <hi>thousand</hi>
Cases in which they are perfectly <hi>useless;</hi>
for they cannot give <hi>Health</hi> to it in any
<hi>Sickness,</hi> nor <hi>Ease</hi> in any <hi>Pain;</hi> they cannot
recover a <hi>lost</hi> Sense, nor restore a <hi>withered</hi>
Limb, nor rectify a <hi>deformed</hi> Feature; nor
is it in their Power to reprieve it from the
Grave one moment beyond the <hi>natural</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of its Mortality. So extreamly <hi>narrow</hi>
are these <hi>worldly</hi> Goods which we are so
greedy of, that they can extend their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
no farther than the Body; nay, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to <hi>that</hi> they are vastly <hi>inadequate,</hi> there
being a thousand <hi>bodily</hi> Necessities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they cannot extend themselves. So
that if to purchase these we expose our selves
to <hi>eternal</hi> Perdition, we shall have in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
but a <hi>drop</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> to compensate
our selves for an <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Misery.</hi> For the
Misery of <hi>Hell</hi> is as <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>extensive</hi> as our
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63657:78"/>
Capacity of Suffering, and hath in it an
<hi>appropriate</hi> Torment for every <hi>sensible</hi> Part
of our Natures. It racks the <hi>wretched</hi> Soul
in every Faculty, and fills <hi>up</hi> all its Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Misery with Anguish and Vexation:
It afflicts its Mind with <hi>horrid</hi> Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
wounds and gashes its Conscience
with <hi>dismal</hi> Reflections; it festers its Will
with <hi>black</hi> and <hi>venomous</hi> Passions, and starves
its Desires with <hi>everlasting</hi> Famine. And as
it leaves no part of the Soul untormented,
but covers it over from Head to Foot with
Wounds, and Bruises, and <hi>putrifying</hi> Sores;
so when the Body at the Resurrection is
reunited to it, the Misery of Hell will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to this also; for then it will have super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added
to its <hi>Spiritual</hi> Plagues the most <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite</hi>
Instrument of <hi>Corporeal</hi> Torment, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>dark,</hi> and <hi>noisom,</hi> and <hi>scorching</hi> Flames of
a <hi>burning</hi> World, which will seize upon the
Bodies of <hi>Reprobate Sinners,</hi> they being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
abandoned to them by the <hi>last</hi> and <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Sentence, and stick close to, and burn
through them <hi>for ever.</hi> And their Bodies
being thus wrapped and clothed in <hi>flaming</hi>
Sulphur, must needs be exquisitely vexed in
every Part and Member, and feel as many
Torments as they have Senses to indure
them. Thus the Miseries of <hi>Hell,</hi> you see,
are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar more <hi>extensive</hi> than the <hi>Goods</hi> of this
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63657:78"/>
World; for whereas <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se</hi> extend only to
our Bodies, and can relieve them but in a
<hi>few</hi> of their Necessities, <hi>those</hi> over-spread
both the Body and Soul, and are both <hi>co-eternal</hi>
and <hi>co-equal</hi> with their <hi>utmost</hi> Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
of Suffering: So that when by our
<hi>unlawful</hi> Pursuits of the <hi>Goods</hi> of this World
we forfeit our selves to <hi>eternal</hi> Perdition, we
plunge our <hi>whole</hi> Nature into <hi>intollerable</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
for the Ease and the Pleasure of one
<hi>particular</hi> Part. Now would any Man in
his Wits, do you think, eat <hi>Rats-bane</hi> for
no <hi>other</hi> Reason, but only because it is
<hi>sweet?</hi> Would he to please his <hi>liquorish</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
diffuse a <hi>tormenting</hi> Poison over all his
Parts and Members? Or would he think
the Pleasure of one <hi>sweet</hi> Gust a <hi>sufficient</hi>
Compensation for all the <hi>succeeding</hi> Spasms
and Convulsions? Surely no; none but a
Mad-man could ever admit of such an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance.
And yet, <hi>O wretched</hi> Sinner!
thou art far more <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>extravagant;</hi> for
<hi>for</hi> a <hi>particular Good</hi> thou throwest thy self
headlong into an <hi>universal</hi> Misery; and to
gratify thy Body in a <hi>few little</hi> things, dost
utterly ruin both thy Body and Soul. To
please thy self in <hi>one</hi> part, thou punishest
thy self in <hi>all;</hi> and for the gratifying <hi>one</hi>
Sense, derivest a <hi>tormenting</hi> Venom over all
the Senses of thy Nature; and so <hi>in sine,</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:63657:79"/>
wilt have nothing but the Pleasure of a
Taste or a Touch to compensate thee for all
the Agonies and Torments that thy Body
and Soul together are <hi>able</hi> to sustain. And
what a <hi>poor</hi> Compensation this is, I leave
you to judg.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> The <hi>Good</hi> that is in the Gain of this
World is <hi>convertible</hi> into <hi>Evil;</hi> but the <hi>Evil</hi>
that is in the Loss of a Soul is never to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
into <hi>Good.</hi> When we are arrived
to the Possession of those <hi>outward</hi> Goods
which at present we do so greedily gasp af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it is a very <hi>uncertain</hi> thing whether
they will prove Goods to us or no; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
even as to this Life, we shall be the
<hi>better,</hi> or the <hi>worse</hi> for them. For it is very
often seen that these <hi>worldly</hi> Goods prove
the <hi>worst</hi> of Plagues to those that are the
Owners of them, and that those things
which we account the Blessings of this Life,
do prove the Curses and Miseries of it.
When by a <hi>thousand Lies, Flatteries,</hi> and
<hi>Circumventions,</hi> a Man hath raised himself
<hi>up</hi> to that Pinacle of Preferment which his
Ambition aspired to, how often hath that
Height proved the Occasion of his Fall, by
exposing him to those Storms of Envy and
Misfortune which would have blown over
his Head, had he sat quietly <hi>below,</hi> and been
contented to injoy himself in a more <hi>private</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:63657:79"/>
Fortune? And so when by an <hi>infinite</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Rapines,</hi> and <hi>Oppressions, Frauds,</hi> and
<hi>dishonest Compliances,</hi> a Man hath amassed
together a <hi>vast</hi> deal of Wealth, how often
hath <hi>that</hi> proved the Occasion of his Undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
Sometimes by exposing him to the
<hi>rapacious</hi> Covetousness of <hi>others,</hi> but most
commonly to the <hi>ill</hi> Effects of his own <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant</hi>
Luxuries. For usually when
Fraud is the <hi>Procurer</hi> of Wealth, Wealth
is the <hi>Baud</hi> of Luxury; this being the <hi>best</hi>
Expedient to drown the Cry of the Guilt
of our Dishonesty. And then by that time
Luxury hath produced its <hi>natural</hi> Effects,
it commonly leaves the <hi>wealthy</hi> Possessor in
a far <hi>worse</hi> Condition than Poverty; it leaves
him so rackt with the <hi>Gout</hi> or the <hi>Stone,</hi> so
over-whelmed with <hi>Catarrhs</hi> or <hi>Dropsies,</hi>
that the <hi>miserable</hi> Man would be heartily
contented to part with all his Wealth for
Ease, and to return to Poverty so he might
but return to the Health of an <hi>honest</hi>
Plough-man; whereas would he have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
himself with the <hi>honest</hi> Acquest of a
<hi>moderate</hi> Fortune, he need have wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Temptations to Luxury, and
Provisions for <hi>tormenting</hi> Diseases. So that
in short, whilst we are pursuing this World's
Goods, we know not what our Game will
be till we have seised on it; peradventure
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63657:80"/>
instead of <hi>Venizon</hi> we are hunting a Ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pent,
which, when we have caught, will
sting and invenom us, and prove ax Plague
instead of a Satisfaction. And is it not <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant</hi>
Madness then for Men to run
themselves into all those Miseries, which
<hi>everlasting</hi> Ruin and Perdition implies, for
the sake of such <hi>uncertain</hi> Goods, which
when they are possessed of, for all they
know, may do them a thousand times more
Mischief than Good? For as for those <hi>future</hi>
Miseries, which by our <hi>sinful</hi> Pursuits of
these <hi>present</hi> Goods we incur, they are all
such <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> Evils, that there
is not one drop of Good to be extracted out
of them; for as they are <hi>eternal</hi> they are of
an <hi>unalterable</hi> Nature, and the same <hi>insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable</hi>
Plagues they were yesterday, they
will continue to be to day, and <hi>for ever.</hi>
Indeed if we were to out-live them, they
might be accidentally <hi>advantagious</hi> to us;
they might discipline our Natures for an
Happiness to come, and serve as so many
Toils to our <hi>future</hi> Pleasures; and when
they are past, the Remembrance of them,
like <hi>bitter</hi> Sauce, might give a Relish to our
Joys, and render them more <hi>grateful</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious:</hi>
But we being to indure 'em for ever,
there is nothing Good can succeed them, no
<hi>possible</hi> Advantage can be derived from
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63657:80"/>
them; for in Miseries that have no End,
there can be nothing but Misery. And is it
not very strange then, that Men should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
their Souls to such <hi>unalterable</hi> Miseries,
for such Goods as may be Plagues to them?
when for all they know there may be such
a Train of Mischiefs at the heels of these
<hi>Pleasures,</hi> and <hi>Profits,</hi> and <hi>Honours</hi> they are
so greedy of, as may out-weigh all the good
of them, and rendet them a <hi>dear</hi> Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,
though they had never pawned
their Souls for them. And if it so prove, as
it is very <hi>probable</hi> it may, then their Bargain
is <hi>worse</hi> than if they had pawned their Souls
for nothing; because they have incurred <hi>one</hi>
Misery only to seise upon <hi>another,</hi> and have
waded through a <hi>temporal</hi> to come at an <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> The <hi>Good</hi> that is in the Gain of this
World, is <hi>mixed</hi> and <hi>sophisticated;</hi> but the
<hi>Evil</hi> that is in the Loss of a Soul is <hi>pure</hi> and
<hi>unmingled.</hi> Should a Man sell his Soul for
never so <hi>great</hi> a share of this World's Goods,
he would find he had gotten but a very <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy</hi>
Purchase; a Purchase as he can neither
secure without a <hi>great</hi> deal of Care, nor yet
injoy without a great deal of Dissatis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For what we call ours, is really ours but for
our Portion of Expence and Use; and all
that is ours beyond this, is only the Title
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:63657:81"/>
and the Care, and the Trouble of securing
and dispensing it; for let but your Servants
walk into your <hi>Gardens of Pleasure,</hi> and the
Air shall fan them with as <hi>gentle</hi> Gales, the
Flowers delight them with as <hi>fragrant</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
and the Birds entertain them with
as <hi>ravishing</hi> Melodies. And in some sense
your <hi>meanest</hi> Servants injoy what you have
with <hi>far</hi> more freedom than you; for your
Possessions are like a <hi>great</hi> Harvest, which
many Labourers must bring in, and more
must eat of; only you are the Center of all
the Cares, and you they fix on; but the
Profits run out to all the Lines of your Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
who usually injoy their <hi>several</hi> shares
with much more Peace and Quiet than you.
You take the Pains to dig the Well, and
undergo the Care of supplying and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
it; and when you have done, you
can drink no more of it than the <hi>meanest</hi>
Slave about you; but wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> you drink can't
be so <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>pure,</hi> because it is dashed with
many more Cares and Disturbances. For
considering the <hi>infinite</hi> Hazards these <hi>worldly</hi>
Goods are exposed to, they must needs carry
with them abundance of Cares and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes;
so that when you are possessed
of them, you only grasp a Bundle of <hi>gilded</hi>
Thorns, which while they <hi>please</hi> your Eyes,
will <hi>prick</hi> your Hearts, and continually
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63657:81"/>
disease you in the Injoyment of them. And
then for the Injoyment it self, considered
abstractedly from those Cares that surround
it, alas it is such as rather creates Desire
than Satisfaction; for though at a distance
these <hi>Terrestrial</hi> Goods do promise us <hi>fair;</hi>
and raise in us <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>boundless</hi> Hopes; yet
still when we approach nearer to them, we
find our selves miserably deceived. And
then our Injoyment falling so vastly <hi>short</hi> of
our Expectation, all those <hi>swelling</hi> Hopes
that flattered and tolled us on, fall flat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
under the Disappointments of
Fruition; and accordingly our Desires mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their <hi>promised</hi> Satisfactions, grow more
<hi>outragious</hi> and <hi>violent.</hi> And thus our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
as they are compassed with Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
so are they mingled with <hi>restless</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
as being all <hi>too little</hi> for our <hi>vast</hi>
Desires; which are therefore rather inraged
than satisfied with them. What <hi>infinite</hi>
Losers therefore must those Men be, who
to compass those <hi>sophisticated</hi> Goods which
have so many Evils intermixed with them,
forfeit their Souls to <hi>everlasting</hi> Perdition?
which is so <hi>vast</hi> and so <hi>intense</hi> an <hi>Evil,</hi> as
will admit no degree of <hi>Good</hi> to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
with it; a Misery so <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allayed,</hi>
as that it totally excludes all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with Happiness, and will not
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63657:82"/>
admit the <hi>least</hi> Hope of Ease or Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For what Ease can we hope for in
the <hi>everlasting</hi> Burnings? What Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can we expect in the <hi>unquenchable</hi>
Lake of Fire and Brimstone? Doubtless
we may as soon hope to find a Cordial in
the Sting of a Scorpion, or <hi>sprightly Nectar</hi>
in a Nest of Wasps, as one degree of Ease
or Comfort in <hi>Hell.</hi> There is not a Gleam
of <hi>Light</hi> in all that Region of <hi>Darkness,</hi> not
a Drop of <hi>Sweet</hi> in all that <hi>vast</hi> Ocean of
<hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Wormwood;</hi> but it is all Misery,
<hi>sharp</hi> and <hi>exquisite</hi> Misery, without the <hi>least</hi>
Mixture of Ease, or Hope of Mitigation.
Can we then be so <hi>stupid</hi> as to imagine the
injoying this World's <hi>Goods,</hi> which are all
such Compositions of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> worth
the enduring such <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>abstracted</hi> Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for ever? Would you for the Pleasure
of an <hi>intemperate</hi> Draught that will quickly
end in a Qualm or an Headach, be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to indure the Torment of being <hi>impaled?</hi>
Or provided you might spend this Night in
your <hi>lascivious</hi> Injoyment, which after a <hi>few</hi>
Moments will conclude in Shame and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse,
would you be willing to roar upon
the Rack all the Night after? doubtless
you would not. And yet, God knows,
these <hi>Pleasures</hi> are not comparably so <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate</hi>
to those <hi>Pains,</hi> as the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63657:82"/>
of this World are to the Pains of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</hi>
How then is it <hi>possible</hi> that such
<hi>Bitter-sweets</hi> as these are, <hi>Sweets</hi> that are
chequered with so many Cares, and allayed
with so many Discontents, and Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
should be <hi>sufficient</hi> to countervail
those <hi>intollerable</hi> Miseries which the Loss of
our Souls implies?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> The <hi>Good</hi> that is in the Gain of this
World is <hi>full</hi> of Intermissions; but the <hi>Evil</hi>
that is in the Loss of a Soul is <hi>continual.</hi> If I
were Lord of all the World, I should never be
able to live in a <hi>constant</hi> Injoyment of it. For
such <hi>wretched</hi> Counterfeits are all the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Sense, that they will not indure the
Test of a <hi>long</hi> Fruition; for at the best they
are but Frolicks of Delight that never <hi>seize</hi>
us but when we are turned <hi>up</hi> to them in
<hi>Moods</hi> and <hi>Fits,</hi> and all the Complacencies
we have in them are nothing but the <hi>little</hi>
Starts of our Appetite, which, as soon as
it hath done craving, grows <hi>aweary</hi> of them,
and so injoys and loaths them by Turns;
for they can dwell no longer upon the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
than while the Necessities of Nature
do continue; and every <hi>fresh</hi> Morsel after
the Hunger is satisfied, is but a <hi>new</hi> Labour
to a <hi>tired</hi> Digestion, and so instead of being
a Pleasure becomes an Oppression. So that
it is but a very <hi>little</hi> while that the Pleasure
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:63657:83"/>
of any <hi>outward</hi> Injoyment continues; for
till it hath pleased us it is not a Pleasure, and
when it hath, it ceases to be so; and so
it dies as soon as it is born, and its Nativity
is only a <hi>Prelude</hi> to its Funeral. Thus all
our Injoyments are stinted by our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
which are naturally <hi>incapable</hi> of a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued</hi>
Fruition. But then besides this, our
Injoyments are <hi>liable</hi> to a thousand <hi>other</hi>
Interruptions, which are not in our power
to prevent or avoid; for whether we will
or no, we must be some times out of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and then all the Pleasures in the
World are most <hi>tedious</hi> Impertinencies; and
some times we must <hi>sleep,</hi> and then we are
<hi>insensible</hi> of them; and sometimes be <hi>sick,</hi>
and then they are as <hi>tastless</hi> as a Cork; and
some times be <hi>griped</hi> with <hi>guilty</hi> Thoughts,
and <hi>ill-aboding</hi> Reflections, and then, instead
of Pleasures, they are our Horrors and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Thus our Injoyment, like an Ague,
is <hi>full</hi> of Intermissions; now we are <hi>pleased,</hi>
and anon we are <hi>displeased,</hi> and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after the <hi>hot Fit</hi> is over, the <hi>cold One</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns;
and thus it would be if we had all
the World in our Possession. And indeed
the Intervals of our Injoyment of these <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial</hi>
Goods are usually <hi>longer</hi> than the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
it self, and the <hi>hot Fits</hi> of our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Fruition are generally sooner over,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63657:83"/>
than those <hi>cold Ones</hi> of Displeasure and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction
that succeed them. So that if I
could command all the <hi>Goods</hi> in the World,
they would be so far from yielding me a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued</hi>
Happiness, that in all Probability the
Interruptions of my Happiness would take
up a <hi>greater</hi> Part of my Life than the Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it; and perhaps for every <hi>one</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Fruition, I should spend <hi>two</hi> either
in Pain, or in Non-perception of Pleasure.
How then is it <hi>possible</hi> that such a <hi>broken</hi> and
<hi>discontinued</hi> Happiness as this should ever
make us amends for those Miseries that are
included in the Loss of our Souls? For to
lose our Souls is to be <hi>miserable</hi> without any
Interruption, to be eternally grieved and
tortured without any Intervals of Ease or
Refreshment. For the State of Perdition is
a <hi>continued</hi> Torment spun out into an <hi>endless</hi>
Duration, wherein there are no <hi>Days</hi> of <hi>Rest,</hi>
nor <hi>Nights</hi> of <hi>Sleep,</hi> nor <hi>intermediate</hi> Pauses
of Ease; where the Fire never ceases burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor the Worm gnawing, but <hi>Wo</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<hi>Wo</hi> without Intermission, and Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
like the <hi>nimble</hi> Minutes of Time, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Miseries, and tread close upon <hi>one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
Heels. Hence, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 10. those that
are cast into this Lake of Perdition, are said
to be <hi>tormented day and night for ever;</hi> which
plainly implies that their Miseries are all but
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63657:84"/>
one <hi>uninterrupted</hi> Torment, or <hi>continued</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of <hi>dolorous</hi> Perceptions <hi>for ever.</hi> And
if so, <hi>O blessed God,</hi> what a <hi>poor</hi> Compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for it are the <hi>broken</hi> Joys of this World?
For if the Misery of <hi>Hell</hi> were to last no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the Happiness of this World, yet
if for <hi>one</hi> Week's Happiness here I were to
indure <hi>another</hi> Week's Misery <hi>there,</hi> I should
have a <hi>miserable</hi> Bargain of it; because the
Happiness being so <hi>interrupted,</hi> and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
so <hi>continued,</hi> I must in the same space
undergo at least <hi>double</hi> the Misery that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
Happiness. And what Man would
be contented to live all the <hi>next</hi> Week in a
Cauldron of <hi>boyling</hi> Oyl, wherein he knows
he shall be continually <hi>tormented,</hi> provided
he may spend <hi>this</hi> Week in an <hi>uninterrupted</hi>
Injoyment of the most <hi>grateful</hi> Luxuries,
which he knows he must be as often and as
long <hi>insensible</hi> as he can be <hi>sensible</hi> of?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly.</hi> And lastly, The <hi>Good</hi> that is in the
Gain of this World is <hi>fading</hi> and <hi>transitory;</hi>
but the <hi>Evil</hi> that is in the Loss of the Soul
is <hi>eternal.</hi> For so <hi>impotent</hi> are all this World's
<hi>Goods,</hi> that they cannot insure us of <hi>one</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
Injoyment of them. It may be as
soon as ever we have filled our Bags and
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rns with the Wages of our Iniquity, and
have a <hi>plentiful</hi> Provision for many Years
Ease and Luxury, we may be snatched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63657:84"/>
upon the very Brinks of Injoyment, and
hurried into a <hi>woful</hi> Eternity, there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
those Years in Misery and Torment,
which we promised to spend in Pleasure and
Voluptuousness. This you know was the
Case of the <hi>rich Epicure</hi> in the <hi>Gospel;</hi> how
did the <hi>jolly</hi> Wretch congratulate and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud
himself in the <hi>golden</hi> Purchace of his
Frauds and Oppressions? How did he vaunt
of his <hi>own</hi> Prudence, and <hi>good</hi> Conduct,
and strut and swell with <hi>munificent</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
of the <hi>happy</hi> Condition he was now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to when all of a sudden his <hi>unprepared</hi>
Soul was surprized with a Summons to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?
And then how <hi>blank</hi> did the <hi>Fool</hi> look
upon the <hi>fatal</hi> News, that <hi>that</hi> Night must
put an End to all his Hopes and Pleasures, and
deprive him of all those <hi>future</hi> Injoyments
with which he had promised to recompence
all his <hi>past</hi> Toils and Labours? With what
Regret and Reluctancy was he dragg'd from
the <hi>dear</hi> Purchase of his Sweat and Sin? and
in what Agonies of Horror did he groan out
his <hi>wretched</hi> Spirit, when instead of injoying
the <hi>Goods he had laid up for many Years,</hi> he
felt himself sinking into a <hi>woful</hi> Eternity,
and lie weltring <hi>there</hi> in <hi>unquenchable</hi> Flames,
whilst he hoped to have been wallowing <hi>here</hi>
in Ease and Voluptuousness? But suppose
we should injoy the many Years Ease which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63657:85"/>
this <hi>vain-glorious</hi> Fool was disappointed of;
alas those Years will quickly expire, and
<hi>Threescore and ten,</hi> or <hi>Fourscore</hi> at most, is
the <hi>utmost</hi> Period we can hope to arrive to;
but then from thence commenses an <hi>Eternity</hi>
of Misery which <hi>Millions</hi> of <hi>Millions</hi> of Ages
can neither shrink nor exhaust, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the <hi>longest</hi> Life of Pleasure hath
not the Proportion of one <hi>single</hi> moment.
So that if in Exchange for our Souls we
could purchase a Lease of Life as long as
<hi>Methuselah</hi>'s, and a Lease of Happiness pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
to that Life, yet in the Conclusion we
should find it a most <hi>woful</hi> Bargain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
when both these Leases are expired,
as they must at last though it be <hi>long</hi> first,
we must remove into a State of <hi>intollerable</hi>
Misery, whose Duration will be always e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
because it will be always infinitely
<hi>distant</hi> from a Period; and when we are
there, all that <hi>long</hi> Train of Happiness that
is <hi>past</hi> will seem but a Minute's Dream in
Comparison of that <hi>Eternity</hi> of Misery that
is to come. But, <hi>O good God,</hi> when for
<hi>thirty</hi> or <hi>forty</hi> Years Pleasure upon Earth, I
have suffered a <hi>thousand</hi> Years Torment in
<hi>Hell,</hi> and after that have <hi>endless Thousands
of Thousands</hi> more to suffer, how dearly
shall I rue my <hi>own</hi> Folly and Madness, that
for the sake of a <hi>few</hi> Moments Pleasure have
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:63657:85"/>
run my self headlong into such an <hi>endless</hi>
Misery! Consider therefore, O my Soul!
within a <hi>little</hi> while all these <hi>outward</hi> Goods,
which I have purchased by my Sin, will
signify no more to me than if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been, and all their <hi>alluring</hi> Relishes
will be gone and forgotten <hi>for ever;</hi> but
then for <hi>Ten thousand</hi> Millions of Ages after
I shall be feeling the Smart, and enduring
the Stings of them. When all my <hi>ill-gotten</hi>
Wealth is shrunk into a <hi>Winding-sheet,</hi> and
my <hi>vast</hi> Possessions into <hi>six foot</hi> of Earth,
and I have none of its Pomps or Pleasures
<hi>left</hi> either to go along with, or to follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
me, then will the Guilt of all stick close
to me, and raise a Cry on me as <hi>high</hi> as the
Tribunal of <hi>God;</hi> a Cry that will draw
down an <hi>everlasting</hi> Vengeance on my Head,
and ring Peals of Thunder in my Conscience
<hi>for ever.</hi> Lord! what a <hi>poor</hi> Amends then
is the <hi>momentary</hi> Injoyments of the Goods of
this World to me, that after a <hi>few</hi> Years must
pass into <hi>another,</hi> and there languish away a
<hi>long</hi> Eternity under the <hi>intollerable</hi> Anguish
of a <hi>damned</hi> Spirit.</p>
            <p>And thus you see, upon a <hi>just</hi> Survey of
the Gains of this World, and the Loss of a
Soul, how infinitely <hi>short</hi> the Happiness of
the <hi>one</hi> is to make us any <hi>tollerable</hi> Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63657:86"/>
for the Miseries of the <hi>other.</hi> And if
the Gain of all the World be <hi>too little</hi> to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail
this Loss, what <hi>miserable</hi> Losers are the
Generality of Men that forfeit their Souls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a far <hi>less valuable</hi> Consideration? For no
Man was ever yet, or is ever like to be so <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous</hi>
in his Sin, as to gain the whole World
by it; that is a <hi>Scramble</hi> in which Millions
are ingaged, and of which every one will be
catching a Share. But, alas, for the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
the Purchase of Mens Sin is so <hi>small</hi>
and <hi>inconsiderable,</hi> that it is scarce a <hi>valuable</hi>
Consideration for the Soul of a Rat. For
what doth the <hi>common</hi> Swearer get by all
his <hi>sensless</hi> and <hi>impertinent</hi> Oaths, which are
capable of serving no <hi>other</hi> Purpose but only
to stop the Gaps of his Speech, or to man his
Rage, and rave, and play the Fool with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
more genteely? What doth the Drunkard
gain by all his Intemperances, but only a
<hi>short</hi> Fit of <hi>frantick</hi> Mirth, and <hi>extravagant</hi>
Jollity; which, after a <hi>few</hi> Hours, ends in a
<hi>sleepless</hi> Night, a <hi>sick,</hi> and <hi>uneasy</hi> Stomach, and
a <hi>sottish</hi> Confusion over all his Senses? What
doth the <hi>envious</hi> and <hi>malicious</hi> Man get by
all his <hi>studied</hi> Mischiefs and Revenges?
When he hath pluck'd out his Enemy's Eye,
he cannot put it into his own Head, nor can
he increase the Stock of his <hi>own</hi> Happiness by
diminishing his Adversaries. When he hath
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63657:86"/>
made <hi>another</hi> the <hi>worse,</hi> he is never the <hi>better</hi>
for it; nor do his Injuries grow <hi>less</hi> by being
retaliated: So that he vexes and disquiets
himself to no purpose, but to make his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
bleed; he keeps his <hi>own</hi> Wound <hi>green,</hi> and
consequently multiplies Evils in vain, and
prosecutes Mischief only for Mischief's sake.
I confess there are some Vices that are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
so <hi>unprofitable</hi> as these; in <hi>some</hi> Vices
there is a Prospect of <hi>worldly</hi> Gain and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in <hi>others</hi> of <hi>sensitive</hi> Pleasure and Delight;
but alas, when after a <hi>few</hi> days Injoyment of
those Gains and Pleasures, I am called away
from them, and transported into a <hi>woful</hi> Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
there to expiate the Guilts of them with
those <hi>sharp</hi> and <hi>everlasting</hi> Torments I shall
be made to endure, how shall I be astonished
at my own <hi>desperate</hi> Folly to think what a
<hi>mad</hi> Bargain I have made? what an Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
I have sold to purchase those Gains?
what a Misery I have incurred to grasp and
injoy those Pleasures? O! now what would I
give for a <hi>Goal-delivery</hi> from <hi>Hell,</hi> or but for
the <hi>least</hi> Mitigation of my Agonies and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments!
If I had all the Wealth that I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
by my Sin, and ten thousand times
more, how willingly would I part with it to
bribe my Flames, and corrupt my Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors?
O! now I shall wish a thousand and a
thousand times that I had rather chosen to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:63657:87"/>
famish for want of Bread, than to injoy those
<hi>accursed</hi> Profits and Pleasures that were the
Fruits and Wages of mine Iniquities; but
now alas it will be <hi>too late</hi> to Repent. As yet
we have the Opportunity to retrieve <hi>our own</hi>
Folly, and to revoke and cancel this our <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
Bargain, and by our <hi>serious</hi> Repentance
and <hi>hearty</hi> Renunciation of the Temptations
of this World, we may release our selves from
our Covenant with Death, and Agreement
with Hell. But if we out-stay our Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
a <hi>few</hi> Moments longer, till Death hath
put an end to it, the <hi>fatal</hi> Bargain will be seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
past all Revocation.</p>

dwelt among us, (and we beheld his
Glory, the Glory as of the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of his Father) full of Grace

               <hi>THESE Words contain</hi> Three distinct
<hi>Propositions; I.</hi> The Word was
made Flesh: <hi>II.</hi> And dwelt among
us full of Grace and Truth: <hi>III.</hi> And we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
his Glory, the Glory as of the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
of his Father. <hi>Of each of these I intend
to discourse in their order.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:63657:88"/>
I. The first is, That <hi>the Word was made
Flesh.</hi> In handling of which I shall do these
three Things:</p>
            <p>1. Shew you what we are here to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by <hi>The Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Why it is called <hi>The Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. What we are to understand by <hi>The
Word's</hi> being made Flesh.</p>
            <p>1. What is meant by <hi>the Word?</hi> I answer
in general, That by <hi>the Word</hi> here we are
to understand Christ: For in the following
Verse you will find that this <hi>Word</hi> was He
of whom <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> was the <hi>Forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
and to whom he bare Witness, saying,
<hi>This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh
after me, is preferred before me; for he was
before me.</hi> And in the other <hi>Evangelists</hi> you
will find that it was <hi>Christ</hi> whose Forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the <hi>Baptist</hi> was, and to whom he gave
this Testmiony, as you may see at your lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 11. and <hi>Mark 1. 7. Luke</hi> 3. 16.
where you find <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> giving the same
Testimony to <hi>Christ</hi> which here he gives to
<hi>the Word,</hi> especially <hi>v.</hi> 27. of this Chapter.
Which is a plain Evidence that <hi>Christ</hi> and
the <hi>Word</hi> are only <hi>different</hi> Titles of the <hi>same</hi>
Person. But that I may more particularly
explain to you the Meaning of this Phrase,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63657:88"/>
I will briefly deliver my Sense of it in these
<hi>following</hi> Propositions:</p>
            <p>1. That this Phrase, <hi>The Word,</hi> as it is
by way of <hi>Eminence</hi> applied to a <hi>particular</hi>
Subject, is derived into the <hi>New Testament</hi>
from the <hi>Theology</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>New Testament</hi> giving no <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi>
Explication of it, it is most <hi>safe</hi> and
<hi>reasonable</hi> to fetch the Sense of it from that
<hi>ancient</hi> Theology whence it was derived.</p>
            <p>3. That the Theology from whence it
was derived, uses it to signify a <hi>vital</hi> and
<hi>Divine Subsistence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. That therefore our <hi>Saviour,</hi> to whom
it is applied in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> is that
<hi>vital</hi> and <hi>Divine Subsistence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That this Phrase <hi>The Word,</hi> as it is by
way of <hi>Eminency</hi> applied to a <hi>particular</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
is derived into the <hi>New Testament</hi> from
the <hi>Theology</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Which
will plainly appear to any one that shall
consider the <hi>exact</hi> Agreement between those
Titles and Characters which are given to
our <hi>Saviour</hi> in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> and those
which the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> give to the
<hi>Word,</hi> so often mentioned in their <hi>Theology<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
For as for this Phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The Word,</hi> it
is very anciently used in the Writings both
of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> For Rab. <hi>Azariel</hi> in
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:63657:89"/>
his Treatise of Holiness, quotes it out of the
<hi>Book of the Creation,</hi> which was written by
Rab. <hi>Abraham</hi> an <hi>ancient Cabalist,</hi> who the
<hi>Iews</hi> say was the <hi>Patriarch Abraham</hi> himself.
<hi>The Spirit,</hi> saith he, meaning the most High
God, <hi>bringeth forth the Word and the Voice,
and these Three are one God.</hi> Thus also it is
frequently used in the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase</hi> as
eminently appropriated to a <hi>Divine Person:</hi>
So in <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 17. instead of <hi>Israel shall
be saved in the Lord,</hi> they read it, <hi>by the
Word of the Lord;</hi> and <hi>Ierem.</hi> 1. 8. instead
of <hi>I am with thee,</hi> they read, <hi>because my Word
is with thee:</hi> and <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 1. instead of <hi>I am
thy shield,</hi> they read, <hi>my Word is thy shield;</hi>
and so in sundry other places. And, which
is very observable, <hi>Ps.</hi> 110. 1. instead of <hi>The
Lord said unto my Lord,</hi> they read, <hi>The Lord
said unto his Word;</hi> which Words our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
applies to himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 44. as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself that <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, there
mentioned. And in the same Sense also it
was very anciently used in the Writings of
the <hi>Gentile Philosophy.</hi> Thus <hi>Zeno,</hi> as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>

Men <hi>to behold and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate

And <hi>Plato</hi> 
               <note n="2" place="margin">Epinomis.</note> tells us,
that the Motions of the
Stars were disposed and
ordered by <hi>the Word.</hi> By
which it's plain that this
Phrase was used as appropriate to a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Person,</hi> both by <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> long
before the Writing of the <hi>New Testament.</hi>
And that the <hi>New Testament</hi> derived it from
their Writings is apparent; for that it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>same</hi> Titles and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
which they were wont to attribute
to the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Thus as the <hi>New Testament</hi>
calls <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Messias, The Word,</hi> so the

that is, <hi>the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and the End of God's
Good-will to the World;</hi> which is all one with
Propitiation.</p>
            <p>And these Authorities of <hi>Philo</hi> I have the
rather insisted upon, because he being a <hi>Iew</hi>
and a <hi>Platonick Philosopher,</hi> must needs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the <hi>Theology</hi> of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi>
and living about the Time of our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
he must be supposed to have written in <hi>Terms</hi>
that were then in use, and were very well
understood both by <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles:</hi> And
if so, then it must necessarily follow that this
Phrase <hi>The Word,</hi> so <hi>common</hi> in that <hi>Author,</hi>
was very commonly used both by <hi>Iews</hi> and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63657:92"/>
               <hi>Gentiles</hi> in our Saviour's Time, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that it was derived from them, and
so appropriated to our <hi>Saviour</hi> by the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Writers</hi> of the <hi>New Testament.</hi> And
indeed it is not to be imagined how those <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Writers</hi> should ever have so exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
with the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
and Characters of the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> had
not either they themselves, or <hi>the Spirit of
God,</hi> which dictated to them, purposely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
it from them.</p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>New Testament</hi> giving no <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi>
Explication of this Phrase <hi>The Word,</hi> it
is most <hi>safe</hi> and <hi>reasonable</hi> to fetch the Sense of
it from that <hi>ancient Theology</hi> whence it was
derived. I do not deny but it is usual with
all Writers to use <hi>Terms</hi> and <hi>Phrases</hi> by way
of Accommodation, and to illustrate their
Sense by alluding to something that is like it;
and therefore are not always to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in the Sense which those <hi>Terms</hi> and
<hi>Phrases</hi> do most commonly signify, but in a
Sense that hath some Proportion with it, as
the Drift and Connection of their Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>course
doth plainly intimate. But when Writers
use Words in a <hi>literal</hi> Sense, without any
Note of Allusion, and without explaining
themselves into any <hi>different</hi> Sense, either
they must mean the <hi>same</hi> Thing which those
Words do commonly signify, or else they
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63657:92"/>
must mean to deceive and impose upon their
Readers. And thus stands the Case before
us; our <hi>Saviour</hi> is here stiled <hi>The Word,</hi> a
<hi>Term of Art</hi> which was very <hi>common</hi> both in
the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Gentile Philosophy;</hi> and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
here, nor any where else, is there the
<hi>least</hi> Intimation that he is called so, only by
way of Allusion; nor is it in all the <hi>New
Testament</hi> explained into any <hi>other</hi> Sense
than that wherein it was commonly used;
and therefore the Intent of the <hi>Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
in using it must be either to denote the
<hi>same</hi> thing which it signified before, or to
deceive and impose upon the World. But
doubtless if the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which inspired
those Writers, had meant any thing else by
it than what it ordinarily signifies, he would
have told us of it, and not have given us such
an <hi>unavoidable</hi> Occasion to mistake in so
<hi>great</hi> a Doctrine, by clothing its Sense in such
a <hi>Phrase</hi> as generally signifies what he never
meant. For when he called <hi>Christ</hi> by the
<hi>same</hi> Name, and attributed the <hi>same</hi> Titles
and Characters by which the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
were wont to describe their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
he could not but foresee that all <hi>inquisitive</hi>
Persons would be apt to conclude that he
meant the <hi>same</hi> thing; and therefore if he
had not meant so, he would doubtless either
not have given him that Name, and those
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63657:93"/>
Titles, or else, to prevent our being impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon by them, he would have explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them into some <hi>other</hi> meaning; which
since he hath not done, we may safely and
rationally conclude that he meant the same
Thing by this Name, and those Titles with
those from whom he did derive them; and
consequently that the most <hi>certain</hi> way for
us to under<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tand what is the Sense of Christ's
being <hi>The Word,</hi> is to consider what those
<hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> meant by it from whose
<hi>Philosophy</hi> it was first borrowed and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>3. That both the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Gentile Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi>
used this Phrase <hi>The Word,</hi> to signify a
<hi>Vital</hi> and <hi>Divine Subsistence.</hi> For as for the
<hi>Iews,</hi> it's plain that by <hi>The Word</hi> they meant
the <hi>Messias;</hi> and therefore, <hi>Ps.</hi> 110. which
they say contains the Mysteries of the <hi>Messias,</hi>
the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase,</hi> instead of <hi>the Lord
said unto my Lord,</hi> read <hi>the Lord said unto his
Word,</hi> that is consequently to his <hi>Messias.</hi>
And Rab. <hi>Arama</hi> upon <hi>Genesis,</hi> explaining
that Passage in the 107 <hi>Ps. 20. The Lord sent
forth his Word, and they were healed;</hi> expresly
tells us, that by this <hi>Word</hi> is meant the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias.</hi>
And Rab. <hi>Simeon</hi> the Son of <hi>Iohni</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
those Words of <hi>Iob 19. 26. Yet in
my Flesh shall I see God,</hi> saith, that the Mercy
which proceeds from the <hi>highest</hi> Wisdom of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:63657:93"/>
               <hi>God</hi> shall be crowned by <hi>The Word,</hi> and
take Flesh of a Woman; by which it's
plain that by <hi>The Word</hi> he understood the
<hi>Messias.</hi> And that by the <hi>Messias</hi> they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
a <hi>Divine Subsistence,</hi> is evident from
<hi>sundry</hi> Places in the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase;</hi>
which often applies the Name <hi>Iehovah</hi> to
the <hi>Messias;</hi> which according to the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> ought not to be imparted to
any Creature; as particularly, <hi>Isa. 28. 5.
Iehovah Sabbaoth</hi> (for so it is in the <hi>Hebrew)
shall be a Crown of Glory unto the residue of his
People;</hi> which those Interpreters understand
concerning the <hi>Messias.</hi> So also <hi>Isa. 18. 7.
In that time shall the Present be brought unto
the Lord of Hosts;</hi> that is, say they, unto
the <hi>Messias.</hi> So also, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 33. 16. By <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah
our Righteousness,</hi> they understand the
<hi>Messias;</hi> and by the Name of the <hi>Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Moses Hadersan</hi> understands the Name
of the <hi>Messias,</hi> or <hi>Anointed King.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
had they not believed the <hi>Messias</hi> to
be a <hi>Divine Subsistence,</hi> they would never
have attributed to him this <hi>incommunicable</hi>
Name of God; of which they had so <hi>high</hi>
a Veneration, that they thought it <hi>too</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
for <hi>any</hi> Creature to name, and much
more to assume. And the <hi>Commentary</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>fourth Psalm</hi> expresly saith, <hi>Because
the Gentiles cease not to ask us, Where is our
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63657:94"/>
God, the time will come that God will sit among
the Righteous, so as they shall be able to point
him out with the finger;</hi> which plainly refers
to the Coming of the <hi>Messias.</hi> And so also
the <hi>Septuagint</hi> change <hi>Shaddai,</hi> the <hi>undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
Name of the <hi>Omnipotent God,</hi> into
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>The Word, Ezek.</hi> 1. 24. where, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>the Voice of God,</hi> (as it is in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew)</hi>
they read <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Voice of the
Word of God.</hi> And so also the <hi>afore-named
Paraphrase,</hi> as I have already hinted, doth
often use the <hi>Word of God</hi> for <hi>God</hi> himself,
and that more especially with relation to the
Creation of the World. Thus instead of
<hi>I made the Earth, Isa.</hi> 45. 12. they read it, <hi>I
by my Word made the Earth:</hi> And instead
of <hi>God made Man, Gen.</hi> 1. 27. the <hi>Ierusalem
Targum</hi> reads, <hi>And the Word of the Lord</hi>
made Man: And instead of <hi>They heard the
Voice of the Lord, Gen.</hi> 3. 8. the <hi>Paraphrase</hi>
reads it, <hi>And they heard the Voice of the Word
of the Lord God.</hi> And <hi>Philo</hi> expresly calls
<hi>this Word</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Second God</hi>
next to the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Iews</hi> believed <hi>The Word</hi> to be
a <hi>Divine Subsistence,</hi> so did the <hi>Gentiles</hi> also.
For so <hi>Numenius</hi> the <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> as he is
quoted by St. <hi>Cyril</hi>
               <note n="1" place="margin">Cyril cont. Julian. l. 8.</note>, calls
the <hi>Father</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> and
the <hi>Word</hi> the <hi>Second God;</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:63657:94"/>
and <hi>Plotin</hi> tells us<note n="1" place="margin">Enn. 5. l. 1. c. 6.</note>, <hi>that
this Word, or Image of God,
beholdeth God, and is inseparably joined with
him;</hi> and <hi>Porphyry,</hi> as he is cited by the
<hi>fore-named</hi> Father<note n="2" place="margin">Cyril. ibid. l. 1.</note>, tells us
that the <hi>Essence of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to Three In-beings,</hi> viz. <hi>the highest Good,
which is the Father, and the Maker of all things,
which is the Word, and the Soul of the World;</hi>
and these he also calls the <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>Second,</hi>
and <hi>Third God.</hi> And of <hi>Pythagoras Proclus</hi>
the <hi>Platonist</hi> affirms, <hi>that he commended
Three Gods together in ONE,</hi> (even as <hi>Plato</hi>
also doth) the <hi>Second</hi> of which was the
<hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Wisdom,</hi> whereunto he attributes
the Creation of the World. And <hi>Plato,</hi> in
his 6th Epistle, so far owns the <hi>Divinity</hi> of
the <hi>Word,</hi> that he earnestly exhorts his
Friends that they should <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
that is, <hi>invocate
God the Governour of all things that are and
shall be, and also the Lord and Father of that
Prince and Govenour;</hi> by the <hi>first</hi> of which
he evidently means <hi>The Word,</hi> since 'tis to
<hi>the Word</hi> that he elsewhere<note n="3" place="margin">Plat. Epinom.</note>
attributes the Government
of the <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Heavenly Bodies.</hi> By all
which it is apparent, that by <hi>The Word</hi> they
understood some <hi>Divine Subsistence,</hi> whose
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:63657:95"/>
Nature is exalted above all <hi>finite</hi> Beings what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever;
and therefore,</p>
            <p>4. And lastly, Our <hi>Saviour,</hi> to whom this
Phrase <hi>The Word</hi> is applied, must be that
<hi>Divine Person</hi> or <hi>Subsistence.</hi> And so we
find him stiled in the first Verse of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
<hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi>
Which Expressions are so exactly agreeable
to the Phrase of the <hi>Gentile Theology,</hi> that
<hi>Amelius</hi> the Disciple of <hi>Plotin,</hi> and a <hi>great</hi>
Enemy to the <hi>Christians,</hi> was forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that this is that <hi>Word</hi> which was
from <hi>Everlasting,</hi> and by whom all things
were made, as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> supposed: And,
<hi>per Iovem,</hi> saith he, <hi>Barbarus isle,</hi> meaning
St. <hi>Iohn, cum nostro</hi> Platone <hi>consentit, Verbum

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. Dei, l. 10.</note>.
<hi>This Barbarian is of our</hi>
Plato'<hi>s Mind, that the Word
of God is ranked among the Principles.</hi> And
indeed, unless we understand this Place of
the <hi>Eternal Deity</hi> of <hi>The Word,</hi> I know not
how it will be possible to make any <hi>tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Sense of it; for if by <hi>In the Beginning</hi>
here, we understand, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> would
have us, in the <hi>beginning of the Gospel</hi> when
<hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> began to preach, the Words
will imply a <hi>gross</hi> Tautology, and the Sense
of them must be this; that <hi>Christ</hi> was when
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63657:95"/>
               <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> preached that he was, or which
is all one, that he was when he was. For
how can it be worthy of an <hi>Apostle</hi> so so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
to assert, that <hi>the Word</hi> had a <hi>Being</hi>
in the Beginning of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> when we
know the <hi>Baptist</hi> taught as much himself?
who therefore came <hi>baptizing with water,
that he should be made manifest to Israel, Ioh.</hi>
1. 31. And when St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi>
who wrote before, taught us more than this,
<hi>viz.</hi> That he was in being <hi>thirty</hi> Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when we are sure it was as true of any
<hi>other</hi> then living as of <hi>the Word,</hi> even of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
that betrayed him, and <hi>Pilate</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
him. By <hi>in the Beginning,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be meant the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the
World; and that even then, <hi>the Word was
with God, and the Word was God.</hi> So <hi>Phil.
2. 6, 7. Who being in the form of God, thought
it no robbery to be equal with God; but made
himself of no reputation, and took upon him the
form of a Servant, and was made in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Men.</hi> From whence these <hi>three</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
do most naturally result; <hi>First,</hi>
That <hi>Christ</hi> was <hi>in the form of a Servant</hi> as
soon as he was made Man: <hi>Secondly,</hi> That
he was <hi>in the form of God</hi> before he was <hi>in
the form of a Servant:</hi> And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That
he was in the <hi>form of God;</hi> that is, did as
really and truly subsist in the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:63657:96"/>
as in the <hi>form of a Servant,</hi> or in the
Nature of Man. For the Words literally
translated run thus; But emptied himself,
taking the Form of a Servant, being in the
Likeness of Men: Which plainly implies,
that <hi>Christ</hi> was <hi>full</hi> before he emptied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that he emptied himself by taking the
<hi>form of a Servant,</hi> that he took the <hi>form of
a Servant</hi> by being made in the <hi>likeness of
Men;</hi> which <hi>Emptying</hi> presupposes a <hi>prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Plenitude,</hi> and which <hi>Plenitude</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in being so in the <hi>form of God</hi> as to think
it <hi>no Robbery to be equal with God.</hi> So <hi>Rev.</hi>
1. 11. he solemnly proclaims his <hi>own</hi> Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
<hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the first and
the last;</hi> which is the <hi>incommunicable</hi> Title
by which <hi>God</hi> describes his own Being, and
distinguishes it from all others. And <hi>Isa.
44. 6. I am the first, and I am the last, and
besides me there is no God.</hi> These and many
other <hi>plain</hi> Assertions there are in the <hi>New
Testament,</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Deity</hi> of the <hi>Blessed
Word.</hi> But since the <hi>Eternal God</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
both by the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by this Phrase <hi>the Word,</hi> there is no
Reason to imagine that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> should make
use of it in any <hi>other</hi> Notion; since in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he would have imposed upon the World,
and taken an <hi>effectual</hi> Course to make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he meant what he never intended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:63657:96"/>
And so I have done with the <hi>first</hi> Thing
proposed, which was to shew you what is
here meant by Christ's being <hi>the Word;</hi> the
Design of which, you see is to express his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Godhead</hi> and <hi>Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I now proceed to the <hi>next</hi> Thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
which was to shew you for what
Reason it is that he is here called <hi>The Word?</hi>
In answer whereunto, it is to be considered
that the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> hath a <hi>twofold</hi> Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification:
<hi>First,</hi> It signifies <hi>Reason,</hi> which
is the inferring <hi>one</hi> thing from <hi>another,</hi> and
this is the Birth and Off-spring of the Mind.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> It signifies <hi>Speech,</hi> which is an <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible</hi>
Expression of our Thoughts and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings,
and this is the Image and Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of our Minds; and it is also the <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of the Mind, especially in those who are
in <hi>Sovereign</hi> Authority, and do rule by their
Word and Command. Now our <hi>Blessed
Saviour</hi> is called <hi>the Word</hi> upon <hi>both</hi> these
Accounts, both as he is the <hi>Reason,</hi> and the
<hi>Speech</hi> of God; and accordingly his being
<hi>the Word</hi> denotes these four Things:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> His being <hi>generated</hi> of the Mind of
the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> His being the <hi>perfect</hi> Image of that
Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:63657:97"/>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> His being the <hi>Interpreter</hi> of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Mind to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> His being the <hi>Executer</hi> of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> His being <hi>generated</hi> of the Mind of
the Father, even as our <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> is
the Issue and Off-spring of our Minds. For
it was the Opinion both of the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
that the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> is nothing else
but that most <hi>perfect Notion, Idea,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi>
which <hi>God</hi> from the Beginning had
formed of <hi>himself,</hi> and all <hi>other</hi> Beings in his
own Mind. For thus the <hi>Iews</hi> tell us, that
every thing <hi>below</hi> hath some Root above;
which Roots, say they, are the <hi>Sephiroth,</hi> or
Seals by which all these <hi>inferiour</hi> Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are stamp'd, and shaped, and fashion'd;
and these Seals, they tell us, are those most
<hi>perfect Ideas</hi> of things which <hi>God</hi> did form
in his own Mind, according to which he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned
all the Beings that are in the World.
<hi>For,</hi> say they,<note n="1" place="margin">

which is sealed, and receiveth the Sealing here

he printed them quite through the Bottom

an <hi>exact</hi> Resemblance to those <hi>Ideas</hi> which
he had formed of them in his own Mind.

it being, according to their <hi>Divinity</hi>
nothing else but that most <hi>perfect Conception</hi>

of <hi>himself,</hi> and all <hi>other</hi> Beings, in his own

call <hi>The Word</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, or <hi>Vnderstanding</hi>

<hi>Alcinous</hi> tells us<note n="2" place="margin">Alein de Doctrinâ Platonis.</note>, that

<hi>taught that God is a Mind,
and that in the same there is a certain Idea
which in respect of God, is that Knowledge
which God hath of himself, and in respect of
the World, is the Pattern or Mould thereof,
and in respect of it self, is very Essence.</hi> And
<hi>Plotin</hi> tells us<note n="3" place="margin">Plot. Enn. 5. l. 6. c. 1.</note>, that <hi>God is
both the Party that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

in the Mind or Vnderstanding, and also
the Party that conceives him;</hi> and he makes
<hi>The Word</hi> to be that which <hi>God</hi> doth mind
in himself, which is <hi>Himself,</hi> and his own
<hi>immense</hi> Perfections; and that the Nature
of that <hi>Idea</hi> of himself which he beholds in
<hi>himself</hi> is an Act that issues from him, which
consists in beholding and minding of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and in beholding him becomes the <hi>self
same</hi> thing with him. And this <hi>Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
or <hi>Knowledge</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he calls<note n="1" place="margin">Enn. 5. l. 8. c 12. &amp; Enn. 5. l. 1. c. 7.</note>, <hi>the Son of
the Sovereign Father, that
bears the like Resemblance to
him, as the Light doth to the Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
And, to name no more, <hi>Porphyry,</hi>
as he is quoted by St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> tells us, <hi>That it
was the Doctrine of</hi> Plato, <hi>that of the Good,</hi>
(which elsewhere he calls the Father) <hi>is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
an Vnderstanding in a manner unknown
to Men, in which are all things that truly are,
and the Essences of all things that have a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
that is, the <hi>substantial Ideas</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and
all <hi>created</hi> things whatsoever. And upon
this account it is, that they call this <hi>Divine</hi>
Subsistence <hi>The Word,</hi> because it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by the <hi>Mind</hi> of the Father, even as
our Words are generated by our Minds.
And accordingly the <hi>ancient Iews,</hi> and <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Fathers,</hi> do generally expound that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63657:99"/>
               <hi>great Elogium</hi> of <hi>Wisdom, Prov.</hi> 8. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Eternal Word;</hi> where it is said, that
<hi>Wisdom was set up from everlasting, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
by God in the beginning of his way; that
it was brought forth by him before the World;</hi>
and that when he appointed the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Earth, then <hi>was it by him, as one
brought up with him, and was daily his delight,
rejoycing always before him,</hi> v. 22.—31. And
this Notion the <hi>New Testament</hi> doth plainly
refer to when it calls <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Wisdom of
God, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 24. which is the same Title
that both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Platonists</hi> give to <hi>The
Word</hi> upon the account of his being that
<hi>Eternal Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> which
<hi>God</hi> hath of <hi>himself</hi> and all <hi>other</hi> Beings; and
in this, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 4. the <hi>Apostle</hi> seems plainly
to hint this Notion to us; for speaking
there of <hi>The Word, In him,</hi> saith he, <hi>was
Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</hi>
Now I think it will be hard to give any <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
Account how that <hi>Life</hi> that was in
<hi>The Word</hi> should enlighten Men, unless we
suppose his very <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> to consist
in <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding;</hi> for by the
<hi>Light of Men</hi> here is plainly meant that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
Knowledge which is revealed to the
World by <hi>Christ;</hi> and this <hi>Divine</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
he tells us is the very <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>The Word,</hi>
or the <hi>Life</hi> that was in <hi>The Word:</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:63657:99"/>
he expresly calls <hi>The Word</hi> the <hi>Light</hi>
it self from whence all our Knowledge of
<hi>God</hi> and Goodness is derived, <hi>v.</hi> 9. which
is exactly the same with what <hi>Philo</hi> saith of

the <hi>Iew</hi> also doth very frequently call <hi>The

<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the most perfect
and exact Representation of God.</hi> For they
suppose that <hi>God</hi> being <hi>Omniscient</hi> he must
necessarily know himself, and that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself, necessarily he must act <hi>ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremum
Virium,</hi> to the utmost of his Power,
even as all <hi>other necessary</hi> Agents do; that
acting to the utmost of his Power, he must
by knowing himself produce as perfect an
<hi>Image, Idea,</hi> or <hi>Notion</hi> of himself in his own
Understanding as it was possible for him to
do; that it was possible for him to produce
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:63657:100"/>
such a <hi>vital</hi> and <hi>substantial Idea</hi> of himself
as is vested with all the <hi>infinite</hi> Perfections
of his Nature; and consequently that such
an <hi>Idea</hi> he hath produced, and that this <hi>Idea</hi>
is the <hi>Eternal Word.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> can do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
doth not imply a Contradiction;
now there is nothing in <hi>God</hi> but what he can
communicate without a Contradiction, but
only <hi>Self-Existence;</hi> that implies a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
indeed, for <hi>God</hi> to cause <hi>another</hi>
thing to be without any Cause, and to exist
of it self. But as for all his <hi>other</hi> Perfections
he may communicate them; and when he
acts necessarily, as he is supposed to do in the
Generation of <hi>the Word,</hi> he must, because
then he acts to his utmost Possibility. So then
<hi>The Word</hi> must have the same <hi>Nature, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi>
and <hi>Perfections</hi> with the <hi>Father;</hi> and
the only <hi>imaginable</hi> Difference between them
must be this; that whereas the <hi>Father</hi> exists
of himself, <hi>the Word</hi> exists of the <hi>Father;</hi>
which is exactly agreeable to the <hi>Catholick
Notion</hi> of <hi>Christians.</hi> And indeed if it be
granted that <hi>God,</hi> who is infinitely <hi>knowing,</hi>
must necessarily know himself perfectly,
then it will seem to follow, that there must
be the <hi>same</hi> Perfections in that <hi>Idea</hi> or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by which he knows <hi>himself,</hi> that there
are in himself; for else it is not one <hi>perfect
Idea</hi> of him. And hence it is that our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:63657:101"/>
do so imperfectly <hi>resemble</hi> things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we cannot communicate to them that
<hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Substance</hi> that is in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and therefore if <hi>God</hi> knows himself
perfectly, as he must needs do being infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>knowing,</hi> he must communicate <hi>Life</hi> and
<hi>Substance</hi> to the Notion of himself, or else
'twill be no <hi>perfect</hi> Notion of his Life and
Substance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he must communicate to it
all the <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mense</hi> Perfections of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or else 'twill be no <hi>perfect</hi> Notion of
his own Perfections. So then the <hi>Eternal
Word,</hi> which is here supposed to be the most
<hi>perfect</hi> Notion of the <hi>Father,</hi> must be a <hi>vital</hi>
and <hi>substantial Idea,</hi> endued with all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> which is also
very agreeable with the <hi>Christian</hi> Notion of
the <hi>Divine Word:</hi> For he is described to be
the <hi>Image of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4. <hi>the Brightness
of his Glory, and the express Character of his
Person, Heb.</hi> 1. 3. and being so he must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be what <hi>God</hi> is, <hi>i. e. God essential,</hi>
or else he cannot be the <hi>perfect</hi> Image, and
<hi>express</hi> Character of <hi>God.</hi> And accordingly
in the <hi>New Testament</hi> he is called <hi>God over
all, blessed for ever, Rom.</hi> 9. 5. and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> are very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
attributed to him, as particularly
<hi>Omniscience, Iohn 16. 30. Eternity, Heb.</hi> 1. 12.
and <hi>Rev. 22. 13. I am Alpha and Omega, the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:63657:101"/>
beginning and the end, the first and the last.</hi>
So that upon this Account also he may very
properly be called <hi>The Word of God,</hi> because
as our Words are the Images of our Minds,
so <hi>He</hi> is the most <hi>perfect</hi> Image of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> He is called <hi>The Word,</hi> because he

him <hi>the Interpreter of the Mind of God to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:63657:102"/>
Men:</hi> So that it seems it was upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
as well as others, that He was called
by the <hi>Ancients, The Word of God.</hi> And
the same Account is given of it in the <hi>New
Testament.</hi> So <hi>Ioh. 1. 18. No Man hath seen
God at any time; the only begotten Son, which
is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared
him.</hi> Where there is a <hi>particular</hi> Reason
assigned, why though <hi>other</hi> Men interpreted
the Mind of <hi>God</hi> to us, yet <hi>Christ</hi> alone is
called <hi>The Word of God;</hi> because he only
was the <hi>immediate</hi> Interpreter of the <hi>Divine</hi>
Will, even as the Word which we speak is
of ours. For he was in the very Bosom of
the Father, and there understood his Mind
not by the Instructions of an <hi>Angel,</hi> nor by
<hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Visions,</hi> nor only by the <hi>Holy
Ghost,</hi> but by an <hi>immediate</hi> Intuition of his
Thoughts and Purposes which from all <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi>
were exposed to his View and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.
For as St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> hath
observed, He had the <hi>same</hi> Relation to the
Father, as the <hi>inward</hi> Thought hath to the
Mind, because of his <hi>intimate</hi> Conjunction
with him, and Power to declare him to the
World. For the <hi>Father</hi> is known by the
<hi>Son,</hi> who is a <hi>brief</hi> and <hi>easy</hi> Demonstration
of the <hi>Father,</hi> as every thing that is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
is <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:63657:102"/>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> And lastly, He is called <hi>The Word,</hi>
because he is the <hi>Executor</hi> of his Father's
Will, even as the Word and Command of
a King is the Executor of his Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
For according to the Sense of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,</hi>
God hath from the very Beginning
governed the World by his <hi>eternal</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

whom they therefore call the <hi>Immortal
King,</hi> the <hi>Governor of all things that are or
shall be,</hi> and the <hi>Vice-Roy of the great God,</hi>
as I have already shewed you at large. And
'twas by this <hi>Word</hi> that <hi>God</hi> executed his
Will when he made the World; <hi>For by his
Word he made the Heavens, and all the Host
of them, by the Breath of his mouth, Ps.</hi> 33. 6.
He did but say the word, <hi>Let there be Light,
and there was Light;</hi> and to his <hi>powerful</hi> and
<hi>efficacious Fiat</hi> the whole Frame of Nature
was but a <hi>real Eccho.</hi> For these Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Let there be Light,</hi> and <hi>let there be a Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,</hi>
&amp;c. are not perhaps so to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
as if <hi>God</hi> did actually pronounce those
Syllables, but they rather seem to be a <hi>popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
Description of the <hi>infinite</hi> Energy of the
<hi>Eternal Word</hi> by which <hi>God</hi> made the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi>
and the <hi>Earth,</hi> to whom it was as easy
to give Being to the World as it was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it to be; and that Passage of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,
<hi>by the Word of the Lord were the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
made,</hi> and of the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:63657:103"/>
Heb.</hi> 11. 3. that <hi>the Worlds were framed by the
Word of God,</hi> seem rather to denote that
<hi>powerful</hi> Act of Creation which was exerted
by the <hi>vital</hi> and <hi>substantial Word</hi> of <hi>God;</hi>
whereby he instantly, and as it were with
a words speaking, gave <hi>Existence</hi> to those
Beings he intended to create, than any <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate</hi>
Words or Phrases pronounced by
<hi>God</hi> himself; because in this Chapter, and
many <hi>other</hi> Places of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> it
is expresly said that <hi>God</hi> made the World
by <hi>Christ,</hi> who is that <hi>living</hi> and <hi>substantial
Word</hi> that was with <hi>God</hi> from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Well therefore may <hi>Christ</hi> be called
<hi>The Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> since by him <hi>God</hi> doth as
effectually execute his Will, as if it were
done by the Word of his own Mouth. For
<hi>Christ</hi> hath such Power both in <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<hi>Earth,</hi> that at his Word and Command all
things are presently done according to his
Will; and therefore you may observe in
that <hi>Vision</hi> to St. <hi>Iohn, Rev. 19. 13. Iesus,</hi>
being represented as the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and
<hi>Lord of Lords, clothed in a royal Purple Robe,</hi>
is called by the name of <hi>the Word of God,</hi>
when he was executing the <hi>Divine</hi> Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
upon the <hi>Nations</hi> by that Power
which he hath at God's Right-hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:63657:103"/>
3. I now pass on to the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>last</hi>
Thing, namely, what we are to understand
by <hi>the Word's being made Flesh;</hi> of which I
shall give you a <hi>brief</hi> Account, and then
conclude with a few short Inferences from
the whole. Which Words, <hi>being made
Flesh,</hi> we ought not so to understand as if the
<hi>Eternal Word</hi> was changed or converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Flesh, as <hi>Cerinthus</hi> taught; or as if the
Flesh was changed or converted into <hi>the
Word,</hi> as <hi>Valentinus</hi> ridiculously asserted;
for the <hi>Deity</hi> is <hi>immutable,</hi> and as it can be
changed into <hi>nothing,</hi> so <hi>nothing</hi> can be
changed into it. But by <hi>Flesh</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Part</hi> being put for the
<hi>Whole;</hi> for so the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
call Man <hi>Flesh,</hi> that being <hi>one</hi> of
the Ingredients of his Nature. Thus <hi>Ps. 56. 4.
I will not fear what flesh can do unto me: Ierem.
17. 5. Cursed be the Man that maketh flesh his
arm,</hi> that is, that puts his Confidence in
Man: <hi>Matth. 24. 22. Except those days be
shortned, no flesh shall be saved;</hi> that is, no
Man: And <hi>Rom. 3. 20. No flesh shall be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in his sight,</hi> that is, no Man shall be
justified. So here, <hi>The Word was made flesh,</hi>
that is, <hi>The Word</hi> was made Man. Not
that the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> was converted into
the Nature of Man, but the Meaning is,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:63657:104"/>
               <hi>it</hi> was made <hi>one</hi> with Man, even as our <hi>Soul</hi>
is not turned into nor confounded with the
<hi>Body;</hi> yet they <hi>two,</hi> though <hi>distinct</hi> in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
grow into one Man; so the <hi>Manhood</hi>
of <hi>Christ</hi> was assumed, or taken into <hi>The
Word,</hi> both being united into <hi>one</hi> Person, the
Natures being preserved <hi>entire</hi> and <hi>distinct,</hi>
without any Mixture or Confusion. For as
the <hi>Fourth General Council</hi> hath defined it,
<hi>He was so made Flesh that he ceased not to be
the Word, never changing that he was, but
assuming that which he was not.</hi> And though
our <hi>Humanity</hi> was advanced by it, yet his
<hi>Divinity</hi> was not at all diminished, and the
Mystery of Godliness, <hi>God manifested in the
flesh,</hi> was no Detriment to the <hi>Godhead,</hi>
which is always <hi>unchangeably</hi> the same:
And therefore the <hi>seeming</hi> Harshness of this
Expression may be easily mollified by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
it with others of the same import;
for elsewhere it is said, that <hi>he was manifest
in the flesh, 1 Tim.</hi> 3. 16. Which only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
that the <hi>Divinity</hi> was made known,
and did appear in the World in a <hi>Humane
Nature.</hi> Elsewhere it is said, that <hi>he took on
him the Nature of Man, Heb.</hi> 2. 16. which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denotes that the <hi>Divinity</hi> did assume the
<hi>Humane Nature</hi> to it, and was personally
united with it. So here, <hi>The Word was
made flesh;</hi> that is, <hi>The Word</hi> was made
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:63657:104"/>
               <hi>one</hi> with the Flesh by assuming the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature</hi> into a <hi>personal</hi> Union with it
self.</p>
            <p>Having thus explain'd to you the Sense
and Meaning of the Words, I shall now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this Argument with <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi>
short Inferences from the whole.</p>
            <p>1. From hence we may infer the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Divinity</hi> of our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> even
from this <hi>great</hi> name <hi>The Word,</hi> that is here
attributed to him. For since it is so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
that this Phrase is a <hi>Term of Art</hi> deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the <hi>Schools</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
and since by it they did all so general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand a <hi>Divine Person</hi> subsisting
from all <hi>Eternity,</hi> it must necessarily follow
that the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> deriving it from them
and applying it to our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> must
use it to the <hi>same</hi> Sense; for otherwise He
were better never to have used it at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by discoursing in the <hi>same</hi> Language
with them, he will give us <hi>just</hi> occasion to
think that he means the <hi>same</hi> thing, namely,
that <hi>Christ,</hi> whom he calls <hi>The Word,</hi> is a
<hi>Divine</hi> Person subsisting from all <hi>Eternity;</hi>
which if he doth not mean by using that
Term, he will almost necessarily betray us
into a <hi>false</hi> Belief concerning our <hi>Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
As, to instance briefly in a Case of anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r
Nature; Our <hi>Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in his Sermons d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>h
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:63657:105"/>
frequently press us to <hi>Meekness</hi> and <hi>Patience,
Humilty</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> all which are <hi>Terms</hi>
frequently used long before in the <hi>Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi>
both of the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by
which they signify such and such <hi>particular</hi>
Virtues. Since therefore our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth
use the <hi>same</hi> Terms with them, we have <hi>just</hi>
Reason to conclude that he means the <hi>same</hi>
Virtues by them; and should he mean any
thing else, his very using of these Terms
would necessarily impose upon us a <hi>false</hi>
Sense of his meaning; for how should we
understand his Meaning but by his Words,
and how should we understand his Words
but by the <hi>common</hi> Import and Signification
of them? And can we imagine that the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Truth</hi> would have ever described our
<hi>Saviour</hi> by a <hi>Term</hi> that was so generally used
to signify a <hi>Divine Person</hi> subsisting from all
<hi>Eternity,</hi> and used it <hi>too,</hi> as he doth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Restraint or Limitation, nay and so
seemingly at least to the <hi>same</hi> Purpose, as he
doth in the <hi>three first Verses</hi> of this Chapter,
where he describes the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> and
<hi>Operations</hi> of <hi>Christ The Word,</hi> in the same
terms in which the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were
wont to describe the <hi>Divinity</hi> of their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
can we imagine, I say, that the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>
would have done thus, had he known <hi>Christ</hi>
to be nothing but a <hi>meer</hi> Man that never was
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:63657:105"/>
before he was born of his Mother? Far be it
from us to charge that <hi>Blessed Spirit</hi> with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
such a Delusion upon Mankind.</p>
            <p>2. Hence I infer the <hi>astonishing</hi> Love of
our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> in condescending so low
as to be made <hi>Flesh</hi> for us, and assume our
Nature. For what he was before he took
our Nature, you have heard already: He
was no <hi>less</hi> than the <hi>Eternal Word of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
in whose Bosom he enjoyed the <hi>supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest</hi>
Degree of Bliss and Happiness, being
crowned with Glory, and incircled about
with the <hi>Essential</hi> Rays of the <hi>Divinity.</hi>
And yet such was his Love to <hi>poor</hi> Mortals,
so <hi>infinite</hi> was his Zeal and Concern for
our Happiness, that, seeing the Misery we
were plunged into, he could not rest, no
not in the <hi>blessed</hi> Arms of his Father, but
stript himself of all his Majesty and Bliss,
and comes down among us, and assumes
our Nature to save and rescue us, and invite
and lead us to those <hi>Heavenly</hi> Mansions
from whence he descended to us. Lord,
what a <hi>Prodigy</hi> of Love was here, as doth
not only <hi>puzzle</hi> my Conceit, but <hi>out-reach</hi>
my Wonder and Admiration! For when I
seriously consider it, though it be a Blessing
beyond all my Hopes, and such as I could
never have had the Impudence to desire;
yet it fills my Mind with an <hi>awful</hi> Horror
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:63657:106"/>
to think that there was a Time when the
<hi>great</hi> God was here upon the Earth in my
Form and Nature, and conversed familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with such <hi>mortal</hi> Wights as my self, and
for my sake, and such <hi>poor</hi> Worms as I,
patiently under-went the <hi>common</hi> Infirmities
of Men, and willingly exposed himself to
the Contempt and Scorn of a <hi>malevolent</hi>
World, and the Malice and Cruelty of those
<hi>barbarous</hi> Men to whom he gave Being, and
could with the Breath of his Nostrils have
scattered into <hi>Atoms,</hi> and all this in <hi>meer</hi>
Compassion to a Company of <hi>apostatized</hi>
Natures, who had so highly deserved to be
thrown from his Care and Mercy <hi>for ever.</hi>
O my Soul, how am I astonished at this
<hi>Miracle</hi> of Love! Methinks when I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it I am looking down from a <hi>stupendous</hi>
Precipice, whose Height <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ills me with a
<hi>trembling</hi> Horror, and even over-setting
Reason.</p>
            <p>3. From hence I infer what <hi>mighty</hi> Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
we have <hi>for ever</hi> to love and serve
our <hi>Blessed Redeemer.</hi> If our Hearts are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being warmed into <hi>any</hi> degree of
Affection, sure 'tis impossible but we must
be affected at such an <hi>unheard</hi> of Instance of
Love. For the <hi>Son of God</hi> to leave his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Bosom, where he was infinitely more
<hi>happy</hi> than we can express and think of, and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:63657:106"/>
disguise himself in <hi>mortal</hi> Flesh, and become
a <hi>Man of Sorrows</hi> that he might make me a
Man of <hi>endless</hi> Joys; can my Heart hold
when I think of this? Is it possible I should
reflect upon such a <hi>prodigious</hi> Instance of
Affection without being wrapt into an <hi>Extasy</hi>
of Love? <hi>Blessed Iesus,</hi> what <hi>barbarous</hi>
Hearts do we carry about with us, that
will not melt before the Flames of thy Love!
Flames that are sufficient to kindle <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims,</hi>
and to fill all <hi>reasonable</hi> Breasts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with
<hi>burning</hi> Affections towards thee! For how
is it possible that any <hi>Man,</hi> I had almost
said that any <hi>Devil,</hi> should be so <hi>disingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
and <hi>ill-natured</hi> as not to be affected with
such <hi>stupendous</hi> Kindness? When we see a
Child slight his <hi>careful</hi> and <hi>indulgent</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
we are ready to account him an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi>
Monster; when we see a Man neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
his Friend, or disregard his Benefactor,
we presently call him <hi>base</hi> and <hi>ungrateful;</hi>
nay when we see one abuse a <hi>poor brute</hi>
Creature that fawns upon him, and expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
its Kindness to him, we look upon it as
an <hi>undoubted</hi> Sign of a very <hi>hard</hi> Heart, and
an <hi>ill</hi> Nature: What Term then can we
find in all <hi>the World of Words</hi> that is <hi>odious</hi>
enough to express our Disaffection to our
<hi>Blessed Redeemer,</hi> to whom we are so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
obliged? <hi>Base, Disingenuous, Ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:63657:107"/>
and <hi>Vngrateful,</hi> are all <hi>too</hi> soft; 'tis
something beyond <hi>Barbarous</hi> and <hi>Devilish.</hi>
For one would think that neither the most
<hi>inhumane Canibal</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> nor the <hi>blackest
Devil</hi> in <hi>Hell,</hi> could ever be guilty of so <hi>foul</hi>
a Crime, which hath something in it <hi>too
monstrous</hi> for any Words to express. Well
therefore may the <hi>Heavens</hi> be astonished,
and the <hi>Earth</hi> tremble, and all the Creation
of <hi>God</hi> stand amazed at us, to see how <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible</hi>
we are of this most <hi>ravishing</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing</hi>
Love. Well may we be amazed
at our selves, and wonder at <hi>our own</hi> Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
to think that the <hi>Son of God</hi> should be
so <hi>kind</hi> as to come down from <hi>Heaven</hi> to
visit us, to leave the Habitation of his Glory,
and sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oud his <hi>Divinity</hi> in <hi>mortal</hi> Flesh, and
make himself a <hi>miserable</hi> Wight, meerly
that he might make us <hi>happy,</hi> and advance
us to that Glory and Bliss which for our
sakes he willingly abandoned; and yet that
we are no more touched and affected with
it, than with the most <hi>indifferent</hi> Thing in
the World. <hi>Blessed God,</hi> what are we made
of? What kind of Souls do we carry about
with us, that no Kindness will oblige us,
no not the most <hi>endearing</hi> that ever was
known or heard of? Doubtless should any
Man have shewn us but half this Kindness,
should a <hi>Friend</hi> but offer to die for us, or a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:63657:107"/>
               <hi>Prince</hi> to descend from his Throne, and put
himself into the State of a <hi>Beggar</hi> to inrich
and advance us in the World, we should
have thought our selves bound to him as
long as we lived; and should we have
thought any Services <hi>too</hi> much, any Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
<hi>too dear</hi> for him, we should have been
lookt upon as <hi>Monsters</hi> of Ingratitude, as
the Reproaches and Scandals of <hi>humane</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and been hiss'd out of all Society for a
Company of <hi>infamous</hi> Villains, <hi>unworthy</hi> of
the <hi>least</hi> Respect or Favour from Mankind.
But for a <hi>Friend</hi> to die, or a <hi>Prince</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>Beggar</hi> for our sakes, alas what <hi>poor
inconsiderable</hi> Things are they, compared
with the Condescentions of the <hi>Son of God,</hi>
who humbled himself much <hi>lower</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
a Man than the most <hi>glorious</hi> Angel
in <hi>Heaven</hi> could have done in assuming the
Nature of a Worm. And can we be so <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane</hi>
as not to be moved by such a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of <hi>condescending</hi> Love? Is it the <hi>less,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the Love of <hi>God,</hi> or doth it <hi>less</hi>
deserve our Requital? What Excuse then
can we make for our <hi>wretched</hi> Insensibility?
<hi>O ungrateful</hi> that we are! with what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
can we shew our Heads among <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>
Beings after we have so barbarously
slighted our <hi>best</hi> Friend, and behaved our
selves so disingenuously towards our <hi>greatest</hi>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:63657:108"/>
Benefactor? How can we pretend to any
thing that is <hi>modest</hi> or <hi>ingenuous, tender</hi> or
<hi>apprehensive</hi> in <hi>humane</hi> Nature, when nothing
will oblige us, no not that <hi>astonishing</hi> Love
that made the <hi>Son of God</hi> leave all his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and become a <hi>poor miserable</hi> Mortal for
our sakes? <hi>O blessed Iesus!</hi> what do thy
<hi>holy Angels</hi> think of us! how do thy <hi>blessed
Saints</hi> resent our Unkindness towards thee!
yea, how justly will the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves
reproach and upbraid our Baseness, who,
<hi>bad</hi> as they are, were never so much Devils
yet as to spurn the Love of a Redeemer
coming down from <hi>Heaven</hi> to die and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for their sakes! Wherefore as we would
not be hiss'd at by all the <hi>reasonable</hi> World,
and become Spectacles of Horror to <hi>God,</hi>
and <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Devils,</hi> let us endeavour to
affect our selves with the Love of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi>
and to inflame <hi>our own</hi> Souls with the
Sense of his Kindness, who hath done such
<hi>mighty</hi> things to endear and oblige us.</p>
            <p>4. From hence I infer what <hi>monstrous</hi>
Disingenuity it would be in us to think
much of <hi>parting</hi> with any thing, or <hi>doing</hi> any
thing for the sake of <hi>Christ,</hi> who for our
sakes parted with his Father's Bosom, and
all those <hi>infinite</hi> Delights which he there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,
and united himself to our <hi>miserable</hi>
Nature that he might make us <hi>good</hi> and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:63657:108"/>
               <hi>happy</hi> for ever. And now after all this, with
what Conscience or Modesty can we grudge
to do any thing which he shall require at our
hands? Should he command me to descend
into the <hi>lowest</hi> Form of Beings, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the most <hi>wretched</hi> and <hi>contemptible</hi> of
all Animals, could I be such a <hi>Caitif</hi> as to
deny him, who descended much <hi>lower</hi> for
the sake of me? Should he remand me back
into <hi>Non-entity,</hi> and bid me cease to be <hi>for
ever;</hi> alas! the Distance is nothing so <hi>great</hi>
between <hi>me</hi> and <hi>nothing,</hi> as 'twas betwixt
<hi>him,</hi> and that <hi>humane Nature</hi> which he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
for my sake. Should he require me
to die for him under all those <hi>lingering</hi> and
<hi>exquisite</hi> Tortures which the <hi>blessed Martyrs</hi>
suffered for his Name, what Proportion
were there between what he requires of me,
and what he hath done for me? He only
requires that I should pass through <hi>Death</hi>
to <hi>Heaven</hi> for him, but he came from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
to pass through <hi>Death</hi> for me; so that
for his sake I should only put <hi>off</hi> a <hi>wretched</hi>
Garment of Flesh, that I may be inrobed
with Glory and Immortality; but for my
sake he put <hi>off</hi> his Robes of Glory and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
that he might wear my <hi>frail</hi> and <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
Flesh, and therein reconcile me to <hi>God,</hi>
and make me everlastingly <hi>happy:</hi> And
when I may advance my self into an Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:63657:109"/>
with <hi>Angels</hi> by suffering the Agonies of
a <hi>miserable</hi> Death for him, shall I refuse, or
think much of it; when he who was <hi>equal
with God</hi> in Glory and Happiness, was so
ready to be born a <hi>wretched miserable</hi> Man
for me? Should he require me to give my
Substance to the <hi>Poor,</hi> and leave my self
<hi>destitute</hi> of all Supplies and Comforts; could
I deny so <hi>poor</hi> a Request to <hi>him,</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
a <hi>Heaven</hi> of <hi>infinite</hi> Pleasures for my
sake, and exposed himself <hi>naked</hi> to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of a <hi>wretched, wicked,</hi> and <hi>ill-natured</hi>
World, from whom he could expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the most <hi>barbarous</hi> Contempt and
Cruelty? Sure, one would think 'twere
impossible for any <hi>reasonable</hi> Being to deny
such <hi>poor,</hi> such <hi>inconsiderable Boons</hi> to such
a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>deserving</hi> Benefactor; and yet
these are much more than what he ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
requires at our hands. For that which
he ordinarily requires of us is, that we
would forsake those <hi>Vices</hi> which are as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious</hi>
to <hi>us</hi> as they are <hi>hateful</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> and
which are therefore <hi>hateful</hi> to him, because
they are our Enemies; and that we would
practise those <hi>Virtues</hi> in which the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Happiness of our Nature is involved,
and which we can no more be <hi>happy</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
than we can <hi>be</hi> without Being. And
can I think much to part with those Lusts
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63657:109"/>
for his sake, which are my Shames and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicities,
who never grudg'd to part with
<hi>Heaven</hi> for <hi>mine?</hi> Can they be as <hi>dear</hi> to
me as his Father's Bosom was to him? and
yet he left <hi>that</hi> for Love of <hi>me;</hi> and shall
not I leave <hi>these</hi> for Love of him? Methinks
if we will not part with them for <hi>our own</hi>
sakes, as being <hi>destructive</hi> to our Peace and
Happiness; yet had we the <hi>least</hi> spark of
Ingenuity in us, we should gladly part with
them for the sake of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who for
<hi>ours</hi> was so ready to part with all that was
<hi>dear</hi> to him. Can we be such Wretches as
to refuse to serve him, when he requires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of us but what we are obliged to by
<hi>our own</hi> Interest? Are we so <hi>lost</hi> to all that
is <hi>ingenuous</hi> and <hi>modest,</hi> that we will not
obey <hi>him</hi> when he only requires us to be
kind to <hi>our selves? O wretched</hi> Mortals!
doth his Coming down from <hi>Heaven</hi> to save
you, deserve this <hi>barbarous</hi> Treatment at your
hands, that to spite <hi>him</hi> you should injure
<hi>your selves,</hi> and wound his Authority thro'
<hi>your own</hi> Sides? Had he been wholly <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi>
to you, it had been very <hi>unreasonable</hi>
to reject his Service when it altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in serving your selves; but to disobey
so <hi>dear</hi> a Friend, to whom we are obliged
by such <hi>stupendous</hi> Favours, when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:63657:110"/>
us nothing but the Means of <hi>our own</hi>
Happiness, is such a Piece of <hi>monstrous</hi> and
<hi>unnatural</hi> Baseness, as the <hi>Devil</hi> himself can
hardly parallel. <hi>O unkind</hi> that we are! that
we will not be <hi>good</hi> to our selves for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
sake, and that when he conjures us
to it, as he doth, even by all the Love that
we owe him! For so <hi>Iohn 14. 15. If ye
love me,</hi> saith he, <hi>keep my Commandments;
Consider what mighty things I have done for
you; how I left my Throne in Heaven for your
sakes, and became a miserable mortal Man:
And now that I am going from you, and am
offering up my Life to redeem you, if ever I
have merited any Love at your hands, express
it in keeping my Commandments. 'Tis no great
matter that I require of you, 'tis only that you
would be kind to your selves, that you would let
Misery alone, and endeavour to be as happy as
Heaven can make you. This is all the Requital
that I expect at your hands, that you would be
as good and happy as I would have you; and
this, which is the sum of all my Commands, I
conjure you strictly to observe, even by all the
Love that you owe me. O blessed Iesus!</hi> one
would have thought thou hadst been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
some <hi>mighty</hi> Trial of our Love to
thee, that we should do some <hi>great</hi> Thing
for thee to which nothing could prompt us
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:63657:110"/>
but only our Gratitude and Kindness: But
when thou only requirest us to express our
Love to <hi>thee</hi> in doing that which is the
<hi>highest</hi> Expression of our Love to <hi>our selves,</hi>
can we be so <hi>disingenuous</hi> as not to do that
for <hi>thy</hi> sake to whom we are so infinitely
obliged, which we are bound to do for <hi>our
own</hi> sakes as well as thine?</p>
            <p>5. And lastly; Hence I infer what a <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>
Thing it is to do <hi>Good,</hi> since the <hi>Son
of God,</hi> having so <hi>great</hi> an Opportunity of
doing <hi>Good</hi> to the World, thought it worth
his While to come down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and
assume our Natures, and undergo our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
as if he esteemed it more <hi>glorious</hi> and
<hi>becoming</hi> the Majesty and Divinity of his
Person to dwell upon Earth with <hi>poor mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
Mortals, among whom he might do
the <hi>greatest Good,</hi> than to sit <hi>above</hi> upon the
Throne of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and receive the most
<hi>humble</hi> Adorations of <hi>Angels;</hi> for 'twas on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for an Opportunity of doing the <hi>greatest
Good</hi> that he exchanged the Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of <hi>Heaven,</hi> chusing rather to become
a <hi>miserable</hi> Man to make others <hi>good</hi> and
<hi>happy,</hi> than to continue among those <hi>infinite</hi>
Delights with which the <hi>Heavenly State</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds.
What a most <hi>glorious</hi> Thing then
is it to do <hi>Good,</hi> when our most <hi>wise Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:63657:111"/>
chose it before <hi>Heaven</hi> it self, when
he thought it more <hi>eligible</hi> to come down
upon Earth and make us <hi>happy,</hi> than to
dwell in the Bosom of his Father, and shine
in <hi>Heaven</hi> with the Brightness and Glory of
his Divinity. And if there be nothing in
<hi>Heaven</hi> so <hi>glorious</hi> as doing <hi>Good,</hi> what is
there upon <hi>Earth</hi> that may be compared
unto it? What <hi>dim,</hi> what <hi>sullied</hi> Things
are all the <hi>Pomps</hi> and <hi>Splendors</hi> of this
World compared with the Glory of doing
<hi>Good</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> when <hi>God</hi> preferred it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Heaven</hi> it self? To conquer Kingdoms,
to lead the World in Triumph after us, how
<hi>mean</hi> and <hi>inconsiderable</hi> are they compared
with that Glory which the <hi>Son of God</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
meerly to do <hi>Good</hi> to the World? A
Thing which he esteemed so <hi>great</hi> and <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious,</hi>
that he did not only leave <hi>Heaven</hi>
for it, but scorned and despised the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the <hi>Earth,</hi> finding nothing <hi>below</hi>
that was <hi>worthy</hi> of him but only to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
doing <hi>Good!</hi> For this was his <hi>constant</hi>
Imployment, as you may see <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 21.
And now is it <hi>possible</hi> that after this <hi>great</hi>
Example, we should think Beneficence a
<hi>cheap</hi> or <hi>vulgar</hi> Thing? Can we think it a
Dishonour to stoop to the <hi>meanest</hi> Offices,
whereby we may serve the <hi>Souls</hi> or <hi>Bodies</hi>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:63657:111"/>
of our Brethren, when the <hi>Son of God</hi>
came down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and vailed his
Glory in <hi>mortal</hi> Flesh for no <hi>other</hi> End but
to do Good? <hi>O foolish</hi> Creatures that we
are! did we but understand and consider
what a <hi>magnificent</hi> Thing it is to supply
the Necessities of Men, and contribute to
their Happiness, we should doubtless em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it as our <hi>greatest</hi> Preferment, and think
our selves bound to bless God <hi>for ever</hi> for
furnishing us with Occasions of doing <hi>Good,</hi>
that he doth deem us <hi>worthy</hi> of such an <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious</hi>
Imployment, to have some share
with himself in the Glory of it, that he
will vouchsafe to us an Opportunity to <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
and <hi>magnify</hi> our selves by acting this
<hi>Divine,</hi> this <hi>Godlike</hi> Part in the World. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
then let us think that we dishonour our
selves, though we stoop <hi>never</hi> so low, when
it is to do <hi>Good;</hi> no, though it be to <hi>visit</hi>
a Beggar, to <hi>dress</hi> the Sores of a <hi>poor Lazar,</hi>
to <hi>instruct</hi> or <hi>comfort</hi> the <hi>meanest</hi> Wretch
in all thy Neighbourhood. For now thou
actest the Part of <hi>God</hi> in doing the most
<hi>glorious</hi> Thing in all the World; a Thing
for which the <hi>greatest</hi> Princes may envy
thee, and the <hi>blessed God</hi> for ever applaud
thee! Now thou art doing that which the
<hi>Son of God</hi> came down from <hi>Heaven</hi> to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:63657:112"/>
do, and which he thought more <hi>worthy</hi> of
his Choice than to reign over <hi>Angels</hi> in
<hi>Heaven:</hi> So that either we must say, that
He was <hi>unwise</hi> for preferring it before <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
or else we must acknowledge that we
are infinitely <hi>foolish</hi> in preferring any Thing
in the World before it.</p>
            <p>II. I now proceed to the <hi>Second</hi> Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>And dwelt among us full of Grace and
Truth.</hi> For that these <hi>later</hi> Words <hi>[full of
Grace and Truth]</hi> belong to the <hi>former,</hi> [And
dwelt among us] you may plainly see by
the <hi>Parenthesis</hi> in your Bible, by which they
are interrupted and broken off from one
another. In the Explication of these Words,
I shall do these <hi>Two</hi> Things:</p>
            <p>1. Enquire what is here meant by the
<hi>Word's dwelling among us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What we are to understand by his
being <hi>full of Grace and Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. What is here meant by the <hi>Word's
dwelling among us?</hi> In the <hi>Greek</hi> it is
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; that is, he pitched his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
among us; which seems plainly to
refer to God's dwelling in the Tabernacle
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:63657:112"/>
under the <hi>Mosaic Law.</hi> For the <hi>Greek</hi> word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> comes immediately from the <hi>Hebrew
Shacan,</hi> and differs from it only by the
<hi>Greek</hi> Termination; and from <hi>Shacan</hi> comes
the word <hi>Shechinah,</hi> by which the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
were wont to express God's <hi>glorious</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
upon Earth, and especially his Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in the <hi>holy Tabernacle</hi> between the
<hi>two Cherubims,</hi> where he is said to dwell,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 4. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 2. because from
thence <hi>God</hi> was wont to speak, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
himself by a <hi>visible</hi> Brightness and
Glory: And accordingly this Presence, or
Habitation of <hi>God,</hi> is called in the <hi>Greek</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Appearing.</hi> Thus
<hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 19. it is said, that when the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi>
drew near to the Tabernacle, the
<hi>Glory of the Lord appeared</hi> unto them; and,
<hi>v.</hi> 42. it is said, that <hi>a Cloud covered the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
and the Glory of the Lord appeared.</hi>
So when <hi>the Glory is said to be departed from
Israel, 1 Sam.</hi> 4. 21. it's plain that by that
<hi>Glory</hi> is meant this <hi>visible</hi> Appearance of
<hi>God</hi> in a <hi>glorious</hi> Brightness from between
the Cherubims. So, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. when it had
been said of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> that it was
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Tabernacle of God with us, v.</hi> 3.
that being repeated again, <hi>v.</hi> 11. is said to
<hi>have the Glory of God</hi> in it, and the <hi>Glory of
God</hi> to enlighten it, <hi>v.</hi> 23. Now it seems
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:63657:113"/>
most probable that this glorious <hi>Shechinah,</hi>
Presence, or Habitation of <hi>God,</hi> consisted in the
Presence of Angels; who being the <hi>Courtiers</hi>
of <hi>Heaven,</hi> where they appear there <hi>God</hi> is
said to be peculiarly present. And hence it is
that the Well <hi>Lahi-roi,</hi> where the <hi>Angel</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to <hi>Hagar, Gen.</hi> 16. 7, 14. is by the
<hi>Ierusalem Targum,</hi> stiled the Well <hi>ubi mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festata
illi fuit Praesentia Domini Majestatica,
where the Presence of God in Majesty was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifosted
to her:</hi> And that <hi>visible Glory</hi> which
appeared from between the Cherubims, is
called by the same name, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Gloria
Majestaticae praesentiae Domini, the Glory of
the Majestatick Presence of God;</hi> which is a
<hi>plain</hi> Evidence that the <hi>Iews</hi> believed the
<hi>Majestatick</hi> Presence of <hi>God</hi> to be nothing
else but the Appearance of Angels. And of
the same Mind was the <hi>Author to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
Heb. 2. 2. For the Law,</hi> saith he, <hi>was
spoken by Angels;</hi> and so St. <hi>Stephen, Acts 7.
53. The Law was received by the Disposition
of Angels;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>the Law was
ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediato<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
Galat.</hi> 3. 19. Whereas <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 11. comp.
with 20. <hi>v.</hi> 22. it is said, that <hi>the Lord
came down in the sight of all the People, and
talked with them;</hi> that is, as you will there
find, he spoke the Law to them. Which
is a plain Evidence that that <hi>glorious</hi> Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:63657:113"/>
of God's Presence upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi>
where the Law was spoken, was in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the <hi>Author to the Hebrews,</hi> nothing
but the Presence of Angels; who when
they were to represent the <hi>Divine Presence,</hi>
were wont to appear in <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>radiant</hi>
Bodies; and therefore where it is said in
<hi>Isaiah</hi>'s Vision, <hi>Is.</hi> 6. 1. that <hi>he saw the Lord
sitting upon a Throne,</hi> and that <hi>his Train sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Temple;</hi> that is, his Train of Angels;
and this Train of Angels our <hi>Saviour</hi> calls
<hi>the Glory of the Lord, Ioh.</hi> 12. 41. which is
the same with the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or <hi>Majestick
Presence:</hi> And therefore perhaps they are
called <hi>Angels of Light</hi> in reference to that
<hi>lucid, shining, flaming</hi> Appearance which
they were wont to make: And in <hi>Ps. 104. 4.
God</hi> is said <hi>to make his Ministers a flaming
fire,</hi> that is, when they are to make a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Representation of his <hi>Majestick Presence</hi>
to Mankind. But besides this, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 9.
you have mention made of <hi>the Angel of
God's Presence which saved Israel;</hi> which
seems to denote the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Chief</hi> of those
Angels, which by their <hi>glorious</hi> Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
did represent <hi>God</hi> to Mankind. By
which Angel the <hi>Iews</hi> did generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the <hi>Messias,</hi> or <hi>Eternal Word:</hi> For so
<hi>Philo,</hi> 
               <note n="1" place="margin">De Agricul. p. 152.</note> speaking of God's
committing the Care of his
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:63657:114"/>
Flock to his <hi>first-born</hi> Son, <hi>The Word,</hi> tells
us, <hi>That this is that Angel whom God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to send before the Camp of Israel, even the
Angel of his Presence.</hi> And so also Rab.
<hi>Menahem</hi> upon the 14th of <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. tells
us, that <hi>the Angel which went before the
Camp of Israel was Shechinah the Presence, or
Majesty of God, and that he is called the Angel
or Prince of the World, because the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World is in his hands.</hi> And to
the same Purpose <hi>Moses</hi> the Son of <hi>Neheman,
Praeterea Scriptum est,</hi> saith he, <hi>&amp; Angelus
faciei ejus salvos fecit ipsos,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>It is</hi>
written, <hi>the Angel of his Presence shall save
them, viz.</hi> that Angel which is the Presence
of God, of whom it is said, <hi>My Presence
shall go before thee, and I will cause thee to rest.
Moreover,</hi> saith he, <hi>this is that Angel of whom
the Prophets foretold, The Lord whom ye seek
shall suddenly come to his Temple, the Angel of
the Covenant whom ye desire;</hi> which both the
Ancient <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> interpret to be
the <hi>Messias;</hi> and <hi>this,</hi> saith he, <hi>is He who
governs the World, that brought the Children
of Israel out of Egypt, and to whom the most
High God communicates his own Name.</hi> And
this without doubt was he whom <hi>God</hi> calls
<hi>his Presence</hi> when he promised <hi>Moses,</hi> that
<hi>his Presence should go along with him, Exod.
33.</hi> 14. for this <hi>Presence</hi> is there said to be
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:63657:114"/>
the <hi>Angel of God;</hi> both which put together
make him to be the Angel of God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 20. And accordingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of, <hi>Say not before the Angel of the Lord,
Eccles.</hi> 5. 6. the <hi>Septugiant</hi> render it, <hi>Say not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Presence of God,</hi> that is, before the
<hi>Angel of his Presence.</hi> And since to this <hi>Angel
of his Presence,</hi> God doth attribute not only
his Prerogative of Forgiving Sins, but also
<hi>his own</hi> Name, as you may see he doth, <hi>Exod.
23.</hi> 21. it seems very probable, what not
only the <hi>Iews,</hi> but many very <hi>Learned
Christians</hi> do assert, that it was no <hi>created</hi>
Angel, but the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> or <hi>Messias:</hi>
For saith <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Moses, Behold I send an Angel
before thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>beware of him, and obey his
Voice; provoke him not, for he will not pardon
your Transgressions, for my Name is in him;</hi>
that is, my Name <hi>Iehovah,</hi> which is the
<hi>proper</hi> and <hi>incommunicable</hi> Name of <hi>God.</hi>
And accordingly you frequently read of an
Angel that is called by the Name <hi>Iehovah,</hi>
which I doubt not was the same with this
<hi>Angel of God's Presence.</hi> Thus that Angel
of the Lord which appeared to <hi>Moses</hi> in the
<hi>burning Bush,</hi> is called by the Name <hi>Iehovah,</hi>
and stiled <hi>the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
Iacob, Exod.</hi> 3. 2. comp. 4. 5. And one of
those Angels that appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> in
the <hi>Plains of Mamre,</hi> is called the <hi>Lord,</hi> and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:63657:115"/>
               <hi>the Iudge of all the Earth, Gen.</hi> 18. 1. 25. So
also he that stood on the top of the Ladder
in <hi>Iacob's</hi> Vision, is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 13. called
<hi>the Lord God of Abraham, and the God of
Isaac;</hi> whereas in <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 11. he is called
<hi>the Angel of the Lord,</hi> and afterwards, <hi>v. 13.
the God of Bethel.</hi> Which seems to me a plain
Evidence that that <hi>Angel</hi> of God was <hi>God,</hi>
since both those Titles were attributed to
the <hi>same</hi> Person; and that he was also that
very Angel of <hi>his Presence</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to send before the <hi>Camp of Israel,</hi> since
in him it is apparent the Name of <hi>God</hi> was,
<hi>i.e.</hi> the Name <hi>Iehovah.</hi> And it's very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
that this very Angel both <hi>Philo</hi>
and the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase</hi> stiles the <hi>Word
of God;</hi> and therefore those Words of God
to <hi>Ioshua, Ios. 1. 5. As I was with Moses,
so I will be with thee,</hi> the <hi>Paraphrase</hi> renders
thus, <hi>As my Word was assisting to Moses, so it
shall be assisting to thee:</hi> And 'tis the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the <hi>Learned Masius,</hi> that general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
where the <hi>Hebrew Text</hi> speaks of God
either conversing with Men, or managing
their Affairs, that <hi>Paraphrase,</hi> instead of God,
uses this Phrase <hi>the Word of God.</hi> From
whence it is evident, that it was the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi>
Doctrine of the <hi>Iews</hi> that <hi>God</hi> was
always present with Mankind by his <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Word;</hi> which is therefore the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:63657:115"/>
because it so exactly agrees with
the Doctrine of the <hi>Primitive Fathers.</hi> For
so <hi>Tertullian, Christus semper egit in Dei Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris
nomine; ipse ab initio conversatus est cum
Patriarchis &amp; Prophetis.</hi> And in his Book
against <hi>Praxian</hi> he tells us, <hi>That from</hi> Adam
<hi>to the Patriarchs and Prophets, Christ always
descended to discourse with Men;</hi> and <hi>that that
God who conversed upon Earth with Men, was
no other than that Eternal Word that was to be
made Flesh.</hi> And the same Thing is strenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
asserted also by <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> in his
Discourses with <hi>Trypho the Iew.</hi> Nor can
I see any Reason why he should not be the
<hi>Angel of God's Presence,</hi> since elsewhere he
is expresly called the <hi>Angel</hi> of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
by which <hi>God</hi> hath oblig'd himself to
be present with his <hi>Church</hi> for ever, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1.
And the <hi>New Testament</hi> so <hi>often</hi> declares him
to be the <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Character,</hi> and <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative</hi>
of God; and <hi>himself</hi> tells <hi>Philip</hi> that
he did so perfectly represent the Father, that
<hi>whosoever had seen him had seen the Father,
Ioh.</hi> 14. 9. And if this be so, as it seems
highly probable, that <hi>The Word</hi> was <hi>the
Angel of God's Presence,</hi> that is, the <hi>Chief</hi> or
<hi>Prince</hi> of those Angels that represented <hi>God</hi>
in the World, then it will follow that the
<hi>Shechinah,</hi> or <hi>Majestick Presence</hi> of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in a <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>visible</hi> Appearance of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:63657:116"/>
               <hi>the Word</hi> with a Troop of <hi>blessed</hi> Angels at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
him in <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>luminous</hi> Forms
And this I conceive was the <hi>glorious Presence.</hi>
of God which came down <hi>first</hi> upon <hi>Mount
Sinai,</hi> and <hi>afterwards</hi> removed into the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
and abode between the <hi>two</hi> Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims.
And this I am rather induced to
believe, because I find the Descent of God's
Presence upon <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> is described in
the <hi>same</hi> manner as Christ's coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for so, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 27. it is said, that
<hi>he shall come in the Glory of his Father, with
his Angels;</hi> and St. <hi>Iude</hi> tells us, that <hi>he shall
come with his holy Myriads, or Ten Thousands,
v.</hi> 14. for so it ought to be render'd: And
the Lord in the same manner is said to come
from <hi>Sinai with his holy Ten Thousands, or
Myriads;</hi> for so it is in the <hi>Hebrew, Deut.
33.</hi> 2. And since they are both described in
the <hi>same</hi> manner, it seems to follow, that
they were both the <hi>same Majestick Presence</hi>
of God, even the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> assuming a
<hi>glorious</hi> Form, and attended with <hi>Myriads</hi>
of <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>shining</hi> Angels. And this same
<hi>Presence</hi> it was that was afterwards display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Tabernacle, which was said to be
filled with the <hi>Glory of the Lord,</hi> which shone
from between the Cherubims with a <hi>bright</hi>
and <hi>visible</hi> Splendour, that is, with the <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious</hi>
Appearances of the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:63657:116"/>
and those <hi>glorious</hi> Angels that attended him.
And upon <hi>that</hi> Mount, and in <hi>that</hi> Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
did this <hi>blessed Word</hi> represent his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
even as the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> doth the <hi>Sovereign</hi>
Prince; for there in his Father's Person, and
by his Authority, he gave forth his Laws and
Oracles to the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as the
Vice-gerent of the most <hi>High God</hi> governed
the House of <hi>Israel,</hi> and distributed to them
<hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments,</hi> according as they
behaved themselves towards him: For up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the <hi>fore-named</hi> Reasons it seems high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
probable, that he was the Lord who spoke
to <hi>Moses,</hi> and from between the Cherubims,
and that thence delivered the Law to him.
So that as he was the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or <hi>glorious
Presence</hi> of the most <hi>High God</hi> in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
he did there represent his Person by
bearing his Authority, and ruling the House
of <hi>Israel</hi> as his <hi>Substitute</hi> and <hi>Vice-Roy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that the Words of my Text do refer
to this <hi>glorious</hi> Appearance of <hi>the Word</hi> in
the Tabernacle, and to his representing of
the most <hi>High God</hi> there, is very evident,
in that it is not only said that he tabernacled
among them, which evidently alludes to his
dwelling in the <hi>old</hi> Tabernacle, but that they
saw <hi>his Glory</hi> too, which is a <hi>plain</hi> Allusion
to that Glory of his which filled the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.
So that the Meaning of these Words,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63657:117"/>
               <hi>He dwelt among us,</hi> seems to be this, that as
<hi>Christ</hi> who is the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> was the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinah,
the Divine Presence,</hi> or <hi>Angel of God's
Presence,</hi> which in the Tabernacle of <hi>old</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
the most <hi>High</hi> to the <hi>Iews;</hi> so he
also abode or tabernacled in our Flesh as the
<hi>Representative</hi> of his Father to Mankind. In
the Tabernacle of our Flesh he displayed the
Glory of his Father to us; he openly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
and represented him to the World,
even as of <hi>old</hi> he was wont to do in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of <hi>Moses.</hi> For, for <hi>The Word</hi> to Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
among us must necessarily signify more
than barely to dwell or live among us; for it
must signify to dwell as the <hi>Shechinah</hi> in the
Tabernacle, that is, as the most <hi>glorious</hi>
Presence or Representative of the most <hi>High
God,</hi> as one that was vested with the <hi>Divine</hi>
Authority, and that was the <hi>Vice-gerent</hi> of
the Father of all things. So that, <hi>He dwelt
among us,</hi> seems to signify the same with, He
reigned among us in his Father's stead, as
one who bore his Authority, and represented
his Person, and to whom for the future we
were to pay the <hi>same</hi> Homage and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that we were bound to render to the
most <hi>High</hi> himself, who under <hi>himself</hi> hath
authorized him to be our Prince and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to declare his Divine Will to us, and
exact our Obedience thereunto by <hi>rewarding</hi>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:63657:117"/>
and <hi>punishing</hi> us according to the Tenour of
those Laws which he hath established in his
<hi>blessed Gospel;</hi> for this is plainly implied in
his <hi>Shechanizing</hi> or <hi>Tabernacling, viz.</hi> his
being the <hi>glorious</hi> Representative of <hi>God</hi> in
the World. He tabernacled among us, that
is, he acted in God's stead, as one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
his Father; and this he did in
our Flesh in a far more <hi>glorious</hi> manner
than ever he did in the <hi>Mosaic Tabernacle:</hi>
For in our Flesh and Nature he tabernacled
<hi>full of Grace and Truth;</hi> which brings me to
the next Enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What is here meant by his <hi>dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us full of Grace and Truth?</hi> By these
<hi>two</hi> Phrases the Design of the <hi>holy Penman</hi>
is doubtless to distinguish the Manner of
his dwelling among <hi>us</hi> from that of his
dwelling among the <hi>Iews</hi> in the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle:
For a little after he uses the <hi>same</hi> Phrases
in Contradistinction to the Law of <hi>Moses:
The Law,</hi> saith he, <hi>was given by Moses, but
Grace and Truth by Iesus Christ, v. 17. God
the Eternal Word</hi> gave the Law to <hi>Moses,</hi>
and <hi>Moses</hi> gave it to the People of <hi>Israel;</hi>
but <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that is, the <hi>Eternal Word
incarnate,</hi> gave not the Law, but <hi>Grace and
Truth.</hi> So in the Text, <hi>The Word incarnate,</hi>
or tabernacled in our Flesh, did <hi>Shechanize,</hi>
or perform the Part of his Father's <hi>supreme</hi>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:63657:118"/>
Representative among us <hi>full of Grace and
Truth;</hi> which implies something beyond
what he did when he dwelt in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of <hi>Moses,</hi> and there as the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of
<hi>God</hi> reigned over the <hi>House of Iacob.</hi> That
I may therefore more fully explain this
Matter to you, I will briefly consider these
<hi>two</hi> Phrases <hi>apart,</hi> and shew you in what
Particulars they each of them distinguish his
dwelling among <hi>us</hi> from his dwelling in the
<hi>Mosaick Tabernacle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. He dwelt among us <hi>full of Grace,</hi>
which distinguishes his dwelling among <hi>us</hi>
from that more <hi>severe</hi> and <hi>rigorous</hi> manner in
the <hi>former</hi> Tabernacle; and that in these
following Particulars:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> He dwelt among us <hi>full of Grace</hi> in
respect of the <hi>Sweetness</hi> and <hi>Obligingness</hi> of
his Behaviour, in Contradistinction to that
more <hi>dreadful</hi> and <hi>terrible</hi> manner of his
conversing with the <hi>Iews,</hi> when he taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacled
among them. The <hi>Iews</hi> being a
most <hi>stubborn</hi> and <hi>stif-necked</hi> Generation, (as
they are often called in the <hi>Old Testament)</hi>
the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> thought fit to converse
among them in such a way as was most
<hi>suitable</hi> to their <hi>Genius</hi> and Temper, to
break their Stubbornness with the Dread of
his Power, and awe them with the Terror
of his Majesty. And accordingly you find
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:63657:118"/>
that when he came down first upon <hi>Mount
Sinai,</hi> he was attended with a <hi>loud sounding</hi>
Trumpet, with <hi>Thunders</hi> and <hi>Lightnings,</hi>
with <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Smoak,</hi> and all the Equipage
of a most <hi>dreadful</hi> Majesty, such as caused
the Mountain and the People to tremble,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 16, 20. And afterwards it is said
that the Glory in which he appeared, when
the People saw him upon the Mount, was
like a <hi>devouring</hi> Fire, in which <hi>glorious</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
he afterwards removed into the
<hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and there abode between the
<hi>Cherubims, Exod.</hi> 40. 34, 35. And when in
all this <hi>dreadful</hi> Majesty he appeared unto
them, they are kept at a <hi>great</hi> Distance from
him, and were severely forbid to approach
him, lest he should <hi>break forth upon them,
and destroy them, Exod.</hi> 19. 24. And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they provoked him by their Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Rebellions, his Wrath broke forth
like Lightning upon them, and consumed
the <hi>ring-leading</hi> Rebels, that by their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the rest might be warned to do no more
wickedly. Thus in all his Converses with
them he clothed himself in a <hi>formidable</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
to break, and awe their <hi>sturdy</hi> Spirits,
and force their <hi>stiff</hi> Necks to yield to the
Yoke of his <hi>Sovereign</hi> Authority. But when
he assumed our Nature, and tabernacled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>us</hi> in our Flesh, he laid by that <hi>asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:63657:119"/>
Majesty that was wont to render
him so <hi>dreadful</hi> to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and put on
all the Condescentions and Sweetnesses of a
most <hi>familiar</hi> and <hi>endearing</hi> Conversation,
and conversed among Men in such a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
friendly,</hi> and <hi>courteous</hi> Manner as was
most <hi>apt</hi> to charm and inamour the World.
He was <hi>free</hi> without being <hi>vain</hi> or <hi>trifling,
serious</hi> without being <hi>four</hi> or <hi>morose;</hi> his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
always <hi>chearful</hi> and <hi>uniform,</hi> and his
Gravity was equally <hi>distant</hi> from Morose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Vanity; and in a word, his Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was made up of all the Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that can command either Love or
Honour. And though now and then he
falls into <hi>high</hi> Expressions of Indignation,
yet 'twas only against those <hi>base</hi> Fellows the
<hi>Pharisees,</hi> who under a Pretence of being
<hi>Saints</hi> and the <hi>Godly Party,</hi> were <hi>bloted</hi> up
with Pride and Arrogance, and <hi>canker'd</hi>
with Malice and <hi>ill</hi> Nature; for which they
were so abominable in his Eyes, whose Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
was altogether so <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> that
he could not mention them without calling
them <hi>Hypocrites, and the Children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi>
And if to all this you add his <hi>profound
Humility</hi> and <hi>Condescention,</hi> his <hi>Meekness</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Reproaches, and his <hi>Constancy</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi>
under the <hi>greatest</hi> Sufferings, how
much more <hi>sweet, grateful</hi> and <hi>charming,</hi> was
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:63657:119"/>
this than when he appeared in such a <hi>dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
and <hi>astonishing</hi> Majesty upon <hi>Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi>
and in the Tabernacle of <hi>Moses?</hi> 'Tis
true, the <hi>Innocency</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of his Life,
the <hi>Divinity</hi> of his Doctrine, and the many
<hi>mighty</hi> Miracles that he wrought, could not
but imprint an <hi>awful</hi> Majesty upon his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
but yet 'twas a <hi>graceful</hi> Majesty, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
<hi>full</hi> of Grace and Sweetness, and such
as was much more <hi>apt</hi> to <hi>endear</hi> than to <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright</hi>
Men! For, as for the <hi>Virtue</hi> of his
Life, and the <hi>Divinity</hi> of his Doctrine, it
could not but attract all those who had any
Love and Esteem for Virtue and Goodness.
And as for his Miracles, they were vastly
<hi>different</hi> from those which he wrought in
the Wilderness, which had <hi>little</hi> else in them
but Matter of Terror and Astonishment;
but these were all such as did express his
Kindness to the World, and so were much
more apt to <hi>oblige</hi> than to <hi>terrify</hi> those that
beheld them: <hi>For he went about doing good,

Devil, Acts</hi> 10. 38. and <hi>healing all manner of

People, Matth.</hi> 4. 23. So that in respect of
the <hi>Sweetness</hi> and <hi>Obligingness</hi> of his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
he tabernacled among us <hi>full of Grace,</hi>
in Contradistinction to that <hi>terrible</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in which he tabernacled among the <hi>Iews.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>2dly.</hi> He tabernacled among us <hi>full of
Grace</hi> in regard of the <hi>Sweetness</hi> and <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of his Laws, in Contradistinction to
those many <hi>burthensom</hi> Precepts which he
gave when he tabernacled among the <hi>Iews.</hi>
It's apparent by the History of that People
that they were obstinately addicted to the
Customs of <hi>Egypt,</hi> from whence they were
brought, and of the <hi>Neighbouring</hi> Nations
round about them; and thence it was that
notwithstanding those <hi>manifest</hi> Discoveries
that God had made of himself to them, and
of his being the only <hi>true God,</hi> such as one
would have thought had been <hi>sufficient</hi> to
have convinced the most <hi>obstinate</hi> Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers;
yet <hi>ever</hi> and <hi>anon</hi> we find them
starting aside to the <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Customs of
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and revolting from that <hi>God</hi>
who had so gloriously manifested himself
among them. The <hi>Eternal Word</hi> therefore,
when he came to <hi>tabernacle</hi> among them,
he gave them abundance of Laws, the
Matter of which was in its <hi>own</hi> Nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<hi>indifferent,</hi> that by those as by so
many Bounds and Fences he might keep
them from breaking out of God's Inclosure
into the <hi>wild Common</hi> of <hi>Gentilism;</hi> and
such were the <hi>greatest</hi> Part of their <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Laws,</hi> some of which were instituted in
Compliance with the more <hi>innocent</hi> Rites of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:63657:120"/>
the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and <hi>others</hi> in opposition to those
which were purely <hi>magical</hi> and <hi>idolatrous.</hi>
And hence it is that in the Law of their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
there are so many things enjoined
them of which we can give no <hi>tolerable</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
they being either <hi>innocent</hi> Customs
derived from the <hi>Heathens</hi> in Compliance
with the <hi>Iews,</hi> or Prohibitions of those <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical</hi>
and <hi>idolatrous</hi> Customs in which the
<hi>Iews</hi> had been educated in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to
which they were always very <hi>prone</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable.</hi>
So that merely to comply with the
<hi>Iews</hi> in what was <hi>innocent,</hi> and to restrain
them in what was <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>idolatrous,</hi> the
<hi>Eternal Word</hi> was fain to impose a <hi>vast</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of <hi>Positive Laws</hi> upon them, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
nothing but what was purely <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi>
and might have been done or undone
without any Prejudice to the <hi>Eternal</hi> Rules
of Goodness. And accordingly, <hi>Ezek. 20.
24,</hi> 25. it is said, that <hi>because their Eyes were
after their Fathers Idols, therefore God gave
them Statutes that were not good,</hi> that is, had
no <hi>intrinsick</hi> Goodness in them; and <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whereby they should not live.</hi> And that
<hi>God</hi> imposed these Things, not as <hi>good</hi> in
themselves, but as <hi>accommodated</hi> to the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
State and Temper of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> is
evident from what the <hi>Psalmist</hi> says, <hi>Ps. 51.

not in Burnt-offerings;</hi> though it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
he had a farther End in imposing very
many of these <hi>sacred</hi> Rites, namely to sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
out by them the Mysteries of the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
and give them some <hi>preludious</hi> Hints of that
<hi>glorious</hi> Kingdom of <hi>Christ</hi> that was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to be established in the World: But
by this means the <hi>Iewish</hi> Law was multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
into so many Precepts, and those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them so <hi>expensive</hi> and <hi>burthensom,</hi> that
the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls it <hi>a Yoke which neither they,
nor their Fathers were able to bear, Acts 15.
10.</hi> and else where, <hi>a Yoke of Bondage, Gal.

among the <hi>Iews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> his Laws were very
<hi>rigid</hi> and <hi>cumbersom,</hi> being clogg'd with so
<hi>vast</hi> a number of <hi>positive</hi> Rites and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances:
But when he came to tabernacle in
our Flesh, he abolished all these <hi>numerous</hi>
Ceremonies, and imposed nothing upon the
World but what is <hi>sweet,</hi> and <hi>easy,</hi> and <hi>full
of Grace.</hi> And hence himself tells us, <hi>Matth.

nothing but what we our selves, if

it. For all the Duty he requires of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63657:121"/>
us results immediately from the Frame of
our Natures, and the <hi>unalterable</hi> Relations
we stand in to <hi>God</hi> and the World. For the
Sum of all <hi>Christian</hi> Duty is contained in
those <hi>three</hi> Generals, <hi>to live soberly, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously,
and godly in this present World;</hi> and
these must necessarily oblige us so long as
we carry <hi>such</hi> Beings about us, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in <hi>such</hi> Relations. Whilst <hi>God</hi> is our
God and Creator, we cannot be disobliged
from living <hi>godly,</hi> that is, from <hi>honouring</hi>
and <hi>loving</hi> him, from <hi>fearing</hi> and <hi>trusting</hi> in
him, from <hi>serving</hi> and <hi>adoring</hi> him; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we could destroy our Relation to him,
and cease to be his Creatures, the Dueness
of these Acts of Homage and Worship from
<hi>us</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> must necessarily abide <hi>for ever:</hi>
Whilst we continue to be <hi>reasonable</hi> Animals
we cannot be freed from the Obligation of
<hi>Sobriety,</hi> which consists in governing our
Passions and Appetites by our Reason; for
till we can lay by our Reason, which is the
<hi>superiour</hi> Principle of our Nature, and step
into <hi>another</hi> Form of Beings, it will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
fit that our <hi>inferiour</hi> Powers should be
subject to its Conduct and Government.
Whilst we continue in the <hi>Society</hi> of Men,
and are Members of the Body of Mankind,
we cannot be released from the Tyes of
<hi>Righteousness,</hi> which contains in it <hi>Charity,</hi>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:63657:122"/>
and all other <hi>sociable Virtues;</hi> and till we
cease to be related to Mankind, it can never
cease to be <hi>reasonable</hi> for us to do what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
our Relation, that is, to be <hi>just, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign,</hi>
and <hi>charitable</hi> to <hi>one another.</hi> So that
all that the <hi>Word incarnate</hi> hath enjoined us,
is to do what we our selves must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

what we should choose to do before any
thing in the World, were we not prejudiced
against it by our own <hi>base</hi> Lusts and <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>
Passions. So that in respect of those

               <hi>3dly.</hi> He dwelt among us <hi>full of Grace</hi> in
respect of that <hi>full</hi> Pardon and Remission
which he hath granted to Sinners in his <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi>
in Contradistinction to that <hi>partial</hi> and
<hi>incompleat</hi> Pardon which he gave when he
tabernacled among the <hi>Iews.</hi> For whilst
the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> as his Father's Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
reigned over the Nation of <hi>Israel,</hi> he
gave no <hi>other</hi> Pardon but <hi>temporal</hi> by the
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> which was the Rule and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of his Government. And I'm sure
that from the 20th of <hi>Exod.</hi> to the 27th of
<hi>Deut.</hi> in which compass that whole Law is
comprized, there is not the <hi>least</hi> mention of
any <hi>other</hi> Pardon or Forgiveness allowed to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:63657:122"/>
Offenders, but only what respects their <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi>
Punishment; nay in <hi>some</hi> Cases this
was not allowed, as particularly in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of <hi>Blasphemy, Idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Murther,</hi> no
not though they heartily repented of it. For
all that Pardon which the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
was indulged to them upon their
offering up <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifices,</hi> which in
these <hi>exempted</hi> Cases were not allowed of;
but yet the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us of all these Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
in general, that <hi>the Blood of Bulls and of
Goats could not take away Sin, Heb.</hi> 10. 4. that
<hi>they did sanctify only to the purifying of the
flesh, Heb.</hi> 7. 13. that <hi>they could not make him
that did the Service perfect, as pertaining to
the Conscience, Heb.</hi> 9. 9. that is, that they
only released Offenders from the Obligation
to <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Punishments, but
could by no means free them from the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Punishments of the <hi>other</hi> Life. Not that
I make the <hi>least</hi> Doubt but that truly <hi>peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi>
Offenders were forgiven the <hi>eternal</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<hi>then</hi> as well as <hi>now,</hi> and forgiven
<hi>too</hi> for the sake of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the Lamb
that was intentionally slain from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the World; but by what hath been
said it's plain they were not forgiven by
Virtue of that Law whereby the <hi>Eternal
Word</hi> reigned over the House of <hi>Israel,</hi> but
rather by Virtue of that <hi>Gospel</hi> which was
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:63657:123"/>
first preached to <hi>Adam,</hi> and afterwards to
the <hi>Patriarchs;</hi> wherein <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Seed of
the Woman,</hi> and <hi>the Seed of Abraham,</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
in whom all Nations of the Earth
should be blessed. 'Tis true, the Sacrifices
of the <hi>Law</hi> were <hi>typical</hi> of the Sacrifice of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and so consequently was that <hi>tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
Pardon obtained by them <hi>typical</hi> of that
<hi>eternal</hi> Pardon which we do obtain by the
<hi>great</hi> Propitiation of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> for so the
<hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, that <hi>the Law had in it a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of good things to come, Heb.</hi> 10. 1. But
we must not imagine that <hi>eternal</hi> Remission,
which is the Effect of <hi>Christ's real</hi> Sacrifice,
could ever be obtained by those Sacrifices
which were only the Shadows and Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
of it. So that <hi>that</hi> Remission of Sins
which the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> gave whilst he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacled
among the <hi>Iews,</hi> was nothing near
so <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>compleat</hi> as that which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
proclaimed in the Tabernacle of
our Flesh, because it neither extended to all
Kinds of Sins, nor yet to all Kinds of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments;
it left <hi>some</hi> unforgiven as to
the Punishments of this Life, and it left <hi>all</hi>
unforgiven as to the Punishments of the
Life to come. But having pitched his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
in our Flesh, he did by the <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>
Sacrifice of himself obtain of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this <hi>publick</hi> Act of Grace, this <hi>free</hi> Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:63657:123"/>
of Mercy for all Mankind, That whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
would repent and amend, whatsoever
Sins he is guilty of, whatsoever Punishments
he is obliged to, he shall certainly be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
them all, and be as freely received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God's Grace and Favour, as if he never
had offended him; for he is the Propitiation
for the Sins of the World; <hi>And by him,</hi> saith
the Apostle, <hi>all that believe are justified from
all things, from which they could not be justified
by the Law of Moses, Acts</hi> 13. 39. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
therefore the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us <hi>full of Grace,</hi> in that he proclaimed
such a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> Pardon of all Sins, and
of all Punishments to all that with a <hi>true</hi> Faith
and <hi>hearty</hi> Repentance, should turn unto
him; and accordingly this Pardon is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
called by the Name of <hi>Grace,</hi> or <hi>of
the Grace of God,</hi> and <hi>of our Lord Iesus Christ,
Acts 15. 11. Heb.</hi> 12. 15. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> He dwelt among us <hi>full of Grace</hi> in
respect of the <hi>internal</hi> Grace and Assistance,
which he so abundantly afforded us above
what he did to the <hi>Iews</hi> under the Law of
<hi>Moses</hi> when he tabernacled among them. I
make no doubt but <hi>God</hi> in all Ages hath
been always ready to assist <hi>good</hi> Men in their
Duty. This the very <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves
believed, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that
<hi>God</hi> did concur with all <hi>good</hi> Men, and that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63657:124"/>
no Man did ever arrive to any <hi>eminent</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Virtue without a <hi>Divine</hi> Afflatus,
or Assistance. And had the <hi>good</hi> Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Iews</hi> been <hi>ignorant</hi> of this, what
should move them to pray, as we find they
often do, that <hi>God</hi> would <hi>wash</hi> and <hi>cleanse,</hi>
and <hi>quicken</hi> and <hi>strengthen,</hi> and <hi>inliven</hi> them?
For so, in the <hi>Book of the Psalms,</hi> you find <hi>good
David</hi> very often praying that <hi>God would
teach him his Commandments, and incline his
Heart to keep them, and keep him back from
presumptuous Sin.</hi> By which Prayers it's
evident they had <hi>good</hi> Encouragment to
hope that <hi>God</hi> would be ready to concur
with them, and to bless their <hi>pious</hi> Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
with the <hi>internal</hi> Assistance of his
Grace and Spirit. And this Encouragement
I suppose they might have partly from their
<hi>natural</hi> Notions of <hi>God,</hi> which must needs
suggest to them that He being infinitely
<hi>good,</hi> as he is, will never be wanting to his
Creatures in any thing that is <hi>necessary</hi> to the
obtaining those <hi>noble</hi> Ends for which he
created them, and consequently that he will
be assistant to them in their Duty, which is
the way to that End, and not leave them to
contend with Difficulties which are <hi>insupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
to their <hi>natural</hi> Power and Ability;
and partly from those <hi>general Evangelical</hi>
Promises which <hi>God</hi> made to them by the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:63657:124"/>
               <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> from whence they
might fairly infer that he who had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to do so much for them, upon Condition
they persisted in their Duty and Allegiance
to him, would never be wanting on his
Part to strengthen and enable them to it.
But I can by no means allow that they
were encouraged to hope for any <hi>such</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
from any Promise of that Law which
the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> gave them when he taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacled
among them, and by which in his
Father's stead he ruled and governed them;
and that both because there is no such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
found in all that Law, and because the
<hi>Apostle</hi> tells us that <hi>the Law was weak through
the flesh, Rom.</hi> 8. 3. and calls it <hi>the Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Death written and engraven in stones,</hi>
in opposition to <hi>the Ministration of the Spirit
that is not written in Tables of stone, but in
fleshly Tables of the heart, 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 8. comp.
with <hi>v.</hi> 3. And, <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 13, 14. you find
the <hi>Apostle</hi> opposes to the <hi>Curse of the Law,</hi>
the Blessing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the <hi>Blessing of
Abraham</hi> he tells us is <hi>the Promise of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
through Faith,</hi> that is, by the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And
thus under the Law there was doubtless an
<hi>internal</hi> Grace and Assistance vouchsafed to
<hi>good</hi> Men, though not promised by it; yet
after the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> forsook the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of <hi>Moses,</hi> and came to tabernacle in our
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:63657:125"/>
Flesh, it's evident that then he did more
plentifully communicate this his Grace to
the World than ever; for then the <hi>Spirit</hi>
was said to be shed upon us abundantly
through <hi>Iesus Christ our Lord;</hi> and in the
16th <hi>ver.</hi> of this 1st. of <hi>Iohn,</hi> we are said
<hi>of his fulness to receive</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Grace upon Grace,</hi> that is, Grace heaped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Grace, and a <hi>vast overflowing</hi> Abundance;
according to that of <hi>Theognis,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that is, thou givest me Calamities up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Calamities. So that unless we will our
selves, it is now <hi>impossible</hi> we should fall short
either of our Duty, or the <hi>blessed</hi> Reward of
it, since our <hi>Saviour</hi> is become such an <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing</hi>
Fountain of Grace to us, and hath
promised to communicate it to us in such
<hi>plentiful</hi> Effusions if we will sincerely ask,
and honestly endeavour after it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this respect also he may well be said
<hi>to dwell among us full of Grace,</hi> in that while
he dwelt among us he obtained for, and
promised to us such an <hi>accumulated</hi> Plenty of
<hi>inward</hi> Grace and Assistance to encourage and
enable us to do his Commandments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> He dwelt among us <hi>full of Grace</hi> in
respect of the Vastness of the Recompence
which he promised to us, and which <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely</hi>
exceeds whatsoever he promised when
he dwelt in the Tabernacle of <hi>Moses.</hi> For
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:63657:125"/>
when the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> reigned over <hi>Israel</hi>
as the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> and Substitute of his Father,
he only acted the Part of their <hi>Civil</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
or Governour; which Part he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
till they chose <hi>another</hi> King, and then he
resigned his Title to the <hi>succeeding</hi> Heirs of
<hi>David.</hi> And accordingly we find, that when
the <hi>Israelites</hi> first desired a King of <hi>Samuel,</hi>
God bids him hearken to their Cry; <hi>For,</hi> saith
he, <hi>they have not rejected thee, but they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
me, that I should not reign over them, 1 Sam.
8.</hi> 7. Which is a <hi>plain</hi> Argument that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he only acted as their <hi>Political</hi> Prince
in that he interprets their desiring <hi>another</hi>
King, to be a rejecting of him from reigning
over them. For had he been no otherwise
King over <hi>Israel,</hi> than as he is over <hi>other</hi>
Nations where the <hi>true</hi> Religion is owned
and professed, his Dominion might have
fairly consisted with that of <hi>another</hi> King or
Sovereign; and it would have been no
more a rejecting God's Rule for <hi>Israel</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
a King, than it is for <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi>
or <hi>England.</hi> For it's plain the <hi>Israelites</hi> did
not reject God's <hi>Divine</hi> Dominion, which
he claims over the World as the <hi>Omnipotent</hi>
Creator of all things; for then their Desire
of a King had been <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the Kings
whom they desired had been <hi>Idols,</hi> or <hi>false</hi>
Gods. It is plain therefore, that it was his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:63657:126"/>
               <hi>Political Dominion</hi> only which they rejected
by desiring <hi>another</hi> King to reign in his
stead, which he interprets as their Intention
to rob and divest him of that <hi>Civil Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
which till then he had claimed and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
among them. So that the <hi>plain</hi> Sense
of their Desire was this, <hi>God</hi> shall no longer
be our <hi>Civil Sovereign,</hi> but for the <hi>future</hi>
we are resolved to have a King from among
<hi>our</hi> selves, even as <hi>other</hi> Nations round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
us, whom we will invest with the
same <hi>Civil Authority</hi> which hitherto he hath
challenged and exercised among us. <hi>God
the Eternal Word</hi> therefore being their <hi>Civil
Prince</hi> or Ruler, as such he gave them the
<hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, which he only designed to be
the Rule or Instrument of his <hi>Civil</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Dominion; which is the Reason
why in <hi>that</hi> Law he only promised <hi>civil</hi> or
<hi>temporal</hi> Blessings, because it was only a
Law of <hi>Civil</hi> Government, and as such
could design no further than the <hi>civil</hi> or
<hi>temporal</hi> Happiness of those who were to be
ruled and governed by it. And accordingly
if you peruse the Promises of that Law, you
will find that they all consist of <hi>outward</hi> and
<hi>temporal</hi> Blessings; such as <hi>Health</hi> of Body,
and <hi>Victory</hi> over their Enemies, <hi>Peace</hi> among
themselves, and with their <hi>Neighbouring</hi>
Nations, <hi>Plenty</hi> of Bread, and the <hi>Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:63657:126"/>
of Life, and <hi>Success</hi> and <hi>Prosperity</hi> in
all their Affairs; and therefore the <hi>Author
to the Hebrews</hi> calls the <hi>Gospel</hi> the bringing
in of a <hi>better Hope,</hi> and upon this Account
opposes it to the Law of <hi>Moses, Heb.</hi> 7. 19.
which plainly implies that <hi>that</hi> Law brought
in no <hi>better Hope</hi> than that of a <hi>temporal</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness;
and those Words of the <hi>Apostle,
Gal. 3. 12. The Law is not of Faith; but, The
Man that doth them, shall live in them,</hi> do
plainly seem to imply this Sense, The Law
proposing only <hi>present</hi> and <hi>sensible</hi> Blessings
to such as do it such as that <hi>Thou shalt live
a happy and prosperous Life in this World,</hi> doth
not require Faith properly so called, which
is <hi>the Evidence of things not seen;</hi> that is, of
the <hi>invisible</hi> Blessings of the <hi>other</hi> Life; and
<hi>v.</hi> 21. he plainly asserts, that if there had
been any <hi>other</hi> Law besides the <hi>Gospel</hi> that
could have <hi>given</hi> that <hi>promised</hi> Life, <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
would have been by that Law;</hi> and
therefore since, as he asserts, Righteousness
was by no <hi>other</hi> Law but the <hi>Gospel,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
that no other <hi>Law,</hi> no not that of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
could give or promise <hi>Life eternal.</hi> Not
that I make the <hi>least</hi> Doubt, but <hi>good</hi> Men
under the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> did firmly believe a
<hi>future</hi> Happiness; for this the very <hi>Heathens</hi>
themselves had very <hi>great</hi> Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
of, though they never had so
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:63657:127"/>
much Reason as the <hi>Iews</hi> to induce them to
believe: For, besides all those <hi>weighty</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which were <hi>common</hi> to them with
the <hi>Heathens,</hi> they had those <hi>general Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical</hi>
Promises which <hi>God</hi> made to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi>
of <hi>being their God,</hi> and <hi>their exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
great Reward;</hi> the Histories of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations
of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> and of <hi>sundry</hi>
most <hi>eminent</hi> Examples of God's <hi>exceeding</hi>
Love to Goodness and <hi>good</hi> Men, from
whence they might easily infer, that sure he
had <hi>better</hi> Rewards in store for them than
any of the <hi>transitory</hi> Blessings of this Life,
especially when they saw how many <hi>good</hi>
Men were deprived of these, and left <hi>naked</hi>
and <hi>destitute</hi> of all <hi>worldly</hi> Comforts: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all which, in every Age they had Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
that were <hi>divinely</hi> inspired, and who,
among all the Secrets that were revealed to
them, cannot be supposed to have been
wholly unacquainted with the <hi>typical</hi> Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Ceremonies and Polity, which
among <hi>other</hi> things presignified the <hi>glorious</hi>
Recompences of the Life to come. But
however they came by it, I think it is very
apparent from <hi>sundry</hi> Passages in the <hi>Book of
the Psalms, Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> that they
were far from being Strangers to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of a <hi>blessed</hi> Immortality <hi>hereafter;</hi>
though I think it is very <hi>apparent</hi> from what
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:63657:127"/>
hath been said, that they did not derive their
Belief of this Doctrine from any <hi>express</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of their Law. But yet it is very <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi>
that though they were not altogether
<hi>unacquainted</hi> with it, yet 'twas never so
clearly discovered to <hi>them</hi> by the <hi>Eternal
Word</hi> as it was afterwards to <hi>us</hi> by the
<hi>Word Incarnate,</hi> since, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us,
<hi>He brought Life and Immortality to light by
the Gospel:</hi> For therein he hath most clearly
promised it to us, and as far as <hi>humane</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
can express, explained and unfolded
its Nature; and by his <hi>own</hi> Resurrection,
and Ascension into <hi>Heaven,</hi> hath given us a
<hi>clear</hi> and <hi>visible</hi> Demonstration of its Truth
and Reality; so that now the Existence of it
is become as <hi>certain</hi> to us, as it's <hi>possible</hi> for a
<hi>Matter of Fact</hi> to be; and we cannot be more
infallibly assured of it than we are, unless we
had been personally in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and had there
surveyed its Glories with <hi>our own</hi> Eyes. Well
therefore may He be said to have dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us <hi>full of Grace,</hi> since he was graciously
pleased to make us such <hi>express</hi> Promises of
<hi>future</hi> Happiness, and give us such <hi>ample</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of its Reality and Existence. And so
I have done with the <hi>first</hi> Note of Distinction
between Christ's dwelling among <hi>us,</hi> and
his dwelling in the <hi>Mosaick Tabernacle:</hi> He
dwelt among us <hi>full of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:63657:128"/>
2. The <hi>other</hi> Character by which his
dwelling among <hi>us</hi> is distinguished from
his dwelling in the <hi>Mosaick Tabernacle,</hi> is this,
that he dwelt among us <hi>full of Truth.</hi> It's
<hi>plain</hi> that <hi>Truth</hi> here is not to be understood
as opposed to <hi>Falshood,</hi> because in that Sense
it is no Note of Distinction between these
<hi>two</hi> Dwellings or Tabernaclings of <hi>Christ,</hi>
unless we suppose that he did falsly dwell,
or act, and represent <hi>God</hi> in the Tabernacle
of <hi>Moses,</hi> which would be to blaspheme his
Truth and Veracity. <hi>Truth</hi> therefore must
here be understood as opposed to <hi>Obscurity</hi>
and <hi>Shadow,</hi> and so must denote <hi>Clearness</hi> and
<hi>Reality,</hi> as it very commonly doth. As when
we say a Picture is not a <hi>true</hi> Man, we do not
charge the Picture with a Lye; if it could
speak indeed, and should call it self a Man,
we should then say it were a <hi>lying</hi> Picture for
pretending to be what it is not, being only a
<hi>silent</hi> Resemblance of him. Thus when the
<hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>He dwelt among us full of Truth,</hi>
and thereby distinguishes his tabernacling
among <hi>us</hi> from the manner of his dwelling
among the <hi>Iews,</hi> it is not so to be understood
as if he had dwelt among them in a <hi>false</hi> or
<hi>lying</hi> manner, or that <hi>that</hi> Representation
which he made to them of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi>
Things were <hi>false</hi> and <hi>imposturous;</hi> no, God
forbid: But thus, whereas when He inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:63657:128"/>
the Tabernacle, he was <hi>full</hi> of <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks,</hi>
or <hi>mystical</hi> Representations, which
though they were <hi>true</hi> Pictures or Shadows
of <hi>Divine</hi> Things, yet have not the Truth
and Reality of the Things themselves in
them, and consequently would be Lies and
Cheats should they pretend to <hi>be</hi> what they
only represent; but now he is come to dwell
among us, he is <hi>full</hi> of the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
of those <hi>Realities</hi> which formerly he
only gave us the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of; now
he hath removed all that Scene of Pictures
and <hi>mystical</hi> Representations, and brought
the Things themselves upon the Stage, and
exposed them <hi>naked</hi> to the View of the
World. So that <hi>now</hi> he doth not entertain
<hi>us,</hi> as <hi>heretofore</hi> he did the <hi>Iews,</hi> with <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems</hi>
and <hi>Shadows,</hi> but with Truth, and the
<hi>real</hi> Substances of Things. And thus the
Word is very frequently taken in the <hi>New
Testament:</hi> Thus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 2. the <hi>Christian
Church</hi> is called <hi>the true Tabernacle,</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinction
to the <hi>Tabernacle of Moses;</hi>
not as if <hi>that</hi> were a <hi>false</hi> Tabernacle, but a
<hi>typical</hi> one, it being designed only as a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> which is the
<hi>true</hi> Reality and Substance which was pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and represented in it; for so the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
himself explains it, <hi>Heb. 9. 24. For
Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>is not entred into the holy
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:63657:129"/>
places made with hands, which are the figures
of the true, but into Heaven it self:</hi> From
whence it's plain, that therefore those <hi>Holy
Places</hi> are opposed to <hi>true Places,</hi> because
they were only Figures, or <hi>mystical</hi> Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
of something that is <hi>real</hi> and <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial.</hi>
So, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 16. when <hi>Daniel</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to know the Truth of that <hi>Prophetick
Scene,</hi> it is said, that <hi>One stood by, and made
him know the Interpretation of the things;</hi>
that is, what was the Reality and Substance
that was represented in those Types and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.
So here, <hi>He dwelt among us full of
Truth,</hi> that is, when he dwelt among us he
was <hi>full</hi> of the <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Reality</hi> of those
Things which before he was wont to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
by <hi>obscure Emblems</hi> and <hi>Shadows;</hi> now
he presents to us the Things themselves,
and not the <hi>mystical</hi> Types and Figures of
them as formerly he was wont to do. For
I think it's very evident, that the <hi>whole</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
of the <hi>Iewish Polity</hi> was purposely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
to be an <hi>Emblem</hi> and Representation
of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and that the <hi>main</hi> Reason of
those <hi>numerous</hi> Rites and Ceremonies, was
to delineate and shadow out the <hi>glorious</hi>
Mysteries of <hi>Christianity:</hi> For the Apostle
plainly tells us, that they were all a <hi>shadow
of things to come,</hi> and that <hi>the Body,</hi> or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of that Shadow, <hi>was Iesus Christ,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:63657:129"/>
Col.</hi> 2. 17. And the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
calls them <hi>the Patterns of the things in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
or the <hi>heavenly</hi> Things; by which it's
plain he means <hi>Christ,</hi> or the Subjects of
the Kingdom of <hi>Christ,</hi> since he tells us that
as it was <hi>necessary</hi> that those Patterns should
be purified with Blood, so it was <hi>necessary</hi>
that those <hi>Heavenly</hi> Things represented by
them, should be purified by a <hi>better Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
Heb.</hi> 9. 23. And what other <hi>Heavenly</hi>
Things are there but only <hi>Christians</hi> that
are purified with this <hi>better Sacrifice</hi> of
Christ? And in another place the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
tells us, that <hi>the Law hath in it a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of good things to come, Heb.</hi> 10. 1. And
thus very frequently in the <hi>New Testament,</hi>
the <hi>sacred</hi> Rites of the <hi>Mosaick Law</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be Types and Shadows of the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries</hi>
of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as particularly in the
Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which is almost wholly
spent upon this Argument. And this the
<hi>Iews</hi> themselves seem to be acquainted with
long before the Publication of the <hi>Gospel:</hi>
For so the most ancient <hi>Iews</hi> look'd upon
the Temple as a Type and Figure of the
<hi>Heavenly</hi> State; and <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Iew,</hi> in his
<hi>Allegories of the Law,</hi> and almost in all his
<hi>other</hi> Writings, makes the Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law to be Types
and Figures of some <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Moral</hi> Truth,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:63657:130"/>
and particularly the <hi>High Priest</hi> to be an
<hi>Emblem</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> and his Crown
and Vestments to be Representations of <hi>his</hi>
Authority and <hi>Divine</hi> Perfections, wherein
he exactly agrees with the Author to the
<hi>Hebrews.</hi> And from <hi>sundry</hi> Passages in the
<hi>Book of Psalms</hi> it seems evident, that the
<hi>good Iews</hi> had a Prospect beyond the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi>
and Letter of the Law, even into the
<hi>typical</hi> Sense and Meaning of it; and that
through its <hi>glimmering</hi> Shadows and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances,
they beheld very much of the
Substance and Realities of the <hi>Gospel:</hi> For
hence probably was that of <hi>David, Ps. 25.
14. The Secret of the Lord is with them that
fear him;</hi> for certainly the <hi>Secret of the Lord</hi>
here cannot be meant the <hi>Fore-knowledge</hi> of
<hi>future Events,</hi> since under the <hi>Old Testament</hi>
that was neither restrained to <hi>good</hi> Men,
nor much <hi>less</hi> was it universally with them
that feared <hi>God;</hi> and therefore it seems
more probable, that by <hi>it</hi> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
those <hi>then secret</hi> Mysteries of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi>
which were so obscurely represented in
the Types and Figures of the <hi>Law;</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if we compare this with that Prayer of
<hi>David, Ps. 119. 18. Open thou mine Eyes that
I may behold the wondrous things out of thy
Law;</hi> which methinks plainly intimates
that the <hi>good</hi> Man did believe there were
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:63657:130"/>
some <hi>wondrous</hi> Mysteries contained under
those <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>typical</hi> Representations: And
afterwards, <hi>v. 27. make me to understand
the way of thy Precepts, so shall I talk of thy
wondrous Works;</hi> which implies that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that there were some Things very
<hi>mystical,</hi> and <hi>hard</hi> to be understood contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within the Precepts of their Law, which
in their <hi>literal</hi> Sense were <hi>easy</hi> and <hi>obvious,</hi>
and had nothing of Depths or Mystery in
them; and therefore certainly had he not
seen something within them beyond their
Rine and <hi>Outside,</hi> he would never have
prayed so earnestly as he doth, <hi>that God
would teach him his Laws,</hi> and that <hi>he would
not hide from him his Commandments,</hi> as he
doth, <hi>v.</hi> 19. much less would he have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that by <hi>understanding of them he should
be enabled to talk of such wondrous Things.</hi>
Afterwards, <hi>v.</hi> 69. he tells us, that <hi>he had
seen an end of all Perfection, but God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
are exceeding broad;</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
that he who had seen an End of all
Things else, had discovered so <hi>vast</hi> and
<hi>boundless</hi> a Depth in the Commands of <hi>God,</hi>
that he could see no End of it; whereas it's
plain, that the <hi>literal</hi> Meaning of them was
very <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>contracted,</hi> and far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so exceeding <hi>broad;</hi> which argues that
the <hi>good</hi> Man had discovered under the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63657:131"/>
and Surface of them, a Mine of <hi>mystical</hi>
Sense which he could not reach the Bottom
of, and that <hi>God</hi> had given him a Glimps of
those <hi>glorious</hi> Secrets of the <hi>Gospel</hi> which he
had wrapt up, and involved in the <hi>typical</hi>
Precepts of the Law. Thus the <hi>Eternal Word</hi>
while he tabernacled among the <hi>Iews,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
his <hi>Gospel</hi> to them by <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi>
and <hi>mystical Representations</hi> of it, which,
though it was very <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>imperfect,</hi> yet
seems to have been the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>clearest</hi> that
the <hi>present</hi> State of that People could admit
of. For it seems plain by the History of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> that they were naturally a very <hi>rude</hi>
and <hi>untractable</hi> People, and doubtless they
were never worse than when they came out
of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where their <hi>bad</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
was doubtless very much improved by
those <hi>gross</hi> Idolatries in which they had been
educated; so that being <hi>bad</hi> themselves, and
also extreamly <hi>debauched</hi> by the <hi>wicked</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> it is not to be supposed
that they were Subjects capable of the
Heights and Purities of <hi>Religion;</hi> for if
from the <hi>Depth</hi> of <hi>Immorality,</hi> whereinto
they were sunk, <hi>God</hi> should have immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
strained them up to the <hi>highest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Pitch
of <hi>Gospel-Purity,</hi> in all Probability they
would never have born it; but like the
Strings of a <hi>Musical Instrument,</hi> being wound
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:63657:131"/>
               <hi>too high,</hi> would have been apt to crack and
fly in pieces, and wholly to revolt from <hi>God</hi>
into those <hi>gross</hi> Idolatries which yet they
were hardly weaned from, and which were
still so <hi>suitable</hi> to their Genius and Temper.
So that as yet there was so <hi>great</hi> a Gulph
between <hi>them</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that 'twas
hardly possible either for them to go to <hi>that,</hi>
or for <hi>that</hi> to come to <hi>them.</hi> And therefore
as <hi>God</hi> in his own <hi>high</hi> Wisdom hath placed
a <hi>Twi-light</hi> between the Night and the
Morning to secure our Sight lest our <hi>weak</hi>
Eyes should be dazled by a <hi>too sudden</hi> Irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Broad-day's</hi> Glory; so did he deal
with the <hi>Iews:</hi> He thought it not <hi>conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi>
immediately to post them out of <hi>utter</hi>
Darkness into <hi>perfect</hi> Light, but first inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
a <hi>less pure Religion</hi> as a <hi>Medium</hi> or
<hi>Twi-light</hi> between the <hi>Heathen</hi> and the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
State,</hi> that so by <hi>that</hi> he might prepare
their Sight for the Reception of a more <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
Splendor, and make them fit to entertain
the <hi>severer</hi> Purities of the <hi>Gospel</hi> without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
offended or dazled with its Glory. But
yet in Wisdom he hath so contrived and
modeled this <hi>less perfect Religion,</hi> as to make
it most <hi>instructive</hi> and <hi>useful,</hi> having so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
its <hi>sacred</hi> Rites and Ceremonies as to
make them <hi>Representative</hi> of the whole Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and <hi>Oeconomy</hi> of the <hi>Gospel;</hi> and though
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:63657:132"/>
those <hi>typical</hi> Representations were very <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure</hi>
and <hi>dark,</hi> so that the <hi>Gospel</hi> seemed to
run under ground in the midst of those <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial</hi>
Observances, yet it frequently broke
forth, and opened it self in the midst of
them, and by degrees in the <hi>Prophetick Age</hi>
did make it self a <hi>larger</hi> Channel, till by its
Force and Violence it did overthrow these
Banks, that stood in its way, and overspread
the Face of the whole Earth. So that it's <hi>plain</hi>
that the Obscurity of those <hi>typical</hi> Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
did not render them wholly <hi>useless,</hi>
since they were not so <hi>obscure,</hi> but those who
were <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>diligent,</hi> and <hi>serious</hi> in the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of them might be, and were instructed
by them in whatsoever was <hi>necessary</hi> to make
them <hi>good</hi> and <hi>happy.</hi> For though those <hi>Types</hi>
had not a Mouth to speak out the <hi>Gospel,</hi> yet
they had a Hand to point to it, they being as
it were <hi>rude</hi> Draughts of that which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to be drawn to the <hi>greatest</hi> Life and
Exactness; and this it's plain was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by all <hi>good</hi> Men whose Hearts were
carried beyond the <hi>outward</hi> Letter of the
Law, to the more <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it; wherein they discovered those <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Mysteries</hi> that were <hi>vailed</hi> and <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
under the <hi>outward</hi> Ceremonies, which
made up that true <hi>spiritual Cabala</hi> which
seems constantly to have been preserved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:63657:132"/>
the <hi>true Israelites,</hi> and which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
was more largely commented on by
the <hi>Prophets</hi> of the <hi>succeeding</hi> Ages, whose
Care it was to unlock this <hi>Cabala,</hi> or <hi>spiritual</hi>
Sense of the Law, and to raise up the Hearts of
that People to a <hi>higher</hi> Expectation of the
<hi>great</hi> Things which were to come. So that
you see the State and Condition of the <hi>Iews</hi>
would not admit of a <hi>plain</hi> Discovery of the
<hi>Gospel</hi> to them, but required an <hi>outward Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
Religion, that</hi> being most <hi>accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date</hi>
to their Genius and Temper; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> for the <hi>present</hi>
Exigence established such a <hi>Religion</hi> among
them, yet He wisely framed and modelled it
into a <hi>typical</hi> Representation of the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
that so thereby he might prepare them for it,
and so far instruct them in the Knowledge of
it as was <hi>necessary</hi> to their Welfare and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And hence the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells the <hi>Iews,</hi>
that <hi>the Law was their School-master to bring
them unto Christ,</hi> that they might be justified
by Faith, and that now after <hi>Faith</hi> was
come, they were <hi>no longer under their School-master,
Gal.</hi> 3. 4, 25. that is, while they were
in their <hi>Infantine, Childish</hi> State, and <hi>incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
of a more <hi>perfect</hi> Institution, <hi>God</hi> set the
Law as a <hi>School-master</hi> over them, that <hi>that</hi>
by its <hi>Types,</hi> and <hi>Pictures,</hi> and <hi>Emblems,</hi> might
gradually instruct them in the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:63657:133"/>
               <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that so when it was
openly revealed they might be <hi>justified</hi> by
the Belief of it; and therefore now since the
<hi>Gospel</hi> was come, they were no longer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Tutorage of that <hi>School-master,</hi> now
they were no longer to learn <hi>Christ</hi> by <hi>Types</hi>
and <hi>mystical</hi> Representations, since he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was present with them, and had openly
revealed those <hi>Divine</hi> Mysteries which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
those <hi>Types</hi> were so obscurely <hi>adumbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
So that you see the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacled
among the <hi>Iews</hi> in a far <hi>different</hi>
manner from what he did when he pitched
his Tabernacle in <hi>our</hi> Natures; for when
he tabernacled among <hi>them</hi> he was <hi>full</hi> of
<hi>Types,</hi> and <hi>Shadows,</hi> and <hi>mystical Emblems;</hi>
He instructed them in <hi>Divine</hi> Things by
<hi>Symbols,</hi> and <hi>obscure</hi> Representations; but
when he came to tabernacle among <hi>us,</hi> and
in <hi>our</hi> Natures, he was <hi>full of Truth,</hi> that
is, of <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Reality:</hi> For then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the <hi>Shadows</hi> and <hi>Pictures</hi> of them,
he exhibited to us the Things themselves;
then he brought down the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the
<hi>Gospel</hi> out of that Cloud of <hi>Types</hi> in which
they were before involved, and set them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us in a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>open</hi> Light.</p>
            <p>But that I may more <hi>fully</hi> demonstrate
this to you, I shall briefly give you some
<hi>particular</hi> Instances of his dwelling, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:63657:133"/>
among us <hi>full of Truth,</hi> in Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
to that <hi>obscure typical</hi> Way of his
conversing or tabernacling among the
<hi>Iews;</hi> which I shall rank under these four
Heads:</p>
            <p>1. His <hi>Personal</hi> Transactions.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Spirituality</hi> of his
Laws.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Condition</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi> of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Recompences</hi> which
he promises to his Subjects.</p>
            <p>1. One <hi>great</hi> Instance of his conversing
among us <hi>full of Truth,</hi> in Contradistinction
to that <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>typical</hi> Way of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
among the <hi>Iews,</hi> is his <hi>own Personal</hi>
Transactions. The <hi>Eternal Word</hi> being to
assume our Natures, thought fit to give the
<hi>Iews</hi> whilst he tabernacled among them, a
<hi>Specimen</hi> or Pattern of those <hi>glorious</hi> Things
he was to transact in his <hi>Incarnate State;</hi>
and this he did chiefly by the <hi>High Priest,</hi>
and those <hi>Expiatory Sacrifices</hi> which he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
and instituted among them, as you
may find it demonstrated at large in the
Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> For as to the <hi>High
Priest,</hi> he was <hi>to be called, and ordained of
God, Heb.</hi> 5. 4. in which the <hi>Eternal Word</hi>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:63657:134"/>
represented to them his Commission from
the Father, to descend into the World as
his <hi>Embassador</hi> to Men. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He was
to be born of a Woman that came a <hi>pure
Virgin</hi> into the Arms of his Father, <hi>Levit.
21.</hi> 14. in which he seems to represent to
them his own <hi>pure</hi> Nativity of a <hi>Virgin-Mother.
Thirdly,</hi> He was to be washed with
Water, and his Flesh and Loyns were to be
covered with the <hi>whitest</hi> and the <hi>cleanest</hi>
Linnen, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 7. and 28. 42. by which
Christ <hi>typified</hi> to them the <hi>IMMACVLATE</hi>
Sanctity and Innocence of his <hi>humane</hi> Life.
<hi>Fourthly,</hi> He was to be clothed in the most
<hi>glorious</hi> Garments that could possibly be
made by the most <hi>excellent</hi> Workmen,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 2, 3. which seems to denote the
<hi>Majesty</hi> of Christ's Person, and those <hi>glorious</hi>
Works by which he render'd himself so <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious</hi>
in the World. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of the <hi>Embroideries</hi> of his Garment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>blue, purple, scarlet,</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> seem to
denote the <hi>Truth</hi> of his <hi>Prophetick Office,</hi> the
<hi>Majesty</hi> of his <hi>Royal,</hi> the <hi>Perfection</hi> of his
<hi>Priestly,</hi> and his <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Sanctity</hi> in
the Execution of them all. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He
wore a <hi>holy Crown</hi> on his Head, and a <hi>Plate</hi>
on his Forehead engraven with <hi>Holiness;</hi>
which denotes the <hi>Divine</hi> Authority of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Sacredness</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:63657:134"/>
his Person. And, <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Upon his Breast
he wore the <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> in which
was prefigured the <hi>Height</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of
Christ's Doctrine, and the <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
of his Laws. In a word, the <hi>High
Priest</hi> was to offer Sacrifice for the Sins of
the People, on the <hi>great day of Expiation,</hi>
which Sacrifice was to be a <hi>Beast without
blemish</hi> voluntarily presented at the Door of
the Tabernacle, whither the <hi>High Priest</hi>
being come, he was to strip <hi>off</hi> his <hi>glorious</hi>
Garment, to lay his Hand on the Head of
the Beast, and to confess the Peoples Sins
over it, and then to slay the Beast, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>some</hi> of the Blood of it within the <hi>Vail,</hi>
and sprinkle it upon, and before the <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi>
by which he is said to make an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
for their Sins; that is, to obtain
Authority from <hi>God</hi> to bless and pardon:
In which the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> gives us a <hi>plain</hi>
Representation of his <hi>future Sacrifice</hi> upon
<hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> in <hi>Heaven;</hi> for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both our <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>High Priest,</hi> did
freely divest himself of the Glory and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of his <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> and offer up
himself to die for us; by which he laid his
Hand as it were upon his own <hi>spotless</hi> and
<hi>immaculate</hi> Head, did as our <hi>Representative</hi>
acknowledge what we had deserved, that
for our Sins we have justly merited to die
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:63657:135"/>
               <hi>for ever</hi> by the Hand of <hi>God,</hi> even as He
for our sakes did submit to die by the Hand
of Man: And having performed this <hi>bloody
Sacrifice,</hi> he enters into <hi>Heaven,</hi> which is
the true <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and there by the
Oblation of his Blood and Obedience, makes
an Atonement for our Sins, and obtains Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from his Father to pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
into Favour every truly <hi>penitent</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
in the World. Thus you see how
the <hi>Personal Transactions</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi>
were under the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> represented in
<hi>mystical</hi> Types and Figures; but when he
came to tabernacle among <hi>us,</hi> he did all <hi>that</hi>
which before he only represented: He actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
came down from the Father to us, was
born of the <hi>Holy Virgin,</hi> lived a most <hi>holy</hi>
and <hi>innocent</hi> Life, died a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for our
Sins, and is gone into <hi>Heaven</hi> to intercede
for us: So that now instead of <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi>
we have the <hi>Substances</hi> and <hi>Realities</hi>
that were obscurely shadowed and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in them.</p>
            <p>2. Another <hi>great</hi> Instance of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
among us <hi>full of Truth,</hi> is the <hi>Purity</hi>
and <hi>Spirituality</hi> of his Laws. It's <hi>apparent</hi>
that those which he gave to the <hi>Iews,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>literal</hi> Sense of them, did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oblige them to an <hi>external Obedience;</hi> and
therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the whole Law a <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:63657:135"/>
Commandment, Heb.</hi> 7. 16. and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of it he calls <hi>carnal Ordinances imposed
upon them till the time of Reformation, Heb.
9.</hi> 10. But yet it is apparent that by these
<hi>carnal Ordinances</hi> the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly
<hi>typify</hi> and represent that <hi>internal</hi>
Purity of Soul which the <hi>Evangelical Law</hi>
doth exact: For he seeing that the <hi>Iews</hi> were
not only a <hi>perverse,</hi> but also a <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>sottish</hi>
People, as those generally are who are born
and bred in Slavery, and that therefore they
were <hi>incapable</hi> of <hi>sublime</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and would be apt to forget <hi>plain</hi>
ones, He therefore thought it most <hi>proper</hi>
and <hi>suitable</hi> to their Capacity and Genius to
instruct them by <hi>sensible</hi> and <hi>material</hi> Signs,
even as Parents do sometimes teach their
Children by Pictures; for of this his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention
to their Dulness and Capacity,
the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> takes notice, <hi>Chap. 28.
10,</hi> 11. where he saith, that he gave them
<hi>Precept upon precept, line upon line, here a
little and there a little with a stammering
tongue;</hi> that is, he look'd upon them as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and so condescended to their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and spoke to them in their <hi>own</hi> Dialect.
And this Way of instructing them by <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
and <hi>visible</hi> Signs was the most <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
to take effect, because it was much in use
in the <hi>Eastern Countries,</hi> but more especially
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:63657:136"/>
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> whose Manners they were infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fond of, to wrap up their most <hi>excellent</hi>
Precepts in <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> which were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Pictures and <hi>material</hi> Signs, by
which they represented their <hi>Divine</hi> and
<hi>Moral</hi> Institutions. Thus therefore by such
<hi>visible</hi> Signs and Pictures, the <hi>Eternal Word</hi>
instructed them in the Rules of <hi>internal</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Goodness; so by <hi>Circumcision</hi> he
signified to them the Circumcision of their
Hearts; and by their <hi>several Washings,</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
from <hi>Hypocrisy</hi> and <hi>Sensuality;</hi> yea this
was probably the Intent of that Difference
of <hi>Meats,</hi> as St. <hi>Barnabas</hi> in his Epistle tells
us, that Swines Flesh was pronounc'd <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi>
to instruct them not to live like <hi>Hoggs</hi>
that clamour when they are <hi>hungry,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
their Masters when they are <hi>full;</hi> that
<hi>Eagles</hi> and such <hi>ravenous Birds</hi> were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to be eat, to teach them that those who
live not by <hi>Industry,</hi> but <hi>Rapine,</hi> are <hi>abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;</hi>
that <hi>Fish without Scales,</hi> which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
dwell in the Mud, were all pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<hi>unclean;</hi> to teach them the Evil of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality,</hi>
and <hi>Earthly-mindedness!</hi> Thus by
these <hi>outward</hi> Signs his Intent was to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
into them <hi>internal</hi> Purity of Mind;
and this was very well understood by those
who were <hi>good</hi> and <hi>wise</hi> among them:
Hence we find <hi>David</hi> gives very <hi>high Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums</hi>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:63657:136"/>
of the Law, <hi>Ps. 19. 7, 8. The Law
of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul,
making wise the simple; rejoycing the Heart,
enlightning the Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. which Characters
are <hi>proper</hi> only to that <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi>
Sense of the Law that was <hi>decyphered</hi> upon
those <hi>outward</hi> Signs and Ceremonies. Which
Sense seems to have been very <hi>little</hi> taken
notice of by the <hi>sottish Vulgar;</hi> for only the
Ceremony it self was Matter of Law to
them, which if they observed they were not
<hi>punishable</hi> by that Law, though they never
took notice of its <hi>spiritual</hi> Sense and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which made them neglect that <hi>inward</hi>
Purity which was pictured on those <hi>outward</hi>
Signs, and place the whole of their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
in an <hi>outside ceremonious</hi> Pageantry.
Hence is that of St. <hi>Paul, 2 Cor. 3. 13, 14, 15.
I used,</hi> saith he, <hi>great plainness of Speech:
And not as Moses, which put a Vail over his
Face, that the Children of Israel could not
stedfastly look unto the end of that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished.
But their Minds were blinded; for
until this day remaineth the same Vail untaken
away, in the reading the Old Testament; which
Vail is done away in Christ:</hi> By which <hi>Vail</hi>
he means those <hi>outward</hi> Shadows and Types
in which the <hi>mystical</hi> Sense of the Law was
wrapt and involved; and it seems they were
so taken with the Pomp and Gaity of the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,</hi>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:63657:137"/>
that they never minded that <hi>rich</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Sense that was contained within it,
and which the <hi>Apostle</hi> here calls <hi>the End of
that which is abolished;</hi> yea, <hi>to this day,</hi> saith
he, the Vail of <hi>outward</hi> Ceremonies stands
so much in their Light that they cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the <hi>internal</hi> Sense of the <hi>Old Testament;</hi>
but now, saith he, it is <hi>done away by Christ.</hi>
Now that the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> hath pitched his
Tabernacle in our Nature, those <hi>outward</hi>
Types wherein this <hi>inward</hi> Purity of Soul
was so obscurely intimated, are vanished
like Clouds before the Sun, and in their
room are introduced the most <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
Laws of the Gospel, which are no
longer couched in Types and <hi>Ceremonial</hi>
Shadows, but in <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>naked</hi> Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Now <hi>internal</hi> Holiness is palpably
declared to be the <hi>great</hi> Design of <hi>Religion,</hi>
that we should <hi>cleanse our selves from all
Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit, and perfect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
in the fear of God.</hi> This therefore is
<hi>another</hi> Instance of Christ's tabernacling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us <hi>full of Truth, viz.</hi> the <hi>Purity</hi> and
<hi>Spirituality</hi> of his Laws, which heretofore he
<hi>mystically</hi> represented to the <hi>Iews</hi> by <hi>outward</hi>
Rites and Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>3. Another Instance of his tabernacling
among us <hi>full of Truth,</hi> in Contradistinction
to that <hi>obscure typical</hi> Way of his conversing
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:63657:137"/>
among the <hi>Iews,</hi> is the Condition and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom.</hi> The <hi>Eternal
Word,</hi> designing to erect a <hi>glorious</hi> Kingdom
in the World, drew as it were a <hi>rude</hi> Scheme
or Draught of it in the Form and Model of
the <hi>Iewish Polity.</hi> For <hi>first</hi> he erects a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
among them of which himself was
King, to typify that <hi>Spiritual</hi> Kingdom
which afterwards he meant to establish in
the World; then he adopts the <hi>Iews</hi> to be
his Children by the <hi>external</hi> Sign of <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
who are therefore called a <hi>Holy Seed,</hi>
which was an Emblem of that <hi>holy</hi> Seed
which afterwards he designed to beget to
himself by <hi>spiritual</hi> Regeneration, which
is therefore called the <hi>Circumcision of the
Heart, whose Praise is not of Men, but of God.</hi>
His delivering them from the Bondage of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and leading them through the <hi>Red-Sea</hi>
and the Wilderness into <hi>Canaan,</hi> typifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his delivering of his <hi>future Church</hi> from
the Bondage of Sin and Satan, and leading
it by his own <hi>gracious</hi> Presence through the
<hi>Red-Sea</hi> of Blood, and Persecutions, and the
Wilderness of the World to the <hi>Canaan</hi> of
<hi>eternal</hi> Rest. His giving the Law on <hi>Mount
Sinai</hi> in Fire, was a Figure of his delivering
the <hi>Gospel</hi> by the Spirit, which came down
in <hi>fiery cloven Tongues</hi> at the <hi>Feast of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ost.</hi>
Thus his erecting the Ark in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:63657:138"/>
was also <hi>another</hi> Type of that <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
Kingdom which afterwards he meant
to erect in the World. The <hi>divers</hi> Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Instruments of that Tabernacle
represented the Diversity of <hi>spiritual</hi> Gifts
and Functions in the <hi>Christian Church;</hi> its
being covered with Skins <hi>without,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
with Gold <hi>within,</hi> shadowed the
<hi>mean</hi> and <hi>contemptible</hi> Form wherein the
<hi>Christian Church</hi> first appeared to the World,
notwithstanding the <hi>inward</hi> Glory and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with which it was adorned and embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.
The Glory of <hi>God</hi> appearing in the
Tabernacle, denoted the Presence of <hi>Christ</hi> in
his <hi>Church,</hi> which he hath promised to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to the end of the World; its being remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Place to Place, and finding no Rest
till it was lodged in the Temple, prefigured
the <hi>persecuted</hi> State of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi>
which was hunted <hi>up</hi> and <hi>down</hi> the World
by the <hi>mighty Nimrods</hi> of the Earth, and
could find no Rest till it was transported to
the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Temple. By these and such
like <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> did the <hi>Eternal Word</hi>
prefigure the State and Condition of his <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Church,</hi> that so when it came to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
in the World, the <hi>Iews</hi> might know
and own it, having seen it before-hand so
exactly <hi>decyphered</hi> and <hi>adumbrated</hi> in the
very Frame and Model of their <hi>own</hi> Polity.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:63657:138"/>
But when he came to tabernacle in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he gave <hi>actual</hi> Being to those Things
which before he only <hi>shadowed</hi> and <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented;</hi>
for then he erected this <hi>glorious
Church,</hi> of which the <hi>Iewish</hi> was only a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
and Platform, delivered it from the
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage of Wickedness and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and by his own <hi>glorious</hi> Presence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
the Members of it through all the
Persecutions of an <hi>enraged</hi> World, to the
<hi>Canaan</hi> of <hi>eternal Rest;</hi> and therefore this
also is <hi>another plain</hi> Instance of his taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling
among us <hi>full of Truth,</hi> the State and
Condition of his Church, which before was
so obscurely represented.</p>
            <p>4. And lastly, <hi>Another</hi> Instance of his
tabernacling among us <hi>full of Truth,</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinction
to that <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>typical</hi> Way
of his conversing among the <hi>Iews,</hi> is the
<hi>glorious</hi> Recompences which he hath so
plainly and clearly promised to his Subjects.
For this he also obscurely <hi>typified</hi> to the <hi>Iews;</hi>
for, as I have already hinted, by that <hi>Canaan</hi>
which he bestowed upon them after their
<hi>tedious</hi> Travel through the Wilderness, he
did darkly represent to them that <hi>Canaan
above</hi> flowing with <hi>infinite</hi> Delights, which
he hath promised to bestow upon his <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Servants after they have pass'd through
the Wilderness of this World. So also by
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:63657:139"/>
their <hi>Sabbaoths,</hi> and especially their <hi>Year of
Iubilee,</hi> wherein they were to rest from all
their Labours, and keep a <hi>perpetual</hi> Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
He did obscurely <hi>decypher</hi> to them that
<hi>Sabbaoth of Rest,</hi> and <hi>Iubilee</hi> of <hi>endless</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
which <hi>vertuous</hi> Souls shall enjoy in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
after they have finished their Labours
here on <hi>Earth,</hi> as you may see at large
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. Now by these and such like <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi>
of their Law, which possibly the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
by <hi>Divine</hi> Inspiration might expound
to them, those who were <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, it is very probable, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
in the Article of <hi>eternal</hi> Life. Hence
it may be might arise that <hi>famous</hi> Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy
among the <hi>Iews</hi> concerning the <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
and <hi>Oral</hi> Law, which they call the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala,</hi>
or the Law by Tradition; not that
this <hi>traditional</hi> contained any thing that was
not in the <hi>written</hi> Law, but because those
things which were obscurely contained in
the <hi>Types</hi> of the <hi>written</hi> Law were explained
and interpreted in this their <hi>Traditional</hi> Law.
But it is <hi>apparent</hi> that the <hi>Types</hi> of <hi>eternal Life</hi>
were not fully explained in this <hi>traditional</hi>
Law till after the <hi>Babylonish Captivity,</hi> after
which the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and after him
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> began to speak more plainly of the
<hi>Resurrection of the Dead;</hi> and from that
Time forwards the Doctrine of the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:63657:139"/>
and <hi>eternal Life,</hi> began to be more
openly taught among the <hi>Common People</hi>
till about the Time of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> when
it was brought forth in the Light from
under those <hi>Types</hi> in which it was so obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
represented, and became a Principle even
of the <hi>Popular Religion,</hi> and an Article of
the <hi>Iewish Faith,</hi> as plainly appears from the
Records of those Times, particularly 2. <hi>Macc.</hi>
7. 23, 26. Comp. with <hi>Heb. 11. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>5.</hi> And
indeed it was very <hi>necessary</hi> that then this
Article should be more clearly revealed to
fortify the <hi>Iews</hi> against those many Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
whereunto they were exposed for the
sake of their <hi>Religion,</hi> that they might not be
terrified to <hi>apostatize</hi> from it by those <hi>cruel</hi>
Martyrdoms which in the Time of the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees</hi>
they many of them endured; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
now the Time of the <hi>Gospel</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
and consequently its Mysteries,
like the Light of the <hi>rising</hi> Sun, began to
break forth <hi>clearer</hi> and <hi>clearer</hi> from under that
Cloud of <hi>Types</hi> wherein it was wrapt and
involved, till at last the <hi>Sun of Righteousness</hi>
himself arose and dispersed those Clouds, and
brought <hi>Life and Immortality to light by the
Gospel.</hi> But as for the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> who give
no heed to the <hi>Cabala,</hi> or <hi>Traditional</hi> Law,
in which this Doctrine was first discovered,
and adhered only to the <hi>written</hi> Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:63657:140"/>
they still continued Infidels in this Point,
and believed neither <hi>Angels</hi> nor <hi>Spirits,</hi> nor
the <hi>Life to come:</hi> So very obscurely was it
represented in the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of the
<hi>Written</hi> Law. But when once the <hi>Eternal
Word</hi> came to tabernacle in our Flesh, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
this <hi>great</hi> Article so plainly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the World, that 'tis impossible for any
one not to believe it that believes him to be the
<hi>Messias,</hi> or <hi>Incarnate Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus you see by all these Instances
what a <hi>vast</hi> Difference there was in respect
of <hi>Truth,</hi> between Christ's tabernacling in
our Nature, and in the Tabernacle of <hi>Moses.</hi>
And now I shall conclude this Argument
with <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three practical</hi> Inferences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> He dwelt or tabernacled among us.]
From hence I infer the <hi>high</hi> Authority of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and that <hi>holy Religion</hi> which he hath
revealed to us. For to tabernacle among
us, as I have already shewed you, signifies
to dwell in the midst of, as the <hi>Shechinah,
Presence,</hi> or <hi>Representative</hi> of the most <hi>High
God,</hi> as one that acted in his Father's Person,
and was vested with his Authority, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
as one who hath as <hi>great</hi> a Right to
exact our Obedience as the <hi>Eternal Father</hi>
himself, should he have come down from
<hi>Heaven</hi> in his own Person to give Laws to
Mankind. For so when the <hi>Eternal Word</hi>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:63657:140"/>
went before the Camp of <hi>Israel</hi> as the <hi>Shechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi>
or <hi>Angel of God's Presence,</hi> God requires
them that they should obey <hi>him</hi> as himself;
<hi>Beware of him, and obey his Voice,</hi> saith God;
<hi>provoke him not, for he will not pardon your
Transgression, for my Name is in him,</hi> Exod.
23. 21. and <hi>v.</hi> 22. To obey the Voice of this
<hi>Angel</hi> is interpreted to be the same thing, as
to obey the Voice of the most <hi>High God</hi>
himself; <hi>But if thou shalt indeed obey his Voice,</hi>
saith God, <hi>and do all that I speak, then I will
be an Enemy to thy Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. So that for
the <hi>Israelites</hi> to disobey this <hi>Angel</hi> (who,
as I have proved to you, was the <hi>Eternal
Word,</hi> or <hi>Representative</hi> of the most <hi>High
God</hi> to them) was to all Intents and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
the same Thing as if they had diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
the most <hi>High</hi> himself. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells the <hi>Iews, He
that believeth on me, believeth not on me but
on the Father that sent me;</hi> that is, he doth
not meerly believe on me, but on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>too,</hi> whose Authority I have, and whose
Person I represent; for so he explains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the <hi>following Verse, He that seeth me,
seeth him that sent me;</hi> that is, I being my
Father's <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or <hi>Representative, Ioh. 12.
44,</hi> 45. And therefore as every Contempt
of the <hi>Deputy,</hi> or <hi>Vice-Governor,</hi> is an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
to the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Prince whose Person
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:63657:141"/>
he bears, and by whose Authority he acts;
so every Rebellion against <hi>Christ</hi> is an <hi>open</hi>
Defiance to the <hi>Sovereign God</hi> whose Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he represents, and by whose Authority
he reigns. Hence our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells the <hi>Iews;
Ioh.</hi> 5. 23. that <hi>He that honoureth not the
Son, honoureth not the Father which hath sent
him;</hi> which plainly intimates that <hi>God</hi> the
Father resents those Indignities which we
offer to <hi>Christ</hi> and his Laws, as if they were
done to his <hi>own</hi> Person, and that if <hi>himself</hi>
should speak to us from the Battlements of
<hi>Heaven,</hi> or proclaim his Law to us in a
<hi>Voice</hi> of <hi>Thunder,</hi> he would not be more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
to hear us openly declare that we
will not obey him, than he is to see us tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
upon the Laws of his <hi>Son</hi> which he hath
stamp'd with his own <hi>Sovereign</hi> Authority.
So that if we were not infinitely <hi>fool-hardy,</hi>
methinks we should never dare to violate
our <hi>Religion,</hi> in which the Authority of the
most <hi>High God</hi> is so immediately concerned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For whatsoever our <hi>Religion</hi> requires of us,
it requires in his Name who hath an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted</hi>
Right and Authority to command
us; for from all <hi>Eternity</hi> he was invested
with an <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>unlimited</hi> Power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any thing that is not <hi>unbecoming</hi> his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
Perfections, and in this the Right of his
Dominion over us is originally founded.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:63657:141"/>
For he that hath Power must needs have a
Right to exercise it so far as it is <hi>just</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming</hi>
his Nature, otherwise his Power
would be altogether in vain; and therefore
since <hi>God</hi> from all <hi>Eternity</hi> hath a Power of
doing whatsoever he pleases so far as is
<hi>consistent</hi> with his Holiness and Goodness,
there is nothing can be pretended against
the Right of his Dominion and Authority
over us: For God <hi>cannot</hi> but have an <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Right to exercise his <hi>own</hi> Power, and he
cannot but have an <hi>immutable</hi> Right to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
it over his <hi>own</hi> Creatures. And as from
all <hi>Eternity</hi> he had Power to do whatsoever
was <hi>just</hi> and <hi>becoming</hi> him, so from his
creating of us it became most <hi>just</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming</hi>
that he should rule and govern us;
for we became <hi>his</hi> as soon as we were creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him; all our Powers of Action were
from him, and by that he hath acquired
an <hi>unalienable</hi> Right in whatsoever we are
able to do. We have nothing but what is
<hi>his</hi> Gift, and therefore can do nothing but
what is <hi>his</hi> Debt; we received <hi>all</hi> from him,
and therefore must owe <hi>all</hi> to him; for by
Right of Creation he is the <hi>supream</hi> Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of all our Powers and Faculties, and as
such hath a <hi>just</hi> Claim to all the Homage
and Obedience that we are able to render
him. So that as God's Dominion over us is
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:63657:142"/>
originally founded in his most <hi>absolute</hi> Power
to do whatsoever is <hi>just</hi> and <hi>becoming</hi> him;
so the Justice and Becomingness of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over us doth immediately result
from his creating of us, by which he hath
<hi>for ever</hi> intitled himself to all the Obedience
we can render him. And by Virtue of this
<hi>immutable</hi> Title doth he claim our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Laws of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> whom next
to himself he hath made our Prince and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
having vested him with his own <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi>
Authority, and constituted him his
<hi>supream</hi> Representative in the <hi>Church.</hi> So
that by disobeying his Laws we incur the
Guilt of the most <hi>monstrous</hi> Injustice in the
World; we resume our selves from <hi>him</hi> to
whom we owe our Being, and refuse to own
<hi>our selves</hi> to be his Creatures from whose
Bounty we receive even the Power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling
against him; we alienate our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
from those <hi>sacred</hi> Uses whereunto they
were designed and consecrated, and turn
these <hi>living</hi> Temples of <hi>God</hi> into Dens of
<hi>impure</hi> Thoughts and <hi>filthy</hi> Lusts; In a
word, we fight against <hi>God</hi> with his <hi>own</hi>
Gifts, and arm the Effects of his Bounty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his <hi>Sovereign</hi> Authority. And what
do we think will be the Consequence of these
Things? Can we be so <hi>sottish</hi> as to imagine
that the <hi>Almighty</hi> Father will sit above in the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:63657:142"/>
               <hi>Heavens,</hi> and see how his Laws are trampled
upon, his Authority contemned, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to Scorn and Derision by a Company of
<hi>impious</hi> Wretches that owe their very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
to him, and never be concerned at it?
Do we think him so <hi>stupid</hi> a Being as that no
Provocations will awake his Vengeance,
that he will <hi>for ever</hi> sit <hi>unconcerned</hi> with his
Hands in his Bosom whilst his <hi>violated</hi> Laws,
like the <hi>Souls under the Altar,</hi> are continually
crying out to him, <hi>How long, O Lord, holy
and true! dost thou not avenge our Quarrel
upon the Heads of these audacious Rebels that
every day trample us under foot, and have no
more regard for our Authority than they have
for the Whistling of the Wind!</hi> For God's
sake, Sirs, let us consider before it be <hi>too</hi> late
what is like to become of us, what <hi>probable</hi>
Hopes of Security we can propose to <hi>our
selves</hi> if we persist in this <hi>unjust</hi> Rebellion.
Gird up your Loins like Men, and I will
demand of you in the Name of <hi>God,</hi> do you
think that the <hi>wise</hi> Governor of the World
will be <hi>for ever insensible</hi> of all the <hi>rude</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
and Provocations you offer him? If
so, pray where is his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> or in what
Sense doth he govern the World, if he takes
no care to secure his Laws by <hi>punishing</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
and lets his Subjects alone to do as
they list? Or have you an Arm as <hi>strong</hi> as
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:63657:143"/>
God's? Can you grapple with his <hi>Almighty</hi>
Vengeance, or withstand the Stroke of his
Thunderbolts? Sure such a <hi>ridiculous</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
can never enter into any <hi>reasonable</hi>
Breast? and if not, in the Name of <hi>God</hi> what
do you propose to <hi>your</hi> selves when you can
neither hope for Favour from <hi>God,</hi> nor Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
from <hi>your</hi> selves? Are you so <hi>aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned</hi>
of all your Reason as wilfully to shut
your Eyes against your Danger, and run the
<hi>desperate</hi> Venture of falling into the Hands of
the <hi>living God?</hi> Hath not our <hi>blessed Lord</hi>
most fairly warn'd us what we are to trust
to? Hath he not told us how he <hi>values</hi> his
Laws, and how dreadfully he will <hi>punish</hi> the
Transgression of them? Hath he not most
seriously protested to us that unless we do
<hi>repent</hi> and <hi>amend,</hi> he will never forgive us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>this</hi> Life, or <hi>that to come;</hi> and that
if we still persist in our Rebellions, he will at
last banish us from his Presence <hi>for ever,</hi> and
assign us our Portion with <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Ghosts</hi> in that Lake that burns with Fire
and Brimstone? And hath he not taken it
upon his Death that all this is <hi>true,</hi> when he
so freely <hi>sealed</hi> his Doctrines with his Blood?
And now after all this, is it possible we should
be so <hi>sensless</hi> as to think we can be <hi>safe</hi> in our
Wickedness, when <hi>God the Father</hi> is engaged
both in <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> to avenge it as
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:63657:143"/>
an Affront to his Authority, and <hi>God the Son</hi>
hath revealed his Father's Wrath from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
against all Unrighteousness and Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of Men? and therefore as we value <hi>our
own</hi> Safety, it concerns us either to submit
to that <hi>Divine</hi> Authority which is stamp'd
upon the Laws of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> or else to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
our selves of <hi>some</hi> Retreat or Sanctuary
from that <hi>Almighty</hi> Vengeance which our
Rebellion will certainly arm against us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> He dwelt among us <hi>full of Grace.]</hi>
Hence I infer what <hi>mighty</hi> Encouragement
we have to serve and obey our <hi>blessed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
who in his dwelling among us was <hi>full</hi>
of every thing that can render his Service
<hi>lovely</hi> or <hi>desireable,</hi> and abounded in all those
<hi>amiable</hi> Graces that can oblige us to love and
obey him. For what was there wanting in
our <hi>blessed Master</hi> that any <hi>reasonable</hi> Subject
can desire in his <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Sovereign?</hi>
Would he desire a Prince of a <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
Temper, one that is <hi>full</hi> of Love and
Tenderness to his Subjects? Such a one in
the most <hi>eminent</hi> degree is our <hi>blessed Lord;</hi>
for how doth the History of his Conversation
upon Earth abound with the Expressions of
a most <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>loving</hi> Temper? For Love
was the Principle of all his Actions, the Life
and Soul of his Conversation, and in all that
he did or spoke he made some <hi>new</hi> Discovery
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:63657:144"/>
of his <hi>unfeigned</hi> Affection to the World; for
he <hi>went about doing good,</hi> and his whole Life
was nothing but one <hi>continued Act</hi> of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to Mankind. For still you find him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>instructing</hi> the <hi>Ignorant,</hi> or <hi>reproving</hi> the
<hi>Erroneous,</hi> or <hi>comforting</hi> the <hi>Dejected,</hi> or <hi>feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
the <hi>Hungry,</hi> or <hi>curing</hi> the <hi>Sick</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased.</hi>
From Morning to Night he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
engaged in <hi>one good</hi> Action or <hi>other,</hi>
and the whole Race of his Life, like that of
the Sun, was spent in <hi>enlivening</hi> or <hi>inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
the World. So <hi>endearing</hi> was his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
that he obliged his very Enemies,
and, when he had won them, treated them
with all the Tenderness and Affection of a
most <hi>loving</hi> Father towards his <hi>dearest</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
From all he conversed with he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
Respect and Veneration, and none
were <hi>able</hi> to resist the Charms of his <hi>victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
Love, but those whose Hearts were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
than the <hi>nether</hi> Milstone. But that I may
convince you of the <hi>infinite</hi> Goodness and
Tenderness of his Nature, I will give you but
that <hi>one</hi> Instance <hi>Luke 19. 41. And when he
was come near, he beheld the City, and wept
over it;</hi> which, as you will see afterwards,
was occasioned by the Fore-sight of its <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching</hi>
Ruin and Destruction; and yet at
the same time he foresaw the Cruelties
which those <hi>barbarous</hi> Villains were about to
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:63657:144"/>
practise upon him, how they would scourge
his Body with <hi>knotty</hi> Whips, and nail his
Hands and Feet to the Cross, and thrust a
Spear into his Heart; he saw how they
would <hi>triumph</hi> over his Misery, mock at his
Calamity, and dance to the Musick of his
<hi>dying</hi> Grones. And now one would have
thought such a Prospect as this would have
<hi>for ever</hi> enraged his Soul against them, and
made him rejoyce to see that <hi>sweeping</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
that was coming upon them; but
such was the <hi>incomparable</hi> Sweetness of his
Temper, that while he <hi>foresaw</hi> them plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>his</hi> Ruin, he could not but sigh over
<hi>theirs,</hi> and while he beheld their Malice all
<hi>reeking</hi> in his Blood, and sporting it self with
his Torments and Agonies, yet at the Sense
of their <hi>approaching</hi> Destruction his very
Bowels <hi>earned,</hi> and his Heart <hi>melted</hi> with
Commiseration, and he could not forbear
weeping to think that those <hi>cursed</hi> Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all his Miseries must e're long be so
<hi>wretched</hi> and <hi>miserable</hi> themselves, earnestly
wishing that they who so greedily thirsted
for his Blood had known <hi>in that their day the
things which belong to their Peace.</hi> And though
one would have thought the <hi>barbarous</hi> Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
he met with here upon Earth
would have <hi>for ever</hi> quenched all his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to Mankind, yet still it lives, and in
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:63657:145"/>
despite of all the Affronts and Outrages he
endured, burns as vigorously in his Breast as
ever. So <hi>unconquerable</hi> was his Love to his
Subjects, that all the <hi>bloody</hi> Cruelties they
practised upon him, when they chased him
out of the World, were never able to <hi>alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
his Heart and Affections from them;
but after all their Cruelties he still retained
his Fatherly Bowels towards them, and when
he could endure their Torments no longer,
breathed out his <hi>loving</hi> Soul in an <hi>earnest</hi>
Prayer for their Pardon, <hi>Father forgive them,
for they know not what they do.</hi> And now that
he is in <hi>Heaven</hi> among <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>glorified
Spirits,</hi> where he cannot but remember how
unkindly we treated him when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Earth,</hi> and perhaps doth still bear upon
his <hi>glorified Body</hi> those very Wounds which
he received from our Hands, which one
would think were <hi>sufficient</hi> to incense him
against us <hi>for ever;</hi> yet his Heart is the <hi>same</hi>
towards us, <hi>full</hi> of all those <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>tender</hi>
Resentments that first brought him down
from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and render'd his Conversation
among us so <hi>full</hi> of Sweetness and Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And now being so infinitely kind
as he is, why should we be disheartned
from serving him? Methinks the Sense of
his Love to us, if there were no <hi>other</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the World, should be <hi>sufficient</hi> to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:63657:145"/>
bind us to his Service <hi>for ever.</hi> For, <hi>O my
Soul, how can I do too much for so kind a
Friend! How can I be too submissive to so good
a Master! That is so infinitely tender of all his
Servants, and loves them a thousand times
more than they love themselves!</hi> Sure if we had
any Spark of Ingenuity in us, the Sense of
his <hi>matchless</hi> Kindness towards us, would be
<hi>sufficient</hi> to turn all our Duty to him into
Recreation, to make us thirst after his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and catch at all Opportunities of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
our Loyalty and Obedience to him:
We should embrace his Commands as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments
to us, and wear them as the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Favours,</hi> and think our selves more <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured</hi>
in being the Servants of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
than in being made <hi>mighty</hi> Kings and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates.</p>
            <p>2. Consider, as he is <hi>full</hi> of Grace, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of his own <hi>Personal</hi> Disposition, so he
is also in Respect of his Laws, in which, as
I have already shewed you, he requires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of us but what is for our <hi>Good,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what tends to the Perfection of
our Natures, and the Consummation of our
Happiness. All that our <hi>Saviour</hi> requires
at our Hands, is only that we should act
according to the Laws of a <hi>Reasonable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and constantly pursue the <hi>great</hi> End
of our Creation, which can never be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:63657:146"/>
by us, unless we regulate our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by those <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> Rules which
he hath prescribed us, and which he hath
prescribed us upon no <hi>other</hi> Inducement,
but only to oblige us to be <hi>happy.</hi> For as to
any Advantage that will accrue to him from
our Actions, 'tis altogether <hi>indifferent</hi> to
him whether we obey him or no; for he
was always infinitely <hi>happy</hi> within himself,
and would have always been so, though we
had never had a Being; so that his Felicity
depends not upon us; and were it not that
the <hi>superabundant</hi> Goodness of his Nature
doth <hi>for ever</hi> incline him to make <hi>us happy</hi> as
well as <hi>himself,</hi> he would never have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
himself about us, but would have
let us alone to do as we list, and abandoned
us to the Fate of <hi>our own</hi> Actions. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being infinitely <hi>happy</hi> within himself,
can have no self-Ends to serve upon his
Creatures; because within the Circle of his
own <hi>divine</hi> Being, he hath all that he needs,
and all that he desires; but being infinitely
<hi>good,</hi> as he is infinitely <hi>happy,</hi> we are sure
that <hi>our</hi> Good must be the only End of his
intermedling with our Actions, and his
giving Laws to direct them. And if we
consult the <hi>particular</hi> Lawss which he hath
given us, we shall find they all of them
most naturally tend to <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>recti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie</hi>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:63657:146"/>
our <hi>disordered</hi> Natures, to <hi>exalt</hi> and <hi>spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize</hi>
our Affections, and inspire us with all
those <hi>divine</hi> Dispositions that are requisite
to qualify us for the Happiness of the World
to come. And now methinks, if we had
any Sense of <hi>our own</hi> Interest, this Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
should mightily encourage us to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
to think that while we are serving
our <hi>blessed Master,</hi> we are serving <hi>our</hi> selves
to the <hi>best</hi> Purposes, and that <hi>his</hi> Service,
and <hi>our</hi> Interest are so combined and united,
that by the same Actions we may gratify
<hi>him,</hi> and do <hi>our selves</hi> the <hi>greatest</hi> Kindness
in the World; that he exacts nothing from
us, but what he was obliged to do by the
<hi>infinite</hi> Care and Concern he hath for us;
and that he had been less <hi>kind,</hi> should he
have required <hi>less,</hi> and must necessarily have
subtracted from us some Degree of our
Happiness, should he have abated us any
Part of our Duty. <hi>O Blessed Iesus,</hi> who can
complain of thy Service, when thy very
Commands are Tokens of thy Love; when
all the Duty thou requirest of us, is only to
be <hi>kind</hi> to <hi>our selves</hi> in doing those things,
which, if thou hadst never commanded,
<hi>our own</hi> Interest would have obliged us to,
had we but understood it as well, or regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it as much as thou dost?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:63657:147"/>
3. But then consider again, as He is <hi>full of
Grace</hi> to us in his own <hi>personal</hi> Temper, and in
those <hi>mild</hi> and <hi>gentle</hi> Laws which he hath
given us; so <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He is <hi>full of Grace</hi> to
us also in respect of that <hi>gracious</hi> Pardon and
Forgiveness which he hath procured for,
and promised to us if we will heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and amend. I confess, though his
<hi>Personal</hi> Temper should be never so <hi>sweet,</hi>
and his Laws never so <hi>gentle,</hi> yet if he
should, upon every <hi>wilful</hi> Offence, exclude
us from all Hope of Pardon, it might justly
discourage the Generality of Men from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
any farther in his Service; because
<hi>more</hi> or <hi>less,</hi> we have all sinned, and fallen
short of the Glory of God. So that if upon
every <hi>wilful</hi> Act of Rebellion, we should
stand <hi>for ever</hi> excluded from his Favour;
we should generally be left in a <hi>desperate</hi>
Condition, and then to what Purpose should
we serve him any longer, when by all our
<hi>future</hi> Loyalty and Submissions, we must
never hope to be readmitted into his Grace
and Favour? To remove this <hi>great</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
therefore, the <hi>blessed Iesus</hi>
hath obtained for us this <hi>publick Grant</hi> and
<hi>Charter</hi> of Mercy from his Father, that if
now at last we will repent and amend our
Ways, notwithstanding all our <hi>past</hi> Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
we shall find Mercy, and be as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:63657:147"/>
received into his Grace and Favour, as
if we never had offended him; and this
<hi>merciful</hi> Grant he hath published to us in the
Promises of his Gospel: So that now we
cannot make the <hi>least</hi> Doubt of our Pardon
and Acceptance with him, upon our <hi>unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
Repentance, without calling his Truth
and Veracity into Question. And now
what <hi>reasonable</hi> Cause of Discouragement
have we from returning to the Service of our
<hi>blessed Master,</hi> when we are so amply assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that our <hi>past</hi> Disobediences to him shall,
upon our Return, be forgotten <hi>for ever?</hi>
For, in the Name of <hi>God,</hi> what can we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
more? Is it <hi>reasonable</hi> that the <hi>wise</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the World should pardon Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
whether they repent or no; that he
should let them take their Swing in Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
and never take any Cognizance of
their Actions? Let us speak plainly;
would we have him govern us or no? If
not, we are infinitely <hi>besotted,</hi> that for the
Sake of a <hi>few paltry</hi> Lusts that are our <hi>Plague</hi>
and <hi>Shame</hi> would deprive <hi>our selves</hi> of all
the Blessings and Benefits of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But whatsoever we would have, it
is by no means fit that he should surrender
up his <hi>just</hi> Authority over us, because we
are Fools and Mad-men; and if we think
it fit that he should govern us, we cannot
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:63657:148"/>
be so <hi>senseless</hi> as to think it <hi>reasonable</hi> that he
should pardon our Sins till we repent of
them; because by so doing he would give
<hi>up</hi> all, and leave us <hi>absolute</hi> Masters of our
selves. So that if we <hi>our selves</hi> had been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the <hi>Privy Council</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> to give
our Vote to those Laws by which we were
to be ruled and governed, doubtless we
could not have had the Confidence to ask
either <hi>gentler</hi> Laws or <hi>greater</hi> Indulgences
than the <hi>blessed Iesus</hi> hath freely granted us
in his <hi>Gospel.</hi> If <hi>God</hi> should have told us,
that he would impose nothing on us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>our own</hi> Consent, and bid us ask
for our selves any thing that is <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest,</hi>
doubtless the utmost that any <hi>modest</hi>
Man could have craved, would have been
only this; <hi>Lord, if thou will be but so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as to give us such Laws as are suited to our
Natures, and are conducive to our Happiness,
and so far to consider our Weakness and Insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
as not cast us away from thy Favour for
ever upon every wilful Transgression, but to
pardon and receive us again upon our unfeigned
Repentance, this is all the Favour we would
ask, and for this we would praise and adore thy
Goodness for ever and ever.</hi> Since <hi>God</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
out of <hi>his own</hi> Grace and Goodness,
hath granted this Indulgence to us, why
should we be discouraged from returning
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:63657:148"/>
to our Duty, though we have never so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously
violated and neglected it? For
now we are fully assured that we can never
be excluded from all Hope of Pardon, till we
are past all Possibility of Repentance.</p>
            <p>4. He is <hi>full of Grace</hi> to us also, in respect
of that <hi>abundant</hi> Assistance which he hath
promised and vouchsafed to us. I do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
though notwithstanding our <hi>former</hi>
Rebellions, he should be never so ready to
receive us into Favour again upon our <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned</hi>
Repentance; yet unless he will also
assist us in <hi>our</hi> Repentance, and enable us
to conquer the Difficulties of it, we have
still very <hi>great</hi> Reason to be discouraged
from his Service: For, by <hi>our own evil</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
we have so disabled our selves from
returning to our Duty, that without the
Concurrence of a <hi>supernatural</hi> Grace, it will
be in vain for us to attempt it: For he that
from a State of <hi>habitual</hi> Sin, enters into a
Course of Repentance, must strive all along
against the Current of his Nature, which
at <hi>first</hi> especially, and when he is <hi>weakest,</hi>
will be so <hi>swift</hi> and <hi>impetuous,</hi> that by <hi>his
own single</hi> Strength, it will be impossible for
him to <hi>stem</hi> or conquer it, and unless he be
assisted by a <hi>greater</hi> Strength than <hi>his own,</hi>
he will be inevitably born <hi>down</hi> and carried
away with it, though he struggle never so
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:63657:149"/>
vigorously against it; so that it is no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
at all to the Service of <hi>Christ,</hi>
that he will receive us to Pardon when we
heartily repent, unless he will also inable
us to repent by the Concurrence of his <hi>Grace</hi>
with our <hi>honest</hi> Endeavors. But this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
also he hath removed out of
our Way, by making us a <hi>publick</hi> Grant
and Promise of his Grace and Assistance;
for he hath assured us that he will give his
<hi>holy Spirit to every one that asks it,</hi> Luk. 11. 13.
that if we will <hi>work out our own Salvation,
he will work in us to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2.
12, 13. and that <hi>to him that hath,</hi> that is,
improves that Grace which he hath, <hi>it shall
be given more abundantly,</hi> Mat. 13. 12. so
that though we cannot do all by our own
<hi>single</hi> Strength, yet we can do so much as
will oblige our <hi>blessed</hi> Master to enable us to
do all; and therefore that we do not do all,
is as much <hi>our</hi> Fault as if we could, because
we are able to do <hi>all</hi> through <hi>Christ,</hi> who
will strengthen us if we will but do what
we can; so that this, methinks, should be
sufficient to encourage any <hi>reasonable</hi> Man
in the World to undertake his Service, to
consider that he who is my Master, will
<hi>co-operate</hi> with me, and <hi>proportion</hi> my
Strength to the Work he enjoyns me; that
he will not stand <hi>still</hi> with his Arms in his
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:63657:149"/>
Bosom, and see me struggle in <hi>vain</hi> under
an <hi>insupportable</hi> Burthen of Duties, but that
he will set <hi>too</hi> his <hi>own</hi> Shoulders, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
his <hi>own</hi> Strength, and enable me, by
degrees, to undergo it with Ease and Alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
so that though thro' the <hi>Weakness</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency</hi>
which I have voluntarily contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
my Duty is become <hi>too heavy</hi> for my
Shoulders, yet I will never be disheartened
so long as I am sure it is not <hi>too heavy</hi> for my
Saviour's, for if I heartily endeavour, I am
<hi>confident</hi> I shall undergo it, if it be in the
Power of an <hi>Almighty</hi> Grace to enable me.</p>
            <p>5. And lastly, He was <hi>full of Grace</hi> to us
also, in Respect of that <hi>glorious</hi> Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
which he hath promised to us, and
prepared for us. I confess, were his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
all Work, and no Wages, there were
some Reason to be disheartned; but when
he hath promised, and so amply assured us,
that after we have spent a <hi>few</hi> Days or Years
in his Service upon <hi>Earth,</hi> he will receive
us into the Participation of <hi>his own</hi> Joys,
where we shall commence as <hi>happy</hi> as it is
possible for an <hi>everlasting Heaven</hi> to make
us, methinks we should kiss his Yoke, and
court his Service, and think we can never
do too much for such a <hi>bountiful</hi> Master,
who rewards all his Servants with such <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal</hi>
Preferments: For what is the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:63657:150"/>
of a <hi>few</hi> Moments, compared with
that <hi>everlasting</hi> Rest and Pleasure wherein
it shall shortly terminate? And when once
we are arrived to the <hi>Heavenly Canaan,</hi> and
have tasted those <hi>ravishing</hi> Delights with
which it flows and abounds, how <hi>light</hi> and
<hi>inconsiderable</hi> will all these Difficulties in
our Voyage appear to us, which now do so
startle and affright us? How shall we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at <hi>our own</hi> Sloth and Faint-heartedness,
to think that ever we should be such <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
Cowards as to be afraid of any thing that
hath <hi>Heaven</hi> at the End of it, which is a
Happiness so <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>unspeakable,</hi> that the
Hope of it is <hi>sufficient</hi> to turn Torments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Recreations? How shall we be astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>our selves,</hi> to think that we could ever
be such <hi>wretched</hi> Fools as to deliberate <hi>one</hi>
Moment, whether <hi>Heaven</hi> were <hi>preferable</hi>
before all the Pleasures of Sin, or whether
it were more <hi>eligible</hi> to dwell with <hi>Harlots</hi>
and <hi>Drunkards</hi> for a Moment, and wallow
in their <hi>beastly</hi> Pleasures, than to enjoy the
Society of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> to
all <hi>Eternity?</hi> The Odds will then appear so
<hi>vast,</hi> and the Disproportion so <hi>unspeakable,</hi>
that we shall wonder how we could ever be
so <hi>senseless</hi> as to make a Comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. Sure Sirs we do not believe
that <hi>Heaven</hi> is the Recompence of Christ's
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:63657:150"/>
Service; for if we did, methinks we should
more heartily engage in it. For could we
stand thus <hi>deliberating</hi> upon the Shore, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we shall bid adieu to our Lusts, take
Leave of all their <hi>fulsom</hi> Pleasures, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark
<hi>our selves</hi> in the Service of our <hi>Saviour?</hi>
Could we stand pausing <hi>thus</hi> as we do,
whether we shall venture into those <hi>petty</hi>
Storms that are like to attend us in our <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
Voyage, did we verily believe that a
<hi>few</hi> Leagues Distance lies that <hi>blessed</hi> Shore
where we shall be crowned as soon as we
are landed with all the Joys that an <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Heaven</hi> means? Certainly the Belief of
this is <hi>sufficient</hi> to put Life and Courage into
the most <hi>crest-fallen</hi> Soul in the World, and
to give her Spirit and Vigour enough to
carry her triumphantly through all the <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
Stages of her Duty. So that considering
how, in all Respects, our <hi>blessed Lord</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
in Grace and Goodness to us, we
have the <hi>greatest</hi> Encouragement imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to engage us to his Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly. He was full of Truth.]</hi> From whence
I infer, that the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is a very
<hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> thing. For this, as I
have shewed you at large, is one of the <hi>great</hi>
Notes of Distinction between Christ's ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacling
among the <hi>Iews</hi> and among
<hi>Christians,</hi> that whereas among the <hi>Iews,</hi>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:63657:151"/>
he was <hi>full</hi> of <hi>obscure</hi> Types and <hi>mystical</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations;
among us <hi>Christians,</hi> he is
<hi>full</hi> of Truth; that is, he is <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>open,</hi>
and <hi>clear,</hi> without any <hi>dark</hi> Reserves or
Mysteries; now he hath plainly revealed
that which before he did so obscurely <hi>decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher;</hi>
now he hath <hi>unriddled</hi> all those <hi>mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Types, and turned them as it were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
outwards,</hi> and given us their <hi>hidden</hi> Sense
and Meaning in <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>naked</hi> Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and of these our <hi>holy Religion</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.
So that those Doctrines which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were all <hi>Mystery,</hi> whilst they lay ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely
couched under the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi>
of the Law, are now brought forth from
behind the Curtain into the <hi>open</hi> View of
the World, and presented <hi>barefac'd</hi> to our
Understandings in the most <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>easy,</hi>
and <hi>familiar</hi> Sense: Not but that <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
hath some Mysteries in it still, whose
Depths we are not <hi>able</hi> to fathom; but 'tis
not because <hi>Christ</hi> hath not revealed them,
but because our Understandings are <hi>incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
of comprehending them; such are the
Doctrines of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of our <hi>blessed Saviour,</hi> and the <hi>Hypostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Vnion</hi> of the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in him: Nor indeed is it much to be
wonder'd at, that we, who with all our
Wit and Reason, are not able to explicate
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:63657:151"/>
the Mysteries of a <hi>Mite</hi> or <hi>Flea,</hi> of a <hi>Plant</hi>
or a <hi>Stone,</hi> or any of those <hi>innumerable</hi>
things that are before us, should not be able
to understand such <hi>incomprehensible,</hi> to order
such <hi>infinite,</hi> or define such <hi>ineffable</hi> things;
but though we cannot comprehend the
<hi>Modes,</hi> nor understand the <hi>strict Philosophy</hi> of
them, yet if we would but strip them out
of their <hi>false</hi> Disguises into their <hi>original</hi>
Plainness and Simplicity, we might doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
easily disintangle them from all Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
and Contradiction, which is <hi>sufficient</hi>
to render them rationally <hi>credible,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contained in that <hi>excellent Religion,</hi>
whose Truth is demonstrated by such <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi>
Evidence. But perhaps, as <hi>God</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
all the Doctrines of <hi>Christianity</hi> in a
Mystery among the <hi>Iews,</hi> and reserved the
<hi>clear</hi> Revelation of them to the coming of
the <hi>Messias;</hi> so for the same Reason he hath
still reserved the <hi>clear</hi> Discovery of those
Doctrines which are still Mysteries to us
<hi>Christians,</hi> for the <hi>future</hi> State, and then it
may be we may as fully understand <hi>these,</hi>
as the <hi>believing Iews</hi> (after the Coming of
<hi>Christ)</hi> did those <hi>other</hi> Doctrines of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi>
which before were all Mysteries to
them. But, <hi>God</hi> be praised, whatsoever
is <hi>necessary</hi> to make us <hi>good</hi> and <hi>happy,</hi> is now
so plainly discovered to us, that we cannot
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:63657:152"/>
be <hi>ignorant</hi> of it unless we wilfully shut our
own Eyes. We need not dive into <hi>mystical</hi>
Senses, nor <hi>grope</hi> after Truth among <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi>
and <hi>Vmbrages,</hi> as the <hi>good Iews</hi> were
fain to do under the <hi>Mosaick Dispensation,</hi>
all that is <hi>necessary</hi> to our Salvation being
written as it were upon the very <hi>Surface</hi> of
our <hi>Religion,</hi> and openly exposed to our
View in <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>literal</hi> Proposals. And
yet not withstanding the <hi>Plainness</hi> and <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi>
of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> there are
<hi>too</hi> many, both among <hi>our selves,</hi> and in the
<hi>Church of Rome,</hi> who have industriously
set themselves to resolve all its Doctrines
again into Darkness and <hi>unintelligible</hi> Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
having, instead of the <hi>plain</hi> Propositions
of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> introduced a <hi>new-fashioned My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Divinity,</hi> made up of nothing but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>empty</hi> Schemes of <hi>effeminate</hi> Follies and
<hi>wild</hi> Enthusiasms, which are impossible for
any Man to understand that cannot <hi>conjure</hi>
for the Meaning of them. And those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
which our <hi>Saviour</hi> purposely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the most <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>literal</hi> Sense,
that so the <hi>meanest</hi> Understanding might be
instructed by them; these Men have blown
<hi>up</hi> like so many Bubbles into <hi>swelling</hi> Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which, being strip't of those <hi>glittering
Allusions,</hi> and <hi>pompous Metaphors,</hi> wherein they
are clothed, vanish immediately into Air, or
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:63657:152"/>
sink into <hi>flat</hi> and <hi>empty</hi> Nonsense. For thus
the Doctrine of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and
<hi>Iustification,</hi> which lye as <hi>plain</hi> in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
as Words can make them, are by their
Divinity render'd more <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
than ever they were whilst they were
couched under the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of the
Law, more of the <hi>true</hi> Nature being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and the <hi>legal Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
and Attonements, than in a <hi>hundred</hi> Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
of <hi>modern Systems of Divinity.</hi> For,
whatsoever is <hi>intelligible,</hi> they look upon as
<hi>carnal,</hi> and till they have subtilized it into
some <hi>unaccountable</hi> Mystery, it is not <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>
enough to be admitted into their <hi>System
of Divinity,</hi> as if they thought it below the
<hi>Majesty</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> to expose it self to the
View of the World, and there was no
Way to secure it from Contempt, but to
lock it <hi>up</hi> in Mysteries and Obscurities; for
else to what Purpose should they wrap it
round with Clouds as they do, unless they
design to make a Trade of it, and so draw a
Curtain before it, as Men do before their
<hi>Puppet-Plays,</hi> that so they may get Money
by shewing it: For 'tis <hi>apparent</hi> that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
it self suffers extremely by it; for
whilst they thus <hi>spiritualize</hi> it into Air,
and do, as it were, <hi>juggle</hi> it out of Sight
in the Clouds of their <hi>mystical</hi> Nonsense,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:63657:153"/>
they render it extreamly <hi>suspicious</hi> to all
that are <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>inquisitive,</hi> and will not
suffer themselves to be imposed upon by
the Trains of their <hi>mysterious Gibberish.</hi>
And as for their more <hi>credulous</hi> Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
whilst they thus lead them by the
Nose through a Vally of <hi>Shades</hi> and <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
they utterly deprive them of the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous</hi>
Warmth and Comforts of <hi>Religion;</hi>
for how should they know how to make
use of the Arguments and Motives of
<hi>Christianity,</hi> when those <hi>excellent</hi> Doctrines
from whence they are deduced, are
wrap'd in <hi>unintelligible</hi> Mysteries? For
how should they draw forth from the
Articles of their Faith, those <hi>Practical</hi>
Principles that are lodged in them, when
those Articles are converted into Riddles,
which they do not, nor cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand?
Thus, by turning <hi>Christianity</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>Mystery,</hi> they do not only thwart the
Design of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which was to bring
it forth from under the <hi>mysterious</hi> Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the Law, and propose it to the
World in the most <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
but they also <hi>dispirit Religion</hi> it self,
whose Life and Energy consists in being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
and expose it to the Contempt and
Scorn of those that have Wit enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
the Follies of their <hi>Enthusiastical</hi> Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:63657:153"/>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> And lastly, <hi>He dwelt among us full
of Grace and Truth.]</hi> From hence I infer
the Inexcusableness of those Men that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in their Disobedience to the <hi>Gospel now</hi>
that our <hi>blessed Lord</hi> hath expressed so much
Grace towards, and so clearly made known
his Mind and Will to us. What Excuse can
we urge to palliate our <hi>wretched</hi> Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
If you will but imagine your selves
for a <hi>little</hi> while to be standing before the
Tribunal of your <hi>Saviour,</hi> where e're it be
long you must all appear, I will briefly

Purpose then should we attempt Impossibilities,
or set our selves to wrestle with Difficulties
which we knew we were never able to surmount?</hi>

                           <p>But pray, how did you know that it was
<hi>impossible</hi> for you to repent when by all the
Arguments I used with you, I could never
persuade you to make Trial of it? You
know in <hi>your own</hi> Consciences that there
are <hi>many</hi> things that you could do; you
could have betaken your selves to a <hi>serious</hi>
Consideration of the Duties and Motives
of <hi>Religion;</hi> you could have attended, and
abstained at least from the <hi>outward</hi> Acts
of Sin, and humbly implored my Grace
and Assistance; and that to encourage
you to do this, and what else was in your
Power, I gave you the most <hi>ample</hi> Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the World that I would <hi>back</hi> and
<hi>enforce</hi> your Endeavours with the Aids of
my Grace, and in despite of all opposition
crown them with Success. So that though
by your own <hi>single</hi> Strength indeed you
could never have effected your Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
yet it was far from being <hi>impossible</hi>
to you, since you knew that by doing what
was in your power, you should infallibly
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:63657:156"/>
oblige me to enable you to do all the rest.</p>

                              <hi>But, blessed Lord, what Encouragement had we
to repent and return to our Duty? for if we
had done it, we must have bid adieu for ever to
all those Pleasures and Delights by which we were
invited and detained in the Service of our
Lusts; and Thou offered'st us nothing in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for them, but only Sighs and Tears, with
other ungrateful Rigours of a bitter and severe
Repentance. How then canst thou blame our
Disobedience against thee, when we had so many
inviting Temptations to it, and so little En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to the contrary?</hi>

such a <hi>notorious</hi> Falshood when you
know in <hi>your own</hi> Consciences that besides
all those Pleasures that are <hi>connatural</hi> to
my Service, and which do vastly exceed
all the Pleasures of Sin, I laid an <hi>immortal</hi>
Crown at your Feet, and faithfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
you that if you would but spend a
<hi>short</hi> Life in my Service, I would at the
End of it receive you into that <hi>blissful</hi>
State where you should be <hi>happy</hi> beyond
all your Wishes, and to the <hi>utmost</hi> Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of your Nature; where you should
live with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> in the most <hi>rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous</hi>
Exercise of <hi>everlasting</hi> Love and
Joy, which one would have thought had

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:63657:156"/>
                              <hi>silly</hi> Pleasures for whose sake you deserted
me and my Service. But since you have
trampled upon all my Offers, and would
by no means be perswaded by all those
<hi>mighty</hi> Tenders I have made you, Go ye
deservedly cursed into ever—</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>

                              <hi>Hold, Lord,
we beseech thee, and before thou passest thy irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable
Doom upon us, hear this last Petition
we shall make for our selves: We now confess
that we are fully convinc'd (and O that we had
understood it sooner!) what infinite Reason we
had to adhere to thee and thy Service. It is our
Misery that these things were not sooner disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
to us, or at least that they were not so
clearly discovered as to convince and perswade us.
Had we but known what we now know, we would
never have deserted thee as we did; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we beseech thee have Pity upon our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and impute not to our Wills the Faults of
our Vnderstandings, which are not in our Power
to remedy.</hi>
                           </p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <p>Why, is this the <hi>utmost</hi> that
you can plead for <hi>your</hi> selves? Have I not
told you all these things before-hand as
plainly as Words could express them?
Have I not instituted an Order of Men in
my <hi>Church</hi> to explain these things to you,
and to put you in mind of them? So that
whatever you pretend, you could not but
know and understand them; or if you did
not, it was because you would not. And
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:63657:157"/>
if you would wilfully shut your Eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Light, it was <hi>your own</hi> Fault
that you did not see, and you may thank
<hi>your selves</hi> for the Consequents of it. I
plainly told you where your Wickedness
would end, and unless you were wilfully
<hi>blind</hi> you could not but see what the Event
of your Sin would prove, even while you
were committing it; and you know in
<hi>your own</hi> Consciences that this <hi>fearful</hi>
Doom, which now you deprecate, you
were fairly warned of when you might
have easily avoided it by a <hi>timely</hi> Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
but you would not. And seeing you
would be so <hi>mad</hi> as to reject <hi>Heaven</hi> when
it lay before you, and leap into <hi>Hell</hi> with
your Eyes open, your Blood be upon <hi>your
own</hi> Heads. For I have tried all the Arts
of Love, and Methods of Kindness to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
you; and since you have render'd
them all <hi>ineffectual,</hi> what remains but that
you depart from me, like <hi>accursed</hi> Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
as you are, into that <hi>everlasting</hi> Fire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Angels.</hi>
                           </p>

            </p>
            <p>And now, I beseech you, do not <hi>your own</hi>
Consciences consent to the Justice and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of this Procedure? Is there any
<hi>tolerable</hi> Plea you can urge at the Judgment-Seat
of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> which here hath not been
fully answered? And if so, how <hi>inexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:63657:157"/>
shall we be when we come to plead <hi>our
own</hi> Cause in the <hi>great</hi> Assembly of Spirits?
For when these Aggravations of our Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
shall be laid open, our Guilt will
appear so <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>monstrous</hi> that we shall
doubtless be condemned by the <hi>unanimous</hi>
Vote of all the <hi>Reasonable</hi> World; and as
soon as the <hi>great</hi> Judge hath pass'd his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
upon us, <hi>our own</hi> Consciences will be
forc'd to eccho, <hi>Iust and righteous art thou,
O Lord, in all thy Ways.</hi> Wherefore as we
would not be found inexcusably <hi>guilty</hi> when
we come to plead for our Lives before the
Tribunal of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> let us all be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to return to his Service, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to continue in it, that so instead of <hi>Go
ye cursed,</hi> we may hear from his Mouth that
<hi>welcome</hi> Approbation, <hi>Well done good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Servants, enter into the Ioy of your
Master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. I come now to the <hi>last</hi> Proposition in
the Text, <hi>viz. And we beheld his Glory, the
Glory as of the only Son of the Father.</hi> In
handling of which I shall do these two
Things:</p>
            <p>1. Explain to you what this Glory of
the <hi>Word</hi> was which the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us they
beheld.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:63657:158"/>
2. <hi>Shew you that it was</hi> the Glory as of
the only begotten Son of the Father.</p>
            <p>1. What was that Glory of the <hi>Word,</hi>
which the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us they beheld? I
answer in general, By this <hi>Glory</hi> here must
be understood something that is <hi>resemblant,</hi>
to the Glory of his dwelling in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle;
because, as I have already shewed
you, the <hi>Apostle</hi> seems plainly to refer to it,
in that he doth not only tell us that the
<hi>Word</hi> tabernacled among <hi>us,</hi> which alludes
to his Tabernacling among the <hi>Iews;</hi> but
he also tells us, that they saw his Glory,
which alludes to that Glory of the Lord
which the <hi>Iews</hi> beheld in that <hi>ancient</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.
Since therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
this Glory of the <hi>Word Incarnate,</hi> by
way of Allusion to the Glory of his <hi>Divine
Presence</hi> in the Tabernacle, it must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
bear some Resemblance or Proportion
to it; because else it would be no <hi>proper</hi>
Allusion. The best Way therefore for us
to discover what this Glory of <hi>Christ</hi> was
which they beheld, is to consider wherein
the Glory of the <hi>Divine Presence</hi> in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
did chiefly discover it self; and
that, you shall find was in these four
Things: <hi>First,</hi> In a <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>luminous</hi>
Appearance. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In exerting of an
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:63657:158"/>
               <hi>extraordinary</hi> Power. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In giving
Laws and Oracles. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In <hi>sensible</hi> Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications
of its own <hi>immaculate</hi> Sanctity
and Purity. And in Proportion and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
to these, the Glory of the <hi>Word
Incarnate</hi> also must consist in these four
Things:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> In the <hi>visible</hi> Splendor and Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with which his Person was arrayed at
his <hi>Baptism,</hi> and more especially at his <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>2 dly.</hi> In those <hi>great</hi> and <hi>stupendous</hi> Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
that he wrought in the Course of his
Ministry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> In the <hi>incomparable</hi> Purity and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> In the <hi>surpassing</hi> Excellency, and
Divinity of his Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> That Glory of the <hi>Word</hi> which St.
<hi>Iohn</hi> and the <hi>Apostles</hi> beheld, consisted in
that <hi>visible</hi> Splendor and Brightness with
which his Person was arrayed at his <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi>
and more especially at his <hi>Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi>
in Resemblance to that <hi>visible</hi> Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
and Brightness in which he appeared in
the <hi>Mosaick Tabernacle,</hi> where it is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said that the Glory of the Lord abode and
appeared; as you may see <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 16. &amp;
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:63657:159"/>
40. 34. Which Glory it's evident discovered
its self in an <hi>extraordinary visible</hi> Splendor
that shone forth from between the <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims,</hi>
and diffused it self thence all over that
<hi>sacred</hi> Habitation. And accordingly in <hi>Ezek.
43.</hi> 2. it is said, that <hi>the Glory of the God of
Israel came from the Way of the East, and the
Earth shone with his Glory;</hi> which denotes
that it was <hi>extraordinary bright</hi> and <hi>luminous</hi>
since the Earth shone with the very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
of it. And in this same <hi>glorious</hi>
Splendor was <hi>Christ</hi> arrayed <hi>first</hi> at his <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi>
and <hi>afterwards</hi> at his <hi>Transfiguration.</hi>
For at his Baptism it is said, that <hi>the Heavens
were open'd unto him,</hi> and that <hi>he saw the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God descending like a Dove, and lighting
upon him, Matth.</hi> 3. 16. where by the <hi>Holy
Ghost's</hi> descending like a Dove, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
we should understand his descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Shape or Form of a Dove, but
that in some <hi>glorious</hi> Form or Appearance
he descended in the <hi>same</hi> manner as a Dove
descends; and therefore St. <hi>Luke</hi> expresses
it thus, <hi>And the Holy Ghost descended in a
bodily Shape like a Dove upon him, Luke</hi> 3. 22.
that is, he descended in some very <hi>glorious</hi>
and <hi>visible</hi> Appearance, in the same Manner
as Doves are wont to descend when they
come down from the Skies, and pitch upon
the Earth. But what that Shape was in
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:63657:159"/>
which he appeared, is not here expressed;
but that which seems to be most <hi>probable</hi> is
this, that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> assuming a Body of
Light, or surrounded as it were with a
Guard of Angels appearing in <hi>luminous</hi>
Forms, came down from <hi>above</hi> just as a Dove
with his Wings spread forth is observed to
do, and lighted upon our Saviour's Head;
and the Reason why I think so, is this, both
because where-ever any mention is made of
God's, or the Holy Ghost's appearing in an
<hi>indefinite</hi> Form, it is always in a Body of
Light and <hi>visible</hi> Splendor, of which I have
given you sundry Instances; and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it seems to have been a very <hi>early</hi>
Tradition in the <hi>Church</hi> that it was in a
very <hi>glorious</hi> Appearance of Light that the
<hi>Holy Ghost</hi> came down upon our <hi>Saviour:</hi>
And therefore in the <hi>Gospel of the Nazarens,</hi>
as <hi>Grotius</hi> observes, it's said that upon the
Holy Ghost's Descent, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>immediately a great Light shone
round about the Place;</hi> and <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi>
speaking of our Saviour's Baptism, saith
expresly, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that there
was a Fire lighted in the River Iordan;</hi> that
is, the Water, immediately after he was
baptized in it, seemed to be all on fire by
the Reflection of that <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>flaming</hi>
Appearance in which the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:63657:160"/>
upon him; so that while he wore
this Crown of <hi>visible</hi> Light, his Head, as the
Painters are wont to express it, was circled
round with the Rays of that Glory in which
he was wont to appear from between the
Cherubims. And this Glory of his was
questionless seen by many of the <hi>Apostles,</hi>
who were <hi>sundry</hi> of them Disciples to <hi>Iohn
the Baptist,</hi> and so many reasonably be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be present at the Baptism of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for his <hi>Transfiguration</hi> upon Mount
<hi>Tabor,</hi> it is said, that upon it <hi>his Face did
shine as the Sun, and that his Raiment was
white as the Light;</hi> or as St. <hi>Luke</hi> expresses
it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; that is, his
Raiment was like the Whiteness of a Flash
of Lightning, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 29. So that from
Head to Foot he was all inrobed in a <hi>visible</hi>
Glory, and covered with all that Brightness,
and <hi>dazling</hi> Splendor in which he was wont
to appear in the Tabernacle of <hi>Moses.</hi> And
accordingly you have mention made of a
Cloud that over-shadowed the <hi>three Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
whilst <hi>Iesus</hi> remained in his Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which is exactly agreeable with that
Cloud that covered the Tabernacle of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
whilst the Glory of the Lord filled it, as
you may see <hi>Exod.</hi> 40. 34. And that this
<hi>glorious</hi> Transfiguration was a Part of that
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:63657:160"/>
Glory of the <hi>Word</hi> which St. <hi>Iohn</hi> here says
they beheld, is evident, because <hi>himself</hi> was
one of the <hi>three Disciples</hi> that were Eye-Witnesses
of this <hi>glorious</hi> Scene, and it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
said of him and his Brethren, that they
<hi>saw his Glory, and the two Men that stood with
him, Luke</hi> 9. 32.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> This Glory which they saw consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in those <hi>great</hi> and <hi>stupendous</hi> Miracles that
he wrought in the Course of his Ministry, in
Proportion to that <hi>extraordinary</hi> Power in
which the Glory of the <hi>Divine Presence</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
it self in the Tabernacle of <hi>Moses.</hi>
For thus we find that it was from the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
that God exerted all that <hi>miraculous</hi>
Power by which he punished the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and wrought those <hi>miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
Deliverances for them. 'Twas from
the Tabernacle that he commanded the
Earth to open, and swallow up <hi>Corah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and that he sent forth that
<hi>devouring</hi> Fire which consumed their <hi>Two
hundred</hi> and <hi>fifty</hi> Accomplices. 'Twas from
the Tabernacle that he smote the <hi>false</hi> Spies
with the Plague, and sent forth an Army of
<hi>fiery</hi> Serpents to destroy the <hi>murmuring</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites.
'Twas by his Presence in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
that he conducted them through the
Wilderness, and drave their Enemies before
them; that he divided the River <hi>Iordan</hi> to
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:63657:161"/>
open them a Passage into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and made
the Walls of <hi>Iericho</hi> to fall flat at the Blasts
of a few <hi>Rams-horns.</hi> And upon the Account
of this <hi>Miraculous</hi> Power which he exerted
from the Tabernacle, the Ark that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it, and was the <hi>special</hi> Seat of his
Presence, is called <hi>the Ark of his strength,
Ps.</hi> 132. 8. and God is said to <hi>send them help
from his Sanctuary, and to strengthen them out
of Sion,</hi> where the Ark was reposited in the
Sanctuary of the Temple, <hi>Ps.</hi> 20. 2. Thus
also those Words are to be understood, <hi>Ps.
80. 2. Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh,
stir up thy strength, and come and help
us;</hi> because the Ark, from whence God was
wont to put forth his Strength in saving of
<hi>that</hi> People, marched immediately before
these <hi>three</hi> Tribes. And this was very well
understood both by the <hi>Israelites</hi> and the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines;</hi>
for when the <hi>Philistines</hi> had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
them, they desired that the Ark of
the Lord might be fetched out of <hi>Shiloh,</hi> that
so when it came among them it might save
them out of the Hands of their Enemies,
<hi>1 Sam.</hi> 4. 3. And when the <hi>Philistines</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that the Ark was brought into their
Camp, they were sore afraid, and cryed out,
<hi>God is come into the Camp: Wo unto us; who
shall deliver us out of the hands of these mighty
Gods? These are the Gods that smote the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:63657:161"/>
with all the Plagues in the Wilderness, v.
7,</hi> 8. From whence it is evident that they
both look'd upon the Tabernacle as the
Seat of God's <hi>miraculous</hi> Power, and this
<hi>miraculous</hi> Power is called the Glory of God;
for thus when the Ark was taken by the
<hi>Philistines,</hi> it is said that God <hi>delivered his
Strength into Captivity, and his Glory into the
Enemies hand, Ps.</hi> 78. 61. and his Glory, and
the Miracles that he wrought from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
in the Wilderness, are mentioned
as <hi>Synonimous</hi> Terms, <hi>Numb. 14. 22. Because
all these Men have seen my Glory, and my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
which I did in Egypt, and in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
&amp;c. So that it's evident, that he exerted
his <hi>miraculous</hi> Power from the Tabernacle,
and that this <hi>miraculous</hi> Power was his
Glory.</p>
            <p>And consonantly hereunto it was from
the Tabernacle of <hi>Humane</hi> Nature wherein
he dwelt, that the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> exerted
that <hi>miraculous</hi> Power whereby he <hi>cured</hi> the
<hi>Sick, calmed</hi> the Sea, and <hi>raised</hi> the Dead,
<hi>vanquished</hi> the Devils, and wrought all his
<hi>miraculous</hi> Works, which were so <hi>many</hi> and
so <hi>great</hi> that they ravished his Friends with
Joy to behold them, and struck Terror and
Amazement into his Enemies; for so it is
said, that <hi>they were all amazed at the mighty
Power of God</hi> that was in him, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 43.
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:63657:162"/>
And that when they saw how the Devils
trembled, and fled before him, <hi>they marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
saying, <hi>It was never so seen in Israel,
Matth.</hi> 9. 33. So that by their <hi>own</hi> Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that <hi>miraculous</hi> Power which he exerted
in the Tabernacle of <hi>Humane</hi> Nature did far
exceed that <hi>miraculous</hi> Power which he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in the Tabernacle of <hi>Moses.</hi> And this
<hi>miraculous</hi> Power of his is also expresly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>his Glory, Ioh. 2. 11. This beginning of
Miracles did Iesus in Cana of Galilee, and
manifested forth his Glory, and his Disciples
believed on him.</hi> So that as his <hi>miraculous</hi>
Power was called his Glory when he taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacled
among the <hi>Iews,</hi> so it was also when
he tabernacled in <hi>Humane</hi> Nature, and so
by consequence this also was a Part of that
Glory of his which his <hi>Apostles</hi> saw while he
dwelt among them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> This Glory which they saw consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
also in the <hi>surpassing</hi> Excellency and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
of his Doctrine, agreeably to that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of his <hi>glorious</hi> Presence in the <hi>Old</hi>
abernacle, <hi>viz.</hi> his giving Laws and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to the <hi>Israelites.</hi> For thus we find that
God told <hi>Moses,</hi> that he would <hi>meet him in
the Tabernacle, and commune with him of all
things, which he would give him in Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Children of Israel, Exod.</hi> 25. 22.
And, <hi>Numb.</hi> 7. 89. you have the manner
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:63657:162"/>
of his Communing with them described;
for <hi>when Moses,</hi> saith he, <hi>went into the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
he heard the Voice of one speaking unto
him from off the Mercy-Seat that was upon the
Ark, from between the two Cherubims.</hi> For
Christ, as I have formerly shewed you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>civil</hi> Prince or Sovereign of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> the <hi>Cherubims</hi> were the Throne upon
which he sat, and from whence he gave
Laws and Directions for the Administration
of the Affairs of his Kingdom: And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
he is said to <hi>dwell between the Cherubims,
Ps.</hi> 99. 1. and <hi>to ride upon the Cherubims,
2 Sam.</hi> 22. 11. and the Sanctuary wherein the
<hi>Cherubims</hi> were seated, is expresly called <hi>the
Throne of the Lord, Ierem.</hi> 17. 12. because
here it was that he sat in all his Majesty, and
gave forth his Laws and Ordinances to the
Kingdom of <hi>Israel.</hi> And this was an <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>
Expression of the Glory of his Presence
among them, because hereby he asserted his
Sovereign Authority, and did publickly
challenge to himself that Right to his <hi>glorious</hi>
Power which from all <hi>Eternity</hi> was <hi>inherent</hi>
in him. And hence the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls the
giving those Divine Laws and Oracles a <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Ministration,</hi> and plainly asserts it to be
an Instance of the Glory of the <hi>Divine She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinah,</hi>
or Presence in the Tabernacle, when
he grants that <hi>the Ministration of Death writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:63657:163"/>
and engraven in stone, was glorious,</hi> yea
and that Ministration to be Glory in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 9.</p>
            <p>And in Correspondence hereunto did the
<hi>Divine Word,</hi> when he tabernacled in <hi>our</hi>
Natures, give forth <hi>Divine</hi> Laws and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to the World; all which are yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among us, and do contain in them the
Substance of our <hi>Holy Religion;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>godlike,</hi> and altogether
composed of the <hi>purest</hi> Laws, and most <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi>
Doctrines, is a most <hi>proper</hi> Instance of
that Glory of the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> which the
Apostles beheld, tho' not with the Eyes of
their Bodies, yet with those of their Minds.
For what can be more <hi>glorious</hi> in the Eye of
<hi>Reason</hi> than those <hi>illustrious</hi> Discoveries
which he hath made to us in his <hi>Gospel</hi> of the
<hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> and
the <hi>immortal</hi> Recompences of the World to
come, in which he hath so far exceeded
whatsoever <hi>Humane</hi> Wisdom was able to
discover of them, that all the <hi>Philosophy</hi> that
ever was <hi>before</hi> him must confess it self
eclipsed and out-shone by him, and all the
<hi>Philosophy</hi> that ever <hi>succeeded</hi> him, hath been
forced to derive and borrow Light from
him: And accordingly we find his <hi>Gospel,</hi>
in which his Doctrines are contained, stiled
by the Name of <hi>the glorious Gospel, 2 Cor.</hi>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:63657:163"/>
4. 4. which in Comparison with those <hi>dark</hi>
and <hi>confused</hi> Discoveries which the World
had formerly made, the <hi>Apostle</hi> resembles to
the first breaking forth of the Light out of
the <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>obscure Chaos, 2 Cor. 4. 6. For
God,</hi> saith he, <hi>who commanded the Light to
shine out of Darkness, hath shined into our
Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of
the Glory of God, in the Face of Iesus Christ:</hi>
where, by the <hi>Face of-Iesus Christ,</hi> the Apostle
seems plainly to allude to that <hi>Divine</hi> Glory
and Luster with which <hi>Moses</hi>'s Face shone
when he came down from seeing the Glory
of <hi>God, Exod.</hi> 33. 29. So that his Meaning is
this, that as the <hi>Children of Israel</hi> with their
<hi>bodily</hi> Eyes saw the Glory of <hi>God</hi> shining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Face of <hi>Moses,</hi> so <hi>they,</hi> the <hi>Disciples</hi> and
<hi>Apostles</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> had far more clearly
beheld with the Eyes of their Minds the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
Glory displayed in his Doctrine and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> And lastly, This Glory of the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Word</hi> which they saw, consisted also in
the <hi>incomparable</hi> Sanctity and Purity of his
Life, semblably to that Expression of his <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>
Presence in the <hi>Old</hi> Tabernacle, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>sensible</hi> Significations he gave of the <hi>immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>
Purity and Holiness of his Nature. For
by those <hi>outward</hi> Cleansings of all Things
and Persons that did any ways belong to the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:63657:164"/>
Tabernacle, or did at any time approach it,
he did openly represent and signify the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Sanctity of his <hi>own</hi> Nature, which
being infinitely <hi>separated</hi> from all manner of
<hi>Impurity</hi> and <hi>Vncleanness,</hi> cannot endure that
any thing that is <hi>filthy</hi> or <hi>impure</hi> should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
it. For thus we read that the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
it self, and all the <hi>Vtensils</hi> of it, were
to be <hi>purified</hi> and <hi>sanctified</hi> with Oyl before
the Entrance of the <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or <hi>Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:</hi>
So also the <hi>High Priest,</hi> the Priests, and
the People were to be cleansed and purified
before they were suffered to approach the
<hi>Holy Habitation;</hi> and if at any time they had
contracted any of those <hi>legal</hi> Uncleannesses
that are specified in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> they
were to be excluded from the Communion of
the Congregation, and from all the Exercises
of <hi>Publick Worship</hi> and Devotion, till they
were cleansed and purified again: The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of all which was to signify to that People
how <hi>irreconcilable</hi> his Nature was to all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity
and Wickedness, that it could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of the Neighbourhood of any Evil, nor
dwell within any Lines of Communication
with it; for this is expressed in the very
Reason why these <hi>Legal Purifications</hi> are so
strictly required: <hi>For I the Lord your God, am
holy, Levit. 19. 2. For I the Lord which sanctify
you, am holy, Levit.</hi> 21. 8. Plainly intimating
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:63657:164"/>
that the Intent and Reason of all those <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi>
Purifications, was to signify to that
<hi>dull</hi> and <hi>stupid</hi> People the <hi>immaculate</hi> Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Purity of his <hi>own</hi> Nature, which is
so infinitely removed from any thing that is
<hi>impure</hi> and <hi>unholy,</hi> that he could neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with, nor endure the Approaches
of it. And in this 'tis evident he placed a
great Part of the Glory of his <hi>Majestatical
Presence</hi> in the Tabernacle, since a great part
of that <hi>Religion</hi> which he there instituted
was intended to signify the Glory of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
to them; and accordingly he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to be <hi>glorious in Holiness, Exod. 15.
11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And agreeably hereunto did the <hi>Eternal
Word,</hi> when he tabernacled in <hi>our</hi> Natures,
signify to the World the <hi>unspotted</hi> Purity of
<hi>his</hi> Nature by that <hi>incomparable</hi> Example of
Holiness which he gave in his Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
among us. For whereas before he
express'd his Holiness by <hi>Mystical</hi> Types
and <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Observances, he hath now
signified it by a Life <hi>full</hi> of Virtue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and a Conversation exactly <hi>conformable</hi>
to the <hi>eternal</hi> Rules of Righteousness. For,
as a Creature in respect of his <hi>Humanity,</hi> he
never failed in the <hi>least</hi> Punctilio of that <hi>Duty,
Homage,</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> which he owed to the
most <hi>High God</hi> his Creator; as a Man, he
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:63657:165"/>
never swerved either in his Passions or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
from the <hi>strictest</hi> Rules of <hi>Sobriety</hi>
and <hi>Temperance;</hi> as a Member of <hi>Humane
Society,</hi> he never was guilty of an <hi>unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
Action either towards his <hi>Superiors,
Inferiors,</hi> or <hi>Equals;</hi> but all his Life was a
<hi>walking</hi> Monument of Goodness, and his
whole Conversation a most <hi>perfect</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
of those <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Heavenly</hi> Laws
which he gave to the World. So that he
was all <hi>glorious without</hi> as well as <hi>within,</hi>
his Practice being a <hi>living</hi> Comment and
Paraphrase upon that <hi>immaculate</hi> Purity and
Holiness which is the Glory of his <hi>Divine</hi>
Nature. This therefore was doubtless a
Part of that Glory which the Apostles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
in the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi> even that <hi>imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate</hi>
Sanctity and Holiness of which he
gave so many <hi>glorious</hi> Significations in the
whole Course of his Conversation: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
we find this his Purity and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
described by the Name of <hi>the Glory of
the Lord, 2 Cor. 3. 18. But we all with open
face, beholding as in a Glass the Glory of the
Lord, are changed into the same Image, from
Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the
Lord:</hi> Where it's plain that by <hi>the Glory of
the Lord,</hi> must be meant his Holiness; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is into the Image of <hi>that</hi> that we
are transformed. So that the meaning of
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:63657:165"/>
the Words is this, we all beholding the
Holiness of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is his Glory, in the
Glass of his Doctrine and <hi>incomparable</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
are transformed into the Likeness of
it; and do gradually pass on from <hi>one</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of this Glory of his Holiness to <hi>another,</hi>
under the Conduct and Assistance of the
<hi>Spirit of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so I have done with the <hi>first</hi> thing
proposed, which was to shew you what
that Glory of <hi>Christ</hi> was which the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
here tells us they beheld.</p>
            <p>2. I now proceed to the <hi>second</hi> Branch of
my Discourse, which was to shew you that
this was the Glory as of the <hi>only begotten
Son of the Father:</hi> But before we proceed to
the Proof of it, it will be <hi>necessary</hi> to explain
this Phrase, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the Glory as of
the only begotten Son.</hi> Which Word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or
<hi>as,</hi> is in <hi>Scripture</hi> taken <hi>two</hi> Ways, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as a Note of <hi>Similitude</hi> or <hi>Comparison;</hi>
so <hi>Mat. 6. 10, Thy Will be done in Earth,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>as it is in Heaven;</hi> that is, like as
it is in <hi>Heaven;</hi> and if we take it in this
Sense, then the Meaning of the Words must
be this, <hi>And we beheld his Glory which was
like unto the Glory of the only begotten Son of
the Father;</hi> that is, like unto that Glory in
which the only begotten Son was wont to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:63657:166"/>
appear when he dwelt in the Tabernacle,
and conversed with the <hi>ancient Patriarchs.</hi>
And in this Sense I have shewed you already
how it was <hi>as</hi> the Glory of the <hi>only begotten
Son,</hi> by shewing you the <hi>great</hi> Agreement
and Similitude there was between the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Christ</hi> when he dwelt in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of <hi>Moses,</hi> and in the Tabernacle of <hi>our</hi>
Nature. And when I consider how plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this Text doth allude to the <hi>Shechinah</hi> or
<hi>Divine Presence</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> in that <hi>ancient</hi>
Tabernacle, I am very much induced to
think that we ought not to exclude this
Sense of it, namely, that as he dwelt in the
Tabernacle of <hi>our</hi> Nature, <hi>like</hi> as he dwelt
in the Tabernacle of <hi>Moses;</hi> so that Glory of
his which they beheld in the Tabernacle of
<hi>our</hi> Nature, was like unto that Glory in
which he appeared in the <hi>ancient</hi> Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</p>
            <p>But then this Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is sometimes also
taken for a Note of <hi>Confirmation.</hi> So <hi>Psal.
73.</hi> 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Truly God is good to</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.
And thus St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> understands
it here, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
&amp;c. <hi>It is not a Note of Similitude and
Comparison, but of Confirmation and unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
Distinction;</hi> as if the <hi>Evangelist</hi> had
said, we saw his Glory, such as <hi>became</hi> and
was <hi>fit</hi> for the <hi>only begotten</hi> and truly <hi>natural
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:63657:166"/>
Son of God.</hi> For my Part, I see no Reason
why the Words may not be fairly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in <hi>both</hi> Senses, since they are no Ways
<hi>opposite</hi> to, nor <hi>inconsistent</hi> with <hi>one another;</hi>
and if so, then this must be the Meaning of
the Words; <hi>We beheld his Glory which was
like unto that Glory in which the only begotten
Son appeared in the old Tabernacle, and which
was such as was every Way becoming the only
begotten Son to appear in.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> of which
Senses I have proved to you already, that
the Glory of <hi>Christ</hi> in the Tabernacle of <hi>our</hi>
Natures was <hi>like</hi> unto his Glory in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
of <hi>Moses;</hi> and therefore now I shall
only prove the <hi>second,</hi> that it was such as <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came</hi>
and was every Way <hi>worthy</hi> of the <hi>only
begotten Son of the Father;</hi> and this I doubt
not will plainly appear by considering the
<hi>several</hi> Particulars of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> That <hi>visible</hi> Splendor and Brightness
in which he appeared at his <hi>Baptism</hi> and
<hi>Transfiguration,</hi> was such as <hi>became</hi> him,
and was <hi>worthy</hi> of him. For in all Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that Splendor consisted of <hi>Angelical
Beings,</hi> clothed in <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>luminous</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
because, as I have formerly proved
to you, that Brightness in which he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the <hi>Mount,</hi> and which he displayed
from between the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> was nothing
else but those <hi>Angels of Light,</hi> or <hi>ministring
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:63657:167"/>
Spirits</hi> which he made to appear as Flames
of Fire round about him; and therefore
that Train of Angels whom <hi>Esay</hi> saw filling
the Temple, <hi>Esay</hi> 6. 1. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> calls
the <hi>Glory of the Lord,</hi> Jo. 12. 41. that is,
that <hi>visible</hi> Glory in which the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
from between the <hi>Cherubims.</hi> And
if that <hi>visible</hi> Glory consisted in a Train of
<hi>Angels</hi> appearing in <hi>glorious</hi> Forms, then
there is no doubt but that <hi>visible</hi> Glory of
our <hi>Saviour</hi> at his <hi>Baptism</hi> and <hi>Transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
was the same; since, as I have already
shewed you, it is described by the <hi>same</hi>
Name, and in the <hi>same</hi> Manner of Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and if so, how well did it become
the <hi>only begotten Son</hi> to be surrounded with
the <hi>illustrious</hi> Guards of his Father's Court,
and attended on with those <hi>high-born</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
whose Office it is to minister before the
Throne of the most <hi>High?</hi> For never was
the most <hi>glorious</hi> Potentate upon Earth, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with such a <hi>splendid</hi> Train and Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
the <hi>meanest</hi> of which was far more <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious</hi>
than the <hi>greatest</hi> and most <hi>high-born</hi>
Monarch in the World. So that as
the most <hi>High God</hi> did, by a Voice from
<hi>Heaven,</hi> both at his <hi>Baptism</hi> and <hi>Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
declare him to be his <hi>beloved</hi> Son;
so by the <hi>glorious</hi> Train of Attendants he
sent him, he manifested the Truth of his
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:63657:167"/>
Declaration; for we must needs suppose
him to be the Son of the most <hi>High,</hi> when
we see the most <hi>glorious</hi> Beings in all the
Creation, so willingly submit themselves
to his Service and Attendance: And when
we see the most <hi>High</hi> adorning his <hi>Outside</hi>
with the <hi>luminous</hi> Bodies of Angels, we
may reasonably conclude that there was a
<hi>Divinity within,</hi> and that the <hi>Iewel</hi> was
<hi>God,</hi> because the <hi>Casket</hi> was <hi>Angels.</hi> But
whatsoever this <hi>glorious</hi> Splendor was in
which he was clothed at his <hi>Baptism</hi> and
<hi>Transfiguration,</hi> it was apparently such as
very well <hi>became</hi> the <hi>only begotten Son,</hi> not
only because, as the <hi>Philosopher</hi> saith, that
if <hi>God</hi> would ever take upon him a Body,
it would be certainly Light, which is a
Vestment most <hi>suitable</hi> to his Glory and
Majesty; but also because that <hi>miraculous</hi>
Splendor was an <hi>infallible</hi> Token of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the <hi>Divinity</hi> in him; for it never
was but where God was present; and
therefore it is called the Glory of God, it
being the <hi>inseparable</hi> Concomitant of his
more <hi>peculiar</hi> Residence. For thus, as I
have shewed you upon the <hi>Mount</hi> and in the
<hi>Tabernacle,</hi> it was a <hi>visible</hi> Demonstration
of the <hi>special</hi> Presence of the <hi>invisible</hi> God,
and wheresoever in all the <hi>Old Testament,</hi>
any Mention is made of its Appearance,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:63657:168"/>
you shall find that there <hi>God</hi> himself did pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
reside: And therefore it is not to
be imagined that <hi>God</hi> would have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> this <hi>inseparable</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of his <hi>own</hi> Presence, unless the <hi>Divinity</hi>
had resided in him. For <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> was
the only Person upon whom this <hi>visible</hi>
Glory descended; never did the Hand of
<hi>Heaven</hi> put such a Robe and Diadem of
Glory upon any Person in the World, as
this which our Saviour wore at his <hi>Baptism</hi>
and <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> which plainly denotes
that he was the only Person in whom the
<hi>Divinity</hi> was <hi>substantially</hi> united, and did
<hi>essentially</hi> dwell. So that as this <hi>visible</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was a <hi>certain</hi> Token of God's <hi>peculiar</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence
in the Tabernacle and Temple, so it
was also of his <hi>special</hi> Presence in <hi>Christ;</hi>
for the History of his <hi>Baptism</hi> tells us, that
it did not only make a <hi>transient</hi> Appearance,
but that it remained on him, signifying
that the <hi>Divinity,</hi> whose Presence was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted
by it, had made him his Habitation
and Place of <hi>constant</hi> Abode. For though
that <hi>visible</hi> Glory after some Time disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
and went <hi>off</hi> from him, yet the
Thing signified by it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi>
always remained in him; for by that
<hi>outward</hi> Glory he was clearly manifested to
be the <hi>Holy One of God,</hi> the Tabernacle and
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:63657:168"/>
Sanctuary in which God was, and where he
had taken up his Residence <hi>for ever,</hi> that his
<hi>Humane</hi> Nature was that <hi>sacred</hi> Temple
where the <hi>Divinity</hi> intended to dwell, and
from whence for the <hi>future</hi> he would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
all his Oracles, and communicate all his
Blessings to Mankind. So that in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
this <hi>visible</hi> Glory was such as highly
<hi>became</hi> the <hi>only begotten Son,</hi> because it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denoted that the Fulness of the <hi>God-head</hi>
dwelt <hi>bodily</hi> in him, and had chosen him for
his Habitation for ever; and therefore <hi>Iohn
Baptist</hi> tells us, that though he knew him
not, yet this <hi>God</hi> had revealed to him, <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending
and remaining on him, the same is he which
baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. And I saw
and bear Record that this was the Son of God,</hi>
Joh. 1. 33, 34. where you may observe,
that though it was revealed to him only
that he was the Person that should baptize
with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> upon whom the Spirit
descended, yet he bare Record also that this
Person was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
that this <hi>visible</hi> Glory, which was
such an <hi>infallible</hi> Token of the <hi>special</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the <hi>Divinity,</hi> was never to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to any but the <hi>Son of God.</hi> And
it is very observable, that at both these
Times, when our <hi>Saviour</hi> was array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:63657:169"/>
in this <hi>glorious</hi> Splendor, he is declared
by a Voice from <hi>Heaven</hi> to be the Son of
God, it being the <hi>Father's</hi> Intention at once to
manifest him to be his <hi>Son</hi> both by <hi>Word</hi> and
<hi>Deed;</hi> and at the same time, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
him to be his Son, to array him in such
a Glory as <hi>became</hi> the Dignity of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> The <hi>great</hi> and <hi>stupendous</hi> Miracles
that he wrought were such as <hi>became</hi> his <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begotten Son.</hi> 'Tis true, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
but several Miracles have been wrought
by <hi>meer</hi> Men, they being authorized by <hi>God,</hi>
and assisted by his <hi>Almighty</hi> Power; but so
<hi>many</hi> and so <hi>great</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> wrought
were never performed by any Mortal. For
as to the Number of them, they were more
than ever were wrought by <hi>Moses</hi> and all
the <hi>Prophets</hi> together; for, besides those
that are recorded, which were all perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
within the Space of <hi>four</hi> Years at most,
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, that he wrought so many
that the World could not contain the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. 25. which though it
be an <hi>Hyperbolical</hi> Expression, yet denotes
thus much at least, that the Number of them
was so <hi>great</hi> that they were almost <hi>innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi>
And as to the Greatness of them, they
did apparently exceed all that ever were
wrought before in the World. For he did
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:63657:169"/>
not only raise the Dead, but he raised <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
also after he had been <hi>barbarously</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by his Enemies. He made the <hi>Winds</hi>
and <hi>Sea</hi> obey him, and with the Word of
his Mouth vanquished the <hi>Devils,</hi> and drave
them from their Habitations, and forc'd
them against their Wills, and their Interest
to acknowledge him to be the Son of God.
And whereas the Miracles of <hi>Moses</hi> and the
<hi>Prophets</hi> were most of them <hi>noxious,</hi> they
being Acts of <hi>Divine</hi> Vengeance upon the
<hi>Wicked</hi> and <hi>Vngodly,</hi> and consequently more
apt to terrify than to oblige those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
them; the Miracles of our <hi>Saviour</hi>
were all of them Expressions of his <hi>unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
Love and Good-Will to the World. For
among all that <hi>vast</hi> Number of <hi>wondrous</hi>
Works that he wrought, there is not <hi>one</hi> to be
found by which any Man was ever prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
unless it was his dismissing the Devils
into the Swine of the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all doubt he did in Kindness and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will
to the Owners; who being so <hi>cruel</hi> to
themselves as to prefer their Swine before
their <hi>Saviour,</hi> it was <hi>great</hi> Charity and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to deprive them of that which was so <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent</hi>
a Hindrance to their Enjoyment of
a far <hi>greater</hi> Good. So that all his <hi>wondrous</hi>
Works were nothing but Acts of Kindness
and Beneficence; for he went about
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:63657:170"/>
doing Good, <hi>curing</hi> all that were <hi>possessed</hi>
with the Devil, and <hi>healing</hi> all manner of
Diseases. And whereas none of those that
wrought Miracles before him could ever
pretend to perform them by any <hi>immanent</hi>
Power of their own, but had only a <hi>transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi>
Power given them for the <hi>present</hi> Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
which they either obtained from <hi>God</hi>
upon their Prayers and Supplications, or
was given by <hi>God</hi> for the Execution of his
<hi>own</hi> Will and Command; the <hi>blessed Iesus</hi>
had this Power subjected and abiding in
him, so that he could exert it <hi>when,</hi> and
<hi>where,</hi> and as <hi>often</hi> as he pleased; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were <hi>absent</hi> or <hi>present,</hi> with the Word
of his Mouth he could do what he would;
yea, and many times he performed his <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous</hi>
Works without any Word or Sign
intervening, even by a <hi>silent</hi> Virtue proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from that <hi>miraculous</hi> Power with which
he was endued; and of all his Miracles
there is only <hi>one</hi> which he performed upon
Prayer and Supplication to his Father, and
that was his raising <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Dead,
the Reason of which he himself gives, <hi>Ioh.
11. 42. Because of the People which stand by,
that they may believe that thou hast sent me:</hi>
Intimating that he did not offer up this
Prayer to his Father with design to obtain
of him any <hi>new</hi> Power of working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:63657:170"/>
which he was already endued with in
an <hi>abundant</hi> measure; but that hereby I
might signify to the People how <hi>acceptable</hi>
I am to thee, and let them see that I do all
my Works in thy Name. And that he had
this Power, is evident in that he did so plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
communicate it to his <hi>Apostles</hi> and
Followers, which neither <hi>Moses</hi> nor the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
were ever able to do. For thus, <hi>Luke
10.</hi> 19. he expresly tells his <hi>Seventy</hi> Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>Behold, I give you power to tread on Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
and Scorpions;</hi> and so also when he
dismissed his <hi>Twelve</hi> Apostles into <hi>Iudea,
Matth.</hi> 10. 8. he bids them, <hi>Go, heal the
Sick, cleanse the Lepers, raise the Dead, cast
out Devils;</hi> for <hi>freely ye have received,</hi> saith
he, and therefore <hi>freely give.</hi> From all
which it is apparent how far the <hi>miraculous</hi>
Works of our <hi>Saviour</hi> did exceed all those
that ever were done before him; and being
so <hi>great</hi> and <hi>excellent,</hi> so far <hi>transcending</hi> all
that ever was done by any Mortal, they
plainly demonstrated him to be the <hi>Son of
God,</hi> and very well became the Dignity of
his Person. For how could he have done all
these <hi>mighty</hi> Things by a Power <hi>immanent</hi>
in himself, had he not been the <hi>Son</hi> of an
<hi>Omnipotent Father?</hi> And in what more <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming</hi>
Way could he have expressed that
<hi>Omnipotent</hi> Power which he derived from
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:63657:171"/>
his Father, than in those <hi>astonishing</hi> Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Love which he wrought in the
World?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> The <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> Doctrine
which he taught was such as <hi>became</hi> the <hi>only
begotten Son.</hi> For certainly if we consider
the <hi>excellent</hi> Frame and Contrivance of the
<hi>Christian Religion,</hi> we cannot but confess it
to be most <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Godlike,</hi> most <hi>worthy</hi>
of that <hi>infinite</hi> Wisdom and Goodness from
whence it was derived. For <hi>Religion</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
is the means of advancing <hi>Rational
Beings</hi> to that Perfection and Happiness for
which the <hi>great</hi> Creator hath designed and
intended them; and certainly never was
there any <hi>Religion</hi> in the World more adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to advance this <hi>noble</hi> Design of <hi>God</hi> than
that which our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath taught: For as
for its <hi>Agenda,</hi> what it requires to be done,
they all consist in acting reasonably, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Dignity of our Nature, in
<hi>thinking, speaking,</hi> and <hi>practising;</hi> in <hi>loving</hi>
and <hi>hating, desiring</hi> and <hi>delighting, hoping</hi>
and <hi>fearing,</hi> as becomes <hi>Reasonable Beings</hi>
placed in our Condition and Circumstances;
and do require nothing of us but that we
should regulate our Practice by the Rules of
<hi>Right</hi> Reason, and direct all our Faculties
and Affections to their <hi>proper</hi> Ends and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
and when we come to this Pitch, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:63657:171"/>
to <hi>think</hi> that which is most <hi>reasonable,</hi>
and always to <hi>practise</hi> what we think so, then
we are advanced to the <hi>topmost</hi> Round of our
Prefection, in which is founded the <hi>utmost</hi>
Happiness we are capable of: So that in all
the Course of our <hi>Christian</hi> Practice we are
in a <hi>direct</hi> Progression and Tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our Perfection and Happiness. And as
for the <hi>Credenda</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> the Doctrines
it requires us to believe, they are all of them
pregnant with the most <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>vehement</hi>
Motives to engage us to the Practice of
what it enjoins; Motives that have such a
<hi>Potent,</hi> I had almost said <hi>Omnipotent</hi> Force
in them, that 'tis <hi>impossible</hi> for any Man
heartily to believe, and throughly to weigh
and consider them, and not be effectually
perswaded by them! Since therefore it was
so highly convenient that the <hi>Son of God</hi>
in Person should come down from <hi>Heaven</hi>
among us, that so the Dignity of his Person
might give Authority to that <hi>Religion</hi> by
which the World was to be governed; and
since he did come down upon this <hi>honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Errand, it was impossible for him to
have taught any Doctrine that could more
effectually have promoted the <hi>great</hi> End of
<hi>Religion,</hi> or more fully expressed his <hi>infinite</hi>
Wisdom, and Goodness, and Zeal for the
Welfare of the Souls of Men, than that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:63657:172"/>
which is contained in the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi>
which is every way so adapted to make
Men <hi>good</hi> and <hi>happy,</hi> so accommodated to
the Nature and Condition of Mankind, that
there is nothing could better <hi>become</hi> the <hi>only
begotten Son</hi> to teach in the World, or that
could be more <hi>worthy</hi> of all those <hi>infinite</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
that are lodged in his Nature, and
do speak him to be the most <hi>genuine</hi> Off-spring
of the most <hi>High.</hi> For so <hi>excellent</hi>
was his Doctrine, that his very Enemies
were astonished at the <hi>Wisdom</hi> that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 2, 3. and wondered at the
<hi>gracious</hi> Words that proceeded out of his
Mouth, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 22. Well therefore might
he say of himself, <hi>I am the Light of the
World, he that followeth me shall not walk in
Darkness, but shall have the Light of Life,
Ioh.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> And lastly, The <hi>incomparable</hi> San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
and Purity of his Life was such as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>well became</hi> the <hi>only begotten Son.</hi> For as it
was highly <hi>convenient</hi> that he should come
down into the World, and in his <hi>own</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
teach us that <hi>Religion</hi> by which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to govern us, that thereby he might
stamp it with a more <hi>awful</hi> Authority; so
to render it more successful, it was no less
<hi>convenient</hi> that he should come down in <hi>our</hi>
Natures, that therein he might be capable
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:63657:172"/>
of practising what he taught us, and setting
us an Example of what he would have us to
do, that so we might see that he enjoined
nothing upon us but what was <hi>practicable,</hi>
and what did become the most <hi>glorious</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that ever did assume our Natures; that
thereby we might be encouraged to our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and animated with a <hi>noble</hi> Emulation of
treading in his blessed Footsteps. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all this was so highly <hi>convenient,</hi> and
the <hi>Son of God</hi> in Compliance with this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
did actually assume <hi>our</hi> Nature, it
was impossible for him to lead a Life that
<hi>better</hi> comported with this Design of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,</hi>
or <hi>better</hi> became the Dignity and
Excellency of his Person than he did. For
now that he was become a Man, he was
obliged to act <hi>suitably</hi> to his Nature; and
should he have done any thing that was <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable</hi>
to the State and Circumstances of
his Nature, he would not have acted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
himself. So that it was highly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient</hi>
that he should become a Man, and
being a Man it was indispensably <hi>necessary</hi>
that he should live like a <hi>wise</hi> and a <hi>good</hi> Man
in the Condition and Relations wherein he
was placed, and nothing could be more
<hi>worthy</hi> of or <hi>becoming</hi> him, than so to do,
though he was still the <hi>only begotten Son</hi> of
the Father. For it is the Glory of <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:63657:173"/>
that he always acts most reasonably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the State and Relations of a <hi>God;</hi>
and therefore when <hi>God</hi> becomes Man by
assuming <hi>our</hi> Nature to his <hi>own,</hi> it is his
Glory to act most reasonably in the State
and Relations of a Man. And thus did the
<hi>blessed Iesus</hi> do in the whole Course of his
Conversation upon Earth; for his Life was
a most <hi>exact</hi> Pattern of all <hi>humane</hi> Virtues,
in which all that is <hi>ornamental</hi> to <hi>humane</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was represented in its <hi>fairest</hi> Colours:
There you may see a <hi>fair</hi> Example of the
most <hi>ardent</hi> Love to, and <hi>constant</hi> Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon <hi>God,</hi> of the most <hi>profound</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
and <hi>perfect</hi> Resignation to his <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi>
Will. There you may behold the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of <hi>Humane</hi> Passions and Appetites
set forth to the Life, and fairly delineated in
all its most <hi>exquisite</hi> Perfections; in a word,
there you will find <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Submission</hi> to
<hi>Superiors, Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> to <hi>Equals,
Courtesy,</hi> and <hi>Candor,</hi> and <hi>Condescention</hi> to
<hi>Inferiors, universal</hi> Love, and an <hi>unbounded</hi>
Charity to all practised to the Height and
Exactness; and which way soever you turn
your Eyes on this <hi>fair</hi> Monument of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
you can discover nothing but what is
<hi>lovely</hi> and <hi>adorable,</hi> and infinitely becoming
the <hi>only begotten Son of the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:63657:173"/>
Having thus explained and demonstrated
the Proposition to you, I shall conclude with
these four Inferences from this <hi>four-fold</hi>
Glory of the <hi>Word</hi> which they saw.</p>
            <p>1. They saw the <hi>glorious</hi> Splendor which
invested his Person at his <hi>Baptism</hi> and <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration:</hi>
From whence I infer his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
from the most <hi>High God,</hi> and Father
of all Things, to be his Representative and
Vice-Roy in the <hi>Christian Church.</hi> For this
<hi>visible</hi> Glory with which he was invested,
was always the <hi>peculiar</hi> Character of the
<hi>immediate</hi> Representative of <hi>God;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by way of Appropriation it is called
<hi>the Glory of God,</hi> and <hi>the Glory of the Lord;</hi>
and wheresoever <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Supream</hi> Monarch
and Governor, is represented as residing and
taking up his <hi>Royal</hi> Habitation, there you
always find him displaying himself in this
<hi>visible</hi> Glory and Splendor. Thus when by
the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> he was represented among
the <hi>Iews</hi> as their <hi>supreme</hi> Lord and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
he always manifested his <hi>Majestick</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
among them by some <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Appearance; the first Instance of which
was his Appearance to <hi>Moses</hi> from out of the
<hi>burning Bush</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where he
first acted under <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> as <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi>
King of <hi>Israel</hi> in commissioning <hi>Moses</hi>
to be their Captain and Leader out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:63657:174"/>
for here it is said, that he <hi>appeared in a
flame of fire, Exod.</hi> 3. 2. that is, in a <hi>visible</hi>
Glory that resembled the Brightness of a
Flame of Fire. For this Mountain he had
chosen for the Seat and Throne of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestical</hi>
Residence, from whence he intended
to give Laws to <hi>Israel,</hi> and to exert his
<hi>Royal</hi> Dominion over them; and therefore
here he appears in that <hi>visible</hi> Glory which
was always the Character of the <hi>divine</hi>
King, and <hi>immediate</hi> Representative of <hi>God</hi>
to that People. And indeed if that be true
which <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us, this Mountain was
looked upon as the Habitation of <hi>God</hi> long
before ever <hi>Moses</hi> came thither; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
says <hi>Iosephus,</hi> did <hi>Moses</hi> drive his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Iethro</hi>'s Flock thither to feed, because
of all other Places it most abounded with
Pasture,<note place="margin">Jos. Antiq. l. 2. p. 60.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
that is, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was famed that God dwelt there, which
was the Reason that the Shepherds never durst
to drive their Flocks thither, because of the
Sacredness of the Place.</hi> And if this Report
were true, then it seems this Mountain was
the Seat of the <hi>Royal</hi> Residence of the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Word</hi> before ever <hi>Moses</hi> came thither,
and consequently the Glory and Brightness
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:63657:174"/>
in which <hi>Moses</hi> saw him appear, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Display of his <hi>Majestick</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
which did there make its <hi>ordinary</hi>
Abode. But whether that be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false,</hi>
it's most <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>apparent</hi> that whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he appeared as the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> or
Representative of <hi>God</hi> to them, he always
clothed himself in a <hi>visible</hi> Glory and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.
Thus he appeared to them in a Pillar
of Fire, that is, in a most <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi>
Form, when he conducted them thro'
the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and the Wilderness; and when
he came down upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> to give
the Law to them, it's said that the Glory in
which they beheld him was <hi>like devouring
fire, Exod.</hi> 24. 17. that is, it was unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<hi>bright</hi> and <hi>refulgent,</hi> even like that of a
most <hi>intense</hi> and <hi>vehement</hi> Fire; and in all
this <hi>radiant</hi> Glory did he display himself
from between the Cherubims when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the Mountain, and chose the
Tabernacle for the Seat of his <hi>future</hi> Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and <hi>Royal</hi> Abode. Thus whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he appeared in his <hi>Kingly</hi> Majesty as
the <hi>publick</hi> Representative of his Father, this
<hi>visible</hi> Glory is always made mention of, as
that which was the <hi>peculiar</hi> Character of his
Presence and Person. 'Tis true, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
of <hi>Moses</hi> that when he came down
from the Vision upon the Mount, his Face
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:63657:175"/>
shone so brightly that the <hi>Israelites</hi> were not
able to approach him; which seems to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
that this <hi>visible</hi> Glory was not so <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi>
to the <hi>Eternal Words</hi> as his Father's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative,
as we would have it, since we
plainly see it was <hi>common</hi> to <hi>Moses</hi> with
him. But this doth no ways destroy our
Assertion; because it's plain that <hi>that</hi> Glory
which covered the Face of <hi>Moses,</hi> was all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the Glory of the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi>
with whom for <hi>forty</hi> Days he had conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Mount. For <hi>Moses</hi> being sent
down as an Apostle to the <hi>Iews</hi> to promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
those Laws to them which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
upon the Mount, the <hi>Eternal Word,</hi>
to convince the <hi>unbelieving Iews</hi> that he had
sent him, reflects upon his Face some Rays
of Glory from that Sphere of Light in which
he appeared to and conversed with him,
that <hi>that</hi> might be an <hi>ocular</hi> Demonstration
to them that <hi>Moses</hi> came from him, and was
commissioned by him to preach and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgate
his Laws to them. So that <hi>Moses</hi>
his Glory being derived from the <hi>Word,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
him to be his Apostle and Minister;
even as the Glory of the <hi>Word</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the Father, declared him to be
his Representative and Vice-Roy; so that
from its shining upon the Face of <hi>Moses,</hi> it by
no means follows that this <hi>visible</hi> Glory is
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:63657:175"/>
not the <hi>peculiar</hi> Character of God's <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi>
Representative; because that which
shone upon his Face was only the <hi>Parhelius</hi>
or Reflection of the <hi>visible</hi> Glory of him
who was God's <hi>immediate</hi> Representative.
For so the Earth also is said to <hi>shine with the
Glory of the God of Israel, Ezek.</hi> 43. 2. and as
the Glory with which it shone was not the
Glory of the Earth, but the Glory of the
<hi>God of Israel;</hi> so neither was that Glory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Face of <hi>Moses</hi> the Glory of <hi>Moses,</hi> but
the Glory of that <hi>divine</hi> Person, with whom
he had conversed, derived to, and reflected
upon him; and it being still the <hi>proper</hi> Glory
of that <hi>divine</hi> Person, may very well be said
to be the <hi>peculiar</hi> Character of his being the
<hi>immediate</hi> Representative of <hi>God,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it reflected from him upon <hi>Moses;</hi>
especially considering that this <hi>reflected</hi> Glory
upon <hi>Moses</hi> his Face was to be an Evidence
to the <hi>Iews</hi> that he came down to them as an
Apostle from the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to publish, and declare his Laws to
them. For if this <hi>derivative</hi> Splendor was
an Evidence that <hi>Moses</hi> came down as an
Apostle from that <hi>divine</hi> Person on the
Mount, then the <hi>original</hi> Splendor of that
<hi>divine</hi> Person whence it was derived and
reflected, was at least an <hi>equal</hi> Evidence that
he came down upon the Mount as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:63657:176"/>
and <hi>immediate</hi> Representative of the
most <hi>High God</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>And in the same manner we find that
the <hi>Word Incarnate</hi> did give Evidence to the
Commission of his <hi>Christian Apostles;</hi> for
upon the <hi>Day of Pentecost,</hi> when they were
assembled together, it is said that <hi>there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
unto them cloven Tongues like as of
fire, and sat upon every one of them, Acts</hi> 2. 3.
that is, there were several Flashes, or Beams
of Glory which like <hi>bright</hi> Flames of Fire,
did cleave asunder in many Places according
to the <hi>natural</hi> Motion of Flames, of which
every Part as it extends it self in Length
grows more <hi>Spire-like</hi> or <hi>Pyremidal,</hi> and so
divides from the Part next to it; and upon
the Head of every one of the Apostles, did
one of these <hi>divided</hi> Flames of Glory rest in
the Form of a Tongue, which like a Flame
grows <hi>sharper</hi> and <hi>sharper</hi> towards the Top:
For thus the <hi>Hebrew Idiom</hi> for a Flame of
Fire uses the <hi>Tongue</hi> of Fire, because of the
Resemblance that is between them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 24.
So that as the <hi>Eternal Word</hi> did evidence to
the <hi>Iews</hi> the Apostleship of <hi>Moses</hi> by that
<hi>visible</hi> Glory which he reflected on his Face,
so did the <hi>Word Incarnate</hi> evidence to the
<hi>Christian Church</hi> the Apostleship of the
<hi>Twelve</hi> by this <hi>visible</hi> Glory which he deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon them. For now, according to
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:63657:176"/>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist's</hi> Prediction of him, he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
them <hi>with the Holy Ghost, and with Fire,
Luke</hi> 3. 16. that is, by the <hi>outward</hi> Sign of
that <hi>visible</hi> Glory which rested like Fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, he solemnly initiated them into
their <hi>Apostleship,</hi> and declared them to be
the <hi>Heralds</hi> of his Will to the World. And
as this <hi>visible</hi> Glory with which he bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
them, was an Evidence of their being
sent <hi>from,</hi> and commissionated by <hi>him</hi> to
bear his Authority, and represent his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
so that <hi>visible</hi> Glory with which he
was baptized from <hi>Heaven,</hi> first in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Iordan,</hi> and afterwards upon Mount
<hi>Tabor,</hi> was an <hi>undoubted</hi> Evidence that he
was sent from <hi>above</hi> to be his Father's Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
in the <hi>Church:</hi> For if their shining
with his Glory was an Evidence of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
invested with his Authority, then his
shining with his Father's Glory must be an
<hi>equal</hi> Evidence of his being invested with
the Authority of his Father. And as this
<hi>visible</hi> Glory was always the <hi>peculiar</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of God's <hi>immediate</hi> Representative,
and the <hi>Royal</hi> Crown and Robes as it were
with which the most <hi>High</hi> adorned him at
his <hi>Inaguration,</hi> and Investment with his
<hi>own Kingly</hi> Authority; so St. <hi>Peter</hi> expresly
tells <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Company, that <hi>God
had anointed him with the Holy Ghost, and with
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:63657:177"/>
Power, Acts</hi> 10. 13. that is, by that <hi>outward</hi>
Sign of the <hi>visible</hi> Glory in which the <hi>Holy
Ghost</hi> descended upon him, he had invested
him with <hi>Regal</hi> Power, and deputed and
declared him to be King of the <hi>Church.</hi>
And this in all probability was the Reason
why he forbad his Disciples to declare his
Transfiguration till after <hi>his Resurrection
from the Dead, Mark</hi> 9. 9. because he knew
that if they did, the <hi>Iews</hi> would not believe
it, but would maliciously interpret it to be a
<hi>false</hi> Pretence of his to the Title of God's <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi>
Representative and Vice-Roy, that
<hi>visible</hi> Glory in which he appeared being the
<hi>proper</hi> Character of that <hi>divine</hi> King by
whom the most <hi>High God</hi> had formerly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
them; and therefore in all the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Life you find he did industriously
avoid openly to avow his <hi>Regal</hi> Authority,
and only insinuates it by Consequences and
<hi>obscure</hi> Intimations. For so violently were
they prejudiced against his being their <hi>King</hi>
upon the account of his <hi>obscure</hi> Parentage, and
<hi>mean</hi> Condition, that he could not but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
how <hi>unseasonable</hi> it would yet be publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to own his <hi>Regal</hi> Authority, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Glory of his Transfiguration
which did so apparently infer it; till by more
<hi>miraculous</hi> Effects, and particularly by his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
from the Dead,</hi> he had sufficiently
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:63657:177"/>
proved and demonstrated it; and then he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
declares without any Reserve, that <hi>all
Power was given him in Heaven and Earth,
Matth.</hi> 28. 18. Since therefore it is so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
by this <hi>Characteristical</hi> Glory, in which
his Person was inrobed, and which the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
assures us they saw him invested with,
we have all the Reason in the World to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the most <hi>High God</hi> hath deputed
him to be King and Lord of the <hi>Church.</hi> For
when the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us that they saw this
<hi>visible</hi> Glory which shone upon him at his
<hi>Baptism</hi> and <hi>Transfiguration,</hi> he doth as good
as say that they saw all the Solemnity of his
<hi>divine</hi> Coronation, that they beheld the most
<hi>High God</hi> circling his Brows with the <hi>Royal</hi>
Diadem, and investing his <hi>sacred</hi> Body with
the <hi>Imperial</hi> Robes of the <hi>great</hi> King of the
World. So that if it be true what St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
says, that they did see this Glory, (as we
have all the Reason in the World to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it is, because he offered to seal his
Testimony of it with his Blood, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>two</hi> that saw it with him actually did
so) then we cannot but acknowledge the
<hi>blessed Iesus</hi> to be <hi>our</hi> King, to whose <hi>divine</hi>
Authority we are bound to pay the <hi>lowest</hi>
Homage and Obedience; and that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
we wilfully transgress his Laws, we
do openly rebel against our most <hi>rightful</hi>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:63657:178"/>
Sovereign, to whose Service we are bound
by all <hi>possible</hi> Ties and Obligations.</p>
            <p>2. They saw the Glory of that <hi>miraculous</hi>
Power which he exerted in the Course of
his Ministry; from whence I infer the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility
of the <hi>Christian Religion:</hi> Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the
many <hi>stupendous</hi> Miracles that he wrought,
were a most <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>unquestionable</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a <hi>Divine</hi> Power residing in him,
and accompanying his Ministry. For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were there so many <hi>miraculous</hi> Effects
produced, either <hi>before</hi> or <hi>since,</hi> in the
World, by the most <hi>renowned</hi> Workers of
Miracles that ever were; and all that hath
been done by the most <hi>famous</hi> Magicians,
that are recorded in History, were but like
the <hi>little</hi> Tricks and Delusions of <hi>Iugglers,</hi>
compared with the <hi>wondrous</hi> Works of our
<hi>Saviour;</hi> and yet 'tis apparent that his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
had been most <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>simple,</hi> that
he never had been instructed in any <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi>
Science, or <hi>mystical</hi> Rites, or in any
<hi>other</hi> Art of performing Wonders, either
by <hi>Humane</hi> Wit or <hi>Diabolical</hi> Assistance;
but was bred up under the Care of his <hi>poor
honest</hi> Parents, who were forced to earn
their Bread with the Sweat of their Brows,
and so in all Probability was trained up in
his Father's Profession, that so by his <hi>daily</hi>
Labour he might be able to contribute to
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:63657:178"/>
the Charge of his Maintenance. And yet
'tis plain, this <hi>home-bred</hi> Person sometimes,
only by speaking of a Word, sometimes
meerly by the Touch of his Hand, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by a <hi>silent</hi> Virtue proceeding from
him without any <hi>outward</hi> Sign intervening,
did <hi>more</hi> and far <hi>greater</hi> Wonders in <hi>three</hi> or
<hi>four</hi> Years Time, than all the most <hi>skilful
Physicians, Magicians,</hi> and <hi>Mathematicians</hi>
could ever do either <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> him.
Now how was it possible that ever such a
Person should ever have accomplished such
<hi>great</hi> and <hi>mighty</hi> Things as he did, had he
not been endued with Power from above?
And if he was endued with such a Power,
what <hi>greater</hi> Evidence can we desire of the
Truth and Divinity of his Doctrine? For it
is not <hi>supposable</hi> that the <hi>God</hi> of Truth
would have endued our <hi>Saviour</hi> with this
<hi>miraculous</hi> Power, had that Doctrine been
<hi>false</hi> which he sought to confirm by it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in so doing he would have openly <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized</hi>
a Cheat, and designedly contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Propagation of an Imposture
which is utterly <hi>inconsistent</hi> with his Truth
and Veracity: So that now the Truth of
<hi>Christianity</hi> finally resolves into the Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>God,</hi> which is the Foundation of all
the Certainty in the World. For admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that <hi>God</hi> can either <hi>deceive</hi> or be <hi>deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:63657:179"/>
we do not know but our Faculties may
be constantly imposed upon, and then there
is nothing in Nature that we can be certain
of: So that if it be true, as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> here
testifies, that they did see the Glory of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Miracles, that is a most <hi>undeniable</hi>
Evidence of the Truth and Divinity of his
Doctrine; and that they did see it, I think
is as evident: For it is not imaginable that
any <hi>single</hi> Man would openly testifie a
<hi>known</hi> Lye without some Temptation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
him thereunto; much less that so
many <hi>Hundreds</hi> of Persons as the <hi>Eye-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi>
of our Saviour's Miracles were, should
conspire to cheat the World, not only when
they had <hi>no</hi> Temptation to it, but when
they had <hi>all</hi> the Reason in the World against
it; for they saw their Master suffer a <hi>shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Death before their Eyes, by which they
might easily divine what their <hi>own</hi> Fate
would be if they persevered to preach up his
Miracles and Doctrine, which they could
not resolve to do without bidding Adieu to
all their <hi>temporal</hi> Hopes, and ingaging
themselves to undergo all the Miseries and
Calamities in the World; and if they testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
what they knew to be <hi>false,</hi> they trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed
the Rule of their <hi>own</hi> Religion,
and thereby forfeited all their Hopes of a
<hi>blessed</hi> Immortality in the Life to come.
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:63657:179"/>
And can it be imagined that so many Men
should at the <hi>same</hi> Time so unanimously
agree to report and testifie the Miracles of
a Man whom they had lately seen crucified
before their Eyes, when they knew in their
<hi>own</hi> Consciences, that it was all a <hi>meer</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
and could not but foresee, that by
persisting in it, they should incur an <hi>inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>
Ruin in this Life, and an <hi>eternal</hi> Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in the Life to come? Was there ever
such a <hi>desperate</hi> Piece of Madness heard of
from the Beginning of the World to this
Day? And yet this <hi>monstrous</hi> Thing, which
is by a <hi>thousand</hi> Times more <hi>incredible</hi> than
any thing in the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> we
must not only imagin may <hi>be,</hi> but believe
that it really <hi>was;</hi> or else confess that St.
<hi>Iohn</hi> says true here, that they did see the
Glory of his Miracles, which is so <hi>undoubted</hi>
an Evidence of the Truth of his Doctrine.
Wherefore since we are compassed about
with such a Cloud of Witnesses, let us by a
<hi>lively</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Faith adhere to the Truth
of our <hi>holy Religion,</hi> and then we shall find
it <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>mighty</hi> through <hi>God,</hi> to the cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the strong Holds of our <hi>vicious</hi>
Habits, and implanting in us all those <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
Dispositions which are necessary to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
us for those <hi>endless</hi> Joys which our <hi>blessed
Lord</hi> hath promised to, and prepared for us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:63657:180"/>
3. They saw the Glory of that <hi>divine</hi> and
<hi>incomparable</hi> Doctrine which he taught:
From whence I infer the Unreasonableness
of Mens entertaining <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>contemptible</hi>
Opinions of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> since it is so
<hi>excellent</hi> in it self that it was a Glory to the
Son of God to be the Author of it. We have
a sort of Men among us who would fain be
accounted the <hi>Wits</hi> and <hi>Virtuoso's</hi> of the Age,
who pretend to acknowledge a <hi>God,</hi> and a
<hi>Providence,</hi> and all the Principles of <hi>Natural
Religion,</hi> and yet openly profess a very <hi>mean</hi>
and <hi>contemptible</hi> Opinion of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and
take all Occasions to represent it as a <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
Fiction, fit only to be imposed upon the
<hi>credulous</hi> Vulgar. But I would fain know
of these <hi>mighty Men of Reason,</hi> what <hi>plausible</hi>
Pretence they can urge for this their <hi>bold</hi>
and <hi>blasphemous</hi> Censure? Is it because <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
is a <hi>Revealed Religion?</hi> or, because
there is any thing in it that is <hi>unworthy</hi>
of <hi>God</hi> whom we pretend to be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer
of it? or because there wants
<hi>credible</hi> Evidence of its being revealed
by him? If they pretend to reject it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis a <hi>Revealed Religion,</hi> I would
beseech them to consider how it could have
comported with the Goodness of <hi>God</hi> never
to make any Revelation of his Will to the
World, when the Generality of Men were
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:63657:180"/>
lost in such a <hi>Mid-night</hi> of Ignorance in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of <hi>Natural Religion;</hi> how even the
<hi>natural</hi> Notions of the <hi>Deity</hi> were corrupted
into all manner of Follies and Vanities, and
Men had formed Religions not only <hi>hateful</hi>
to <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>nauseous</hi> to all that were <hi>wise</hi>
among themselves; and how defective also
they were in the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>purest</hi> Precepts of
<hi>Morality,</hi> having at last consecrated their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and inthroned them among the Graces
of <hi>Religion:</hi> In which <hi>miserable</hi> State of
Things, it is so far from being <hi>unreasonable</hi> to
expect a Revelation, that 'tis hardly <hi>possible</hi>
to vindicate God's Goodness without sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it. For should he have <hi>for ever</hi> left
Mankind in this <hi>bewilder'd</hi> State without
Revelation, he would have been more want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Man, who is the <hi>noblest</hi> of all his
<hi>earthly</hi> Creatures, than he is to the most <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible</hi>
Animal; for to his <hi>meanest</hi> Creatures
he hath given <hi>sufficient</hi> Ability to attain the
<hi>highest</hi> End of their Beings, which Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
can hardly be supposed to have in
his <hi>corrupt degenerate</hi> State, without sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
a <hi>new</hi> Revelation from <hi>Heaven.</hi> For
we having an <hi>innate</hi> Notion within us
of a <hi>Supreme Being</hi> above us, that is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively
<hi>good,</hi> and endued with all <hi>possible</hi>
Perfection; our <hi>natural</hi> Reason dictates to
us, that to converse with and enjoy him <hi>for
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:63657:181"/>
ever,</hi> is the <hi>highest</hi> Good that we are capable
of, and the most <hi>suitable</hi> to our <hi>rational</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
but by what means we may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to him in this State of Revolt
whereinto we are fallen, and how at length
we may arrive to the Enjoyment of him,
could never have been sufficiently made
known to us in this <hi>Maze</hi> of Ignorance
wherein we were involved, without some
<hi>divine</hi> Revelation: And therefore to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Revelation <hi>unreasonable</hi> in our <hi>miserable</hi>
State and Circumstances, is to suppose it <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable</hi>
for the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Governor
of the World to furnish his <hi>noblest</hi> Creature
<hi>Man</hi> with <hi>sufficient</hi> means to obtain his most
<hi>excellent</hi> End. And if it be acknowledged
that there is a Revelation, because it is so
highly <hi>reasonable</hi> that there should be, let us
consider which of all the Religions in the
World, that pretends to be from <hi>God,</hi> is
most likely to be the Revelation of his Will,
and then I doubt not, if we impartially
compare them, but our Reason will soon
give its Vote for <hi>Christianity.</hi> If you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
for this Revelation of the <hi>Enthusiastick
Poets</hi> of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> how <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi>
is that <hi>Religion</hi> which we find in the
<hi>Theology</hi> of <hi>Hesiod,</hi> the <hi>Hymns</hi> of <hi>Orpheus,</hi>
the <hi>Odes</hi> of <hi>Pindar,</hi> and the <hi>Poems</hi> of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
Virgil,</hi> and <hi>Ovid?</hi> If you consult the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:63657:181"/>
               <hi>Heathen Oracles</hi> of <hi>Delphos, Dodona,</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter
Hammon,</hi> how <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>frivolous,</hi> how
<hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>fallacious,</hi> are all their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponses?
besides that, the Books and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of them are long since perished and
consumed. If you enquire for this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in the <hi>Old Roman Theology,</hi> which
<hi>Numa</hi> pretended to receive from his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dess
<hi>Egeria,</hi> that also is lost, being burnt by
the <hi>Roman Senate,</hi> as <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> tells
us; for that it contained many Things in it
not only destructive to the Gods and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
of other Countries, but also to his <hi>own</hi>
and the <hi>Roman</hi> Profession. Or shall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
<hi>Christianity</hi> with the <hi>Alchoran</hi> of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
which he often pretends to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from God? There we shall find every
Page almost abounding with <hi>monstrous</hi>
Cheats and Impostures, the whole being
nothing else but a <hi>confused</hi> Medly of <hi>impious</hi>
and <hi>contemptible</hi> Fopperies, heaped together
by a <hi>Triumvirate</hi> of <hi>Arians, Iews,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi>
who were all of them <hi>known</hi> Impostors
in the Ages wherein they lived: So that to
confront <hi>Christianity</hi> with any of these, is to
light up a <hi>Rush Candle,</hi> and resolve to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
the Sun with it. For as for <hi>Christianity,</hi>
'tis a <hi>Religion</hi> made up of the most <hi>divine</hi>
and <hi>Godlike</hi> Institutions; its Precepts being
such as are most <hi>worthy</hi> of God, enjoining
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:63657:182"/>
nothing but what is either <hi>true</hi> Godliness,
and most <hi>generous</hi> Morality, or what are
the most <hi>efficacious</hi> Means and Instruments
of promoting them. And as for its Doctrine,
it partly consists of those Principles of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Religion</hi> which all <hi>wise</hi> Men, of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Nation or Religion, have owned and
acknowledged, such as the <hi>Existence, Vnity,</hi>
and <hi>Providence</hi> of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> the <hi>Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Soul,</hi> and the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of <hi>another Life,</hi> together with the <hi>great
Day</hi> of Accounts, wherein Men shall receive
according to what they have done in the
Flesh: And even the Doctrine of the <hi>Holy
Trinity,</hi> which is the <hi>profoundest</hi> Mystery of
all our <hi>Religion,</hi> hath been owned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
by the <hi>greatest</hi> and most <hi>famous Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
that ever were. And as for those Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
that are purely <hi>Christian,</hi> such as the
<hi>Birth,</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> the <hi>Resurrection</hi>
and <hi>Ascension</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> together with
his Sitting at the <hi>Right-hand</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and
coming at the <hi>last</hi> Day to judge the World,
they are all of them so excellently contrived
to serve the <hi>great</hi> Ends of <hi>Religion,</hi> so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
<hi>pregnant</hi> with Motives and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to engage Men to the <hi>greatest</hi> Purity
and Goodness, that by their <hi>own native</hi> Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and <hi>excellent</hi> Contrivance, they manifest
themselves to be the Products of a <hi>divine</hi>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:63657:182"/>
Wisdom. So that there can be no <hi>reasonable</hi>
Pretence to contemn <hi>Christianity</hi> either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a <hi>Revealed Religion,</hi> or because it
contains any thing in it that is any ways <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi>
of the Revealer: And that there wants
not <hi>sufficient</hi> Evidence to demonstrate it to be
the Revelation of God, I have already proved
in the former Inference. So that after all the
<hi>lewd</hi> Talk of these <hi>confident</hi> Men, it's appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
there is not the <hi>least</hi> Colour of Reason
for their <hi>impious</hi> Censures of <hi>Christianity.</hi> But
alas! it's evident that the Foundation of their
Quarrel against it, lies not so much in their
Reason, as their Lusts. <hi>Christianity</hi> lays them
under <hi>severe</hi> Restraints, and will not permit
them to be <hi>wicked</hi> in quiet, which provokes
them to arm their Wit, and the <hi>little</hi> Reason
that they have against it; that so having baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled,
or rather laughed themselves out of their
<hi>Religion,</hi> they may be left at liberty to play
the Fools and Mad-men without Controul
or Disturbance. And I make no doubt but if
instead of that <hi>strict</hi> Piety and Virtue which
<hi>Christianity</hi> enjoins, it had but indulged to
them the Liberties of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Religion,
so that they could have but acted all their
Wickedness with Devotion, sacrificed to the
Gods in <hi>drunken</hi> Bowls, and worshipped in
the Arms of a <hi>Strumpet,</hi> there are no Men in
the World would have been more <hi>zealous
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:63657:183"/>
Christians</hi> than they. But let no Man be so
<hi>foolish</hi> as to imagine that he can alter the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Things by laughing at them, or that
<hi>Christianity</hi> will cease to be <hi>true</hi> in Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with our <hi>wicked</hi> Interest and Desires;
no, no, Things will be as they are in despite
of us, and howsoever we will please to
fancy them. And if after all our <hi>rude</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of <hi>Religion,</hi> it be found to be <hi>true,</hi> as
I doubt not but it will, we shall be <hi>sensible</hi>
when it is <hi>too</hi> late that it had been more for
our Safety to have play'd before the Mouth
of a <hi>Cannon</hi> while it is spitting Fire, or to
have catch'd hold of a <hi>Thunderbolt</hi> as it
comes roaring down from the Clouds, than
to have plaid with <hi>Religion,</hi> and made it the
Subject of our <hi>impious</hi> Scorns and Buffoone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>4. And lastly; They saw the Glory of
his <hi>immaculate</hi> Holiness and Purity: From
whence I infer, that Holiness and <hi>true</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is the <hi>greatest</hi> Glory and Honour to <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
Nature. For this was the Glory of the
<hi>Son of God</hi> himself when he assumed our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and dwelt among us; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more <hi>glorious</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> than his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and notwithstanding those <hi>excellent</hi>
Doctrines that he preached, those <hi>stupendous</hi>
Miracles that he wrought, and that <hi>visible</hi>
Splendor in which he was inrobed, he had not
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:63657:183"/>
deserved the Name of a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi>
Man if he had not been <hi>just</hi> and <hi>charitable,
temperate,</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> and <hi>Heavenly-minded,</hi>
and <hi>eminent</hi> in all those <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>humane</hi>
Virtues which are the <hi>proper</hi> Glory and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of <hi>humane</hi> Nature. For that which
makes a Man more <hi>honourable</hi> than a <hi>meer</hi>
Animal, and advances us into the <hi>next</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Beings to Angels, is our Reason, by
which alone we border upon the Divinity,
and do claim Kindred with the <hi>Angelical</hi>
Natures. That therefore which is truly our
Honour and Glory, consists in living accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that Reason by which we are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
above all <hi>sublunary</hi> Natures; that is, in
governing our <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Appetites, Words</hi>
and <hi>Actions,</hi> according to those <hi>Eternal</hi> Rules
of Righteousness which <hi>Right</hi> Reason di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
to us; and if instead of doing thus, we
wholly resign up our selves to the Dominion
of our <hi>brutish</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> Inclinations,
we thereby render our selves more <hi>despicable</hi>
and <hi>infamous</hi> than the most <hi>beastly</hi> Brutes in
all the Creation, and even those <hi>Goats,</hi> and
<hi>Wolves,</hi> and <hi>Swine,</hi> and <hi>Tygers,</hi> whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
in our <hi>beastly</hi> Manners, could they see
our Shame, would doubtlesly hiss at us, and
reproach us for <hi>greater</hi> Beasts than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
for they all live <hi>up</hi> to the <hi>best</hi> of their
Natures, and regularly pursue the <hi>highest</hi> End
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:63657:184"/>
for which they were created; whereas we
who are Allyed to the <hi>noblest</hi> of Beings, and
are created and designed for the most <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
Ends, do by our <hi>base</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi>
Condescentions shamefully under-value our
selves in pursuing no Ends but what are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<hi>unworthy</hi> of us: So that it had been
much more for our Honour and Reputation
to have assumed the Shape and Nature of
Brutes, when we assumed their Manners and
Customs; for then our Actions would have
very well become us, and neither <hi>God</hi> nor
<hi>Men</hi> could have justly upbraided us for
them. But to lead the Lives of <hi>Brutes</hi> in the
Shape and Nature of <hi>Men,</hi> is <hi>monstrous;</hi> 'tis
to advance the <hi>Beast</hi> above the <hi>Man,</hi> to place
our <hi>Heels</hi> where Nature hath placed our
<hi>Head,</hi> and become our own <hi>Reverse</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>BY the <hi>Scriptures</hi> here must be meant
the <hi>Old Testament;</hi> for as yet the
<hi>greatest</hi> Part of the <hi>New</hi> was <hi>unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,</hi>
and the <hi>whole</hi> of it <hi>unwritten.</hi> They
were those very <hi>Scriptures</hi> which the <hi>unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Iews,</hi> to whom our <hi>Saviour</hi> was now
preaching, owned and acknowledged to be
the Word of God; <hi>for in them,</hi> says our
Saviour, <hi>ye think ye have eternal life;</hi> which
it's certain they did not <hi>think</hi> of any <hi>other
Scriptures</hi> but only those of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and they are they,</hi> says he, <hi>which testify
of me.</hi> And to be sure there were no <hi>other
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:63657:185"/>
Scriptures</hi> which could testify of <hi>Christ</hi> to
the <hi>unbelieving Iews,</hi> but only those of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> these being the only
<hi>Scriptures</hi> whose Testimony they credited.
But yet the Reason which our <hi>Saviour</hi> urges
to move them to read the <hi>Old Testament,</hi>
doth as much oblige us to read the <hi>New</hi> as
well as the Old, as it did them to read the
<hi>Old; for in them ye think to have eternal life;</hi>
that is, in them ye think ye have <hi>eternal Life</hi>
promised, and all the Necessaries to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and done by you in order to your
obtaining it, proposed to you. And indeed
as they thought, so it was; they had <hi>eternal
Life</hi> proposed to them in <hi>Hieroglyphicks;</hi> for
<hi>that</hi> was the Mystery of their <hi>Holy of Holies,
that</hi> was the Interpretation of their Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> and the <hi>spiritual</hi> Sense of all their
<hi>general</hi> Promises of <hi>good</hi> Things to come:
They had all the Articles of Faith, and all
the Instances of Duty that were <hi>necessary</hi> to
their Attainment of <hi>eternal Life</hi> exhibited
to them in the Writings of their Prophets,
and the Types and Figures of their Law.
For it was by this Rule alone that all the <hi>holy</hi>
Men of the <hi>Iewish Nation</hi> did live and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
and either this was <hi>sufficient</hi> to guide
and direct them to <hi>eternal Life,</hi> or they were
left under a <hi>fatal</hi> Necessity of falling short of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:63657:185"/>
it: It was the <hi>Law of the Lord</hi> that did <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
their Eyes, and rejoyce their Hearts, and
convert their Souls;</hi> and it was <hi>in keeping it</hi>
that they found <hi>great Reward,</hi> Ps. 19. 7, 8, 11.
And therefore either they fell short of the
Reward of <hi>eternal Life</hi> notwithstanding this
their Illumination and Conversion, or they
found it in keeping that Law by which they
were illuminated and converted; and if in
keeping their Law they found <hi>eternal</hi> Life,
then it's certain that in their Law <hi>they</hi> had it.
So that these Words of our <hi>Saviour (for in
them ye think ye have eternal life)</hi> do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that they were mistaken in thinking so,
or at least they only imply that they were
mistaken in thinking to obtain <hi>eternal Life</hi>
by adhering to the <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>literal</hi> Sense of
their Law without pursuing the Mystery
and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Meaning of it; which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Error of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> with whom
our <hi>Saviour</hi> is here discoursing. For the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
Sense and Mystery of their Law was
the <hi>Gospel,</hi> all whose Articles of Faith, and
Precepts of Duty, were (though darkly and
obscurely) expressed and represented in the
Types and Figures of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And hence the Apostle tells us, that both
the <hi>Priests</hi> and their <hi>Oblations, did serve unto
the example, and shadow of heavenly things,
Heb.</hi> 8. 5. So that the <hi>heavenly Things</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:63657:186"/>
in the <hi>Gospel</hi> were the <hi>substantial</hi> Idea's
which those <hi>Legal</hi> Types and Patterns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
and represented; and the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
calls that Law <hi>a shadow of good things to
come, Heb.</hi> 10. 1. that is, it was an <hi>obscure</hi>
Scheme or Prefiguration of the Mercies of
the <hi>Gospel,</hi> of which <hi>eternal</hi> Life is a <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi>
Part. Since therefore the Law was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but only the <hi>Gospel</hi> in <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure</hi>
Cyphers, if in <hi>this</hi> we <hi>Christians</hi> have
<hi>eternal Life,</hi> in <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> had it also:
And therefore the Reason which our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
here urges to oblige the <hi>Iews</hi> to <hi>search the
Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament; [for in them
ye think ye have eternal life]</hi> doth at least e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
oblige us <hi>Christians</hi> to search the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
both of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New.</hi> For if they
had <hi>just</hi> Reason to think they had <hi>eternal
Life</hi> in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
obliged to search into it, we have ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>more</hi> Reason to think that we have <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life</hi> in the <hi>New,</hi> since the <hi>New Testament</hi>
is nothing else but only the <hi>Old</hi> decyphered
and unriddled; and therefore we must not
only have <hi>eternal Life</hi> in <hi>this,</hi> as they had in
<hi>that,</hi> but we must also have it far more expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than they. In the Prosecution of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
therefore, I shall endeavour these
<hi>Two</hi> Things:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:63657:186"/>
I. To shew you that in the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
we have <hi>eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. That this is a very <hi>forcible</hi> Reason to
oblige us to search them.</p>
            <p>I. First, that in the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> we
have <hi>eternal Life;</hi> that is, that in them we
have <hi>eternal Life</hi> proposed to us, together
with all that is <hi>necessary</hi> to be believed, and
practised by us in order to our obtaining it;
or in other words, that the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi>
is a <hi>sufficient</hi> Rule both of Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to guide and direct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to <hi>eternal</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And this is <hi>one</hi> Article of the Faith of
the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to explain to the People; for so in
her sixth Article <hi>our Church</hi> professes, <hi>that
the Holy Scripture containeth all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to Salvation; so that whatsoever is not
read therein, or may be proved thence, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of any Man that it should be believed as
an Article of Faith, or be thought requisite or
necessary to Salvation.</hi> Now to make the
<hi>Scripture</hi> a <hi>sufficient</hi> Rule as to all Things <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>
to Salvation, there are <hi>two</hi> Things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
<hi>First,</hi> That it should be <hi>full;</hi> and,
<hi>Secondly,</hi> That it should be <hi>clear:</hi> both
which the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is in an <hi>eminent</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
as containing in it all that is <hi>necessary</hi> to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:63657:187"/>
be believed, and done in order to <hi>eternal Life.</hi>
And this will evidently appear from these
three following Propositions:</p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> inspired the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the <hi>Scripture</hi> with all that is <hi>necessary</hi>
to <hi>eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That they preached to the World all
those <hi>Necessaries</hi> with which the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>
inspired them.</p>
            <p>3. That all those <hi>necessary</hi> Truths which
they preached, are comprehended in those
<hi>Sacred</hi> Writings of theirs of which the <hi>Holy
Scripture</hi> consists.</p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> inspired the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the <hi>Scripture</hi> with all that is <hi>necessary</hi>
to <hi>eternal Life.</hi> For, <hi>first,</hi> our <hi>Saviour,</hi> by
whom they were originally instructed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
that as the <hi>Father loved him, and shewed
him all things that himself did, Ioh.</hi> 5. 20. so
<hi>he had made known to them all things that he
had heard of his Father, Ioh.</hi> 17. 8. And then
when he went from them, and ceased to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
them in his <hi>own</hi> Person, he promised
that by his <hi>Spirit</hi> he would <hi>teach them all
things, and bring all things to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
whatsoever he had said unto them, Ioh.
14.</hi> 26. and that by the same <hi>Spirit</hi> he would
<hi>guide them into all Truth, Ioh.</hi> 16. 13. If
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:63657:187"/>
therefore the <hi>Spirit</hi> did perform this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to them, (as there is no doubt but he
did) then we are sure that he did teach them
over again whatsoever <hi>Christ</hi> had taught
them before, and if <hi>Christ</hi> had taught them
whatsoever he had heard of his Father, (as
he declares he had) then it is certain either
that he taught them all Things <hi>necessary</hi> to
<hi>eternal Life,</hi> or that he himself had not heard
from his Father all Things that are <hi>necessary</hi>
thereunto.</p>
            <p>2. That as they were taught by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
all Things <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>eternal Life,</hi> so
what they were taught, they preached and
delivered to the World. For so our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
commanded them to go forth into all
the World, and <hi>teach all Nations to observe
all</hi> those <hi>things which he had commanded</hi> them,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. Which Injunction of his
they strictly observed; for so we are told,
that in Obedience to it, <hi>they went forth, and
preached every where, Mark</hi> 16. 20. And that
their preaching extended to all Things <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>
to Salvation, is evident from their
<hi>own</hi> Testimony: For thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the
<hi>Ephesians</hi> that he had <hi>not shunned to declare
unto them the whole Counsel of God, Acts 20.
27.</hi> And to be sure in the <hi>whole</hi> Counsel of
<hi>God,</hi> all that is <hi>necessary</hi> to Salvation must be
included. And concerning <hi>that Gospel</hi>
               <pb n="366" facs="tcp:63657:188"/>
which he had preached to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
he thus pronounces, <hi>By which also ye are sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if ye keep in Memory what I preached unto
you, unless ye have believed in vain, 1 Cor. 15.
1,</hi> 2. But how could they be saved by that
<hi>Gospel,</hi> he preached to them, unless it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in it all Things <hi>necessary</hi> to Salvation?
And this very <hi>Gospel</hi> which the Apostles in
their <hi>constant</hi> Ministry proposed to the
World, St. <hi>Iames</hi> calls the <hi>ingrafted Word,
which is able to save our Souls, Iam.</hi> 1. 21.
And for the same Reason it is also called the
<hi>Word of Reconciliation; 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 19. The
<hi>Word of Salvation, Acts</hi> 13. 26. And the
<hi>Word of Life, Acts</hi> 5. 20. And <hi>the Savour of
Life unto Life, 2 Cor.</hi> 2. 16. And also <hi>the
Power of God unto Salvation to every one that
believes, Rom.</hi> 1. 17. Neither of which it
could be justly stiled, supposing it to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective</hi>
in any Things <hi>necessary</hi> to the <hi>eternal</hi>
Happiness of Men.</p>
            <p>3. And lastly, That all those <hi>necessary</hi>
Truths which they preached, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in those Writings of theirs, of which
the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> consists. It is true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine was collected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
those <hi>Scriptures</hi> of which the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
now consists, it was all conveyed by
<hi>Oral Tradition</hi> from the Mouths of the
Teachers, to the Ears of the Disciples; but
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:63657:188"/>
in a <hi>little</hi> Time those <hi>holy</hi> Men who first
preached it, found an <hi>absolute</hi> Necessity of
committing it to Writing, as a much <hi>surer</hi>
Way of preserving it <hi>uncorrupted,</hi> and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
it down to all <hi>succeeding</hi> Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for thus <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells us,</p>
            <p>
               <note n="1" place="margin">Hist. Eccles. l. 2. c 15.</note> 
               <hi>That the</hi> Romans <hi>not being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with St.</hi> Peter'<hi>s preaching
of Christianity to them, earnestly
desired St.</hi> Mark, <hi>his Companion, that he
would leave them in Writing, a standing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of that Doctrine which St.</hi> Peter <hi>had
delivered to them by Word of Mouth, which
was the Occasion,</hi> says he, <hi>of the writing of St.</hi>
Mark'<hi>s Gospel: Which thing St.</hi> Peter <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by a Revelation of the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
highly pleased with their earnest Desire,
he confirmed it by his own Authority, that it
might afterwards be read in the Churches.</hi> It
seems in those Days the <hi>Romans</hi> did not
think <hi>oral</hi> or <hi>unwritten Traditions</hi> a <hi>sufficient</hi>
Conservatory of <hi>divine</hi> Truths, nor did their
<hi>Bishop</hi> then forbid the reading of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
to the Laity in their <hi>own</hi> Language.
After which he tells us <note n="2" place="margin">L. 3. c. 24.</note>,
that <hi>St.</hi> Matthew <hi>and St.</hi>
John <hi>were the only Disciples
of our Lord, who had left written Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Things which they had preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them; and it was,</hi> says he, <hi>Necessity that
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:63657:189"/>
impelled them to write. For</hi> Matthew <hi>having
preached the Faith to the Hebrews, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to go from them to other Nations, wrote his
Gospel in his own Country-Language, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he might supply the Want of his Presence to
those whom he left behind him. And afterwards
when</hi> Mark <hi>and</hi> Luke <hi>had published their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels,</hi>
John <hi>who had hitherto only preached the
Gospel by Word of Mouth, being at length moved
by the same Reason betook himself to write. And
the Three former Gospels,</hi> says he, <hi>arriving to
the Knowledge of all Men, and particularly of
St.</hi> John, <hi>he approved them, and with his own
Testimony confirmed the Truth of them.</hi> From
which Relation it's evident, that <hi>that</hi> which
moved those <hi>holy</hi> Men to commit their <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels</hi>
to Writing, was this, that they judged
it <hi>necessary</hi> for the Conservation of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Doctrine, that so these in their Absence
might be <hi>standing</hi> Monuments of the Faith,
to preach that <hi>Gospel</hi> to Mens Eyes which
they had preached to their Ears: And if they
wrote to preserve the Faith, to be sure they
would leave no <hi>necessary</hi> or <hi>essential</hi> Part of it
unwritten. There are several Propositions
in these <hi>Gospels</hi> which, though very <hi>useful,</hi>
are far from being <hi>essential</hi> Parts of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi>
and can we imagine that those <hi>holy</hi> Men
who wrote on purpose to conserve <hi>Chrictia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
should take so much Care to write
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:63657:189"/>
many Things which are not <hi>necessary</hi> Parts, and
in the mean time omit any Things that are? <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>
tells us of St. <hi>Mark</hi> in particular, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
i.e. <hi>he took great Care of
this more especially, not to pretermit any of those
Things which he had heard,</hi> (even from St. <hi>Peter)
nor to affix any thing to them that was false:</hi> And if
he were so <hi>careful</hi> not to omit any Thing, to be
sure he would be particularly careful not to
omit any Thing which he judged <hi>necessary</hi> to the
<hi>eternal</hi> Happiness of Men. But what need we
depend upon <hi>humane</hi> Authority, when as, if we
consult those <hi>Sacred</hi> Writings themselves, (which
so far as they go, all <hi>Christians</hi> allow to be the
<hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God)</hi> we shall find they give this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of themselves, that they comprehend in
them all Things <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>eternal</hi> Life. For thus
the Writers of the <hi>New Testament</hi> testify of the
<hi>Old, That they are able to make us wise unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
through Faith which is in Iesus Christ, 2 Tim.
3.</hi> 15. And if the <hi>Old Testament</hi> alone was able
to do this, then much more the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New</hi>
together; but how could they make Men <hi>wise to
Salvation,</hi> if they were <hi>defective</hi> in any Article
that is <hi>necessary</hi> to Salvation? And then the same
Author goes on and tells us, that <hi>all Scripture is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by Inspiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine,
for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;
that the Man of God may be perfect, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furnished unto all good works, v.</hi> 16. 17. And if the
<hi>Old Scriptures</hi> were <hi>sufficient</hi> to make the Man of
God <hi>perfect,</hi> and to furnish him throughly unto
all <hi>good</hi> Works, one would think that the <hi>New</hi>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:63657:190"/>
and <hi>Old</hi> together should not be <hi>defective.</hi> For that
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>New Testament</hi> as well as of
the <hi>Old</hi> contain in them all Things <hi>necessary</hi> to
<hi>eternal Life,</hi> they themselves do plainly testify of
themselves: For thus St. <hi>Luke</hi> in the Beginning
of his <hi>Gospel</hi> tells his <hi>Theophilus,</hi> to whom he
writes, that <hi>forasmuch as many had set forth a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of those things that were surely believed
among Christians, it seemed good unto him also ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had a perfect understanding of all things from the
first, to write them down in order that he might know
the Certainty of those things wherein he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed:</hi>
From whence I infer, that supposing
St. <hi>Luke</hi> performed what he promised, his <hi>Gospel</hi>
must contain a <hi>full</hi> Declaration of the <hi>Christian
Religion:</hi> For, <hi>First,</hi> by promising to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of those Things which were surely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
among <hi>Christians,</hi> he engaged himself to
give an <hi>entire</hi> Account of <hi>Christianity,</hi> unless we
will suppose that there were some Parts of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi>
which the <hi>Christians</hi> of that Time did not
surely believe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In promising to give
an Account of those Things of which he had a
<hi>perfect</hi> Understanding from the first, and in
which his <hi>Theophilus</hi> had been instructed, he also
engages himself to give a <hi>compleat</hi> Account of the
whole <hi>Religion,</hi> unless we will suppose that there
were some Parts of this <hi>Religion</hi> which St. <hi>Luke</hi>
did not perfectly understand, and in which <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus</hi>
had not been before instructed. Thus also
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> testifies of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> Chap. 20. 31. <hi>These
things are written, that ye might believe that Iesus is
the Christ the Son of God, and that believing ye might
have life through his name.</hi> And if it be objected,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:63657:190"/>
that by <hi>these Things</hi> the Apostle only means the
Miracles of <hi>Christ</hi> which are the Motives of our
Belief, and not his Doctrines which are to be
believed by us; this is notoriously <hi>false,</hi> since by
<hi>these Things</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> means his <hi>Gospel</hi> in which
not only the Miracles, but the Doctrines of <hi>Christ</hi>
are contained; and therefore in his first Epistle,
<hi>chap.</hi> 5. 13. he saith, <hi>These things have I written
unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God,
that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye
may believe,</hi> or continue to believe <hi>on the name of
the Son of God:</hi> Where by <hi>These Things</hi> it's plain
he means only that <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine which he
had been teaching throughout the whole Epistle.
From which <hi>two</hi> Places I argue, that <hi>all</hi> Things
<hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>eternal Life</hi> are written, because he
expresly tells us that <hi>These Things</hi> were written
to this end, that they might beget and nourish in
us that Faith by which we may obtain <hi>eternal
Life;</hi> but if that Faith which these <hi>written</hi> Things
was designed to beget in us, be not <hi>sufficient</hi> to
<hi>eternal Life,</hi> then were these Things written in
vain, and the End of writing them, which was
that we might obtain <hi>eternal Life</hi> by believing
them, was wholly frustrated; but if that Faith
were <hi>sufficient</hi> to <hi>eternal Life,</hi> then these <hi>written</hi>
Things which begot that Faith, and were the
Object of it, must contain in them all Things
<hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>eternal Life;</hi> for how can they beget
in us a Faith that is <hi>sufficient</hi> to <hi>eternal Life,</hi> unless
they propose to our Faith all Things that are <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>
thereunto?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:63657:191"/>
And thus I have endeavoured to demonstrate
from <hi>Scripture</hi> it self, which all agree is the <hi>Word
of God,</hi> and consequently the most <hi>concluding</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in the World, that the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is
in it self a <hi>sufficient</hi> Rule of Faith and Manners to
direct Men to <hi>eternal Life.</hi> And if this be so, I
would fain know by what Warrant or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
any Man, or <hi>Church,</hi> can pretend to obtrude
upon the Faith of <hi>Christians</hi> any <hi>unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
or Doctrines of Faith, and Rules of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
not <hi>recorded</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> as of <hi>equal</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with those <hi>recorded</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and equally
<hi>necessary</hi> to the <hi>eternal</hi> Happiness of Men. For
that there have been such <hi>bold</hi> Imposers in the
<hi>Christian</hi> World, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> assures us in the 2d
Chapter of his 2d Book against <hi>Heresies;</hi> where
he tells us of a sort of <hi>Hereticks</hi> who taught, that
<hi>the Truth could not be found in the Scriptures by those
to whom Tradition was unknown; for as much as it
was not delivered by Writing, but by Word of Mouth.</hi>
And these Hereticks<note n="1" place="margin">De Praescrip. Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. c. 25.</note>, as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
observes, <hi>confessed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that the Apostles were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
and that they did not at all differ among
themselves in their Preaching, but said they revealed
not all Things unto all Men; some Things they taught
openly and to all, some Things secretly, and to a few;</hi>
which <hi>secret</hi> Things were the <hi>unwritten Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
which they sought to impose upon the
Faith of <hi>Christians.</hi> And how far the <hi>Church of
Rome</hi> it self doth in this matter tread in the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of these <hi>ancient Hereticks,</hi> is but <hi>too notorious:</hi>
For thus in the Preface of their <hi>Catechism</hi> it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
affirmed by the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> that <hi>the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:63657:191"/>
whole Doctrine to be delivered to the Faithful, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Word of God, which Word of God is
distributed into Scripture and Tradition.</hi> And in the
<hi>Council</hi> it self they declare, and define, that <hi>the
Books of Scripture and unwritten Traditions are to be
received and honoured with equal pious Affection and
Reverence:</hi> In which Words they expresly own
<hi>another</hi> Word of God besides the <hi>Scripture, viz.
Tradition,</hi> which they <hi>equalize</hi> with the <hi>Scripture</hi>
it self. And this is almost <hi>verbatim</hi> the very
Assertion which both <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Terullian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
for <hi>Heresy;</hi> and as they are the same, so
we find they are grounded on the same Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
For those very Texts of <hi>Scripture</hi> which
those <hi>ancient</hi> Hereticks urged for their <hi>Tradition,</hi>
are urged by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> for the <hi>Tradition</hi> of his
<hi>Church.</hi> Thus for their <hi>Tradition,</hi> as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and
<hi>Tertullian</hi> acquaints us, they urged that of St.
<hi>Paul, We speak Wisdom among them that are perfect;</hi>
and also, <hi>O Timothy, keep that which is committed
to thy trust;</hi> and again, <hi>That good Thing which is
committed to thee, keep:</hi> All which Texts are
urged by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> in his 4th and 5th Books <hi>de
Verbo Dei,</hi> in behalf of that <hi>Tradition</hi> which the
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> contends for: And 'tis something
hard that <hi>that</hi> which was damned for <hi>Heresy</hi> in
the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> should be made an <hi>Article of
Faith</hi> in the <hi>present Roman.</hi> Not that we do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow
of <hi>Traditions</hi> universally received in all
<hi>Churches</hi> and Ages; for we frankly acknowledge
that what is now contained in <hi>Scripture</hi> was <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
before it was <hi>Scripture,</hi> as being <hi>first</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by Word of Mouth before it was collected
into Writing; and therefore whensoever it can
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:63657:192"/>
be made evident to us that there are any <hi>unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>
Doctrines bearing the same Stamp of <hi>Divine</hi>
Authority with those that are <hi>written,</hi> we are
ready to receive them with the same Veneration
as we do the <hi>Scriptures</hi> themselves. For it is not
their being written that doth <hi>authorize</hi> them, but
their being from <hi>God,</hi> and our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and his
<hi>Apostles;</hi> and therefore when once it's made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to us that <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Apostles</hi> taught <hi>so</hi> and
<hi>so,</hi> that is <hi>sufficient</hi> to command our Assent and
Submission whether it be made appear from
<hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Tradition.</hi> So that the Reason why we
embrace <hi>some</hi> Doctrines and reject <hi>others,</hi> is not
merely because the <hi>one</hi> are written, and the <hi>other</hi>
not; but because to us, who live at so <hi>great</hi> a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> it can never
be made so evident, that what is not <hi>written,</hi> was
taught by them, as what is. What is <hi>written</hi> hath
been delivered down to us by the <hi>unanimous Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
and Testimony of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in all
Ages, which I am sure can never be justly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
of any <hi>one</hi> of those <hi>unwritten Traditions</hi>
which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> now imposes upon the
Faith of <hi>Christians.</hi> Let them but produce the
same <hi>unanimous</hi> Testimony that any one of those
<hi>Twelve Articles</hi> which they have thought meet to
superadd to the <hi>ancient Creeds,</hi> was taught by
<hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Apostles,</hi> as we do that what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in <hi>Scripture</hi> was so, and we will as readily
embrace it as any Proposition in <hi>Scripture;</hi> but if
<hi>this</hi> Article be neither to be found in <hi>Scripture,</hi>
nor delivered down to us as taught by <hi>Christ</hi> or
his <hi>Apostles,</hi> by the <hi>unanimous</hi> Testimony of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> through all Ages, we must crave
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:63657:192"/>
their pardon if we cannot receive it as Part of the
<hi>Word of God.</hi> But how <hi>impossible</hi> it is to prove by
the <hi>unanimous</hi> Testimony of the <hi>Church,</hi> that any
<hi>unwritten</hi> Doctrine is Part of the <hi>Word of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>
to be believed by all <hi>Christians,</hi> is evident
from hence, because for <hi>several</hi> Ages after our
<hi>Saviour</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> unanimously taught, that
whatsoever was <hi>necessary</hi> to be believed was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in <hi>Scripture;</hi> and for the same <hi>Church</hi> at
the same time to testify that <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that unwritten</hi>
Doctrine is a Part of God's <hi>Word necessary</hi> to be
believed, and yet that all Doctrines <hi>necessary</hi> to
be believed are <hi>written,</hi> is plainly to contradict
it self. And yet we find the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi>
unanimously attesting that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is the
Rule from whence we draw all the Assertions of
our Faith, the <hi>last</hi> Will and Testimony of our
<hi>Saviour</hi> by which all Controversies are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided,
the Boundaries of the <hi>Church,</hi> out of
which it is not to depart, the Touchstone of
Truth, the Foundation and Pillar of our Faith
for the Time to come, and the only certain Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine and Demonstration in
Matters of Faith. These are their <hi>own</hi> Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and abundance more than these we meet
with to the same purpose; and which is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable,
they not only assert the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be
a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>adequate</hi> Rule of Faith, but severely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
against all Additions to it. Thus <hi>Eusebius
Pamphilus</hi> in the Name of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Nice,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; i. e. <hi>those Things which
are written, believe; those Things which are not
written, neither think upon, nor enquire after.</hi> Thus
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:63657:193"/>
also St. <hi>Austin, Quicquid inde audieritis è Scripturâ
sacrâ, hoc vobis bene sapiat; quicquid extra est, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spuite,
ne erretis in nebula: Whatsoever ye hear from
the Holy Scriptures let it savour well with you;
whatsoever is without them, refuse, lest ye wander in
a Cloud.</hi> St. <hi>Bazil</hi> declares, that <hi>it is a manifest
falling from the Faith, and an Argument of Arrogancy
either to reject any point of those Things that are
written, or to bring in any of those which are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
and that it is the Property of a faithful Man to
be fully perswaded of the Truth of those Things that
are delivered in the Holy Scripture, and not to dare
either to reject or to add any thing thereunto.</hi> Thus
<hi>Tertullian,</hi> advers. Hermog. <hi>Si enim non est scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
timeat Vae illud adjicientibus aut detrahentibus
destinatum: If what he pretends be not written, let
him fear that Woe that is denounced against such as
add or take away.</hi> What Likelihood therefore is
there that they who thus severely forbid adding
any thing to the <hi>written Word of God,</hi> did ever so
much as dream of <hi>another Word of God</hi> consisting
of <hi>unwritten Traditions?</hi> And indeed methinks it
is very strange if there had been any <hi>other Word
of God</hi> besides what is <hi>written,</hi> there should no
notice be taken of it in that which is <hi>written;</hi>
especially considering that if it be as <hi>necessary</hi>
to be believed as the <hi>Roman Church</hi> defines it; it is
as <hi>necessary</hi> that we should have Direction where
to find it, and how to know it when we have it;
but of this we have not the <hi>least</hi> Intimation in
<hi>Scripture.</hi> For as for those Words of St. <hi>Paul,
2 Thess. 2. 15. Hold the Traditions which ye have
been taught, whether by Word, or our Epistle,</hi> all
that can be justly inferred from them is only this,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:63657:193"/>
that the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> at the Writing of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
had only an <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> of a <hi>great</hi> Part of
that <hi>Gospel</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had preached to them,
the Gospels being as yet either not collected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Writing, or not dispersed abroad into the
Churches; so that then <hi>this,</hi> and his <hi>former</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to them, were perhaps the only <hi>written</hi> Part
of the <hi>New Testament</hi> that was yet arrived to
their hands; and if so, then this Command of
<hi>holding the Traditions by word,</hi> did oblige no longer
than till they had received the <hi>written Gospel;</hi>
because then those <hi>Traditions</hi> by Word were all
recorded in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and being there recorded,
they were thenceforth obliged to hold them as
<hi>Scripture,</hi> and no longer as <hi>Traditions</hi> by Word.
But supposing there are still <hi>unwritten Traditions</hi>
in the Church that are not in <hi>Scripture,</hi> but yet
were delivered by <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and so
are equally the <hi>Word of God</hi> with the <hi>Scripture;</hi>
I would fain know how we who live at so <hi>great</hi>
a distance from <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> should ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know where to find, or be assured that they
are such when we have them. We know very
well that even in the <hi>Primitive</hi> Ages there were
sundry <hi>counterfeit Traditions</hi> which <hi>Hereticks</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to derive from <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles;</hi>
and if it were so <hi>easy</hi> a matter to counterfeit <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi>
then, how much more <hi>easy</hi> is it now? I
confess <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi> gives us a very <hi>good</hi>
Rule how to distinguish <hi>counterfeit</hi> from <hi>true Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
Quod ubi<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> quod semper, quod ab omnibus

                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Catholicum
That which was every where, and always, and by all
Christians believed, that is truly and properly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:63657:194"/>
And by this Rule we are willing to abide;
if they can shew us any Article of <hi>Christianity</hi> not
recorded in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which hath been every
where, and always believed by all <hi>Christians,</hi> we
will readily admit it as an <hi>unwritten Word of God,</hi>
and with the same Respect and Reverence as we
do that which is <hi>written:</hi> But this we are fully
assured they will never be able to perform, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as was shewn before, the <hi>Primitive Church</hi>
doth with <hi>one</hi> Consent attest the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be
an <hi>entire</hi> Rule of Faith, in which all the Articles
of <hi>Christianity</hi> are contained.</p>
            <p>But we are told that for these <hi>unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
we must rely upon the <hi>present Church</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Age, and receive as a <hi>divine</hi> Tradition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
she defines to be so; where by the <hi>present
Church</hi> is meant the <hi>present Roman Church;</hi> that is
to say, whatsoever <hi>this Church</hi> defines we must
believe it, because she defines it; which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but think is a <hi>hard</hi> Case; <hi>First,</hi> Because we
know very well that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is at <hi>best</hi>
but a Part of the <hi>Church universal,</hi> and we know
no Right that any <hi>Part</hi> hath to impose upon the
<hi>Whole,</hi> and to oblige it to believe whatsoever she
proposes, meerly because she proposes it. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
Because in Fact we are very well assured
that the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is so far from being a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi>
Preserver of <hi>Tradition,</hi> that there is no <hi>Church</hi>
in the World hath more studiously attempted to
counterfeit and deprave it; of which <hi>innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Instances are given by our Authors, many of
which are now acknowledged even by their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
to be <hi>true.</hi> For even their <hi>Vulgar Latin
Edition</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi> it self, which they prefer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:63657:194"/>
the <hi>Originals,</hi> is confessed by themselves to
abound with <hi>manifest</hi> Errors and Corruptions;
and even to the very <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi> they have
added <hi>sundry Apocryphal Books</hi> which we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know the <hi>Primitive Tradition</hi> never admitted
as Parts of the <hi>sacred Scripture;</hi> and it is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to all the World how many Books and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
they have forged, and how many of the
Writings of the <hi>Ancients</hi> they have <hi>gelded</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpolated</hi>
to defend and support those <hi>pretended
Traditions</hi> which they have imposed upon the
World as Articles of Faith. And after she hath
been guilty of so many <hi>apparent</hi> Falsifications, we
cannot but think it a very <hi>hard</hi> Case that we
should still be obliged to believe her upon her
own <hi>bare</hi> Word. For in the <hi>third</hi> Place, at this
rate of Proceeding we must in many Instances
condemn the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> in
Complement to those of the <hi>present Roman;</hi>
which if we believe <hi>our own</hi> Eyes, and the most
<hi>authentick</hi> Histories and Records of those Times,
do expresly thwart and contradict <hi>one another;</hi>
and since, if we would never so fain we can never
believe both Parts of a Contradiction, we must
in believing the <hi>one</hi> give the Lye to the <hi>other.</hi>
Nay, <hi>Fourthly</hi> and lastly, though we should be
perswaded, as we think we have Reason to be,
that many of the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>present Church
of Rome</hi> are not only not mentioned in <hi>Scripture,</hi>
but directly contrary to it; (as for Instance,
their performing <hi>Divine Service</hi> in an <hi>unknown</hi>
Tongue, which we think is as <hi>contrary</hi> to
<hi>1 Cor.</hi> 14. as <hi>one</hi> Proposition can be to <hi>another:)</hi>
yet if that <hi>Churches</hi> Definitions do by their <hi>own</hi>
               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:63657:195"/>
Authority oblige our Faith, we must believe her
against <hi>Scripture</hi> it self. And this we think <hi>intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,</hi>
that any <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christian</hi> should be
obliged to believe the <hi>unwritten Word</hi> of the
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> in a Matter wherein, upon the most
<hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> Search, they are verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
it contradicts the <hi>written Word of God;</hi>
and if the Sentence of the <hi>one</hi> or <hi>t'other</hi> must be
made <hi>void,</hi> we think it is very <hi>reasonable</hi> that the
Voice of her <hi>pretended unwritten Word</hi> should be
silenced by that more <hi>certain</hi> one of the <hi>lively Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of God.</hi> But after all, if what I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to prove be proved, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Holy
Scriptures</hi> are a <hi>sufficient</hi> Rule of Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to conduct us to <hi>eternal Life,</hi> this will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to evacuate all that is pretended for this
<hi>unwritten Word of God.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> and Nature we
know do nothing in vain; and therefore <hi>if one
Word of God</hi> be <hi>sufficient, viz.</hi> that which is <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
what need have we of this <hi>other</hi> which is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written?</hi>
And so I have done with the <hi>first neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
Property of a Rule of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> that it be
<hi>full;</hi> and shewn at large that the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is
so as to all Things <hi>necessary</hi> to Salvation; and
therefore shall now proceed to</p>
            <p>II. The <hi>Second, viz.</hi> That it be <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible</hi>
to those whose Faith and Manners are to
be regulated by it.</p>
            <p>I do not mean when I say that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is
<hi>clear,</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> to all those to
whom it is a Rule of Faith and Manners, that it
is throughout so in all its Proposals. For it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied but there are many Things not only
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:63657:195"/>
in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, but also in <hi>other</hi> Parts of
<hi>Scripture, hard to be understood;</hi> and such as do
not only exceed the Apprehension of <hi>common</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities;
but also puzzle the Understandings of
the most <hi>acute</hi> and <hi>profound</hi> Enquirers. But that
which I assert is this, That all those Doctrines of
Faith, and Rules of Manners which are <hi>necessary</hi>
for Men to believe and practise in order to their
Attainment of <hi>eternal</hi> Life, are so plainly and
clearly revealed in <hi>Scripture</hi> that there is no <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
teachable</hi> Mind that is <hi>capable</hi> of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>common</hi> Sense, but may from thence receive
<hi>full</hi> Information of them upon <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>
Enquiry. And though in <hi>some</hi> Texts these
<hi>Necessaries</hi> are not so plainly proposed as in <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
yet in <hi>some</hi> Text or <hi>other</hi> they are all of
them so plainly proposed that no Man can read
the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and still be <hi>ignorant</hi> of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being wilfully <hi>blind;</hi> for which there is no
Remedy either <hi>in</hi> the Scripture, or <hi>out</hi> of it. And
this I shall endeavour to prove,
<list>
                  <item>1. From the <hi>express</hi> Testimony of <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. From the <hi>avowed</hi> Design of writing the

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. From the <hi>express</hi> Testimony of <hi>Scripture</hi> it is
evident, that in all Things <hi>necessary</hi> to Salvation
at least the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n.</hi> For to be
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:63657:196"/>
sure if in any thing the <hi>Scripture</hi> be <hi>plain,</hi> it is in
those Things that are most <hi>necessary</hi> to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and known; and therefore if it be <hi>obscure</hi> in
these Things, we may reasonably presume it is
<hi>plain</hi> in nothing: But that it is in many Things
plain and easy to be understood, is evident from
its <hi>own</hi> Testimony: For thus of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law
it is expresly affirmed by <hi>Moses, This Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which I command thee this day, it is not hidden
from thee, neither is it far off, Deut.</hi> 30. 11. Where <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
speaks not only of the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> which
consisting for the most part of Laws of Nature,
are upon that Account more <hi>easy</hi> to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
but of all the Commandments of <hi>Moses</hi> in
general, whether <hi>Ceremonial, Iudicial,</hi> or <hi>Natural.</hi>
For so, <hi>v. 16. This Commandment,</hi> we find, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
as well the Statutes and Judgments, as the
Commandments of the Law, all which must take
in the whole <hi>Mosaick</hi> Institution. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
<hi>Ps. 119. 105. David</hi> calls this <hi>Word of God,
a lamp unto his feet, and a light unto his path;</hi>
which how could it be if it did not burn <hi>clear</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to guide and direct him? and if it did,
then to be sure it burnt clear enough to direct
him in those Things wherein it was most <hi>necessary</hi>
for him to be directed. Again in the 19th <hi>Ps.</hi> 7, 8.
we are told, that <hi>the Testimony of the Lord is sure,
making wise the simple;</hi> and that <hi>the Commandment
of the Lord is pure, enlightning the eyes.</hi> But how can
any Law make the <hi>simple, wise,</hi> or enlighten the
Eyes of Men, unless it be so plainly and clearly
delivered as that the <hi>simple</hi> may be capable of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending,
and the Eyes of Men of discerning
the Sense of it? I know it is objected by <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:63657:196"/>
that these Words do only imply that this
Law indeed being understood, doth enlighten
Mens Eyes, and direct their Practice; but by no
means that it is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>easy</hi> to be understood.
But this is a <hi>meer</hi> Cavil; for it's plain that it is by
understanding the Law, that the <hi>simple</hi> are made
<hi>wise,</hi> and the Eyes of Men enlightned. If therefore
this Law be so <hi>obscure</hi> in its self as that it cannot
make it self understood by all that sincerely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into it, how is it <hi>possible</hi> that it should make
them <hi>wise,</hi> or enlighten the Eyes of their Minds?
But it's plain that the Intent of those Passages of
<hi>David</hi> was to excite, and encourage Men to study
and observe the Law: But what though the Law
makes the <hi>simple,</hi> wise, when they understand it?
what Encouragement is this for the <hi>simple</hi> to
study it, if it be so <hi>obscure</hi> that they cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it? And since they must understand it
before they can observe it, what Encouragement
doth this Consideration give them to observe it
that it will make them <hi>wise</hi> when they understand
it, if it be not plain enough for them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it? But then that forecited Passage of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
doth in <hi>express</hi> Words contradict this Cavil of
<hi>Bellarmin;</hi> for he tells the People that <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
he gave them was not hidden from them;</hi>
whereas if it had been so obscurely delivered to
them by <hi>Moses,</hi> that upon their <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi>
Enquiry they could not understand it, it is
certain that it had been still hidden from them
how <hi>wise</hi> soever it might make them when they
did understand it: And to say that such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
will make me <hi>wise</hi> when I do understand
it, is no Argument at all that it is not hidden
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:63657:197"/>
from me if it be so obscurely expressed as that
upon my <hi>sincere</hi> Enquiry I am not capable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
it. But that the <hi>Old Testament</hi> at least
in all <hi>necessary</hi> Matters was <hi>plain</hi> enough even to
<hi>common</hi> Capacities, is evident from the <hi>frequent</hi>
Appeals our <hi>Saviour</hi> makes to it in his Contests
with the <hi>Common People</hi> of the <hi>Iews.</hi> Thus in the
Text he bids them, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for they
are they which testify of me;</hi> and in <hi>other</hi> Places,
<hi>What saith the Scripture?</hi> and <hi>doth not the Scripture</hi>
say so and so? Now how <hi>impertinent</hi> would it
have been for our <hi>Saviour</hi> thus to appeal to it at
the Tribunal of the People, if he thought it so
<hi>obscure</hi> that the People were not <hi>capable</hi> of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it? How <hi>trifling</hi> would it be for a Man to
appeal to <hi>Suarez</hi>'s <hi>Metaphysicks</hi> in a Controversy
with a <hi>Plow-man,</hi> or to refer him to <hi>Euclid's Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
for the determining the Bounds and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of a Field?</p>
            <p>And as from what hath been said, 'tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> were
at least in all Necessaries <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> to the
<hi>Iews;</hi> so it is no <hi>less</hi> evident that the <hi>Scripture</hi> of
the <hi>New Testament</hi> are so to <hi>Christians,</hi> since it
gives the same Testimony to it self of its <hi>own</hi>
Clearness, as the <hi>Old Testament</hi> doth. For thus,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2, 3, 4. the Apostle tells us, that they
did not <hi>handle the Word of God deceitfully, but by
manifestation of the Truth, commending themselves to
Mens Consciences in the sight of God. But if our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; in whom
the God of this World hath blinded the Minds of
them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious
Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God, should
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:63657:197"/>
shine unto them.</hi> Supposing then that they wrote
with the same Plainness and Clearness with
which they spake, (which there is no shadow of
Reason to doubt of) then from these Words it
is evident; <hi>First,</hi> That they did neither in their
Preaching nor Writings affect to discourse du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biously
or obscurely, but that their <hi>great</hi> Design
was so to manifest and make known the Truth as
that by their Plainness and Simplicity they might
recommend themselves to the Consciences of all
that heard or read them: <hi>Secondly,</hi> That in Fact
they had in their Sermons and Writings so clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taught the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that if after all it remained
<hi>hidden</hi> or <hi>obscure</hi> to any, it was only to such as
were <hi>lost</hi> and <hi>irrecoverable. Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>that</hi>
which render'd the <hi>Gospel</hi> which they had taught
and written, <hi>hidden</hi> or <hi>obscure</hi> to such, was not
the Obscurity either of the Matter which they
taught, or of their Manner of teaching it, but
their own <hi>worldly</hi> Affections which blinded their
Eyes, and hinder'd them from seeing that which
in it self was illustriously <hi>visible.</hi> Which is an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable</hi>
Evidence of the Clearness and Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Scriptures of the <hi>New Testament</hi> in all
<hi>necessary</hi> Things; for if they are <hi>clear</hi> to all but
such as wilfully shut their Eyes against them,
they are as <hi>clear</hi> as they need be to <hi>honest</hi> and
<hi>teachable</hi> Minds; for there is nothing can be clear
enough to such, as are not willing to understand.
And accordingly the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which the Apostle
calls <hi>the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation,</hi> is
said to have <hi>appeared,</hi> or shone forth, <hi>to all Men;
teaching us, that denying Vngodliness and worldly
Lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:63657:198"/>
this present World, Tit.</hi> 2. 11. Now if the <hi>Gospel</hi>
did shine forth unto all Men, it must be in the
<hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Discourses</hi> of those that had preached
it to the World; and if they <hi>so</hi> preached it as
that it shone forth to all Men, they must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
have preached it very plainly and clearly:
Either therefore it was wrote as it was preached,
or it was not; if it was not, it was not wrote
truly and sincerely; if it was, it was wrote very
plainly, so as to make it appear and shine forth to
all that read it. 'Tis true, there are some Things
<hi>obscure</hi> both in the <hi>Old Scriptures</hi> and <hi>New;</hi> but
then these are such Things as are no Parts of the
<hi>Necessaries</hi> and <hi>Essentials</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> such Things
as Men may be safely <hi>ignorant</hi> of, or be <hi>mistaken</hi>
about, without any Hazard of their <hi>eternal</hi> Life.
For all that the <hi>fore-cited</hi> Testimonies prove is
only this, that <hi>that true Religion</hi> by which <hi>God</hi>
governs the Faith and Manners of Men, is so far
forth as it is <hi>necessary</hi> to be believed and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
plainly and clearly revealed to them in the
<hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> But besides this, all Men agree
there are a <hi>great</hi> many <hi>other</hi> Things revealed in
<hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> which, because they are not <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
for all Men to understand, are many of them
not so plainly revealed as that all Men may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
them. But since the <hi>Scripture</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to teach and instruct Men, to be sure it teaches
them most plainly that which is most <hi>necessary</hi> for
them to know; and therefore since there are
some Things plainly taught in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to any one that reads it, to be sure among
these Things are contained all that is <hi>necessary</hi> for
Men to know and understand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:63657:198"/>
2. From the <hi>avowed</hi> Design of writing the
<hi>Scripture</hi> it is also evident that in all Things <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
it is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear.</hi> For thus concerning the
<hi>Old Testament,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that <hi>whatsoever
things were writtenafore time, were written for our
learning; that we through patience and comfort of the
Scriptures might have hope, Rom.</hi> 15. 4. And if
they were written for our Learning and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to be sure they were so written as to teach
and instruct us, that is, plainly and clearly, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
as to those Things wherein we have most
need to be instructed. And then as for the <hi>New
Testament,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells his <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that
the Reason of his writing his <hi>Gospel</hi> was that
he might know the certainty of those Things that
were surely believed among <hi>Christians,</hi> and
wherein he himself had been instructed; And if
it were to assertain us of the Principles of <hi>Chrsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
that he wrote his <hi>Gospel,</hi> certainly he would
take care to write it after such a Manner as that
those that read it might understand it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he must run counter to his <hi>own</hi> Design.
Thus also St. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, that he wrote his <hi>Gospel</hi>
that Men might <hi>believe that Iesus is the Christ the
Son of God;</hi> but how could his <hi>Gospel</hi> induce Men
to believe This, unless it be so <hi>written</hi> as that
Men may understand it? And so also for his
Epistles he tells us, that he wrote them that <hi>they
that believed in Iesus might know that they have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life, and that they may believe,</hi> or continue
to believe, <hi>on the Name of the Son of God:</hi> And if
this were his End, to be sure he would take care
to write so as that they might understand; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
how could they know by his Writing that
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:63657:199"/>
they had <hi>eternal Life,</hi> or be moved thereby to
continue to believe on the name of Jesus? For
there is nothing can create in Men either Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or Faith, but what they understand. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore the <hi>great</hi> End of Writing the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
was to instruct the World in the <hi>great</hi> Things
of <hi>Religion,</hi> either we must say that both the
Writers of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> that
inspired them were <hi>defective</hi> in Skill, or in Care
so to write as to obtain this End; or that their
Writings are an <hi>effectual</hi> Means to obtain it, which
it is <hi>impossible</hi> for them to be, unless they are <hi>plain</hi>
and <hi>clear</hi> as to the <hi>great</hi> Things of <hi>Religion.</hi> In
short every <hi>wise</hi> Agent pursues his End by the
most <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> Means; and I would fain
know whether to write plainly or obscurely be
the most <hi>proper</hi> Means to instruct Men by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
if to write plainly, then either the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
wrote so, or they were not <hi>wise</hi> Agents,
since to instruct was the <hi>great</hi> End of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
The most <hi>natural</hi> Way of conveying to
Mens Minds the Notices of Things is by Words
either <hi>spoken</hi> or <hi>written,</hi> and seeing whatsoever can
be <hi>spoken</hi> in <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> Words may be
<hi>written</hi> in the same Words, there can be no
doubt but those Words will be as <hi>intelligible</hi>
when they are <hi>written,</hi> as when they are <hi>spoken;</hi>
for why should the same Words be more <hi>obscure</hi>
when conveyed to us by our Eyes, than when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to us by our Ears? Seeing then the Sense
of <hi>Scripture</hi> may be as plainly conveyed by Words
<hi>written</hi> as by Words <hi>spoken,</hi> and seeing that even
those who deny the Plainness of <hi>Scripture</hi> do yet
allow that the Sense of it may be plainly convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:63657:199"/>
by Words spoken, or which is the same thing,
<hi>Oral Tradition;</hi> if the <hi>Scripture</hi> be not <hi>plain</hi> it
can be resolved into no <hi>other</hi> Reason but this that
<hi>God</hi> would not have it so; for there is no Doubt
but he could have <hi>spoken</hi> as plainly as Men, and
have <hi>written</hi> as plainly as he spoke; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if he hath not done so, it was because he
would not; but to say that he would not write
those Things plainly which he thought <hi>necessary</hi>
for all Men to know, and which he wrote on
purpose that all Men might know, is to say that
he would, and would not at the same time; or
that he wrote them on purpose that Men might
know them, and yet that he wrote so as that they
might not know them.</p>
            <p>3. From the <hi>frequent</hi> Commands <hi>God</hi> lays up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us to read the <hi>Scripture</hi> it is also evident, that
in all <hi>necessary</hi> Things it is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear.</hi> That
<hi>God</hi> doth not only allow, but will and require us
to read the <hi>Scripture,</hi> I shall shew at large here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
when I come to treat of <hi>searching the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
Supposing therefore at present the Thing
to be <hi>true,</hi> I would fain know to what Purpose
should <hi>God</hi> require us to read the <hi>Scripture,</hi> if in
those things which are <hi>necessary</hi> for Men to know
and believe, it be not <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelligible.</hi> Doth
<hi>God</hi> require us to read it, for the sake of reading
it, or for the sake of understanding it? If the
<hi>former,</hi> reading any <hi>other</hi> Book might as well
have answered God's End as reading the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
because reading is reading whatsoever it
be that we read; if the <hi>later,</hi> then either the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> as to all those Things
which he requires us to understand, or he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:63657:200"/>
us to read it in vain. For to what Purpose
should we read that we may understand, if that
which we are to read be not <hi>plain</hi> enough to be
understood by us? As for Instance; the <hi>Bereans,
Acts</hi> 17. 11. are highly commended for <hi>searching
the Scriptures daily;</hi> now I would fain know was
this a Virtue in them, or was it not? If not, why
are they commended for it; if it were, it was
certainly their Duty. What was the Intendment
of it; was it only that they might be expert
Readers? Why are they so commended for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> above any <hi>other</hi> Book, seeing
that reading any <hi>other</hi> Book would have done as
well for that Purpose as reading the <hi>Scriptures?</hi>
But the Text it self tells us that the Intendment of
their reading the <hi>Scripture</hi> was <hi>that they might know
whether those things were so</hi> or no which St. <hi>Paul</hi>
had preached to them; but how should they know
this by reading the <hi>Scripture,</hi> if the <hi>Scripture</hi>
which they read were not <hi>plain</hi> enough to be
understood by them? Again St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives this
as a <hi>great</hi> Commendation of his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> that
<hi>from a Child he had known the Holy Scriptures;</hi>
whence by the Way we may learn that it is not
so <hi>great</hi> a Reproach to our <hi>Church</hi> as the <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists</hi>
intend it, for that we permit <hi>Women</hi> and
<hi>Children, Tinkers</hi> and <hi>Cobblers</hi> to read the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
But I pray, what was the Meaning of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s
knowing the <hi>Holy Scripture from a Child?</hi> Was it
that he knew the Words of it only, or the Sense
of it also? If the <hi>former,</hi> a <hi>Parrot</hi> may be taught
as much as <hi>Timothy</hi> had learned, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deserve as <hi>high</hi> a Commendation as he; if the
<hi>later,</hi> then it seems the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>plain</hi> enough
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:63657:200"/>
               <hi>for a well-disposed</hi> Child to know the Sense of it so
far forth at least as it is <hi>necessary</hi> to be known,
and this is as much as we desire. If therefore
<hi>God</hi> requires us to read the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as <hi>Timothy</hi>
did, to the End that we may know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it as he did, then either we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Sense of it by reading it, or else <hi>God</hi>
requires us to read it in vain.</p>
            <p>4. And lastly; From the Obligation we lie
under upon Pain of Damnation to believe and
receive those <hi>Necessaries</hi> to Salvation contained
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> it is also evident that as to all those
<hi>Necessaries</hi> it is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear.</hi> That we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to believe under Pain of Damnation all that
the <hi>Scripture</hi> proposes as <hi>necessary</hi> to our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is agreed on all hands; but how can Men be
justly obliged to believe such Things as are <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,</hi>
and <hi>doubtful,</hi> and <hi>uncertain,</hi> and of which
they can have no <hi>certain</hi> Knowledge? Either the
<hi>Necessaries</hi> to Salvation must be plainly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expres'd in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or we have not <hi>sufficient</hi>
Reason to believe them; and to say <hi>God</hi> will
damn us for not believing those Things which
he hath not given us <hi>sufficient</hi> Reason to believe,
is to charge him with the most <hi>outragious</hi> Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Injustice. But we are told that though
<hi>God</hi> hath not clearly revealed to us in <hi>Scripture</hi>
those Things which he hath obliged us to believe
upon Pain of Damnation, yet he hath left us <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi>
Reason to believe them; for he hath left
us to the Conduct of an <hi>infallible Church,</hi> that is to
say, of the <hi>present Church of Rome</hi> in all Ages,
whom he hath <hi>authorized</hi> to explain and define
to us all Things that are <hi>necessary</hi> to be believed,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:63657:201"/>
which we are to receive upon her Authority,
and not upon the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> so that if we firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe what She defines and proposes to us,
we are sure to believe all Things that are <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
to be believed. Now in Answer to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
which indeed is the <hi>great</hi> Foundation
that the Faith of those of the <hi>present Church of
Rome</hi> relies on, I desire these Things may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
considered.</p>
            <p>1. That before we can reasonably rely upon
the Authority of the <hi>present Church of Rome</hi> in
defining and proposing to us the Articles of our
Faith, there are <hi>sundry</hi> Things that we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
upon the Authority of <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That these Things which we must believe
from <hi>Scripture</hi> before we can rely upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>that Church,</hi> are at <hi>least</hi> as obscurely
revealed in <hi>Scripture</hi> as any <hi>other</hi> Article of our
<hi>Christian</hi> Faith.</p>
            <p>3. That after all these Things, upon our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
on that <hi>Church</hi>'s Authority, we are left to
the <hi>same</hi> or <hi>greater</hi> Uncertainties than upon our
relying upon the Authority of <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. That in relying upon the Authority of
<hi>Scripture</hi> we are left to no <hi>other</hi> Uncertainties
than just what is <hi>necessary</hi> to render our Faith
<hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>rewardable;</hi> whereas by relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Authority of <hi>that Church,</hi> supposing it to
be a <hi>certain</hi> Ground, as it is pretended, our Faith
would have <hi>little</hi> or <hi>nothing</hi> of <hi>Virtue</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>1. That before we can reasonably rely upon
the Authority of <hi>that Church</hi> in defining and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:63657:201"/>
to us the Articles of our Faith, there
are <hi>sundry</hi> Things that we must believe upon the
Authority of <hi>Scripture.</hi> As for Instance; we
must in the <hi>first</hi> Place believe that there is a
<hi>Church,</hi> or Society of <hi>Christians</hi> separated from
the World, or incorporated by a <hi>peculiar Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
Charter. Now whether there be such a
<hi>Church</hi> or no is a Question that must be resolved
by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and not by the <hi>Church;</hi> because
to believe that there is a <hi>Church</hi> because the
<hi>Church</hi> saith there is a <hi>Church,</hi> is to take that for
granted which is the Thing in Question. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
We must believe that this <hi>Church</hi> hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to define and propose to us the Articles
of our Faith, which must also for the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be believed on the Authority of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and not of the <hi>Church.</hi> For to believe that
there is a <hi>Church</hi> that hath Authority to propose
to us the Articles of our Faith, is to believe that
there is a <hi>Church</hi> which we are obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
and how can I believe this upon the
<hi>Church</hi>'s Authority, unless I can believe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I do believe it? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Before we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon this <hi>Church</hi>'s Authority in defining and
proposing to us the Articles of our Faith, we
must believe that this <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>infallible;</hi> for if
she be not <hi>infallible,</hi> how is it <hi>consistent</hi> with the
Truth of <hi>God</hi> to oblige us to believe Her, seeing
in so doing he must oblige us whensoever She
errs to believe her Errors? but that She is <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi>
is not to be believed upon her <hi>own</hi> Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for then her <hi>infallible</hi> Authority must be the
Reason of our Belief that She is <hi>infallible,</hi> that is,
we must believe her <hi>infallible,</hi> because we believe
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:63657:202"/>
her <hi>infallible.</hi> Seeing then we cannot believe it
on her <hi>own</hi> Authority, if we believe it at all, it
must be upon the Authority of <hi>Scripture. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
Before we can rely upon the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>'s
Authority to define to us the Articles of our
Faith, we must believe the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to be
this <hi>infallible</hi> Church: But seeing this is no <hi>self-evident</hi>
Principle, we must have some <hi>other</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
besides her self to induce us to believe it;
and what else can that be but <hi>Scripture?</hi> We are
told indeed by some of her <hi>greatest Divines,</hi> that
there are <hi>certain</hi> Marks and Notes of a <hi>true Church</hi>
peculiar to the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> by which we are
obliged to believe Her the <hi>true Church;</hi> such as
<hi>Antiquity, Vniversality, Holiness of Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c.
But seeing no Doctrine can be <hi>holy</hi> that is not
<hi>true,</hi> we must be satisfied that <hi>that Church</hi> is <hi>true</hi>
before we can know that it is <hi>holy;</hi> so that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we can reasonably submit to her Athority,
we must be very well assured that her Doctrine
is <hi>true,</hi> and this we cannot be assured of by her
Authority, because that as yet is the Matter in
Qustion; and therefore we can be no otherwise
assured of it, but only by the Authority of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
and when we are assured beforehand by
the Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi> that her Doctrines are
<hi>true,</hi> her Authority comes <hi>too</hi> late to assure us.
Seeing therefore it is evident that there are
some, if not all the Articles of the <hi>Roman Faith</hi>
that must be known and believed by us upon the
Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi> before we can safely rely
upon her Authority to define them to us, how
can we be obliged to settle our Faith upon her
Authority, when as before we can reasonably
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:63657:202"/>
admit her Authority, we must believe several of
the Articles of our Faith upon the Authority of
<hi>Scripture?</hi> For I would fain know, are these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith, or no? <hi>That there is a Church;
that this Church hath Authority to define the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of our Faith, and that in so defining, this Church
is infallible, and that this infallible Church is the
Church of Rome?</hi> If they be, as they themselves
own they are, then there are some Articles it
seems that must be believed without the <hi>Church</hi>'s
Authority upon the <hi>single</hi> Authority of <hi>Scripture;</hi>
and if <hi>some,</hi> why not <hi>all?</hi> why should not the
<hi>Scripture</hi> be as <hi>sufficient</hi> to <hi>authorize</hi> us to believe
the Rest as these, since its Authority is as <hi>great</hi>
in <hi>one</hi> Text as in <hi>onother?</hi> Especially considering</p>
            <p>2. That these Things which we must believe
from <hi>Scripture</hi> before we can rely upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> are at least as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely
revealed in <hi>Scripture</hi> as any <hi>other</hi> Article
of our <hi>Christian</hi> Faith. The <hi>great</hi> Reason urged
by the <hi>Romanists</hi> against our Relyance upon the
<hi>Scripture</hi> for our Faith is the Obscurity of it;
and if this be a <hi>good</hi> Reason it proves a <hi>great</hi> deal
more than they would have it, <hi>viz.</hi> that we
ought not to rely upon <hi>Scripture</hi> even for those
Articles, without believing of which we can
have no <hi>sufficient</hi> Ground to rely upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of their <hi>Church.</hi> For I would fain know,
is it <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>plain</hi> from Scripture that the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Catholick Church</hi> of every Age hath Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to define the Articles of Faith, and that in
all its Definitions it is <hi>infallible?</hi> and that the
<hi>present Church of Rome</hi> is this <hi>Catholick Church?</hi>
If so; how come those Texts upon which those
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:63657:203"/>
Articles are founded to be understood in a
quite <hi>different</hi> Sense, not only by us, but by the
<hi>greatest</hi> Part of the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> as hath
been abundantly proved by <hi>Protestant</hi> Writers?
Supposing that we should be so <hi>blinded</hi> by our
Partiality to <hi>our own</hi> Tenets as to misapprehend
<hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> Expressions of <hi>Scripture,</hi> it is very
<hi>strange</hi> methinks that the <hi>Fathers</hi> who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
engaged in the Controversy, and so could
not be biass'd either <hi>one</hi> way or <hi>t'other,</hi> should
yet misapprehend them too. What is this but
to say that let Men be never so <hi>indifferent,</hi> yet
they may be easily mistaken in the Sense of very
<hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> Expressions; and if so, what sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
either Speaking or Writing? But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to some Instances; will any <hi>modest</hi> Man in
the World affirm that the <hi>Church of Rome's infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility</hi>
in defining Articles of Faith to all <hi>succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Generations is more plainly exprest in those
Words of our <hi>Saviour, Thou art Peter, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Rock will I build my Church,</hi> than the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi>
of our <hi>Saviour</hi> is in the Beginning of the
<hi>first</hi> Chaper of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Gospel, where it is
expresly affirmed that he is <hi>God,</hi> whereas in
the <hi>other</hi> there is not the least mention either of
the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> or of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> or defining
Articles of Faith? Why may we not then as
well depend upon the <hi>one</hi> Text for the Article
of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s <hi>Divinity,</hi> as upon the <hi>other</hi> for
that of the <hi>Church of Rome's Infallibility?</hi> Again,
are there not <hi>innumerable</hi> Texts of Scripture
wherein the Articles of <hi>Remission of Sin, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the Dead, the last Iudgment, and
the World to come</hi> are at least as plainly exprest as
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:63657:203"/>
the <hi>present Church of Rome's Infallibility</hi> is in any
of those Texts that are urged in the Defence of
it? and therefore if we believe the <hi>later</hi> upon
the Authority of <hi>Scripture,</hi> notwithstanding the
pretended Obscurity of it, why may we not as
well upon the same Authority believe all the
<hi>former,</hi> since the <hi>former</hi> are at least as plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
as the <hi>later?</hi> Either therefore the <hi>Scripture</hi>
is <hi>plain</hi> enough to be relyed upon as to <hi>this</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the <hi>Church of Rome's Infallibility,</hi> or it is
not; if it be not, we have no Ground for our
Dependence upon the Authority of her Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Proposals; if it be, it's <hi>plain</hi> enough
to be relyed upon in all other <hi>necessary</hi> Articles
of Faith, since these are all as plainly at least
expres'd in <hi>Scripture</hi> as that. For if we may not
rely upon <hi>Scripture</hi> because it is not <hi>plain,</hi> then
where it is equally <hi>plain,</hi> it is equally to be rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on.</p>
            <p>3. That when we come to rely upon this
<hi>Church</hi>'s Authority, we are exposed to far <hi>greater</hi>
Uncertainties than while we relied upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>Scripture.</hi> For in the <hi>first</hi> place, we
are of all sides agreed that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>infallible,</hi>
and that <hi>such</hi> and <hi>such</hi> Writings are Parts of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;</hi>
and therefore are absolutely <hi>secure</hi> that if
we follow the <hi>true</hi> Sense of it, it cannot mislead
us. But the much <hi>greater</hi> Part of <hi>Christians</hi> deny
that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is infallible; even the
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> it self owns the Authority we rely
on to be <hi>infallible,</hi> but all <hi>Christians</hi> all the World
over, besides those of her <hi>own</hi> Communion, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow
<hi>hers</hi> to be so; and to forsake our Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon an <hi>Infallibility</hi> which <hi>all</hi> own, to rely
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:63657:204"/>
upon an <hi>Infallibility</hi> which but <hi>few</hi> in Comparison
admit, is certainly a very <hi>dangerous</hi> Venture.
And then <hi>Secondly,</hi> As for the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
we are <hi>certain</hi> where to find it; <hi>viz.</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Text, and in every Proposition therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
which being all the <hi>Word of God,</hi> must be
all <hi>infallible.</hi> But as for the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church,</hi> as they have handled the Matter, it
is almost as <hi>difficult</hi> to find as to prove it; some
cry, lo it is here; and some, lo it is there;
some place it in the <hi>Pope</hi> only, others in the <hi>Pope</hi>
and his <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Cardinals;</hi> some in the <hi>Pope</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding
in a <hi>General Council,</hi> others in a <hi>General
Council</hi> whether the <hi>Pope</hi> preside in it, or no. So
that in this <hi>Church,</hi> it seems, there is <hi>Infallibility</hi>
somewhere, but what are we the better for it if
we know not where to find it? If we go to the
<hi>Pope</hi> for it; there have been <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three Popes</hi> at
once that have decreed against <hi>one another;</hi> and
therefore <hi>one</hi> or <hi>t'other</hi> of them to be sure were
mistaken. How then shall we know which is
the <hi>true infallible</hi> one? And when I have found
the <hi>true Pope,</hi> others tell me I am not yet arrived
at the Seat of <hi>Infallibility</hi> until I have found him
in his <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Cardinals;</hi> and when I have found
him here I am still to seek, seeing I find the
same <hi>Pope (Eugenius the Fourth</hi> for Instance) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing
<hi>one</hi> Thing in his <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and
the quite <hi>contrary</hi> in a <hi>general Council;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I am sure he could not be <hi>infallible</hi> in both.
Therefore others send me to the <hi>Pope</hi> in a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council;</hi> but when I come thither, I find my
self at a Loss again; because I meet with several
Instances of <hi>one Pope</hi>'s defining <hi>one</hi> Thing in <hi>one
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:63657:204"/>
General Council,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> Pope, the quite <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>
in <hi>another;</hi> and therefore in <hi>one</hi> or <hi>t'other
Council</hi> I am sure, the <hi>one</hi> or <hi>t'other Pope</hi> was mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.
And as for <hi>General Councils</hi> themselves
there are <hi>sundry</hi> of them which are owned by <hi>some,</hi>
and rejected by <hi>others</hi> of the <hi>principal</hi> Doctors of
the <hi>Roman Communion.</hi> And even when <hi>Councils</hi>
are legally assembled, there are so many <hi>nice</hi>
Disputes among them, what it is that makes
them <hi>General,</hi> and when it is that they act <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliariter</hi>
as they call it, that is, so as to render
their Decrees perpetually and universally obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging;
that though we were resolved to build
our Faith upon the Authority of <hi>this Church,</hi> yet
if we will use that Caution in believing that we
ought to do in a Matter of so <hi>great</hi> Moment, we
should find our selves involved in <hi>greater</hi> Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties
concerning these Things than we are
concerning the Sense even of the most <hi>difficult</hi>
Places of <hi>Scripture.</hi> But then <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When we
are pass'd over all these Difficulties we are still
at as <hi>great</hi> a Loss to understand what is the Sense
of the <hi>Church</hi> to be believed by us, as what is the
Sense of <hi>Scripture.</hi> For the <hi>Church</hi> hath no <hi>other</hi>
way to deliver her Sense to us but either by <hi>Oral
Tradition,</hi> that is, by Word of Mouth; or by
<hi>Writing;</hi> If She deliver her Sense to me by <hi>Oral
Tradition,</hi> how can I know what that is who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard Her speak either in its <hi>diffused</hi> Body,
or in a <hi>General Council,</hi> or in any <hi>other</hi> Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative;
unless it be that of my own <hi>Parish-Priest</hi>
perhaps, who for all I know may be <hi>Ignorant</hi> or
<hi>Heretical,</hi> and so either not understand himself
the Church's <hi>Oral Tradition,</hi> or wilfully pervert
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:63657:205"/>
it to a <hi>contrary</hi> Meaning? And if the <hi>Church</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
her Sense to me by Writing, as She hath
done in the <hi>written</hi> Decrees of her <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>
must I read over all her Decrees? How
should I do that who understand not so much as
the Languages in which they are written?
Or suppose they were Translated, how shall I
know that they are faithfully render'd any more
than I do that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is so? But suppose I
were <hi>certain</hi> of this, and should thereupon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to read them, alass, I find in them a <hi>great</hi>
many <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>dubious</hi> Expressions, yea, and
at least <hi>seeming</hi> Contradictions to <hi>each other;</hi> how
then can I be more <hi>certain</hi> of the <hi>true</hi> Sense of
these Writings than of the Sense of the Writings
of <hi>Scripture?</hi> But you will say, the <hi>Church</hi> hath
digested her Sense of all her Articles of Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>plain Creed</hi> and <hi>Catechism, viz.</hi> that of the
<hi>Council of Trent,</hi> whereby the <hi>plainest</hi> Reader may
without any <hi>laborious</hi> Enquiries be readily instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
what he ought to believe. This I confess
is something; but as for those Articles of Faith
wherein <hi>We</hi> and the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> are agreed,
we find them as plainly expressed in <hi>Scripture</hi> as
in that <hi>Creed</hi> and <hi>Catechism;</hi> and therefore we
have Reason to believe that if those Articles
wherein we disagree had ever been intended for
Articles of Faith, they would have been as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
express'd there as these; but 'tis no wonder
we should not find them plainly express'd <hi>there,</hi>
when we cannot find them express'd <hi>there</hi> at all.
But do we not find that the Scriptures even in the
<hi>plainest</hi> Expressions of Articles of Faith have yet
been perverted by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> into a <hi>contrary</hi>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:63657:205"/>
Meaning? And what then? Are not the Words
of <hi>Councils</hi> as liable to be perverted into a <hi>contrary</hi>
Meaning as the Words of <hi>Scripture?</hi> For do not
the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors differ as much about the Sense
of their <hi>Councils,</hi> as we do about the Sense of
our <hi>Scriptures?</hi> Yea and have we not a <hi>notorius</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of it at this very Day? For what can be
more <hi>contrary</hi> than <hi>Belarmine</hi>'s Exposition of the
<hi>Trent Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Condom</hi>'s? And yet
both allowed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> who by the Authority
of that <hi>Council</hi> is made <hi>sole</hi> Arbitrator of the Sense
of it. But then <hi>Fourthly</hi> and lastly, As to the
Sense of <hi>Scripture</hi> our Reliance on the Authority
of that <hi>Church</hi> leaves us at as <hi>great</hi> an Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as it found us. For where the <hi>Scripture</hi> designs
to speak plainly, as it doth in all Things <hi>necessary</hi>
to salvation, the <hi>Church</hi> cannot speak <hi>plainer;</hi>
and therefore there we may understand the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
as well without the <hi>Church</hi> as with it; but
where it doth not speak plainly, the <hi>Church of
Rome</hi> hath left us no <hi>infallible</hi> Commentary where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to understand it; so that where the <hi>Scripture</hi> is
<hi>plain</hi> She hath not made it <hi>plainer,</hi> and where it is
<hi>obscure</hi> She hath left it as <hi>obscure</hi> as ever: So that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all the Noise that is made of <hi>Infallibility</hi> her
Doctors are fain to apply themselves to the same
Methods of Understanding <hi>Scripture,</hi> that is, to
consult the Sense of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and compare Text
with Text, and the like that we <hi>fallible</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
do; and when they have done all, are as <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
to be mistaken as we. Nay they themselves
confess that even <hi>General Councils</hi> themselves may
be mistaken in their Applications of <hi>Scripture;</hi>
that is, that they may misapply them to <hi>wrong</hi>
Purposes, which they cannot do without mistak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:63657:206"/>
the Sense of them, of which there are a <hi>great</hi>
many <hi>notorious</hi> Instances in the <hi>second Council of
Nice;</hi> which to prove it the Duty of <hi>Christians</hi> to
worship <hi>Images,</hi> urges God's taking Clay, and
making Man after his <hi>own</hi> Image; and likewise
that of <hi>Esay, There shall be a Sign and Testimony
to the Lord in the Land of Egypt;</hi> and also those
Passages of <hi>David, Confession and Beauty is before
him. Lord I have loved the beauty of thy House. O
Lord my Face hath sought for thee. O Lord I will
seek after thy Countenance. O Lord, the light of
thy Countenance is sealed over us.</hi> And from that
Passage, <hi>As we have seen, so have we heard,</hi> they
argue that there must be Images to look on; and
because it is said, <hi>God is marvellous in his Saints,</hi>
they conclude that the <hi>Church</hi> must be deck'd
with Pictures: And from <hi>No man lighteth a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
and putteth it under a bushel,</hi> they wisely infer
that <hi>Images</hi> must be set upon the Altar; All
which are as <hi>remote</hi> from their Sense as the <hi>first</hi>
Verse of the <hi>first</hi> Chapter of <hi>Genesis.</hi> What <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
Certainty have they with their <hi>Infallibility</hi> than
we without it? We can know as well the Sense
of <hi>plain</hi> Texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as of <hi>plain</hi> Texts of
<hi>Councils,</hi> or <hi>Creeds,</hi> or <hi>Catechisms;</hi> and we can
as easily pervert the Sense of the <hi>one</hi> as of the <hi>other:</hi>
And as for those that are not <hi>plain,</hi> even <hi>General
Councils</hi> you see for all their <hi>Infallibility</hi> may be
mistaken about them as well as we. So that
when all comes to all, by forsaking the <hi>infallible</hi>
Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi> to rely upon the <hi>infallible</hi>
Authority of <hi>that Church,</hi> we are so far from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving
at a <hi>greater</hi> Certainty of Faith that we are
involved in <hi>greater</hi> Uncertainties than ever. But
then,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="403" facs="tcp:63657:206"/>
4. And lastly, in relying upon the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Scripture</hi> we are left to no <hi>other</hi> Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
than just what are <hi>necessary</hi> to render our
Faith <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>rewardable;</hi> whereas by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
upon the Authority of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>
(supposing it were as <hi>sure</hi> a Ground of Faith as
it is pretended) our Faith would have <hi>little</hi> or
<hi>nothing</hi> of Virtue in it. It is pretended (though
falsly you see) that <hi>that Church</hi>'s Authority is so
<hi>sure</hi> a Ground of Faith, that while a Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon it he cannot be mistaken in any <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>
Article of Faith; which in Reality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to no more than this, That while a Man
believes as <hi>that Church</hi> believes, which infallibly
believes all that is <hi>necessary</hi> to Salvation, he infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
believes all that is <hi>necessary</hi> to Salvation;
and it is equally <hi>true,</hi> that while a Man believes
as the <hi>Scripture</hi> teaches, which infallibly teaches
all that is <hi>necessary</hi> to Salvation, he infallibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
all that is <hi>necessary</hi> to Salvation; that is,
both are equally <hi>false.</hi> For no Man can infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
believe either the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Scripture,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Infallibility</hi> exceeds the Capacity of <hi>humane</hi>
Nature; no Man can so believe <hi>either</hi> but that
he may be mistaken, and if he may be mistaken,
its <hi>possible</hi> he may not believe all that is <hi>necessary</hi>
to Salvation, whether he grounds his Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Church</hi> or the <hi>Scripture.</hi> But because this
<hi>Church</hi> pretends so to secure my Faith while I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon her Authority as that I cannot be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
for this very Reason I cannot depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, because I am sure of this, that <hi>God</hi> never
designed for me any such Means of Believing as
should render my Faith <hi>infallible.</hi> For to what
End should he require me to take so much Pains
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:63657:207"/>
and Care to secure my Faith from Errors, if he
hath furnished me with any <hi>certain</hi> Means of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>infallible?</hi> It would be but applying that
Means whatever it is, and my Danger would be
immediately over; and then I need trouble my
Head no further, being now so <hi>secured</hi> as that I
cannot be mistaken; after which it would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>impertinent</hi> methinks for <hi>God</hi> to trouble me
with those <hi>unnecessary</hi> Injunctions <hi>of trying all
Things, and holding fast to that which is good; of
searching the Scriptures, and trying the Spirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be of God; and taking heed whilst I stand
lest I fall.</hi> What need a Man be at the Expence
of all this Labour and Caution, whose Faith is
already secured? Seeing therefore <hi>God</hi> requires
these Things at our Hands, it is a <hi>plain</hi> Case that
he never intended us any Method how to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi>
in believing; and therefore since the
<hi>Church of Rome's</hi> Authority is pretended to be
such a Method, for that Reason it ought to be
rejected. It's plain that <hi>God</hi> intended that our
Faith should be a Grace and a Virtue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that it should be an Act of our Wills
as well as of our Understandings, which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
the Evidence of it not to be <hi>irresistible;</hi> for
what Virtue is it to believe that the Sun shines
when it glares full in our Eyes? Since therefore
our Faith must be a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi> Assent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such Motives as are <hi>sufficient</hi> to satisfy an <hi>honest</hi>
Mind, but not to compel either an <hi>obstinate</hi> Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
or <hi>self-deceived</hi> Hypocrite; <hi>God</hi> did not
think fit so to secure our Faith as to leave it <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi>
for us to err <hi>damnably;</hi> And, indeed if he
had, it would have been no Virtue in us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>savingly;</hi> for what Virtue is it for a Man to
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:63657:207"/>
do that which it is <hi>impossible</hi> for him not to do?
It is <hi>sufficient</hi> that we cannot err damnably in our
Faith without some <hi>damnable</hi> Fault in our Wills;
but if we either refuse to enquire into this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
for what is <hi>necessary</hi> for us to believe,
or will only enquire into it with a Mind that is
byass'd with <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>sinful</hi> Prejudices, or will
not submit our Understandings to it upon the
<hi>clearest</hi> Conviction, there is no doubt but we
may be <hi>ignorant,</hi> and we may be deceived in
Things of the <hi>greatest</hi> Moment, and it is but
<hi>just</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> that we should: And if notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Faults we could not err, for God's sake
what Virtue would it be to be <hi>Orthodox?</hi> But if
with <hi>honest, humble,</hi> and <hi>teachable</hi> Minds we will
diligently enquire into <hi>divine</hi> Revelation, we
shall there find all the <hi>Necessaries</hi> to Salvation so
clearly and plainly proposed to us, that 'twill
be <hi>morally impossible</hi> for us either to be <hi>ignorant</hi> of,
or deceived about them. So that by relying on
<hi>Scripture</hi> you see we are exposed to no <hi>other</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties
than just what are <hi>necessary</hi> to render
our Faith a Virtue; and <hi>God</hi> doth as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
that our Faith should be <hi>vertuous</hi> as that it
should be <hi>Orthodox;</hi> that it should be the Act of
an <hi>honest, humble, diligent,</hi> and <hi>teachable</hi> Mind,
as that it should be extended to all Things <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi>
to Salvation. Now our Faith may be <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi>
without an <hi>infallible</hi> Certainty, but it canot
be <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>rewardable</hi> with it. To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
then do the <hi>Romanists</hi> talk of an <hi>infallible</hi>
certainty in Believing? Is it <hi>reasonable</hi> to expect
more certainty than <hi>God</hi> ever intended to give?
He hath given as much as is <hi>necessary</hi> for <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest</hi>
Minds and no more, and whether <hi>Knaves</hi>
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:63657:208"/>
and <hi>Hypocrites</hi> believe <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi> is of no
<hi>great</hi> Concernment. If therefore our Faith be
<hi>liable</hi> to no <hi>other</hi> Uncertainty than just what is
<hi>necessary</hi> to try our Honesty, that is much <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
for us in Respect of the Virtue of our Faith
than an <hi>infallible</hi> Certainty. Supposing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> were as <hi>infallible</hi>
as it pretends, it is certain that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is
as <hi>infallible</hi> as that; but whether we relie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>one</hi> or <hi>t'other</hi> we are <hi>fallible</hi> still. And could
that <hi>Church</hi> render us as infallibly <hi>certain</hi> as it
pretends, it would thereby preserve indeed the
<hi>Orthodoxy</hi> of our Faith, but then at the same
Time it would destroy the Virtue of it: For
to believe <hi>right</hi> when we cannot believe <hi>wrong</hi>
is <hi>fatal</hi> and <hi>necessary;</hi> but to believe <hi>right</hi> when
through <hi>our own</hi> Default we may believe <hi>wrong,</hi>
this is <hi>virtuous</hi> and <hi>rewardable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By what hath been said therefore, I think
it is sufficiently evident, that it is upon the
<hi>Scripture</hi> we are to relie, and not upon the
<hi>Church,</hi> especially upon the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> for
all Things <hi>necessary</hi> to Salvation; and therefore
since we are obliged to believe these Things
upon Pain of <hi>Eternal</hi> Damnation, it necessarily
follows that they must be <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> and
<hi>Scripture;</hi> otherwise we could not be justly so
obliged to believe them. And thus I have shewn
at large, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is the <hi>great</hi> Rule of
our Faith and Manners, and that as such, it is
both <hi>full</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> as containing in it all Things
<hi>necessary</hi> to Salvation, and proposing them so
plainly and clearly, as that upon an <hi>honest</hi> and
<hi>diligent</hi> Enquiry all Men may find and discover
them.</p>

               <q>Search the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye

            </epigraph>
            <p>WHether these Words are to be rendred
<hi>Indicatively; [Ye do search the Scriptures]</hi>
as some would have them, or <hi>Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
[Search the Scriptures]</hi> as our Translation
renders them, amounts to the same thing; For
if we render them <hi>Indicatively, [Ye do search the
Scriptures]</hi> it is evident, that they are spoken
with Approbation, <hi>Ye do read the Scriptures, and
ye do very well in so doing:</hi> For thus we find the
<hi>Bereans</hi> commended for <hi>Searching the Scriptures,</hi>
and <hi>Timothy,</hi> for <hi>knowing them from a Child.</hi> And
if to Search the <hi>Scripture</hi> be a <hi>commendable</hi> Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
then to be sure our <hi>Saviour</hi> here mentions
it at least with Approbation; and what he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
when done, that to be sure he would
have us do. Whether therefore it be delivered
in the Form of a Command, or of a <hi>bare</hi> Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is <hi>equivalent</hi> to a Command, it being at
least an Assertion of a Thing which he approves,
and consequently would have all Men to Practise.
But because there is a numerous Party in the
<hi>Christian</hi> World which doth not only forbid the
People to Search the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but represents it
as a Practice of very <hi>dangerous</hi> Consequence, it
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:63657:209"/>
is hereby become <hi>necessary</hi> that we should not
only assert, but prove their Obligation to it,
which otherwise would be very <hi>needless,</hi> there
being nothing more <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>evident</hi> in it self.
Now to prove that the People are obliged to
Search and Read the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> I shall as briefly
as I can, argue the Point from these following
Topicks.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. From the Obligations which the <hi>Iews</hi> were
under to Read and Search the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of
the <hi>Old Testament.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. From our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s and his Apostles Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of their Practice in pursuance of this
their Obligation.</item>
               <item>3. From the <hi>great</hi> Design and Intention of
Writing the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. From the Direction of these <hi>Holy Writings</hi>
to the People.</item>
               <item>5. From the <hi>great</hi> Concernment of the People
in the Matters contained in them.</item>
               <item>6. From the <hi>Vniversal</hi> Sense of the <hi>Primitive
Church</hi> in this matter.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. From the <hi>general</hi> Obligation which the
<hi>Iews</hi> were under to Read and Search their
<hi>Scriptures.</hi> For so <hi>God</hi> requires them to <hi>keep the
words which he commanded them, in their Hearts,</hi>
and <hi>to teach them diligently to their Children,</hi> and
<hi>to talk of them as they sat in their Houses, and as
they walked in the way, and when they lay down, and
when they rose up, and to bind them as a sign upon
their hands,</hi> Deut. 6. 6, 7, 8. And elsewhere,
This <hi>book of the Law shall not depart out of thy
mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night,</hi>
               <pb n="409" facs="tcp:63657:209"/>
speaking to the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> in general,
<hi>Ios.</hi> 1. 8. And again, <hi>Ye shall lay up these my words
in your heart and in your soul, that your days may be
multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land
which the Lord sware unto your Fathers to give them,
as the days of heaven upon the earth,</hi> Deut. 11. 18, 21.
And to <hi>meditate on God's Law day and night, David</hi>
makes a Part of the Character of the <hi>Blessed</hi> Man,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 3. Now if they could not keep God's
Laws in their Hearts, as most certainly they could
not; if they could not teach them to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
if they could not talk of them upon all
<hi>just</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> Occasions, and in a word, if they
could not meditate on them day and night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being very well acquainted with them by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Search and Reading them, it is most <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
that to Read and Search into them was their
<hi>indispensable</hi> Duty. Now if there be the same
Reason why <hi>we</hi> should Read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as there
was why the <hi>Iews</hi> should, then the Obligation of
these Commands must extend to <hi>us</hi> as well as to
<hi>them;</hi> because the Reason of the Law is the Law;
but 'tis evident, even beyond Contradiction, that
there is no <hi>good</hi> Reason assignable for the <hi>one,</hi>
which is not of <hi>equal</hi> force for the <hi>other;</hi> and
whatsoever is objected by our Adversaries in
this Point against our Reading the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> is
of <hi>equal</hi> validity against the <hi>Iews</hi> Reading them.
It is Objected, That our Reading them, through
our Incapacity to understand them, must occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
a great many <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Heresies</hi> in the
<hi>Church.</hi> And why should not their Reading them
occasion the same, since neither their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were <hi>larger</hi> than ours, nor their Scriptures
<hi>clearer</hi> and more <hi>intelligible</hi> than ours? It is
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:63657:210"/>
farther objected, that because of the many <hi>ill</hi>
Examples recorded in <hi>Scripture</hi> it is <hi>dangerous</hi> for
the People to read it; because of their Aptness
to be misled and corrupted by Example. But
I beseech you, are there not more <hi>bad</hi> Examples
in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> than in the <hi>New?</hi> And were
not the <hi>Iews</hi> as apt to be corrupted by them as
we <hi>Christians?</hi> And therefore since these Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
do press as much against their reading the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> as ours, it is certain they ought to
keep <hi>both</hi> from it or <hi>neither.</hi> Seeing therefore
notwithstanding these Objections <hi>God</hi> obliged
the <hi>Iews</hi> to read them, it's plain they are not of
Force enough to disoblige us from doing the
same.</p>
            <p>2. From our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of this Practice of the <hi>Iews</hi> in Pursuance
of their Obligation to it, it is also evident that
we are obliged to the same. That the <hi>Common
People</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> did ordinarily read the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
in our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Time, is evident not only
from the Text, <hi>Search the Scriptures</hi> (which if
you take them <hi>Indicatively,</hi> are an <hi>express</hi> Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that they did read them; and if you take
them <hi>Imperatively,</hi> necessarily imply that they
themselves owned that they ought to read them)
but also from those Questions which our <hi>Saviour</hi>
frequently ask'd them in his Conferences with
them; such as, <hi>Have ye not read? Have ye never read
in the Scripture?</hi> And <hi>hath not the Scripture said so</hi>
and <hi>so?</hi> Which Question would be very <hi>imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>
if reading the <hi>Scripture</hi> were not then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
practised by that People. And that even
their <hi>holy</hi> Women were then so well instructed in
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as to be able to instruct their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:63657:210"/>
               <hi>Timothy</hi> is a <hi>signal</hi> Instance, who, though
his <hi>Father</hi> were an <hi>Heathen,</hi> had <hi>known the holy
Scriptures from a Child, 2 Tim.</hi> 3. 10. which Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
he must necessarily have derived from his
<hi>Grand-Mother Lois,</hi> and his <hi>Mother Eunice,</hi> whose
Faith St. <hi>Paul</hi> celebrates; <hi>2 Tim.</hi> 1. 10. And this
Practice of reading the Scriptures which was
so <hi>common</hi> among that People in our Saviour's
time is so far from being discontinued either by
<hi>himself</hi> or his <hi>Apostles,</hi> that it is always mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them with Applause and Approbation.
Thus the <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reans</hi> are commended as a People of a
<hi>nobler</hi> Strain than those of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> because
they <hi>searched the Scriptures daily whether</hi> those
Things which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had preached to them
were so or no. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> is so far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
<hi>Timothy</hi> for medling with the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
whilst he was a <hi>Lay-man,</hi> that he mentions
it to his Honour, <hi>that he had known the Scriptures
from a Child.</hi> And in all those Passages wherein
our <hi>Saviour</hi> takes it for granted that the <hi>Common
People</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> did read the <hi>Scripture,</hi> we have
not the <hi>least</hi> Intimation of his dislike of their
Practice, which we should certainly have had,
had he apprehended it to be either <hi>dangerous</hi> or
<hi>unwarrantable.</hi> Seeing therefore neither our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
nor his <hi>Apostles</hi> do in the <hi>least</hi> disallow of the
<hi>Scriptures</hi> being read by the <hi>Common People,</hi> but
on the contrary do expresly commend it; this is
a <hi>plain</hi> Argument that it was their Intention to
perpetuate the Practice of it to <hi>future</hi> Ages. For
seeing the <hi>Iews</hi> read the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in Obedience
to an <hi>express</hi> Command of <hi>God,</hi> as was shewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
had our <hi>Saviour</hi> intended that they should
not continue it, he would doubtless have repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:63657:211"/>
that Command by some Countermand, which
he was so far from doing that he not only every
where allows of their reading the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
expresly approves and commends it; whereby
he plainly establishes the <hi>Obligation</hi> of that <hi>ancient</hi>
Command in Obedience to which they did read
them.</p>
            <p>3. From the <hi>great</hi> Design and Intention of
Writing the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> it is also evident, that
the <hi>People</hi> are still obliged to Read them. It is
plain that the <hi>great</hi> Design of Writing the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
was to instruct Men in the Knowledge, and
persuade them to the Practice of <hi>True Religion;</hi>
For thus of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament</hi>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That <hi>whatsoever things were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
afore-time, were written for our learning,</hi> Rom.
15. 4. and <hi>for our admonition,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 11.
And as for the <hi>New Testament,</hi> we are told,
That it was written, <hi>that we might believe that
Iesus is the Christ the Son of God, and that believing
we might have life through his name,</hi> Joh. 20. 31.
And St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, That he wrote both his
Epistles to <hi>stir up the pure minds of Christians by
way of remembrance, and to put them in mind of the
words which were spoken before by the Holy Prophets,
and of the Commandment of the Apostles of our Lord
and Saviour,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 1. And St. <hi>Iohn</hi> gives us
this account of his Writing his Epistles, <hi>These
things have I written to you that ye sin not,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. And St. <hi>Iude,</hi> this of his, <hi>Beloved, when I gave
all diligence to write unto you of the common Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it was needful for me to write unto you, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
you that ye should earnestly contend for the
faith which was once delivered unto the Saints,</hi> v. 3.
These are the Ends for which the <hi>Scripture</hi> was
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:63657:211"/>
written; but how can the Writing of it contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to these Ends if we are not permitted to
Read what is written? For the <hi>Scripture</hi> was
written to the <hi>People</hi> as well as to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as I
shall shew by and by; but to what purpose
should it be written to the <hi>People</hi> to instruct and
admonish them, if the <hi>People</hi> are not allowed to
Read its Instructions and Admonitions? What
Influence could the Writing it have upon the
People's Belief, that <hi>Iesus Christ is the Son of God,</hi>
if they had been debarr'd from acquainting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with what is written concerning him?
How could it stir up their Remembrance, if they
might not Read what it suggested to their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory?
By what <hi>other</hi> way can it keep the <hi>People</hi>
from Sinning, but by Motives and Persuasions?
But how should its Motives and Persuasions affect
their Minds if they are not allowed to consult
and understand them? Upon what Account can
it move the <hi>People</hi> earnestly to contend for the
Faith once delivered to the Saints, if they are
not allowed to learn from it either what that
Faith is, or what those Reasons are which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them to contend for it? So that to write to
the <hi>People</hi> on purpose to instruct and reform
them, and at the same time to purpose to debar
them from Reading it, is either to suppose, that
the Writing will operate like a Charm, or to
purpose a <hi>downright</hi> Contradiction. For how
oddly would it have lookt, if in the <hi>afore cited</hi>
Passages, the <hi>Apostles</hi> had exprest themselves
thus:
<q>These things are written for your Learning
and Admonition; but 'tis by no means fit you should
learn from them what they teach and admonish you.
These Things are written that ye should believe that
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:63657:212"/>
Iesus is the Christ and the Son of God; but they are
not written that you should enquire of them whether
Iesus be the Christ or the Son of God. These
Things are written to put you in Mind of what hath
been spoken by the Prophets and Apostles; but they
were not written that you might acquaint your selves
by them what the Prophets and Apostles spake.
These Things are written that you should not Sin;
but beware you do not read them lest the bad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
recorded in them occasion you to Sin.</q>
In short, 
<q>These Things were written to excite you ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
to contend for the Faith once delivered to the
Saints; but you are by no means allowed to enquire
into them lest you should misunderstand them, and
so instead of contending for the Faith you should
contend for Heresie and False Doctrine.</q>
Had the
<hi>Apostles</hi> thus express'd themselves, I appeal to
any <hi>reasonable</hi> Man whether these Passages would
not have startled his Understanding, and tempted
him to question whether the Authors of them
were <hi>well</hi> in their Wits; and yet this must have
been their meaning, supposing that they meant
that the <hi>People</hi> should not read what they wrote.</p>
            <p>4. From the Direction of these <hi>Holy Writings</hi>
to the <hi>People,</hi> it is also evident, That the <hi>People</hi>
are still obliged to Read, or acquaint themselves
with them. For so we find the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>
was delivered by <hi>God</hi> to all the <hi>People</hi> as well as
to <hi>him</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> and (as was shewn before)
they were all of them commanded to search and
enquire into it. And so also were the <hi>Sermons</hi>
of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which are usually prefaced with
an, <hi>Hear O Israel, Hear O House of Iudah, Hear
O House of Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Hear all ye of Iudah.</hi> So
also our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> Preach'd his <hi>Sermons</hi> and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:63657:212"/>
               <hi>Parables,</hi> not only to his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Seventy
Disciples,</hi> but also to the <hi>People,</hi> and to the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes.
And so also his <hi>Apostles</hi> direct their
Epistles, not only <hi>to the Saints, to the faithful in
Christ Iesus, to the Beloved, which</hi> in the Language
of <hi>Scripture</hi> includes every <hi>Christian;</hi> but also <hi>to
all that are at Rome, to all that in every place call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the name of Iesus Christ our Lord, to all the Saints
which are in Achaia, to all the Saints which are at
Philippi, to the twelve Tribes which are scattered
abroad, to the Strangers scattered through Pontus,
Galatia,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>to them which have obtained like
precious Faith with us,</hi> that is, to all the <hi>Iewish
Christians</hi> dispersed over the World. Seeing
therefore the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were directed to all, as
well <hi>Laity</hi> as <hi>Clergy,</hi> this not only gives a Right
to <hi>all</hi> to Read them, but also lays an Obligation
npon <hi>all</hi> to acquaint themselves with them. For
the very directing such a Writing or Epistle to
<hi>such</hi> or <hi>such</hi> Persons, doth, in the Sense of all
the World, imply, that he who writes doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and intend, that they to whom he directs
it should Read and Peruse it; and therefore,
since the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were written to <hi>all,</hi> that is a
<hi>plain</hi> Intimation, that it was the Intention of the
Writers that <hi>all</hi> should Read them. And for
us not to Read what <hi>God</hi> hath written, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to us, is by Implication of Fact, a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane</hi>
Neglect and Contempt of his Mercy, and
looks as if we either thought him such an <hi>Insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant</hi>
Being, or our selves so <hi>little</hi> concerned in
any thing that he can say or write to us, as that
it would not be worth our while to receive, and
peruse the Contents of those <hi>Sacred</hi> Epistles,
which by the Hands of his <hi>Holy Penmen</hi> he hath
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:63657:213"/>
vouchsafed to direct to us. Nor is it a <hi>sufficient</hi>
Excuse for our Contempt, to say, that in Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of <hi>our own</hi> Proneness to Err and Mistake,
we ought to content our selves with this, that
our <hi>Spir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tual Guides</hi> should Read God's Writings
for us, and deliver the Sense and Contents of
them to us: For to be sure, had <hi>God</hi> intended
that the <hi>Priests</hi> only should read them, he would
have directed them only to the <hi>Priests,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
them only to deliver the Sense of them to
the <hi>People;</hi> and therefore since he hath directed
them to <hi>both,</hi> this necessarily implies that it was
his Intention that <hi>both</hi> should read them. For if
<hi>God</hi> had not directed them to Men, neither
<hi>Priests</hi> nor <hi>People</hi> were obliged to read them;
and therefore seeing the <hi>great</hi> Reason why any
Men ought to read them is, because they are dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to Men, this Reason obliges all Men to read
them; because they are directed to all Men.
For not to be highly concerned to know and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what it is that <hi>God</hi> writes to us is an
Argument that we have a very <hi>mean</hi> Regard
both of his Majesty, and his Mind, and Will.
But to be sure whosoever is highly concerned to
know what such a Writing contains, will, if he
can, be very <hi>curious</hi> to peruse it with his <hi>own</hi>
Eyes at least, supposing that it is not <hi>unlawful</hi>
for him so to do; because there is nothing gives
that Satisfaction to a Man's Mind as the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of his <hi>own</hi> Sense. So that for Men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to neglect reading the <hi>Scripture</hi> which <hi>God</hi>
hath so expresly directed to them, and thereby
not only licensed but obliged them to read it, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
a very <hi>prophane</hi> Disregard both of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it, and of the Matter it contains; and
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:63657:213"/>
for any Man, or Society of Men to forbid the
<hi>People</hi> to read what <hi>God</hi> hath written and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to them, is not only to deprive them of a
Right which <hi>God</hi> hath given them, but also to
acquit them of a Duty which he hath laid
upon them. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> in those Epistles
which he wrote to the <hi>Christian People</hi> in <hi>general</hi>
of <hi>such</hi> and <hi>such Churches,</hi> still takes it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that they would read them; as being not
only warranted, but obliged thereunto by his
writing them; for so <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 3, 4. speaking of
that <hi>great</hi> Mystery of the calling the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
which <hi>God</hi> had revealed to him, concerning
which, saith he, <hi>I wrote afore in few words, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in
the mystery of Christ.</hi> So also 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 13. We
write no other things unto you, than what you read,</hi>
that is, than what you may at least, and are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to read by vertue of our writing them to
you. And as for his Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi>
which he wrote to that <hi>whole Church,</hi> he gives
Charge that it should <hi>be read to all the holy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
1 Thes.</hi> 5. 27. So also for that of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ans,
When this Epistle</hi> is, or hath been, <hi>read
amongst you, cause that it be read also in the Church of
the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
from Laodicea.</hi> Where you see he all along
either supposes or requires that what he wrote
to <hi>all</hi> should be read by <hi>all</hi> and to <hi>all.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Authority of St. <hi>Paul</hi> be <hi>sufficient</hi> to
over-rule the Authority of any <hi>pretended Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
of</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> then it's certain that reading the
<hi>Scripture</hi> is still the Duty of <hi>Lay-men</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any <hi>Papal</hi> Prohibition to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="418" facs="tcp:63657:214"/>
5. From the <hi>great</hi> Concernment the <hi>People</hi>
have in the Matters contained in <hi>Scripture,</hi> it is
also evident that they are obliged, if they are
able, to read it and acquaint themselves with it:
For as for the Matters which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
they are such as are of <hi>everlasting</hi> Moment
to the <hi>People</hi> as well as to the <hi>Clergy.</hi> The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith which the <hi>Scripture</hi> proposes are
as <hi>necessary</hi> to be believed by the <hi>People</hi> as by the
<hi>Clergy.</hi> The Precepts of Life which the <hi>Scripture</hi>
prescribes are as <hi>necessary</hi> to be practised by the
<hi>People,</hi> as by the <hi>Clergy.</hi> The Promises and
Threats with which the <hi>Scripture</hi> inforces those
Precepts are as <hi>necessary</hi> to be considered by the
<hi>People</hi> as by the <hi>Clergy:</hi> And seeing <hi>both</hi> are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned in the <hi>great</hi> Matters which the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
contain, what Reason can be assigned why
<hi>both</hi> should not be obliged to acquaint themselves
with them? I know 'tis pretended that it is the
<hi>proper</hi> Office of the <hi>Clergy</hi> to study the <hi>Scriptures</hi>
for the <hi>People</hi> as well as for <hi>themselves,</hi> and that
therefore the <hi>People</hi> are obliged to receive the
Sense of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> upon Trust from their
Teachers without making any farther Enquiry.
But I beseech you, are you sure that your Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are <hi>infallible?</hi> That they are not so is most
<hi>certain,</hi> it being <hi>notorious</hi> that most of the <hi>prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Heresies</hi> of <hi>Christendom</hi> were <hi>first</hi> set on
broach by the <hi>Teachers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and it is
impossible they should be <hi>infallible,</hi> who have so
often actually erred even in Matters of the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
Moment. Suppose then what is fairly <hi>suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable,</hi>
that your Teachers should mislead you,
and not only into <hi>dangerous</hi> but <hi>damnable</hi> Errors;
are you sure that they shall be damned for you,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:63657:214"/>
and that you shall escape? If so, then <hi>Heresy</hi> in
the <hi>Layty</hi> can never be <hi>damnable</hi> if they receive
it upon Trust from their <hi>Teachers;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
their Souls are as <hi>safe</hi> under the Conduct
of <hi>false Teachers</hi> as <hi>true;</hi> provided always that
<hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi> they believe what is taught them.
But if your selves must give an Account to <hi>God</hi>
as well for your Faith as for your Manners, and
are <hi>liable</hi> in your <hi>own</hi> Persons to <hi>eternal</hi> Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(as most certainly you are) as well for <hi>Heresy</hi>
as <hi>Immorality,</hi> then it is the most <hi>unreasonable</hi>
Thing in the World that you should in all Things
be obliged to believe your <hi>Teachers</hi> upon Trust;
for at this Rate a Man may be eternally <hi>damned,</hi>
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erly for believing what he is obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
If it be said that the <hi>People</hi> are not bound
to believe what their <hi>particular Pastor</hi> teaches,
but what the <hi>Church</hi> teaches them, and the <hi>Church</hi>
cannot err though their <hi>particular Pastor</hi> may; I
would fain know how shall the <hi>People</hi> be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
informed what the <hi>Church</hi> teaches them
than by the Expositions of their <hi>particular Pastors,</hi>
they being at least as <hi>incapable</hi> of informing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
what the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> is, as
what the Doctrine of the <hi>Scripture</hi> is; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if their <hi>Pastor</hi> should err damnably in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
to them what the <hi>Church</hi> teaches, as it
is supposable he may if he be not <hi>infallible,</hi> there
is no Remedy but they must err damnably in
believing whatsoever their <hi>Pastor</hi> teaches. But
we are farther told, that it is <hi>sufficient</hi> for the
<hi>People</hi> that they believe in the <hi>gross</hi> that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the <hi>Church</hi> teaches is <hi>true,</hi> and that as for the
<hi>particulars</hi> there is no Necessity that they should
be informed about them; because he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:63657:215"/>
that all that the <hi>Church</hi> teaches is <hi>true,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly
believes all that is <hi>necessary,</hi> seeing the
<hi>Church</hi> teaches all that is <hi>necessary.</hi> But the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
of it is that this <hi>compendious</hi> Way of Belief
is utterly <hi>insignificant,</hi> and doth no way comport
with the Design and Intention of a <hi>Christian</hi>'s
Faith. For <hi>God</hi> doth not require our Faith meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for its <hi>own</hi> sake, but in order to a farther End,
that it may purify our Hearts, and influence our
Lives and Manners; that is, that the Matters
which we believe might by being believed by us
affect our Wills, and continually move and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
us to abstain from <hi>all Vngodliness and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly
in this present World;</hi> and if our Faith hath not
this Effect upon us, St. <hi>Iames</hi> assures us that it is
a <hi>dead</hi> Faith, and will profit us nothing. But
how is it <hi>possible</hi> that our believing <hi>such</hi> and <hi>such</hi>
Propositions should move and persuade us, if we
do not know what those Propositions are, and
what is the <hi>true</hi> Sense and Meaning of them?
What Man can be persuaded by such Proposals
as he doth not understand, and of which he hath
no Manner of <hi>explicite</hi> Knowledge? An <hi>Heathen</hi>
that believes that whatsoever <hi>God</hi> teaches is <hi>true</hi>
doth implicitly believe that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> came
from <hi>God</hi> to reveal his Will to Mankind, because
it is certain that <hi>God</hi> teaches this; but what is
he the <hi>better</hi> for this his <hi>implicite</hi> Belief? What
Influence can it have upon his Heart and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who perhaps never heard of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
nor of any <hi>one</hi> Proposition which he revealed to
the World? And so he who believes that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the <hi>Church</hi> teaches is <hi>true,</hi> doth implicitly
believe that there shall be a <hi>future Iudgment,</hi> a
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:63657:215"/>
               <hi>Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> and <hi>an everlasting State
of Happiness or Misery after Death;</hi> because all
these Things the <hi>Church</hi> teaches; but if he never
hear of them, or hath no <hi>explicite</hi> Knowledge
and Belief of them, how is it <hi>possible</hi> they
should operate on his Will and Affections.
or ever persuade him to be the <hi>better</hi> Man or the
<hi>better Christian?</hi> And the same is to be said of all
the <hi>other</hi> Articles of <hi>Christianity.</hi> So that either
we must believe to no Purpose, and content our
selves with an <hi>insignificant</hi> Faith that will not at
all avail us; or take up our Faith upon Trust
from <hi>fallible</hi> Teachers who may mislead us into
<hi>damnable</hi> Errors, and if they should, we must be
<hi>liable</hi> to answer for it in <hi>our</hi> Persons, and at our
own <hi>eternal</hi> Peril; or, which is the Truth of the
Case, we must be allowed to enquire, and judge
for our selves at least in all Things <hi>necessary</hi> to
our <hi>eternal</hi> Salvation. Seeing therefore there
are many Things in <hi>Scripture</hi> which the <hi>Scripture</hi>
it self obliges me upon Pain of Damnation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
it hence necessarily follows, that so far
forth as the <hi>Scripture</hi> obliges me to believe what
it teaches, it obliges me to understand what it
teaches, otherwise I must believe I know not
what, which is impossible; and so far as the
<hi>Scripture</hi> obliges me to understand what it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
it must oblige me to <hi>search, enquire,</hi> and <hi>judge</hi>
what it teaches; because I cannot understand
without enquiring and judging: But how can I
enquire what the <hi>Scripture</hi> teaches if I cannot be
admitted to read and consult the <hi>Scripture?</hi>
And so again, there are many Duties in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
which the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self obliges me to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
upon pain of <hi>eternal</hi> Damnation; but how
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:63657:216"/>
can it oblige me to Practise what it doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
me to Understand; or how can it oblige me
to Understand what it doth not oblige me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after? But how can I enquire what it is
that the <hi>Scripture</hi> obliges me to Practise, when I
am forbid all access to it, and it is lockt up from
me in an <hi>unknown</hi> Tongue? In short therefore,
seeing the Things contained in <hi>Scripture</hi> are of
the <hi>highest</hi> Moment to the <hi>People,</hi> and it is as much
as their Souls are worth not to Believe and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
what it Teaches; and seeing they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Believe nor Practise what they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand;
it is of <hi>infinite</hi> concern to them so far
at <hi>least</hi> to Read, Consult, and Understand the
<hi>Scripture,</hi> as they stand obliged to Believe and
Practise its Doctrines and Precepts.</p>
            <p>6. And lastly, From the <hi>Vniversal</hi> Sense of
the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> in this matter, it is also evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the <hi>People</hi> are obliged to read or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
themselves with the <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi> For
the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> for above <hi>six hundred</hi> years
were so far from debarring the <hi>People</hi> the Use
of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that it continually urged and
press'd it upon them as a matter of <hi>indispensable</hi>
Obligation. For so <hi>Origen</hi> wishes, That <hi>all would
do as it is written,</hi> viz. <hi>Search the Scriptures.</hi> So
also <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Hearken ye that are afar
off, hearken ye that be near; the Word of God is hid
from no man: it is a Light common to all Men, and
there is no Darkness in it.</hi> So
also St. <hi>Austin</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">In Orat. adhort. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Gent.</note>, <hi>Think it not
sufficient that ye hear the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in the Church, but do you also read the Scriptures
your selves in your own Houses, or get some other to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:63657:216"/>
read them to you.</hi> So also St.
<hi>Ierom</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">In Psal. 86.</note>, <hi>The Lord hath spoken
to us by his Gospel, not that a
few, but all should understand.</hi> And elsewhere,
speaking of the Women that were at <hi>Bethlehem</hi>
with <hi>Paula, It was not lawful,</hi> saith he, <hi>for any
one of all the Sisters to be ignorant of the Psalms,
nor to pass over any day without learning some part
of the Scriptures.</hi> And else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<note n="*" place="margin">Ep. ad Coloss. c. 3.</note>, <hi>We are taught,</hi> saith
he, <hi>That the Lay-People ought
to have the Word of God not only sufficiently, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
with abundance, that so they may be able to teach
and counsel others.</hi> So also St.
<hi>Chrysostome</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Ep. ad Colos. Hom. 9.</note>, <hi>Hear me O Layty,
get ye the Bible the most wholsom
remedy for the Soul; and if ye will no more, at least
get the New Testament, St. Paul's Epistles, and the
Acts, that they may be your continual and earnest
Teachers.</hi> And elsewhere, he
affirms<note n="*" place="margin">In Matth. Hom. 3.</note>, <hi>That it is more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the Lay-People to read
the Scriptures than either for the Monks or Priests, or
any others.</hi> And to cite no more of the <hi>infinite
Authorities</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> to this
purpose, St. <hi>Basil</hi> observes<note n="*" place="margin">In Psal. 1.</note>,
<hi>The Scripture of God is like an
Apothecary's Shop full of Medicines of sundry sorts,
that so every Man may there choose a convenient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for his Disease.</hi> And that the <hi>People,</hi> as well
as the <hi>Priests</hi> were then allowed the Use of the
<hi>Bible,</hi> is evident from a <hi>notorious</hi> matter of Fact;
for when the <hi>Roman Emperors</hi> endeavoured to
force the <hi>Christians</hi> by Persecution and Torments
to deliver up their <hi>Bibles</hi> to be burnt, that so by
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:63657:217"/>
extinguishing those <hi>Sacred</hi> Records they might
extinguish <hi>Christianity,</hi> they examined not only
the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> but also the <hi>People</hi> of all
Degrees and both Sexes; many of whom, as
well Women as Men, owned that they had <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>
but rather chose to die than to deliver them
<hi>up;</hi> and many <hi>others,</hi> who to avoid Death,
delivered up their <hi>Bibles,</hi> and are therefore
branded with the <hi>ignominious</hi> Name of <hi>Traditors,</hi>
for which they were excluded the <hi>Communion of
the Church,</hi> and could not be readmitted without
a <hi>long</hi> and <hi>severe</hi> Penance. But it is impossible
the <hi>People</hi> could have been <hi>Traditors</hi> if they had
had no <hi>Bibles</hi> to deliver <hi>up;</hi> and therefore being
so, is an <hi>undeniable</hi> Argument, that the <hi>People</hi>
were then allowed the Use of the <hi>Scripture</hi> as
well as the <hi>Priests.</hi> And by the way, it's very
<hi>strange</hi> that any Community of <hi>Christians</hi> should
think, that a <hi>proper</hi> Way to extinguish <hi>Heresie,</hi>
which those <hi>Heathen Persecutors</hi> made use of to
extinguish <hi>Christianity.</hi> But that in those <hi>first</hi>
Ages the <hi>People</hi> were allowed the Use of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
is a case so <hi>plain,</hi> that they who of <hi>later</hi> Ages
have thought meet to repeal this Allowance, have
never been able to produce so much as one <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi>
colour of <hi>Primitive</hi> Authority to warrant
their Practice. And though in <hi>other</hi> Points they
not only claim but ravish <hi>Antiquity,</hi> in despite
of Modesty as well as Truth; yet here they are
so abandoned of all pretence to it, that they are
not able to produce so much as <hi>one</hi> Passage of any
<hi>Primitive Father</hi> that seems to discourage the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
from Reading the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and much <hi>less</hi>
that forbids them so to do: And 'tis notorious
to all the World, That in the <hi>Primitive Ages,</hi>
               <pb n="425" facs="tcp:63657:217"/>
when the <hi>Latin</hi> was the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Language of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Bible</hi> was translated into that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
for the Use and Instruction of the <hi>People;</hi>
but when through the many Incursions of the
<hi>Barbarous</hi> Nations into the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire this
Language was worn out by degrees, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of being the <hi>vulgar,</hi> became an <hi>unknown</hi>
Tongue to that <hi>People;</hi> the <hi>Governours</hi> of that
<hi>Church,</hi> having to serve their own secular Ends,
introduced into it sundry <hi>corrupt</hi> Doctrines and
Practices, which they feared the Light of the
<hi>Scripture</hi> might detect to the <hi>People,</hi> they thought
it most <hi>advisable</hi> not to translate it into the <hi>New
Vulgar,</hi> but to let it remain lockt <hi>up</hi> from their
Cognizance in the <hi>Old Latin,</hi> which by this Time
very <hi>few,</hi> except the <hi>Clergy,</hi> understood. And
when for some Time it had lain hid from them
in an <hi>unknown</hi> Tongue, they proceeded at last
wholly to forbid the Use of it to the Layty. So
that about the <hi>Ninth</hi> and <hi>Tenth</hi> Ages, which all
agree were over-cast with <hi>gross</hi> Darkness and
Ignorance, the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were shut <hi>up,</hi> like the
<hi>Sybilline Oracles</hi> in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> and none but the
<hi>Priests</hi> were allowed to Read and Consult them.
And though upon the Commencement of the
<hi>Reformation,</hi> the <hi>Bible</hi> was for some time set forth
again in <hi>sundry vulgar</hi> Languages among the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
yet did the <hi>Guides</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> soon find it
<hi>necessary,</hi> for Defence of their own <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural</hi>
Doctrines and Practices, to remit it to
its <hi>old</hi> Confinement. For <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Council of
Trent,</hi> in the <hi>Fourth</hi> Rule of their <hi>Index Expur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorius,</hi>
forbids the <hi>Layty</hi> to read, or so much
as to have the <hi>Bible</hi> in the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Language,
though translated by those of their own <hi>Church,</hi>
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:63657:218"/>
without a Licence in Writing from the <hi>Bishop</hi>
of the Diocess, or the <hi>Inquisitor;</hi> and this upon
Pain of not receiving Absolution of their Sins
unless they delivered <hi>up</hi> those their <hi>Bibles</hi> to their
<hi>Ordinary.</hi> To which Rule, <hi>Pope Clement the Eighth</hi>
afterwards added this Observation, <hi>That hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by the Command and Practice of the Holy Roman
and Vniversal Inquisition, the Faculty of granting
such Licences for reading or keeping Bibles in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Tongue, or any Summaries or Historical Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums
of the said Bibles, is taken away; which is
to be inviolably observed.</hi> And in the <hi>Index of
Prohibited Books,</hi> published by <hi>Pope Alexander the
Seventh,</hi> not only those <hi>Bibles</hi> that are translated
and printed by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but also all <hi>Bibles</hi> in any
<hi>Vulgar</hi> Tongue are absolutely forbidden. And
though, where the <hi>Reformation</hi> hath prevailed,
they are forced against their <hi>own</hi> Laws more
freely to indulge the Use of the <hi>Scripture</hi> to their
<hi>People,</hi> yet in those Countries where they are
<hi>sole</hi> Masters this Priviledge is very rarely granted.</p>
            <p>And now being thus <hi>necessitated</hi> to deprive the
<hi>People</hi> of the Light of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> lest they
should thereby discover their Errors and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
it was <hi>necessary</hi> for them to invent some
<hi>plausible</hi> Pretences to justifie a Practice so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
both to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Primitive</hi> Antiquity,
and so enormously <hi>derogatory</hi> to the <hi>common</hi> Right
of <hi>Christians;</hi> and when it must be done, it is a
very <hi>hard</hi> Case if Men of Wit and Learning
cannot find something to say for any thing.
Now the <hi>two main</hi> Pretences that are urged in
this Case are; <hi>First,</hi> That a <hi>general</hi> P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rmission
of the Use of <hi>Scripture</hi> to the <hi>People</hi> must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
open a <hi>wide</hi> Door to <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Heresies:
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:63657:218"/>
Secondly,</hi> That it will prove an <hi>unavoidable</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of <hi>great</hi> Corruptions in Manners.</p>
            <p>1. That a <hi>general</hi> Permission of the Use of
<hi>Scripture</hi> to the <hi>People</hi> must necessarily open a
<hi>wide</hi> Door to <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Heresies;</hi> because there
are many Things in <hi>Scripture</hi> which are <hi>hard</hi> to
be understood, and which the <hi>Vnlearned,</hi> who
are <hi>unqualified</hi> to understand them <hi>aright,</hi> will be
apt to wrest into a <hi>wrong</hi> Sense to their <hi>own</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
To which I answer,</p>
            <p>1. That this Reason holds as <hi>good</hi> against the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and publishing the <hi>Scripture</hi> at <hi>first</hi> in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
that were vulgarly known to the <hi>People,</hi> as
against the Translating them now into the <hi>vulgar</hi>
Languages. For the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> in which the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi>
was written, was the <hi>vulgar</hi> Language of
the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> in which the <hi>New Testament</hi>
was written, was then the most <hi>vulgar</hi> Language of
the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and yet notwithstanding
there were the same <hi>hard</hi> Things <hi>then</hi> in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
as <hi>now,</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> were as <hi>unlearned</hi> then,
and as apt to wrest these <hi>hard Scriptures</hi> to their <hi>own</hi>
Destruction <hi>then</hi> as <hi>now;</hi> yet <hi>God</hi> notwithstanding
thought fit to write and publish it in Languages
that were most <hi>known</hi> to the People; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
either we must say, that he did not take
that Care that he ought to have done to prevent
<hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Heresies,</hi> or that this is no <hi>good</hi> Reason
why the <hi>People</hi> should be debarred of the <hi>Scripture</hi>
in their own <hi>vulgar</hi> Language. For why should
not the Writing the <hi>Scriptures</hi> at <hi>first</hi> in the <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi>
Languages as much open a Door to <hi>Heresie,</hi>
as the translating them afterwards, seeing it is
neither their being written in the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
nor their being translated into the <hi>Vulgar</hi>
               <pb n="428" facs="tcp:63657:219"/>
Language, but their being in the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
that is here pretended to set open this <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi>
Door to <hi>Heresies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This Objection strikes with <hi>equal</hi> force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God's writing and publishing the <hi>Scripture</hi>
to the <hi>People,</hi> as against their reading and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
it. For that <hi>God</hi> wrote these <hi>Scriptures</hi>
to the <hi>People,</hi> and that in so doing, he not only
gave them a Right, but also laid on them an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
to Read them, I have already shewed.
If therefore the Reading the <hi>Scripture</hi> by the
<hi>People</hi> be such an <hi>unavoidable</hi> Inlet of <hi>Error</hi> and
<hi>Heresie,</hi> as this Objection pretends, it was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
very unadvisedly done of <hi>God</hi> to publish
such a <hi>dangerous</hi> Book to the World; which
those for whom he published, and to whom he
directed it cannot familiarly converse with with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>eminent</hi> Peril of being infected with <hi>Heresie.</hi>
And if the <hi>Scripture</hi> be such a <hi>quarrelsome</hi> Knife
as these Men say it is, that the <hi>People</hi> can hardly
touch it without cutting their Fingers, they are
certainly more beholding to the <hi>Church</hi> for taking
it from them, than they are to <hi>God</hi> for bestowing
it on them.</p>
            <p>3. This Objection makes as much at least a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Priests</hi> Reading the <hi>Scripture</hi> as the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
For most of those <hi>Heresies</hi> that have been
broacht to the <hi>People</hi> were <hi>first</hi> brewed by the
<hi>Priests,</hi> from whose Lips the <hi>People</hi> do commonly
derive their <hi>Errors,</hi> as well as their <hi>Knowledge:</hi>
Witness those <hi>famous Heresies</hi> with which the
<hi>Christian</hi> World hath been so distracted from <hi>one</hi>
Generation to <hi>another,</hi> such as the <hi>Novatian,</hi> the
<hi>Donatist,</hi> the <hi>Arian,</hi> the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> the <hi>Eutichian,</hi>
the <hi>Eunomian;</hi> all which Counterfeits, and a
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:63657:219"/>
great many more, were <hi>first</hi> coined by the <hi>Clergy,</hi>
and dispersed for <hi>current Christianity</hi> among the
<hi>Layty.</hi> And therefore, if this Pretence, that
the Reading of <hi>Scripture</hi> opens a Gap to <hi>Heresie,</hi>
be a <hi>sufficient</hi> Reason why the <hi>Layty</hi> should not
Read it, it is a much more <hi>sufficient</hi> Reason why
the <hi>Clergy</hi> should not Read it. For it requires
Skill and Learning as well to wrest the <hi>Scripture</hi>
into such <hi>false</hi> Senses as are likely to impose upon
the World, as to interpret it into its <hi>true</hi> Sense;
and I am very sure that it ordinarily requires
more Wit and Art, to extort from the <hi>Scripture
probable</hi> Errors, than it doth to discover by it
<hi>necessary</hi> Truth; and if so, then if the danger of
letting in <hi>Heresies</hi> is a <hi>true</hi> Reason why any should
not Read it, it is much more a <hi>true</hi> Reason why
the <hi>Learned</hi> should not Read it than the <hi>Vnlearned;</hi>
and consequently why the <hi>Priests</hi> should not Read
it than the <hi>People,</hi> seeing the <hi>former</hi> are more qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
to extract <hi>Heresies</hi> from it than the <hi>later.</hi>
If therefore this Objection signifie any Thing, it
must be this, That it is a very <hi>dangerous</hi> thing for
any Body to Read the <hi>Bible;</hi> that this same <hi>Divine</hi>
Book, which <hi>God</hi> thought fit to publish to the
World, and which the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> thought
fit to oblige all that were able to Peruse and
Study, is now become such a <hi>dangerous</hi> Inlet of
<hi>Heresie,</hi> that like <hi>Pandora's Box,</hi> you can no
sooner open it, but Swarms of <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>False
Doctrines</hi> will presently fly abroad into the
World; so that it would be very well for the
World if it were either utterly extinguished,
or hid in some <hi>inaccessible</hi> Repository, where no
<hi>Mortal</hi> Eye might ever approach it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:63657:220"/>
4. This Objection expresly contradicts our
<hi>Saviour,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Fathers.</hi> For <hi>Matt.
22.</hi> 29. our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> who were
cavelling with him about the Resurrection; <hi>Ye
do err, not knowing the Scriptures.</hi> Had therefore
the <hi>Sadducees</hi> been of the same Mind with our <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors</hi>
they would doubtless have told him, <hi>by your
good Leave Sir, in this Point you your self are in an
Error, for in all Probability had we known the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or been intimately acquainted with it, we should
have err'd much more.</hi> Either therefore our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
was mistaken in charging the Errour of the
<hi>Sadducees</hi> upon their Ignorance of <hi>Scripture,</hi> or our
<hi>Objectors</hi> are mistaken in making it so <hi>necessary</hi>
an Expedient for the Prevention of Error to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the <hi>People</hi> being acquainted with <hi>Scripture;</hi>
for 'tis plain <hi>He</hi> and <hi>They</hi> are of <hi>quite Different</hi>
Opinions in the Case. But whatever their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is, I am sure the <hi>Primitive Fathers</hi> were of
the same Opinion with our <hi>Saviour:</hi> For <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
writing of the <hi>Valentinian Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 12.</note>
               <hi>All those Errors they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
because they know not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
So St. <hi>Ierom,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">In Ep. ad Ephes. l. 3. c. 4</note> 
               <hi>We must
search the Scriptures with all Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
that so as being good Exchangers we may know
the lawful Coyn from the Copper.</hi> And elsewhere,
<hi>That infinite Evils arise from Ignorance of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and that from this Cause the greatest Part of
Heresies have proceeded.</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> is of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>that if Men would be conversant with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and attend to them, they would not only not fall
into Errors themselves, but be able to rescue those that
are deceived; and that the Scriptures would instruct
Men both in right Opinions, and good Life.</hi> And to
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:63657:220"/>
name no more, <hi>Theophilact</hi> tells us, <hi>that nothing
can deceive them who search the Holy Scriptures;
for that saith he is the Candle whereby the Thief is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</hi>
But it seems, according to <hi>Modern</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
this Candle of <hi>Scripture</hi> rather serves
to light the Thief into the House, than to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him when he is there; and therefore it is
thought <hi>necessary</hi> for <hi>honest</hi> Men's security either
that it should be wholly extinguished, or at least
hinder'd from giving Light by being shut <hi>up</hi> in a
<hi>dark Lanthorn</hi> of an <hi>Vnknown</hi> Tongue. But when
they who were once the <hi>honest</hi> Men are become
the <hi>Thieves,</hi> it is no wonder that they should thus
change their Note, and complain of the Light of
this Candle as <hi>dangerous</hi> to them, which <hi>heretofore</hi>
they esteemed their <hi>greatest</hi> Security. I am sure
the Reason assigned by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> why some Men
wrested the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to their <hi>own</hi> Destruction,
was not their reading the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wise their not reading it enough, <hi>which they
that are unlearned,</hi> saith he, <hi>wrest to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi>
2 Pet. 3. 16. <hi>Vnlearned</hi> in what? Why
doubtless in the <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi> For as to <hi>humane</hi>
Learning, St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself was as <hi>unlearned</hi> as
they; and if it were their being <hi>unlearned</hi> in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
that occasioned them to wrest it into an <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
Sense, then it is not Mens reading the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
that leads them into <hi>Heresy,</hi> but their not
reading it enough. To say therefore that the
Peoples reading the <hi>Scripture</hi> is an Inlet of <hi>Heresy,</hi>
and to say, no it is not their reading it, but
their not reading it enough is the Inlet of Heresy,
is an <hi>express</hi> Contradiction; the <hi>former</hi> our <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors</hi>
say, the <hi>latter</hi> our <hi>Saviour,</hi> his <hi>Apostles,</hi>
and the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> say; and I think it is no
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:63657:221"/>
               <hi>hard</hi> Matter to determine which of these <hi>two</hi>
Contradictions we ought to believe.</p>
            <p>5. And lastly, According to this Objection,
the <hi>best</hi> Way to keep Men from being <hi>Hereticks</hi>
is to deprive them of all Means of arriving at
the Knowledge of the Truth: And this, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
is a very <hi>certain</hi> Way, though not a very
<hi>Honest</hi> one. Let Men know nothing of <hi>Religion,</hi>
and to be sure they cannot be <hi>Hereticks,</hi> it being
<hi>impossible</hi> for Men to err in their Conceptions of
those Things whereof they have no Notion.
Put out a Man's Eyes, and you certainly prevent
his being imposed upon by <hi>false</hi> Medium's of
Sight to mistake <hi>one</hi> Colour or Figure for <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;</hi>
And yet I fancy most Men would think
this a <hi>cruel</hi> Kind of Courtesy. But if Men must
not be allowed <hi>Scripture</hi> to instruct them in the
Truth, for this Reason; because it may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally
mislead them into <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Heresies,</hi>
then they must be allowed no Means of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that may occasion them to err, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
no Means at all, there being no <hi>imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Means of Instruction which may not be an
Occasion of <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Heresies.</hi> Is the <hi>Scripture</hi>
it self in its <hi>own</hi> Nature an Occasion of misleading
Men into <hi>Heresy,</hi> or not? If you say it is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
before you say it, how it could consist with
the Truth and Veracity of <hi>God</hi> to publish such a
Book to the World as tends in its <hi>own</hi> Nature to
seduce and mislead the Understandings of those
that read it. If you say it is not <hi>so</hi> in it self, but
only that it may be so accidentally, I would fain
know what Means of Instruction is there which
may not accidentally become an Occasion of
misleading Men into <hi>Heresy;</hi> and therefore if
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:63657:221"/>
this be a <hi>sufficient</hi> Reason to deprive Men of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
it is <hi>sufficient</hi> to deprive them of all <hi>other</hi>
Means of Instruction. And seeing the Knowledge
of <hi>Religion</hi> is the Food of Mens Souls, to keep
them in Ignorance for fear they should err, is to
deny them Food for fear they should surfeit.
There is no doubt but Men whose Minds are tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured
with <hi>Heretical</hi> Pravity will be apt enough
to extract the Poison of <hi>Error</hi> out of the <hi>clearest</hi>
Conveyances and Discoveries of Truth; but
what then? Do not <hi>bad</hi> Men ordinarily apply
the <hi>best</hi> Things to the <hi>worst</hi> Purposes? If Men fall
into <hi>Heresy</hi> by reading the <hi>Scripture,</hi> where lies
the Fault? not in the <hi>Scripture</hi> sure, no <hi>Christian</hi>
will pretend that; and if it be in themselves, in
their <hi>Pride,</hi> or <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> or <hi>Covetousness,</hi> or
<hi>Sensuality,</hi> (as it is demonstrable it is) is it <hi>just</hi>
that <hi>All</hi> should be deprived of it, because <hi>some ill</hi>
Men have made an <hi>ill</hi> Use of it? Some Men have
surfeited by Eating and Drinking, is it <hi>just</hi> that
all Mankind therefore should be deprived of
Meat and Drink? Suppose a Prince, pretending
to be an <hi>infallible Geographer,</hi> should issue out a
Proclamation commanding all his Subjects to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
at <hi>Mid-night,</hi> and should assign <hi>this</hi> as the
Reason of it, that he had been certainly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that <hi>several</hi> of them had lost their Way at
<hi>Noon,</hi> and wandred into Bogs and Precipices by
the Light of the Sun; would any <hi>one</hi> imagin <hi>this</hi>
to be the <hi>true</hi> Reason, or rather would not every
<hi>one</hi> believe that his <hi>true</hi> Design was to keep his
People in Ignorance of the Roads and Situation
of his Country, that so they might never be able
to discover the Errors of his Maps, which would
perhaps discover him to be not only a <hi>fallible Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographer,</hi>
               <pb n="434" facs="tcp:63657:222"/>
but also a very <hi>erroneous</hi> one? And
where the <hi>People</hi> are forbid travelling in the Light
of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> whatever may be pretended,
<hi>wise</hi> Men will believe that the <hi>true</hi> Reason is not
to prevent the Peoples falling into <hi>Errors,</hi> but
to prevent the discovering the <hi>Errors</hi> of those to
whose Guidance and Direction they are wholly
and solely subjected. And this I conceive is a
<hi>sufficient</hi> Answer to the <hi>first</hi> Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the Allowance of the <hi>Scripture</hi> to the <hi>People</hi> is a
<hi>dangerous</hi> Inlet of <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Heresy.</hi> I proceed
therefore to the Second, which is this;</p>
            <p>Object 2. That there are <hi>many</hi> Things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in <hi>Scripture</hi> which are very <hi>apt</hi> to suggest
<hi>leud</hi> Thoughts to the People, and thereby to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
their Manners, as particularly the many <hi>bad</hi>
Examples therein related, which are of a very
<hi>contagious</hi> Nature, and consequently <hi>dangerous</hi>
for the <hi>People</hi> to converse with. In Answer to
which I desire these <hi>four</hi> Things may be seriously
considered.</p>
            <p>1. That this <hi>Objection</hi> strikes as much against
the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self as against the People's read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. For what <hi>worse</hi> Thing can be said of
the <hi>Scripture</hi> than this, that it is such an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious</hi>
Book, so <hi>apt</hi> to excite <hi>impure</hi> Thoughts
in Mens Minds, and to Kindle <hi>leud</hi> Affections in
their Hearts, that it is by no Means fit the <hi>People</hi>
should read it? Should this be said to a <hi>Turk,</hi> or
a <hi>Heathen,</hi> who had never read <hi>one</hi> Word in the
<hi>Bible,</hi> he would certainly conclude it to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a <hi>Canto of Ribbaldries</hi> written for no
<hi>other</hi> End but to provoke and entertain the <hi>lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious</hi>
               <pb n="435" facs="tcp:63657:222"/>
Inclinations of Mankind. And certainly
had our <hi>Objectors</hi> but as much Reverence for this
<hi>Holy Book</hi> as they pretend, they would rather
oblige their <hi>People</hi> to read it than withhold it
from them, upon a Pretence that doth so scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalously
reflect upon its Reputation. If there
be any such Passages in <hi>Scripture</hi> as are <hi>apt</hi> to start
<hi>leud</hi> Thoughts in Mens Minds, the utmost that
can be fairly pretended, is, That those Passages
ought to have been left out of the Peoples <hi>Bibles,</hi>
or at least to have been left <hi>untranslated:</hi> But to
urge <hi>this</hi> as a Reason, why all the rest of the
<hi>Scripture</hi> should be denied to the <hi>People,</hi> insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,
as if the <hi>whole</hi> were nothing else but a <hi>meer</hi>
Kennel of <hi>contagious</hi> Obscenities. For to urge
that for a Reason, why the <hi>Scripture</hi> in <hi>general</hi>
should not be read by, or to the <hi>People,</hi> (which
at most is only a Reason why some <hi>few</hi> Passages
of it should not be read by them) is to suppose
the whole <hi>Scripture</hi> to be made <hi>up</hi> of such Passages
as are <hi>apt</hi> to infuse <hi>vicious</hi> Thoughts into the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi>
than which what can there be supposed
more <hi>false</hi> in it self, or more <hi>derogatory</hi> to the
<hi>Scripture?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This <hi>Objection,</hi> if it proves any Thing, doth
as well prove that it was <hi>unfit</hi> for <hi>God</hi> to publish
the <hi>Scripture</hi> to the <hi>People,</hi> as it is for the <hi>People</hi>
to read it. For is it fit, that <hi>He, who is a God
of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity,</hi> should pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
such Things to the World as are <hi>apt</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender
<hi>impure</hi> Thoughts in Mens Minds? And
yet though Mens Minds were as <hi>apt</hi> to imbibe
<hi>impure</hi> Thoughts when these Things were <hi>first</hi>
published, as they are now; this hindred not
<hi>God</hi> from publishing them to the World in such
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:63657:223"/>
Languages as are best <hi>known</hi> and <hi>understood</hi> by the
<hi>People.</hi> Either therefore <hi>God</hi> did not so well
know what is <hi>apt</hi> to corrupt Mens Minds as our
<hi>wise</hi> Objectors; or He was <hi>less</hi> concerned than
they to preserve them from being corrupted;
or what they object is both <hi>false</hi> and <hi>scandalous.</hi>
For to say, That the <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>holy God</hi> hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
such Things to the World as his Ministers
find <hi>necessary</hi> to conceal from the World, lest its
Thoughts should be corrupted by them, is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to say, that his Ministers are grown <hi>wiser</hi>
than he, or are more concerned for the Interest
of Holiness than he. If the <hi>Vicious</hi> Examples,
for instance, that are recorded in <hi>Scripture</hi> are
more <hi>apt</hi> to deprave Men than to instruct them,
what need they have been recorded? What is
there in the <hi>meer</hi> Story of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Drunkenness
and Incest, and <hi>David</hi>'s Adultery, considered
abstractly from the <hi>good</hi> Instructions it gives,
that should move <hi>God</hi> to deliver it down to all
<hi>future</hi> Posterity? If it serve no <hi>good</hi> Ends, it is
recorded to a <hi>bad</hi> purpose; and therefore, if
for this Reason, because it is <hi>apt</hi> to corrupt Mens
Minds, the <hi>Church</hi> be obliged to conceal it now,
for the very same Reason <hi>God</hi> was obliged to have
concealed it <hi>for ever.</hi> Either therefore we must
say that <hi>God</hi> did very <hi>ill</hi> in publishing it, or that
the <hi>Church</hi> doth very <hi>ill</hi> in suppressing it;
for <hi>God</hi> could have no <hi>other</hi> End in publishing it
to the World, but only to instruct the World
by it. If therefore it be not <hi>instructive, God</hi>
was mistaken; but if it be, it is <hi>fit</hi> the World
should be acquainted with it.</p>
            <p>3. That this <hi>Objection</hi> doth expresly contradict
the <hi>Scripture</hi> it self; For whereas it tells us, that
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:63657:223"/>
the <hi>bad</hi> Examples recorded in <hi>Scripture</hi> would be
apt to deprave the Peoples Minds and Manners,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us the quite contrary: <hi>These Things
were our Examples, to the intent we should not lust
after evil things, as they,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the
Wilderness, <hi>lusted. Neither be ye idolaters, as
were some of them: Neither let us commit fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as some of them committed, and fell in one day
three and twenty thousand: Neither let us tempt
Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
of serpents: Neither murmur ye, as some of
them also murmured, and were destroyed of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer:
Now all these things happened unto them for
ensamples; and they are written for our admonition,
upon whom the ends of the world are come,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Whereas this <hi>Objection</hi> urges
that there are <hi>sundry</hi> Passages in <hi>Scripture</hi> which
should the <hi>People</hi> read, would excite <hi>evil</hi> Thoughts
in their Minds; The same St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>That
all Scripture is profitable,</hi> not only <hi>for Doctrine</hi> and
<hi>Reproof,</hi> but also <hi>for correction, for instruction in
righteousness,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16. Whereas this <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi>
pretends, that it would be very <hi>unsafe</hi> for
<hi>young People</hi> especially, to be allowed the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
because there are several <hi>amorous</hi> Stories
and Passages in it which will be apt to suggest
<hi>wanton</hi> Thoughts to their <hi>gay</hi> and <hi>amorous</hi> Fancies.
<hi>David,</hi> it is plain, was of a quite <hi>contrary</hi> Mind;
for <hi>wherewith</hi> saith he, <hi>shall a young man cleanse his
way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word,</hi>
Psal. 119. 9. than which two Passages what As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertions
can be more contrary <hi>one</hi> to <hi>another?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And lastly, That supposing this <hi>Objection</hi>
to be thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ar <hi>true,</hi> that there are some Passages
in <hi>Scripture</hi> which may sometimes occasionally
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:63657:224"/>
excite <hi>bad</hi> Thoughts in Mens Minds, yet this is
no <hi>just</hi> Reason why the Use of <hi>Scripture</hi> should be
forbid to the <hi>People.</hi> For every Thing which the
<hi>People</hi> occasionally make <hi>bad</hi> Uses of, is for that
Reason to be forbid to them; even <hi>Prayer</hi> and
the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and the <hi>Profession</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi>
ought to be forbidden them as well as the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
seeing of the <hi>one</hi> as well as of the <hi>other,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>People</hi> do occasionally make very <hi>bad</hi> Uses.
So long as the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>good</hi> in it self, and <hi>apt</hi>
in its <hi>own</hi> Nature to instruct and edifie those that
read it, this is <hi>sufficient</hi> not only to warrant the
Peoples Use of it, but to enjoyn and require it;
and if it sometimes occasion <hi>corrupt</hi> Thoughts in
<hi>corrupt</hi> Minds, this is no more a Reason why the
<hi>People</hi> should be deprived of the Light of it than
some <hi>bad</hi> Mens making ill Use of the Light of
the Sun is, why the Sun should be extinguished,
or why the <hi>People</hi> should be <hi>for ever</hi> shut <hi>up</hi> from
the Light of it in <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>dismal</hi> Dungeons.
But as for those very Passages of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which
do sometimes occasion <hi>ill</hi> Thoughts in Mens
Minds, they are so far from doing it of their <hi>own</hi>
Natures, that as they are delivered in <hi>Scripture,</hi>
there is nothing more naturally <hi>apt</hi> to repress <hi>bad</hi>
Thoughts, and to arm and fortifie Mens Minds
against them. As for instance, The <hi>bad</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
recorded in <hi>Scripture</hi> are generally deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with <hi>infamous</hi> Characters, <hi>severe</hi> Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and <hi>dreadful</hi> Instances of God's Vengeance
attending them, which render them much more
<hi>apt</hi> to repress than to excite <hi>evil</hi> Thoughts in
Mens Minds; to quicken them to <hi>Prayer</hi> and
<hi>Watchfulness</hi> against Temptations, and when at
any Time they have been overcome by them, to
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:63657:224"/>
encourage them to Repentance; or when they
have overcome them, to stir them <hi>up</hi> to a <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Acknowledgment of that <hi>preventing</hi> and <hi>assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Grace of God, by which they have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to resist and repel them. These are the
<hi>natural</hi> Uses of those <hi>bad</hi> Examples recorded in
<hi>Scripture;</hi> and therefore, if instead of making
these Uses of them, some Men pervert them to
<hi>bad</hi> Purposes, that is <hi>their</hi> Faults and not the
<hi>Scriptures.</hi> It is <hi>sufficient</hi> that the <hi>bad</hi> Examples
in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as they are there recorded, are in
themselves of <hi>excellent</hi> Use to the <hi>People;</hi> but
should Men be deprived of the Use of every <hi>good</hi>
Thing they abuse, I would fain know what one
<hi>good</hi> Thing would be left free to their Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And now having proved at large the
Peoples Right and Obligation to Use and Search
the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and answered the <hi>main Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
against it; I shall conclude with these two
Inferences from the whole.</p>
            <p>1. If the <hi>People</hi> are obliged to acquaint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with <hi>Scripture,</hi> then they are obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
upon the Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi> those <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
Truths which it proposes to their Belief.
For to what <hi>other</hi> end should we be obliged to
read and consult the <hi>Word of God,</hi> but only that
we may learn from it what is his Mind and Will?
but how should we learn from <hi>Scripture</hi> what
God's Mind is, if we are not to believe what he
therein declares upon <hi>Scripture</hi> Authority? If I
must not believe when I read the <hi>Scripture</hi> that
this is God's Mind, because the <hi>Scripture</hi> says so,
it is <hi>impossible</hi> I should ever learn God's Mind by
reading it; and consequently I am obliged to
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:63657:225"/>
read it to <hi>no</hi> Purpose: For there is nothing can
teach me what God's Mind is, but that which
gives me <hi>sufficient</hi> Ground to believe that what it
teaches is the Mind of <hi>God.</hi> When therefore I
read the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and find such a Proposition
plainly asserted in it, is this a <hi>sufficient</hi> Ground or
no for me to believe it to be the Mind of <hi>God?</hi>
If it be, then the Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi> is a
<hi>sufficient</hi> Ground for my Belief; If it be not,
then the <hi>Scripture</hi> cannot teach me what God's
Mind is; because it cannot give me <hi>sufficient</hi>
Ground to believe any <hi>one</hi> Proposition in it to be
the Mind of <hi>God.</hi> We are told indeed, that we
are not to receive the Sense of the <hi>Scripture</hi> from
the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but from the <hi>Church,</hi> who alone
hath Authority to Expound it to us, and whose
Expositions in all Matters of Faith are <hi>infallible.</hi>
But if this be so, to what End should we read the
<hi>Scripture,</hi> seeing the only End of Reading is to
learn the Sense of what we read, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this Principle is not to be learnt from
<hi>Scripture?</hi> So that though there be no other <hi>wise</hi>
End of reading the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but only to learn
from it what it means, yet it seems for Men to
read it for this End is a <hi>perfect</hi> Labour in Vain;
seeing it is not from the <hi>Scripture</hi> but from the
<hi>Church</hi> that they are to learn the Meaning of
<hi>Scripture.</hi> For as for the <hi>Scripture,</hi> if these Men
are to be believed, it is nothing but a heap of
<hi>unsensed Characters;</hi> so they expresly term it:
But what do they mean by it? Is it that the
<hi>Scripture</hi> consists of a company of Letters, and
Syllables, and Words, that carry with them no
<hi>determinate</hi> Sense, that <hi>God Almighty</hi> hath written
and published a Book to the World that means
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:63657:225"/>
nothing? If so, then when the <hi>Church</hi> by its <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi>
Authority pretends to expound the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
Her meaning is not to expound the Sense
of it, but to impose a Sense on it which was
never in it; for how can She expound the Sense
of a Book which hath no Sense in it? If the
<hi>Church</hi> is to expound the Sense of <hi>Scripture,</hi> the
<hi>Scripture</hi> must have a <hi>certain determinate</hi> Sense in
it before she expounds it; for to expound the
Sense of <hi>That</hi> which hath no Sense, is Nonsense:
And if the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath a <hi>certain</hi> Sense in it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently
to the <hi>Church</hi>'s Exposition of it, why
do they call it a Parcel of <hi>Vnsensed Characters?</hi>
If their Meaning be only this, that the Sense of
<hi>Scripture</hi> as it is delivered in <hi>Scripture,</hi> is so <hi>obscure</hi>
and <hi>ambiguous,</hi> that without the <hi>infallible</hi> Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Church,</hi> we can never be <hi>certain</hi> what
it is; besides, that this is notoriously <hi>false,</hi> the
<hi>Scripture</hi> in all <hi>necessary</hi> Points both of Faith and
Manners, being so very <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> that any
Man that reads it with an <hi>unprejudiced</hi> Mind, may
be as <hi>certain</hi> of the Sense of it, as he can be of the
Sense of any Writing, and consequently of the
Sense of any <hi>written</hi> Exposition of the <hi>Church;</hi>
besides this, I say, it is <hi>evident,</hi> that whatever
these Men pretend, it is not meerly because of
the obscurity of <hi>Scripture</hi> that they oblige Men
to ground their Faith upon the <hi>Church,</hi> and not
upon the <hi>Scripture.</hi> For they own as well as we,
that in many Things the <hi>Scripture</hi> is very <hi>plain</hi>
and <hi>clear,</hi> and yet they will by no Means allow
Men to ground their Belief of these things upon
the Authority of <hi>Scripture,</hi> but all must be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into the Authority of the <hi>Church.</hi> By which
it is evident, That if all the <hi>Scripture</hi> were as
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:63657:226"/>
               <hi>plain</hi> as the <hi>plainest</hi> Scriptures, they would still
contend for the Necessity of Mens relying upon
the <hi>Church,</hi> and not upon the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that the <hi>true</hi> Reason why they contend
for it, is not because the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>obscure,</hi> but
because they are resolved to advance their <hi>Church</hi>'s
Authority. We own as well as they, that where
the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>obscure;</hi> Men ought to be guided
by the Authority of the <hi>Church,</hi> which we freely
allow to be the <hi>best</hi> Expositor of <hi>Scripture.</hi> But
the <hi>true</hi> State of the Difference between <hi>them</hi>
and <hi>us,</hi> is this, That whereas we require <hi>plain</hi>
Men to judge of <hi>plain</hi> Things with their <hi>own</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
and all Men, so far forth as they
are <hi>capable,</hi> to judge for themselves in Matters
of <hi>Religion,</hi> and not content themselves to see
with the <hi>Church</hi>'s Eyes, where they are able to
see with their <hi>own;</hi> nothing will satisfie these
Men, but to have all Men, as well <hi>Wise</hi> as <hi>Simple,</hi>
surrender <hi>up</hi> their Faith and Judgment to the
<hi>Church,</hi> and wink <hi>hard,</hi> and believe what-ever
the <hi>Church</hi> believes, purely because the <hi>Church</hi>
believes it. Whatever they pretend therefore,
the Truth of the Case is this; They will by no
means allow us to believe upon the Authority
of <hi>Scripture;</hi> not because the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>obscure,</hi>
(though this they pretend, for were it never so
<hi>plain</hi> the Case would be the same) but because
they are <hi>sensible</hi> that this will inevitably subvert
their <hi>usurped</hi> Dominion over the Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of Men. But we must believe upon the
Authority of the <hi>Church;</hi> and who is this <hi>Church</hi>
I beseech you? Why they themselves are this
<hi>Church.</hi> So that whereas <hi>God</hi> hath published
a Book called the <hi>Bible,</hi> on purpose to declare
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:63657:226"/>
his Mind and Will to the World, here are start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>up</hi> a Sort of Men that call themselves the
<hi>Church,</hi> who very gravely tell us; <hi>Sirs, You must
not so much as look into this Book, or if you do, must
not believe any one Word in it upon its own Credit and
Authority. For though we do confess it is the
Word of God, yet we are the sole Iudges of the Sense
of it; and therefore whatsoever we declare is its
Sense, how unlikely soever it may seem to you, you are
bound in Conscience to receive and believe it for this
very Reason, because we declare it. In short, you
must resign up your Eyes, your Faith, your Reason,
and Vnderstandings to us, and see only with our Eyes,
and believe only with our Faith, and judge only with
our Iudgment; and whithersoever we shall think fit
to lead you, you must tamely follow us without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
to examin whether we lead you right or wrong.</hi>
But yet after all to induce us thus to inslave our
Understandings to them they themselves are fain
to appeal to <hi>Scripture,</hi> and allow us in some
Things to judge of the Sense of it, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
those Things upon its Authority. For no
<hi>wise</hi> and <hi>honest</hi> Man will ever believe either that
They are the <hi>Church,</hi> or the <hi>infallible</hi> Judges of
the Sense of <hi>Scripture</hi> without some Proof and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
and for this they are fain to produce se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Texts of <hi>Scripture,</hi> such as, <hi>Thou art Peter,
and upon this Rock will I build my Church.</hi> Now
supposing that to be <hi>true,</hi> which is notoriously <hi>false,
viz.</hi> that those Texts do necessarily imply that
They are the only <hi>true Catholick Church,</hi> and that
as such they are constituted by God <hi>infallible</hi>
Judges of <hi>Scripture;</hi> yet before I can believe so,
I must judge for my self whether this be the
Sense of them or no; and if I judge it is, I must
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:63657:227"/>
believe that they are the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi>
upon the <hi>Scripture</hi>'s Authority and not theirs; for
their Authority is the Thing in debate, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe upon it before I believe it. So then,
though we must believe nothing else upon <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
Authority, yet upon this very Authority
we must believe that they are the <hi>Church,</hi> and
that they are <hi>infallible,</hi> which are the <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
Principles of their <hi>Religion;</hi> that is to say, we
must believe as much upon <hi>Scripture</hi> Authority
as will serve their turn, and no more. But may
I be <hi>certain</hi> of the Truth of these <hi>two Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi>
Principles upon <hi>Scripture</hi> Authority, or
no? If I may, why may I not as well be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
<hi>certain</hi> upon the same Authority of <hi>other</hi>
Principles of <hi>Christianity</hi> as well as those, seeing
there are no <hi>common</hi> Principles of <hi>Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
but what are at least as plainly revealed in
<hi>Scripture</hi> as these. But this will spoil all; for if
Men may be infallibly certain of the Principles
of <hi>Religion</hi> upon <hi>Scripture</hi> Authority, what will
become of the Necessity of Mens relying upon
the <hi>Church,</hi> which is founded upon this Principle
that Men can arrive at no <hi>infallible</hi> Certainty in
<hi>Religion</hi> by relying upon the Authority of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
or indeed any <hi>other</hi> Authority but the
<hi>Church</hi>'s? But if I cannot be infallibly <hi>certain</hi> of
those <hi>two</hi> Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are the <hi>Church,</hi>
and <hi>Infallible,</hi> by those Authorities of <hi>Scripture</hi>
which they urge to prove them, how can
I be infallibly <hi>certain</hi> of any Thing that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
and define? For if I am not <hi>certain</hi> that
they are the <hi>Church,</hi> for all I know the <hi>Church</hi>
may be <hi>infallible,</hi> and yet they may be mistaken;
and if I am not <hi>certain</hi> that they are <hi>infallible,</hi> for
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:63657:227"/>
all I know they may be the <hi>Church,</hi> and yet still
be mistaken. In short, no Authority can render
me infallibly <hi>certain,</hi> but that which is <hi>infallible;</hi>
no <hi>Infallibility</hi> can render me infallibly <hi>certain,</hi>
but that of which I have an <hi>infallible</hi> Certainty.
Either therefore the <hi>Scripture</hi> can render me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
<hi>certain</hi> of the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi>
(and if it cannot, I am sure nothing can) or it
cannot; if it can, why may it not as well render
me infallibly <hi>certain</hi> of <hi>other</hi> Principles of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
which are at least as plainly revealed in it
as that? If it cannot, how can I be infallibly <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
that any Thing she defines and declares to
me is true? If then the Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi>
can give us an <hi>infallible</hi> Certainty, we have as <hi>just</hi>
a Pretence to it as They, it being upon this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
that we ground our Faith; if it cannot,
neither they nor we can justly pretend to it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they can no otherwise be infallibly <hi>certain</hi>
of their <hi>own Infallibility</hi> but by <hi>Scripture.</hi> But the
Truth of it is, <hi>God</hi> never intended either that
<hi>they</hi> or <hi>we</hi> should be infallibly <hi>certain</hi> in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of our <hi>Religion;</hi> for after all the Means of
Certainty that he hath given us he still supposes
that we may err, and plainly tells us that there
must be <hi>Heresies,</hi> and that even from among the
Members of the <hi>true Church,</hi> where <hi>infallible</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
is (if it be any where) there should arise
<hi>false Teachers</hi> who should bring in <hi>damnable</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines;
which could never have happened if he
had left any such Means to his <hi>Church</hi> as should
render her Children infallibly <hi>certain.</hi> All that
he designed was to leave us such <hi>sufficient</hi> Means
of Certainty in <hi>Religion,</hi> as that we might not
err either dangerously or damnably without
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:63657:228"/>
               <hi>our own</hi> Fault. He hath left us his Word, and in
that hath plainly discovered to us all that is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>
for us to believe in order to <hi>eternal</hi> Life.
He hath left us a <hi>standing</hi> Ministry in his <hi>Church</hi>
to explain his <hi>Word</hi> to us, and to guide us in
the Paths of Righteousness and Truth; but still
he requires us to search the <hi>one,</hi> and attend to
the <hi>other</hi> with <hi>honest, humble,</hi> and <hi>teachable</hi> Minds;
and if we do not, we may err not only danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
but damnably, and it is but <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>just</hi> we
should. But if we diligently search the <hi>Scripture,</hi>
and faithfully rely upon its Authority, without
doing of which we search it in vain; if we sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
attend to the <hi>publick</hi> Ministry, with Minds
prepared to receive the Truth in the Love of it;
though we may possibly err in Matters of <hi>less</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet as to all Things <hi>necessary</hi> to our <hi>eternal</hi>
Salvation our Faith shall be inviolably secured;
and this is as much as any <hi>honest</hi> Man needs, or
as any <hi>honest Church</hi> can promise.</p>
            <p>2. From hence also I infer that in the Matters
of our Faith and <hi>Religion, God</hi> doth expect that
we should make use of <hi>our own</hi> Reason and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For to what End should he put us upon
searching the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but that thereby we may
inform our selves what those Things are which
he hath required us to believe and practise? But
if it were his Mind that we should wholly rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Authority of our <hi>Church,</hi> or of our <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ids,</hi> and submit our Faith to their Dictates
without any Examination, what a <hi>needless</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>nt</hi>
Imployment would this be for us, to
search and consult the <hi>Scriptures?</hi> Consult them,
for what, it we are not to follow their Guidance
and Direction, and to take the Measures of our
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:63657:228"/>
Faith and Manners from them? And if for this
End <hi>God</hi> hath obliged us to consult them (as to be
sure it can be for no <hi>other</hi> End) then he hath obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
us to imploy <hi>our own</hi> Reason and Judgment,
to consider what they say, and enquire what they
mean; otherwise he hath obliged us to consult
them to no Purpose. It is as evident therefore that
<hi>God</hi> will have us use <hi>our own</hi> Reason and Judgment
in discerning what we are to believe, and what
not, in <hi>Religion,</hi> and not <hi>lazily</hi> rely upon <hi>others</hi> to
<hi>see,</hi> and <hi>discern,</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> for us, as it is that he
would have us search and consult the <hi>Scriptures;</hi>
and that I think is evident enough, from what
hath been said, to any one that is not resolved to
admit of a Conviction. And indeed seeing our
Reason is the <hi>noblest</hi> Faculty we have, it would
be very strange if <hi>God</hi> should not allow it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle
in the <hi>highest</hi> and most <hi>important</hi> Affair
wherein he hath engaged us; and seeing it is our
Reason only that renders us <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi>
what an <hi>odd</hi> Thing would it be for <hi>God</hi> to forbid
us making use of our Reason in the most <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi>
Concerns of <hi>Religion,</hi> that is, indistinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is <hi>true Religion</hi> from what is <hi>false,</hi> and
what we ought to believe from what we ought to
reject? I know it is pretended by those who urge
the <hi>absolute</hi> Necessity of submitting our Reason to
the <hi>Church,</hi> that they allow Men to make Use of
their <hi>own</hi> Reason and Judgment in discovering
which the <hi>true Church</hi> is, and that all they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for is only this, that when once Men have
found the <hi>true Church</hi> they ought to enquire no
farther, but immediately to deliver up their
Reason and Understanding to it, and believe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Thing it believes without any farther Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:63657:229"/>
So that before Men come into their
<hi>Church,</hi> it seems they are allowed to see for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but after they are <hi>in,</hi> they must wink and
follow their Guides, and depute them to see and
understand for them; which to such Men as are
not quite <hi>sick</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> Reason and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
should methinks be a <hi>great</hi> Temptation to
keep them out of their <hi>Church for ever:</hi> For if I
may judge for my self while I am <hi>out</hi> of it, but
must not while I am <hi>in</hi> it, I must be very <hi>fond</hi> of
parting with my <hi>own</hi> Eyes and Reason if ever I
come into it at all. But suppose I was always <hi>in</hi>
it, and had been bred <hi>up</hi> in its Communion from
my Infancy, will they allow me when I come to
the <hi>full</hi> use of my Reason fairly to question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theirs be the only <hi>true Church</hi> or no, and to
hear the Reasons, and examine the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and
consult the Doctors on both sides? No, by no
means; this I am forbid under the Penalty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deprived of the Benefit of <hi>Priestly Absolution.</hi>
So that in short they will allow me to make Use
of my Reason if I have been bred an <hi>Heretick</hi> in
order to my Reconciliation to their <hi>Church,</hi> but
if I have never been an <hi>Heretick</hi> I must never use
my Reason to examine the Truth either of my
<hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Religion;</hi> that is to say, I may use my
Reason when there is no <hi>other</hi> Remedy, and I
must continue a <hi>Heretick</hi> if I do not: But it were
much better that I had never had Occasion to use
my Reason at all. So that according to these
Men the Use of our Reason in <hi>Religion</hi> is only the
<hi>least</hi> of <hi>two</hi> Evils; it is not so <hi>bad</hi> as to continue
a <hi>Heretick,</hi> but if I had never been one it would
be very <hi>bad,</hi> and a <hi>certain</hi> Way to make me one;
which methinks looks very <hi>odd,</hi> that the Use of
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:63657:229"/>
my Reason should be <hi>necessary</hi> to reduce me from
<hi>Heresy,</hi> and the Disuse of it as <hi>necessary,</hi> when I
am reduced, to preserve me from relapsing into
<hi>Heresy.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>memorable</hi> Passage of the <hi>Bishop of</hi>
St. <hi>Mark</hi> in the <hi>Council of Trent, that Seculars are
obliged humbly to obey that Doctrine of Faith which is
given them by the Church, without disputing or think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
farther of it.</hi> Where by <hi>the Church</hi> he means
the <hi>Clergy</hi> assembled in that <hi>Council.</hi> So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Doctrine the Faith of the
<hi>People</hi> is a <hi>meer</hi> Beast of Burthen, that <hi>right</hi> or
<hi>wrong</hi> must bear all the Load that the <hi>Priests</hi> shall
agree to lay upon it; and though it should feel
it self <hi>oppressed</hi> by them with never such <hi>gross</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
or Absurdities, it must think no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of it, but tamely trudg on without starting
or bogling. At this Rate what Tricks may not
the <hi>Priests</hi> play with the Faith of the <hi>People?</hi> Let
them invent what Doctrins they please to serve
the Interest of their <hi>own</hi> Ambition and Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
the <hi>People</hi> must believe them without
asking <hi>why;</hi> or if they should ask why, they must
expect no <hi>other</hi> Answer but this, because we
have thought to define and declare them. For
it is by no means <hi>allowable</hi> that the <hi>People</hi> should
exercise any <hi>private</hi> Judgment of their <hi>own,</hi> about
Matters of Faith; no, I confess it is not, where
the Matters proposed to their Faith are <hi>false</hi> and
<hi>erroneus;</hi> because it is a <hi>thousand</hi> to one but <hi>one</hi>
time or <hi>other</hi> the <hi>People</hi> will discover the Frauds
and Impostures of the <hi>Priests,</hi> and this would
spoil all. But if the Matters of Faith are <hi>true,</hi> in
all Probability the farther the <hi>People</hi> enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them the better they will be satisfied about
them; and if in the Exercise of their <hi>private</hi>
               <pb n="450" facs="tcp:63657:230"/>
Judgments they should in some <hi>particulars</hi> err,
that is far more <hi>tollerable</hi> than that they should be
utterly deprived of the Means of being able to
give an Answer to every one that asks them a
Reason of the Hope that is in them. But when
<hi>God</hi> hath given the People <hi>reasonable</hi> Faculties on
purpose that by them they may be able to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
what is <hi>true</hi> from what is <hi>false,</hi> for any
Party of Men to forbid them the Use of these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in distinguishing what is <hi>true</hi> from what
is <hi>false</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> in which above all Things they
are most highly concerned, it is a most <hi>injurious</hi>
Usurpation upon the <hi>common</hi> Rights of <hi>humane</hi>
Nature. For by this Means our <hi>best</hi> Faculty is
rendred <hi>useless</hi> to us in our <hi>greatest</hi> Concerns;
and whereas <hi>God</hi> gave it to us on purpose to
guide and direct us, we are utterly deprived of
it's Guidance where we have most need of it, and
where it will prove most <hi>fatal</hi> to us if we should
happen to err and go astray.</p>

            <p>THese Words are a part of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Charge
to his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> wherein he Patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
Exhorts him, as a <hi>Valiant Bishop,</hi> to
take all <hi>possible</hi> Care to preserve the Purity of the
<hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine in his Diocess of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which
at that time abounded with <hi>false</hi> Teachers, whose
Business it was to sow the Tares of Heresie and
<hi>false</hi> Doctrine in that <hi>large</hi> and <hi>fruitful</hi> Field, the
Cultivation whereof St. <hi>Paul</hi> had committed to
his Charge. And that he might discharge this
Office the more effectually, the <hi>Apostle</hi> warns
him in the <hi>first</hi> Place to take Care of himself, that
he did not suffer <hi>his own</hi> Faith and Manners to be
depraved and corrupted by those <hi>leud</hi> and <hi>irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi>
Principles which those <hi>Antichristian</hi> Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries

were then scattering among his People;
that so he might be an Example to his Flock, as

And this, <hi>v.</hi> 18. he presses upon him from the

            </p>
            <p>Before we proceed to the Design of these
Words, it will be <hi>necessary</hi> briefly to explain
some Terms in them; as,
<list>
                  <item>1. What is meant by <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. As for the <hi>fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st,</hi> What is here meant by
<hi>keeping the Faith?</hi> I answer, By this Phrase <hi>Faith,</hi>
we are to understand the <hi>Christian Creed,</hi> or sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
of those <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> Doctrines
whereof the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> is composed: For
at that time there was <hi>little</hi> else professed and
taught in the <hi>Christian</hi> Churches, but only the
<hi>fundamental</hi> Principles of <hi>Christianity,</hi> together
with the <hi>nearest</hi> and most <hi>immediate</hi> Inferences
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:63657:231"/>
from them; so that few then mis-believed but
such as mis-believed in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> and every
Error in Doctrine was generally a Heresie. The
<hi>Christian</hi> Faith in those Days lay within a <hi>narrow</hi>
compass, and so it continued till the Wantonness
and Curiosity of <hi>succeeding</hi> Ages started <hi>disputable</hi>
Opinions, and as they prevailed, <hi>adopted</hi> them
into the Family of Faith; insomuch, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of Time, <hi>sundry</hi> Opinions were received,
that were never so much as heard of in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Age;</hi> and as soon as they were received,
they were presently declared necessary Articles.
And as for the <hi>contradictory</hi> Opinions, though
<hi>Christianity</hi> was little or nothing concerned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false;</hi> yet they seldom
underwent any <hi>milder</hi> Name than <hi>Heresie,</hi> or
<hi>gentler</hi> Doom than Damnation; which hath been
one of the <hi>grand</hi> Occasions of all the Ruptures
and Divisions that have happened in the <hi>Christian</hi>
World. But as for the Faith which the <hi>Apostle</hi>
here speaks of, it was of a much <hi>less</hi> Bulk than
what it is now arrived to by rolling through the
<hi>wild</hi> Opiniatry of <hi>Sixteen Disputation Ages,</hi> which
by degrees have swelled it from a <hi>short</hi> script in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>large</hi> Volume. For if we look into the <hi>New
Testament,</hi> and into the Writings of the most
<hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> we shall find the Sums of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Faith therein contained, consisting of very
<hi>few</hi> Articles, and those such only as are <hi>essential</hi>
to <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> and such as wherein almost
all the <hi>differing</hi> Persuasions of <hi>Christians</hi> do to this
Day concenter. To hold the Faith therefore is
to persevere immovably in the Profession of the
<hi>true Christian</hi> Doctrine, so far as in us lies, and
not to be prevailed upon to desert or forsake it,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:63657:232"/>
either through <hi>Fear</hi> of Persecution, or <hi>Hope</hi> of
<hi>Temporal</hi> Advantage, or the <hi>Knavish</hi> Arts and <hi>Sly</hi>
Insinuations of <hi>False</hi> Teachers.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>second</hi> Term to be here explained, is,
What is meant by keeping a <hi>good Conscience?</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in general is nothing but our <hi>practical</hi>
Judgment directing us what we ought to <hi>do,</hi> and
what to <hi>avoid,</hi> and <hi>approving</hi> or <hi>reproving,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as we follow its Directions, or run counter
to them. The Conscience therefore is <hi>good</hi> or
<hi>bad,</hi> according as the Directions are which it
gives for the Government of our Lives and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
If our Judgment be <hi>false</hi> and <hi>erroneous,</hi>
and directs us to <hi>do</hi> what we ought to <hi>avoid,</hi> or to
<hi>avoid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> what we ought to <hi>do,</hi> it is a <hi>bad</hi> Conscience,
that instead of being a Light to guide our Steps
in the Paths of Righteousness, is only a <hi>wandring
Night-fire</hi> that leads us into Bogs and Quagmires.
As on the contrary, A <hi>good</hi> Conscience is our
<hi>practical</hi> Judgment well informed, and truly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
us in the Course of our Actions what we
ought to <hi>do,</hi> and what to <hi>avoid:</hi> For a <hi>good</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is the <hi>true</hi> Eccho of <hi>God</hi> within us, that
faithfully resounds his Voice, and upon all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of Action, repeats after him to our
Wills and Affections. To keep a <hi>good</hi> Conscience
therefore implies <hi>two</hi> Things: <hi>First,</hi> To main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in our Minds a <hi>true</hi> Sense of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi>
and so far forth as in us lies, to preserve our
<hi>practical</hi> Judgment <hi>pure</hi> from all <hi>false</hi> Principles
of Action, and not to suffer either our <hi>vicious</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
or <hi>wordly</hi> Interest to warp and seduce
it, and cause it to mistake <hi>Evil</hi> for <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Good</hi>
for <hi>Evil. Secondly,</hi> It implies our following the
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:63657:232"/>
Dictates and Directions of a <hi>good</hi> Conscience, our
doing what it <hi>bids,</hi> and abstaining from what it
<hi>forbids,</hi> and faithfully resigning our selves to its
Conduct and Government, and not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon by any Temptation whatsoever to
act counter to its Sense and Persuasion. In short,
To keep a <hi>good Conscience</hi> is to live in a <hi>strict</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the Dictates of a <hi>well-informed</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and not to allow our selves in any Course
of Action which this Vice-God within us forbids
or disapproves.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Third</hi> Term to be explained in the
Text, is, What is meant <hi>by putting away a good
Conscience?</hi> which being directly opposed here to
keeping a <hi>good Conscience,</hi> must denote the
Contraries to it. To put away a <hi>good Conscience</hi>
therefore is either, <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rst,</hi> to corrupt <hi>our own</hi>
Judgment of Things and Actions out of <hi>vicious</hi>
Affection or <hi>worldly</hi> Interest, and impose upon
our selves <hi>false</hi> Notions of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil;</hi> or,
<hi>secondly,</hi> to act directly contrary to our Sense
and Persuasion; to leave <hi>undone</hi> those Things
which <hi>our own</hi> Conscience tells us we ought to
<hi>do,</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> those Things which it tells us we
ought not to <hi>do.</hi> In short, To put away a <hi>good
Conscience</hi> is to live in any <hi>known</hi> Course of Sin,
either of <hi>Omission</hi> or <hi>Commission;</hi> to practise
Contradictions to <hi>our own</hi> Judgments, and to
follow the Inclinations of our Wills against the
Light and Conviction of our Consciences.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>last</hi> Enquiry, is, What is here meant
by making <hi>shipwrack of the Faith?</hi> which being
here set in Opposition to <hi>holding,</hi> or <hi>keeping the
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:63657:233"/>
Faith,</hi> must signifie oppositely, and consequently
must denote not holding and keeping it; or
which is the same thing, losing and abandoning
it: For in this <hi>Allegory,</hi> the <hi>true Christian</hi> Faith is
represented as a Ship, and a <hi>good Conscience,</hi> or a
<hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Life as the Pilot, that steers and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
it. And indeed, in that State of Things
there was no <hi>other</hi> Pilot, but Purity of Conscience
and Holiness of Life was able to conduct and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this Ship, and carry it <hi>safe</hi> through those
<hi>incessant</hi> Storms of Persecution, wherein at that
time it was toss'd and agitated. For when <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
have once thrown <hi>off</hi> the Obligations of a
<hi>good Conscience,</hi> by abandoning themselves to a
<hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>dissolute</hi> Life, what is there left to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
them from abandoning their Faith when it
stands in Competition with their worldly Ease and
Interest? And though there should be no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
between their Faith and Interest, but
they might freely enjoy them both without any
Disturbance; yet their <hi>wicked</hi> Lives will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
tempt them to corrupt their Faith with
<hi>wicked</hi> Principles; of which <hi>later</hi> in the next
Verse, he gives an <hi>eminent</hi> instance in <hi>Hymenaeus,</hi>
who had not wholly deserted <hi>Christianity,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
renounced <hi>one Fundamental</hi> Article of it, <hi>viz.</hi>
The Resurrection of the Dead: As of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
he gives <hi>another</hi> Instance in <hi>Alexander,</hi> who
as it seems probable, had through the Fear of
Persecution deserted <hi>Christianity</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>The Words thus explained may be resolved
into this Sense, <hi>That Mens living wickedly against
the Convictions and Obligations of their Conscience,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth very much expose them to Apostacy from true
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:63657:233"/>
Religion into gross and impious Errors.</hi> Thus to <hi>the
love of money, which is the root of all evil, the Apostle</hi>
attributes Men's Erring <hi>from the Faith,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.
10. And that which exposed those <hi>silly women,</hi>
2 Tim. 3. 6. to the Seduction of <hi>false</hi> Teachers,
was their being <hi>laden with sins,</hi> and <hi>led away with
divers lusts.</hi> And the same <hi>Apostle</hi> ascribes <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>'s
Apostacy to his Covetousness, or <hi>inordinate
love of this present world,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 10. But that
I may evince this Truth more fully, I shall give
you some <hi>particular</hi> Instances of the <hi>mighty</hi> Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies
there are in every <hi>vicious</hi> Course of Life
to Error and Apostacy from <hi>true Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It <hi>corrupts</hi> and <hi>debauches</hi> Men's Reason and
Understanding.</p>
            <p>2. It renders the Principles of <hi>true Religion
uneasie</hi> to their Minds.</p>
            <p>3. It deprives Men of the <hi>highest</hi> Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Constancy and Stedfastness in <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. It weakens the <hi>natural</hi> Force of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
which is the <hi>greatest</hi> Restraint from
<hi>Apostacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. It strengthens the Temptations to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy.</p>
            <p>6. It provokes <hi>God</hi> to give us <hi>up</hi> to the Power
of Delusion.</p>
            <p>1. Living in any <hi>known</hi> and <hi>willful</hi> Course of
Sin, corrupts and debauches Mens Reason and
Understandings. So long as a Man lives in any
<hi>known</hi> Sin he doth not only live without, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Reason, which instead of being the
Guide of his Actions, hath nothing at all to do
with them, but like an <hi>idle</hi> Spectator, doth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:63657:234"/>
behold the <hi>bruitish</hi> Scene without any Part or
Concern in it. And whilst a Man thus abandons
himself to the Government of his own <hi>blind</hi> Will,
and lives not only in the <hi>perpetual</hi> Neglect, but
Contempt of his Reason, it is impossible for him
not to waste and impair it. For as our <hi>rational</hi>
Faculties are improved and perfected by Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
so they naturally languish and decay, through
Disuse and Inactivity; and consequently the <hi>less</hi>
Use we make of them in the Government of our
Lives and Actions, which is their <hi>proper</hi> Office
and Employment, like <hi>standing</hi> Waters they must
corrupt and putrisie. And indeed there is no
<hi>impure</hi> Lust but doth by its own <hi>natural</hi> Efficacy
disable Mens Reason and Understanding: For
while we are in these Bodies, our Mind is fain to
work by <hi>bodily</hi> Instruments, and to make Use of
<hi>Brains,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> in all its Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and according as their Temper is <hi>good</hi> or
<hi>bad,</hi> its Operations will be <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less perfect:</hi>
But while a Man indulges himself in any <hi>impure</hi>
Affection, that will naturally distemper these
Organs of his Mind, and indispose them for the
Use of his Reason. For so Madness, which is
such a Distemperature of the <hi>Brain,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi>
and <hi>Spirits,</hi> as doth wholly alienate them from
the Use of Reason and Discourse, is usually found
to be the Effect of some <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>extravagant</hi>
Affection, such as <hi>Pride,</hi> or <hi>Covetousness, Anger,</hi>
or <hi>Fearfulness, Iealousie,</hi> or <hi>Lust;</hi> and if these
Passions, being once arrived to their <hi>utmost</hi> Rage
and Excess, do so often run into <hi>down-right</hi> Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Distraction, to be sure every <hi>inordinate</hi>
Degree of them must be a Tendency towards
it, a <hi>great</hi> Disturbance of Mind, though not a
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:63657:234"/>
               <hi>total</hi> Distraction; and by how much they exceed
their <hi>due</hi> Bounds and Measures, by so much they
must taint and vitiate these <hi>necessary</hi> Instruments
of our Mind and Reason. Thus every <hi>inordinate</hi>
Lust doth by a <hi>natural</hi> Influence disturb Mens
Reason, and fully the clearness of their <hi>discerning</hi>
Faculties. So that what <hi>Clearness</hi> is to the Eye of
the Body, that <hi>Purity</hi> from <hi>vicious</hi> Affection is
to the Eye of the Mind; it brightens its Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions,
and renders its Conceptions of Things
more <hi>quick, distinct,</hi> and <hi>vigorous:</hi> Whereas on
the contrary, all <hi>disorderly</hi> Affection doth <hi>more</hi> or
<hi>less</hi> cloud and disturb the Brain, chill or inflame
the Spirits, hurry them into <hi>tumultuous</hi> Motions,
or render them <hi>listless</hi> and <hi>unactive;</hi> by which
<hi>continual</hi> Disorders, our <hi>discerning</hi> Faculties must
by Degrees be extreamly weakened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.
And whilst the Mind is thus <hi>lost</hi> in
the Fogs of <hi>inordinate</hi> Affection, it is an <hi>easie</hi>
Matter to seduce and mislead it, it being through
the Dimness of its sight apt to be imposed upon
by <hi>false</hi> Colours, and tinctured with Prejudice
and <hi>undue</hi> Apprehensions of Things. <hi>Weak</hi>
Minds are easily abused, especially in Matters of
<hi>Religion,</hi> which being placed beyond the Prospect
of Sense, require a <hi>sevorer.</hi> Attention in order to
the forming of <hi>right</hi> Apprehensions concerning
them; and therefore the <hi>more</hi> Men weaken their
Understandings by their Lusts, the <hi>more</hi> they
must be exposed to Errors and Delusions. But
then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>2. Living in any <hi>known</hi> Course of Sin, renders
the Principles of <hi>true Religion</hi> uneasie to Mens
Minds. Whilst a Man leads a <hi>wicked</hi> Life, his
<hi>Religious</hi> Principles, if they are <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>true,</hi> will
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:63657:235"/>
perpetually reproach and upbraid him: For
there are no Contraries in Nature more <hi>irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable</hi>
to <hi>one another</hi> than <hi>true</hi> Faith and <hi>bad</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
the <hi>great</hi> Design of all <hi>true</hi> Faith being to
move and persuade Men to abstain from all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness,
and <hi>to live soberly, righteously, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this present World.</hi> If therefore a Man's
Faith be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>genuine,</hi> he cannot live wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without acting against the <hi>full</hi> Persuasion of
his <hi>own</hi> Mind, which must necessarily render
him very <hi>uneasie;</hi> for in this State of Things he
acts with a <hi>self-condemning</hi> Judgment, and every
Compliance with his Inclination sets him at odds
with his Reason; all the while he is meditating
any <hi>wicked</hi> Design, he struggles with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and confronts and outrages his <hi>own</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions;
and when he hath acted it, every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
he makes on it is a <hi>bitter</hi> Invective against
himself: Thus so long as the Principles of <hi>true
Religion</hi> possess his Mind, he finds himself conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
hagg'd and oppressed by them; they sit
as an <hi>uneasie</hi> Load upon his Soul, and will not
suffer him to Sin in quiet, but perpetually cause
his <hi>sinful</hi> Delights to go <hi>off</hi> with an <hi>ungrateful</hi>
Farewel, and recoil upon him in many a <hi>sickly</hi>
Qualm and Convulsion. In which State of
Things he hath no <hi>other</hi> Remedy, but either to
forsake his Principles, or his Lusts; or to live
in <hi>perpetual</hi> Variance with himself; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if he still resolve to Sin on, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
he will soon grow quite weary of <hi>true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
and quit his Mind as soon as possibly he
can of those <hi>stern</hi> and <hi>inflexible</hi> Principles which
create these Discords in his Breast. And whilst
he is in this Temper it will be an <hi>easie</hi> matter to
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:63657:235"/>
pervert him to any <hi>Religion</hi> that will give Ease to
his <hi>straitlaced</hi> Conscience, and cast a more <hi>favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Aspect on his Lust: For being resolved to follow
his <hi>vicious</hi> Inclinations he now sees through them,
and understands by them; and whilst his Mind
runs upon the <hi>false</hi> Biass of his Lusts, that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
which is most <hi>grateful</hi> to them will seem
most <hi>reasonable</hi> to him. Shew him a way how he
may worship <hi>God</hi> acceptably without the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of a <hi>strict</hi> Attention, and the <hi>inward</hi> Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a <hi>pure</hi> Heart, and <hi>heavenly</hi> Affections;
meerly by numbering so many Prayers on a String
of Beads, by seeing a Priest act over such a Set
of Ceremonies, and hearing him in <hi>varied</hi> Tones
sometimes pronounce, and sometimes murmur a
<hi>Form of Words</hi> in an <hi>Vnknown Language;</hi> and
though at first view it may seem very <hi>absurd</hi> to
him, yet the very Loosness and Carnality will be
apt to engage his Affections to it, and then they
by Degrees will go near to wheedle his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
into a more <hi>favourable</hi> Opinion of it.
Propose to him an Expedient how he may go to
<hi>Heaven</hi> at last without undergoing the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>verities
of a <hi>sincere</hi> Repentance and Amendment; tell
him that there is a <hi>certain Church</hi> in the World
whose Priests, if he confess his Sins to them with
any Degree of Sorrow and Remorse, have <hi>full</hi>
Power to pardon and absolve him; so that if he
do but take Care not to die without Confession,
however he lives he cannot miscary for ever.
He may indeed go into a very <hi>hot</hi> Place called
<hi>Purgatory,</hi> and there suffer a while very <hi>grievous</hi>
Things before he get to <hi>Heaven;</hi> but if instead of
parting with his Lusts while he lives, he will part
with his Mony when he dies, he may at <hi>easy</hi> Rates
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:63657:236"/>
purchase of that <hi>Church</hi> such a Number of <hi>Masses,
Requiems,</hi> and <hi>Indulgencies,</hi> as will in all Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
soon procure his Dismission from those <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary</hi>
Sufferings into <hi>eternal</hi> Happiness: How <hi>od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
soever this Doctrine may appear to his Reason,
to be sure it will be <hi>charming</hi> enough to his Lusts;
and when once a Mans Lusts are retained the
Cause is half carried at the Bar of his Judgment.
And so in all <hi>other</hi> Instances it is a <hi>great</hi> Disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to <hi>true Religion,</hi> and as <hi>great</hi> an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to <hi>false,</hi> that Mens Faith and Reason are so
much swayed and byass'd by their Lusts. For
though there is no <hi>Religion</hi> can be <hi>true</hi> but what is
<hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> yet it is the Holiness of <hi>true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
that doth provoke their Lusts against it, and
'tis their Lusts that do provoke their Reason;
and when all is done there is nothing doth more
strongly incline, or frequently pervert <hi>depraved</hi>
and <hi>wicked</hi> Minds to <hi>false Religion</hi> than its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with their <hi>vicious</hi> Affections, though this
very Thing is one of the most <hi>certain</hi> Signs in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of its Falsehood.</p>
            <p>3. Living in any <hi>known</hi> Course of Sin deprives
Men of the <hi>greatest</hi> Encouragements to Constancy
and Steadiness in the <hi>true Religion:</hi> For doubtless
the <hi>highest</hi> Encouragement to Perservance in the
Truth against all Oppositions and Temptations, is
the Hope of those <hi>glorious</hi> Rewards that await them
in the World to come. 'Twas this that guarded
the Faith of the <hi>antient</hi> Martyrs safe through all
the Rage and Cruelty of their Persecutors, their
having an Eye to the Recompence of Reward, the
Sight of which inspired the <hi>drooping</hi> Souls with
an <hi>invincible</hi> Courage; made them despise <hi>Racks,</hi>
and <hi>Wheels,</hi> and <hi>Flames,</hi> and exalt and triumph
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:63657:236"/>
under the most <hi>exqisite</hi> Torments. And indeed
what <hi>less</hi> Encouragement than the Hope of being
eternally <hi>happy</hi> within a <hi>few</hi> Moments could have
enabled a Company of <hi>tender</hi> Virgins, <hi>delicate</hi>
Matrons, <hi>infirm</hi> and <hi>aged</hi> Bishops to endure those
<hi>long</hi> and <hi>dolorous</hi> Martyrdoms, as many times they
did, when their Tormentors took their Turns from
Morn to Night, and plyed them with all Kinds
of Tortures till oftentimes they were forced to
give over; and confess themselves overcome ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through Weariness or Compassion? But
now by indulging our selves in any <hi>known</hi> Course
of Sin we throw away this <hi>Sovereign</hi> Cordial,
and leave our selves <hi>naked</hi> and <hi>destitute</hi> of all the
<hi>mighty</hi> Supports it is able to give us under any
Temptation to Apostacy. For how can we hope
for any Good from <hi>God,</hi> and much <hi>less</hi> for so
<hi>great</hi> a Good as a <hi>Heaven</hi> of <hi>immortal</hi> Joys amounts
to, whilst we persist in <hi>open</hi> Rebellion against
him; especially when he hath expresly suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this <hi>mighty</hi> Recompence upon our <hi>constant</hi> and
<hi>faithful</hi> Obedience to his Will, and told us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beforehand, that we might know what to trust
to, that if we fail of <hi>this</hi> he will be so far from
admitting us into that Place and State of Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that he will banish us <hi>for ever</hi> from his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
into <hi>outer</hi> Darkness, and <hi>eternal</hi> Wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Despair? When by <hi>wilful</hi> Sin therefore
we have cast away our hope of Heaven, what
have we left to support our Constancy to the
Truth if ever we should be called to suffer for it?
How can it be expected that rather than renounce
our <hi>Religion,</hi> we should be contented to part
with our <hi>Goods,</hi> or <hi>Liberties,</hi> or <hi>Lives,</hi> when
all our Hope is shut up in this Life, and we have
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:63657:237"/>
no Prospect of Compensation either <hi>here</hi> or <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after?</hi>
If ever therefore we would be <hi>stedfast</hi> to
the Truth against all Temptations, we must
above all Things take Care by a <hi>holy</hi> Life to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
and keep alive the Hopes of <hi>Heaven</hi> in our
Breasts, which is the only Anchor that can hold
and secure us in a <hi>stormy</hi> Sea from making Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
of our Faith.</p>
            <p>4. Living in any <hi>known</hi> Course of Sin weakens
the <hi>natural</hi> Force of Mens Consciences, which is
the <hi>greatest</hi> Restraint from Apostacy. Indeed,
for Men to <hi>apostatize</hi> from their <hi>Religion</hi> to secure
their <hi>worldly</hi> Interest is a Thing so <hi>base</hi> and <hi>infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,</hi>
so <hi>foul</hi> an Instance of a <hi>cowardly, degenerous,</hi>
and <hi>prostitute</hi> Soul, that if a Man were under no
<hi>other</hi> Restraint but only that Sense of Honour that
is lodged in all <hi>brave</hi> Minds, he would scorn so
<hi>mean,</hi> so <hi>poor</hi> a Condescention. But yet when all
is done, there is no such <hi>powerful</hi> Restraint upon
Men as that of a <hi>good</hi> Conscience, which is the
<hi>natural</hi> Bridle by which <hi>God</hi> curbs our <hi>head-strong</hi>
Nature, and keeps it from flying out into all the
<hi>wild</hi> Extravagancies it is inclined to. For it is
from <hi>God</hi> and in God's stead that Conscience acts,
who is the most <hi>powerful</hi> Being in the World:
When it <hi>commands,</hi> it is with God's Authority;
when it <hi>rebukes,</hi> it is with God's Majesty; when
it <hi>applauds,</hi> it is with God's Complacency: It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not upon Principles of <hi>mere</hi> Policy or Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which require us to act this way <hi>now,</hi>
and <hi>anon</hi> the contrary, as Circumstances alter;
but upon the <hi>awful</hi> Principles of Divinity, which
oblige us by all that we can hope or fear <hi>for ever,</hi>
and require of us the self same Things and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in all Circumstances; and the <hi>sole</hi> Reason it
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:63657:237"/>
insists on is the Will of <hi>God,</hi> whose Pleasure or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
can make us <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>miserable</hi> for ever. The
Voice of Conscience is not, <hi>This I judge most expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for thee to do, and this to avoid;</hi> but <hi>this thou must
do, and this avoid as thou tenderest the Love of God
and dreadest his everlasting Hatred and Revenge:</hi>
And it is no less than <hi>eternal</hi> Bliss that Conscience
allures our Hope with, and <hi>eternal</hi> Vengance that
it alarms our Fear with; and if Men will not be
witheld by such <hi>powerful</hi> Restraints as these, what
can withold them? Whilst therefore a Man che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes
his Conscience by complying with it and
following its Directions, this, if any Thing, will
secure his stedfastness to the Truth against all
Temptations; whilst this hath any Power over
him, he will as soon eat Fire as <hi>sacrifice</hi> his Faith
to his Interest. For, for a Man to renounce his
<hi>Religion</hi> upon any Prospect of <hi>temporal</hi> Gain or
Loss, is such a <hi>flagitious</hi> Violation of all that is
<hi>Sacred,</hi> such a <hi>monstrous</hi> Instance of <hi>High-Treason</hi>
against <hi>God,</hi> such an <hi>open</hi> Blasphemy of his Truth,
such a <hi>bold</hi> Defyance of his Majesty, and in a
word, such a Complication of <hi>vile</hi> Perfidy, <hi>base</hi>
Ingratitude, and <hi>impious</hi> Falsehood, that but to
think of it is like looking down from a <hi>stupendous</hi>
Precipice, that swims the Head, and strikes the
Mind with Horror and Amazement; so that
while a Man's Conscience hath any Power over
him, he will no more be able to prevail with
himself to commit the <hi>one,</hi> than to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
headlong down from the <hi>other,</hi> whilst he is
under the Horror of the Prospect; and he will
find it much more <hi>easy</hi> to endure the worst of
Persecutions, than to commit such an Outrage
and Violence on his Conscience, and undergo
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:63657:238"/>
those <hi>horrible</hi> Reflections and <hi>stinging</hi> Remorses
that must follow it: But after a Man by wilful
<hi>Sinning,</hi> hath often wounded his Conscience, the
<hi>natural</hi> Tenderness of it will by Degrees wear
off, till at length it grows quite <hi>callous</hi> and <hi>insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</hi>
For what is reported of <hi>Methridates,</hi> that
by often drinking of Poison, he had so <hi>familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>
it to his Constitution, that at length it sate
quietly on his Stomach, and gave him no Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
is true of Conscience, which at first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coils
at every <hi>sinful</hi> Potion, and cannot swallow
it without suffering <hi>violent</hi> Spasms and Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but having been awhile accustomed to it,
it by Degrees grows more and more <hi>natural,</hi> till
at length it goes glibly <hi>down</hi> without straining,
and goes quietly <hi>off</hi> without Remorse or Relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance.
And when once a Man's Conscience
is frozen over by a Custom of Sinning, it
will every day grow <hi>harder</hi> and <hi>harder,</hi> and
at length be able to bear the <hi>heaviest</hi> Loads
of Guilt without Relenting; and when once
Things are reduced to this State, <hi>Good</hi> and
<hi>Evil, Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> are Things <hi>indifferent</hi> to
him which he chuses or refuses as they come to
hand, and are <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less subservient</hi> to his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
Conveni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce. He can <hi>blaspheme,</hi> and <hi>pray,
oppress</hi> and <hi>give Alms</hi> with the same Unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
of Mind; and to act the <hi>Devil</hi> or the <hi>Saint</hi>
are Parts so <hi>indifferent</hi> to him, that he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them both with the same Remorslessness. And
when a Man is thus got loose from the Restraints
of his Conscience there is nothing so <hi>bad</hi> that can
come amiss to him. If therefore while he stands
in this Posture his <hi>temporal</hi> Interest should chance
to beckon him to change the <hi>best Religion</hi> in the
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:63657:238"/>
World for the <hi>worst;</hi> to pray to <hi>insensible</hi> Images
and <hi>dead</hi> Mens Ghosts instead of the <hi>everliving
God;</hi> to let go Substances to catch at Shadows
and Ceremonies, and to part with the most <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi>
Truths for the most <hi>palpable</hi> and <hi>fulsom</hi>
Contradictions; he hath no Principle in him
<hi>strong</hi> enough to withold him from a <hi>base</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
his Conscience being laid fast asleep,
which whilst awake would have trembled at
such an <hi>horrid</hi> Proposal. And though by thus
prostituting his Faith to his Interest, he at once
renounces his <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Saviour,</hi> and all his Hopes
of <hi>future</hi> Immortality; yet his <hi>insensible</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morsless</hi>
Heart is no more toucht or affected with
it, than if it were the <hi>slightest</hi> Peccadillo. Thus
by letting go a <hi>good Conscience</hi> Men pave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
an <hi>easie</hi> Way to Apostacy from <hi>true Religion,</hi>
which otherwise would be one of the most
<hi>craggy</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi> Passages in all the High-Way
to <hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Living in any <hi>known</hi> Course of Sin doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much strengthen and enforce the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to Apostacy. He who lives under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and Government of a <hi>good Conscience,</hi> takes
Care to regulate his Affections towards the
Things of this World, so, as neither to fear the
<hi>Evils</hi> of it <hi>too</hi> much, nor love the <hi>Goods</hi> of it <hi>too</hi>
well; but makes a <hi>just</hi> and <hi>equal</hi> Estimate of both,
and by that proportions his Affections towards
them; and he who doth this, disarms them of
their <hi>tempting</hi> Power, which is chiefly owing to
our selves, and the <hi>false</hi> Estimate we make of
them. 'Tis <hi>our own</hi> Imagination that gives Life
and Efficacy to the Charms and Terrors of the
World, and renders them so <hi>successful</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious:</hi>
               <pb n="468" facs="tcp:63657:239"/>
We fancy <hi>that</hi> to be in them which is
not, and so are affected not so much with the
Things themselves, as with the <hi>false</hi> Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
that we make of them. But he, who by
following the Dictates of a <hi>good Conscience,</hi> hath
reduced his <hi>wild</hi> Affections within the Lists of
Reason and Sobriety, can from thence defie the
World, and maintain his Post against all its
Temptations. He loves its <hi>Goods</hi> no better than
they deserve, and consequently he loves them
not so well as to part with his Virtue, his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
and his Soul for them. He dreads its
<hi>Evils</hi> no farther than they are truly <hi>dreadful,</hi> and
consequently is fully satisfied, that to Sin is much
more <hi>dreadful</hi> than to suffer; and he hath found
by often Experience, that in the <hi>faithful</hi> discharge
of his Duty, there is far more <hi>Peace,</hi> more <hi>Ioy,</hi>
and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> than in all the <hi>vain</hi> Allurements
of this World. He hath found another <hi>Heaven</hi>
upon Earth, besides these <hi>temporary</hi> Enjoyments;
a <hi>Heaven</hi> within <hi>his own</hi> Breast composed of <hi>joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
Hopes, and <hi>blessed</hi> Expectations; and in this
<hi>Heaven</hi> hath often found himself a thousand times
more <hi>happy</hi> than among all the Festivities of an
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arthly</hi> Paradise; and therefore knows very well
that he is bid to his Loss when ever he is tempted
to exchange the <hi>one</hi> for the <hi>other.</hi> He is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sensible, having already found it to his Smart,
that by Sinning he shall sustain a much <hi>heavier</hi>
Loss, and expose himself to far more <hi>exquisite</hi>
Agonies of Mind than any this World can
threaten him with all; and therefore certainly
reckons upon it, that when ever to avoid a Sin
he incurs a Suffering, he wisely chooses of <hi>two</hi>
Evils the <hi>least.</hi> And while his Soul stands thus
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:63657:239"/>
affected, it is <hi>shot-proof</hi> against all Temptations,
and much more against those Temptations which
sollicite him to renounce his <hi>Religion,</hi> and in which
he knows by Experience there is far more <hi>Good</hi>
than the World can propose to him in Exchange
for it. He knows both how <hi>little</hi> the World,
and how much <hi>true Religion</hi> is worth; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made a <hi>just</hi> Estimate of both, to propose
to him any <hi>worldly</hi> Hope as a Price for his Faith,
is the same Thing as to offer a Miser Dross for
his Gold. His Mind is fixed in this Persuasion,
that all the Mischiefs <hi>this</hi> World can do him are
<hi>inconsiderable</hi> to one who must live <hi>for ever</hi> in
<hi>another</hi> unspeakably <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rable;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to threaten him into Apostacy with any
<hi>worldly</hi> Fear, is to attempt to blow <hi>up</hi> a Rock of
Marble with a Squib of Wild-fire. But when
once a Man hath taken <hi>off</hi> the Restraints of his
Conscience from his <hi>wild</hi> Affections, and let
them loose to the World, they will aid and assist
its Temptations against him, and animate them
with a thousand times more Life and Vigour
than is in their <hi>own</hi> Natures. For as for the
<hi>Goods</hi> of this World, they could never bewitch
us as they do, did we not give a Dress to them;
we paint their Faces, and varnish them over
with an <hi>artificial</hi> Beauty, and then fall in Love
with <hi>our own</hi> Fucus; and so much as we value
and affect them beyond their <hi>natural</hi> Worth, so
much Power we give them to conquer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave
us. When therefore by leading a <hi>sensual</hi>
and <hi>wicked</hi> Life, a Man has wholly devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the World, he hath put himself into the
Worlds Power to be commanded and disposed
of as it pleases. And now if any <hi>worldly Good</hi>
               <pb n="470" facs="tcp:63657:240"/>
beckons and invites him, his <hi>mad</hi> Affection will
presently hurry him after it, though it be through
<hi>thick</hi> and <hi>thin,</hi> through the most <hi>flagitious</hi> and
<hi>enormous</hi> Courses. If any <hi>worldly Evil</hi> threaten
and alarm him, he must immediately fly, though
it be from <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Innocence,</hi> from <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Heaven,</hi> and all that is <hi>Sacred</hi> in <hi>Religion.</hi> His
Affections have render'd him a <hi>meer</hi> Laquey to
the <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Evils</hi> that are <hi>without</hi> him, and
whither ever they send him, he must go, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they lead him, he must follow, let their
Vagaries be never so <hi>wild</hi> or <hi>wicked.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
while his Soul is thus inslaved to the World,
he should be tempted by it to <hi>Apostatize</hi> from his
<hi>Religion,</hi> what hath he to restrain or secure him?
For ever since he got loose from his Conscience,
he is wholly led by his Affections, and these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
chained and fastned to the World, hale him
after it which way soever it moves. So long as
his <hi>Religion</hi> and his <hi>worldly</hi> Interest consist, and
go hand in hand, he is very well content to own
and follow it; but if ever a Storm of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should part them, in all Probability he will
follow his Interest, and like the <hi>treacherous Orpha,</hi>
give his <hi>Religion</hi> a <hi>parting</hi> Kiss and leave it. For
his Heart is now so wedded to the World that
he esteems nothing so <hi>good</hi> as its <hi>Goods,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so <hi>evil</hi> as its <hi>Evils;</hi> and the <hi>one</hi> being his
<hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> his <hi>Hell,</hi> all other Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
are overcome by them; and to obtain
the <hi>one,</hi> and avoid the <hi>other</hi> he must stick at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
no not at renouncing his <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
together with all his <hi>Hopes</hi> of a <hi>future</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="471" facs="tcp:63657:240"/>
6. And lastly. Living in any <hi>known</hi> Course of
Sin provokes <hi>God</hi> to give us up to the Power
of Delusion: For so long as Men submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Guidance and Direction of a <hi>good
Conscience,</hi> the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> who is a Spirit of
Truth abides with them, and not only directs
their Wills, but also informs their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and enables them to discern the Beauty
and Reality of those <hi>heavenly</hi> Truths, which he
hath revealed to us in the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> For
though, since he hath revealed already the whole
Will of <hi>God</hi> to us concerning our <hi>eternal</hi> Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we have no Reason to expect that he will
reveal <hi>new</hi> Truths to us; yet seeing so far forth,
as it is <hi>necessary,</hi> he hath promised and engaged,
that he will co-operate with us to enable us as
well to understand the Will of <hi>God</hi> as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it; we have the <hi>greatest</hi> Reason in the
World to depend upon it, that so long as we
cherish his <hi>heavenly</hi> Inspirations, by yielding to
them our <hi>free</hi> and <hi>ready</hi> Compliance, he will
be so far an <hi>ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sting Genius</hi> to our Understandings,
as to suggest to us those Truths which he hath
already revealed, and set them before our Eyes
in so <hi>fair</hi> a Light, as that we shall not fail more
clearly to discern, and more distinctly to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
them than otherwise we should or could
have done. For when he writes his Truth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Minds, it is with such a <hi>Victorious</hi> Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam
as will endure neither Cloud nor Shadow
before it. Whenever he speaks, He speaks not
to our Ears but to our Minds, and represents
Things nakedly and immediately to our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.
He converses with our Spirits, as
<hi>Spirits</hi> do with <hi>Spirits,</hi> without involving his
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:63657:241"/>
Sense in <hi>articulate</hi> Sounds or <hi>material</hi> Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
but objects it to us in its own <hi>naked</hi>
Light, and <hi>characterizes</hi> it immediately on our
Understandings. And as he proposes the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
Light to us, so he also illuminates our
Minds to discern and comprehend it: He raises
and exalts our <hi>Intellectual</hi> Powers, and as a <hi>vital</hi>
Form to the Light of our Reason, invigorates
and actuates it, and thereby renders its Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of Things more <hi>quick,</hi> and <hi>piercing,</hi> and
<hi>sagacious.</hi> Thus doth the <hi>Holy Spirit more</hi> or <hi>less</hi>
assist us in the <hi>true</hi> Understanding of <hi>Divine</hi>
Things, as he finds us <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less compliant</hi> with
his <hi>heavenly</hi> Pleasure; and though he stands no
more obliged to render our Minds <hi>infallible</hi> than
our Wills <hi>impeccable,</hi> yet so long as by our <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi>
Obedience to his <hi>holy</hi> Suggestions, we keep
our selves under his Conduct and Direction, we
may depend upon it, he will either preserve us
from all <hi>dangerous</hi> Errors, or if for <hi>just</hi> Reasons
he should permit us to fall into any such, they
shall not prove <hi>dangerous</hi> to us, but either we
shall be convinced of them while we live, or
obtain Pity and Pardon for them when we die.
But whilst we persist in any <hi>willful</hi> Course of
Sin, we do not only violate <hi>our own</hi> Conscience,
but also repel those <hi>good</hi> Motions of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> whereby he strives to reduce and reclaim
us; in doing which we continually grieve him,
and if we do not forbear, shall at length pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
him wholly to forsake and abandon us, to
give us up to <hi>our own</hi> Hearts Lusts as <hi>desperate</hi>
Wretches, with whom he hath hitherto strove
and struggled in vain, and of whose <hi>future</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
there remains no <hi>farther</hi> Hope or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:63657:241"/>
And when He hath forsaken us, our Mind
will not only be left <hi>naked</hi> and <hi>destitute</hi> of all
those Helps and Advantages for the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Divine</hi> Truths, which it receives from
him, but also be exposed to the Cheats and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies
of <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> whose Recreation it is to
put Tricks upon our Minds; to banter and play
upon our <hi>easie</hi> Faith, to cast Mists before our
Eyes, and therein to juggle away all <hi>true Religion</hi>
from us, and foist in the Room of it, the most
<hi>fulsom</hi> Errors and Mistakes. For so the <hi>Apostle</hi>
tells us of <hi>Antichrist</hi> the <hi>great</hi> Deceiver, that he
should <hi>come with all deceivableness of unrighteousness
to them that perish, because they received not the love
of the truth, that they might be saved.</hi> And that
for that Cause, <hi>viz.</hi> their not receiving the <hi>truth
in the love of it, God should send them strong delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that they should believe a lye;</hi> that is, by aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
them to the Power of cheating and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
Spirits: <hi>That they all might be damned, who
believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi>
2 Thess. 2. 10, 11, 12. And <hi>God</hi> grant
that this at last prove not our Fate, that because
we have sinned against the <hi>clearest</hi> Light, and
gone astray in all Unrighteousness under the <hi>best</hi>
and <hi>purest Religion</hi> in the World, we are not at
length given up by <hi>God</hi> to follow the <hi>wild</hi> Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and to believe all those <hi>fulsom</hi>
Lyes and Impostures which he from Age to Age
hath been imposing upon the World. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it prove thus or no, this I am sure of, that
by persisting in any <hi>vicious</hi> Course against the
Light and Conviction of our Consciences, we
highly provoke <hi>Almighty God</hi> to withdraw his
Grace from us, and give us <hi>up</hi> to <hi>our own</hi> Hearts
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:63657:242"/>
Lusts; and when this is done, <hi>our own</hi> Hearts
Lusts will soon betray and give <hi>up</hi> our Faith to
<hi>false</hi> and <hi>vicious</hi> Principles of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now having shewn at large what <hi>strong</hi>
and <hi>prevalent</hi> Tendencies there are in a <hi>wicked</hi>
Life to Apostacy from <hi>true Religion,</hi> I shall
conclude this Argument with <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
            <p>1. From hence I infer, What a <hi>great</hi> Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
there is in Mens being <hi>inconstant</hi> to, and <hi>aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing</hi>
from the <hi>true Religion</hi> in Compliance with
their <hi>sinful</hi> Affections; it being, as you see, the
<hi>ill</hi> Daughter of a <hi>bad</hi> Mother, (a <hi>debauched</hi> and
a <hi>dissolute</hi> Conscience) and consequently partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all its <hi>natural</hi> Bane and Malignity, even
as all other <hi>bad</hi> Effects do of the <hi>malignant</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their <hi>bad</hi> Causes. But the Truth of
this will more fully appear by considering the
<hi>particular</hi> Evils which Mens Inconstancy to, and
Proneness to revolt from the <hi>true Religion</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies;
of which I shall give you these five In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:
<list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>great</hi> Impiety of it.</item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>desperate</hi> Folly of it.</item>
                  <item>3. The <hi>foul</hi> Dishonesty of it.</item>
                  <item>4. The <hi>shameful</hi> Cowardize of it.</item>
                  <item>5. The <hi>vast</hi> Hazard and Insecurity of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. Consider the <hi>great</hi> Impiety of it. He who
can part with his <hi>Religion,</hi> or any Principle of
it, upon any <hi>other</hi> Terms than a <hi>full</hi> Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Falshood of it, is either a <hi>down-right
Atheist;</hi> who believing no <hi>Religion</hi> to be <hi>true,</hi>
               <pb n="475" facs="tcp:63657:242"/>
governs himself by this Principle, That the
<hi>wisest</hi> Course is to profess none but that which is
uppermost, and most for his Interest; or a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane</hi>
and <hi>impious</hi> Wretch, who, though he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
his <hi>own Religion true,</hi> exchanges it for <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
which he believes to be <hi>false,</hi> upon no <hi>other</hi>
Consideration, but so much <hi>temporal</hi> Advantage
to boot: By which he plainly declares, that in the
Ballance of his Estimation the Odds between
<hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falshood,</hi> the Declarations of <hi>God,</hi> and
the Impostures of the <hi>Devil</hi> is so <hi>inconsiderable,</hi>
that the <hi>least</hi> Addition of the <hi>transitory</hi> Goods of
this World to the <hi>later,</hi> renders it of <hi>sufficient</hi>
Weight to turn the Scale against the <hi>former,</hi> and
that for his part he is not much concerned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Almighty</hi> be his Friend or Foe; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
he may but enjoy his Ease and Pleasure a
<hi>few</hi> Years longer here, he is very well contented
to part with all his Hopes and Interest in <hi>God
for ever.</hi> For this is the <hi>natural</hi> Construction
of Mens Apostacy from the <hi>true Religion</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of their <hi>worldly</hi> Interest, that <hi>that</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
is in their Esteem far more <hi>eligible</hi> than
<hi>God</hi> with all his Power and Goodness, that it is
<hi>better</hi> to be without <hi>God</hi> in the World than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Preferment, and that <hi>that</hi> Man makes a very
<hi>good</hi> Bargain, who gets a <hi>good</hi> Place in Exchange
for his <hi>Maker,</hi> and with the <hi>treacherous Iudas</hi>
sells his <hi>Saviour,</hi> though it be but for <hi>thirty Pieces
of Silver:</hi> Which is such a <hi>monstrous</hi> Degree of
Impiety, as one would think, should be <hi>fufficient</hi>
to scare and affright the most <hi>couragious</hi> Sinner
that hath but the <hi>least</hi> Apprehension of <hi>God,</hi> or
Sense of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi> But then,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="476" facs="tcp:63657:243"/>
2. Consider the <hi>desparte</hi> Folly of Mens aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
their <hi>Religion</hi> in Complyance with their
<hi>vicious</hi> Affections. For he who without <hi>through</hi>
Conviction abandons the Profession of his <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
whether it be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false,</hi> doth together
with that most certainly abandon all the <hi>blessed</hi>
Rewards, and incur all the <hi>dreadful</hi> Penalties
that <hi>true Religion</hi> promises and denounces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
though his <hi>Religion</hi> perhaps may be <hi>false,</hi>
yet in renouncing it whilst he believes it <hi>true,</hi>
his Will doth as maliciously renounce the <hi>true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
as if it really were so. He thought it <hi>true,</hi>
and yet renounc'd it, by which he plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
that if it had been <hi>true</hi> he would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
it; so that whether it be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false,</hi>
it's all one to him, his Will is the <hi>same,</hi> his
Crime and Guilt the <hi>same;</hi> it is <hi>true Religion</hi> he
intentionally renounces, and therefore in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he doth intentionally renounce all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
and Interest in <hi>true Religion.</hi> Now what a
<hi>desperate</hi> Piece of Folly is this for a Man to part
with all his Stock in the <hi>Common Bank</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi>
which if it be not a <hi>down right</hi> Sham and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
is of <hi>everlasting</hi> Moment and Concern to
him, only for a <hi>present</hi> Gratification of some <hi>vain</hi>
and <hi>unreasonable</hi> Lust; to divorse himself <hi>for ever</hi>
from the Love of <hi>God,</hi> to quit all Title and Interest
in the <hi>precious</hi> Blood of the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World
only to curry a <hi>short-lived</hi> Favour with Men, with
Men whose Breath is in their Nostrils, and who
within a <hi>few</hi> Days or Years must go <hi>off</hi> the Stage,
and leave us here perhaps <hi>forlorn</hi> and <hi>destitute?</hi> To
part with all my <hi>glorious</hi> Hopes of <hi>Heaven,</hi> which
are my <hi>best</hi> Heaven upon Earth; and which is <hi>worse,</hi>
with <hi>Heaven</hi> it self, where I have Treasures of
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:63657:243"/>
Bliss sufficient to maintain me in a most <hi>happy</hi>
Port to <hi>eternal</hi> Ages; only to gain or secure a
<hi>transitory</hi> Estate or Preferment, which, while I
have, it cannot make me <hi>happy,</hi> and from which
erelong I shall be torn and divided, and not be a
Farthing the <hi>better</hi> for <hi>forever;</hi> to expose one self
as a <hi>publick</hi> Spectacle of Scorn and Contempt to
<hi>God,</hi> and Angels, and all the <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Part
of the <hi>rational</hi> World for a <hi>short extemporary</hi> Blaze
of <hi>pompous</hi> Splendor and Greatness which lies
at the Mercy of every Counter-blast of Fortune,
and in all Probability will e'er long expire in
<hi>Smoak</hi> and <hi>Stink, Wretchedness</hi> and <hi>Infamy;</hi> to
plunge one self head-long into all the Agonies and
Torments, the Horrors and Desperations of a
<hi>woful Eternity,</hi> only to escape a <hi>short</hi> Persecution,
and a <hi>glorious</hi> Martyrdom; when a little after
perhaps I shall suffer a <hi>great</hi> deal <hi>more</hi> and <hi>longer</hi>
under the <hi>Gout,</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> or <hi>Strangury</hi> without
the Comfort of dying in a <hi>brave</hi> Cause, and being
assured of an <hi>immortal</hi> Recompence than I could
have done under the Hand of the Executioner
with it? And yet all these <hi>mad</hi> Pranks that Man
plays at once, who abandons his <hi>Religion</hi> in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with his Lusts.</p>
            <p>3. Consider the <hi>foul</hi> Dishonesty of it: For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that our <hi>Religion</hi> being the most <hi>sacred</hi> Pledg
committed to us by <hi>God</hi> for <hi>our own</hi> Use, and the
Use of our <hi>latest</hi> Posterity, we cannot viciously
desert and abandon it without betraying of <hi>God,</hi>
and falsifying our Trust to him; and which is
<hi>worse,</hi> without squandering away the most <hi>inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable</hi>
Good that ever he committed to Men, upon
our own <hi>base</hi> Lusts, and his most <hi>execrable</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:63657:244"/>
which is Dishonesty blackned with the
<hi>foulest</hi> Ingratitude: Besides this, I say, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
our <hi>Religion</hi> in Complyance with any <hi>leud</hi>
Affection, we not only do a <hi>dishonest</hi> Thing at
<hi>present,</hi> but also totally discard the Obligations
to Honesty for the <hi>future:</hi> For there is nothing
can rationally oblige a Man to be throughly <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest</hi>
but only his <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>inward</hi> Sense that it is
his <hi>indispensable</hi> Duty towards <hi>God,</hi> before whose
<hi>righteous</hi> Tribunal he must one Day give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all his Actions. The <hi>two great</hi> Motives
of <hi>humane</hi> Action are <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>worldly</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est:
Now as for <hi>Religion,</hi> that consists of <hi>fix'd</hi> and
<hi>unalterable</hi> Principles, which will by no Means
ply or bend to the Alterations of <hi>outward</hi> Affairs
and Circumstances; but do in all Conditions
move and oblige us with <hi>equal</hi> Force and Vigour;
whereas <hi>Worldly</hi> Interest is a <hi>fickle</hi> and <hi>mutable</hi>
Thing that varies and alters with every <hi>outward</hi>
Turn and Revolution: So that <hi>that</hi> which is my
Interest to <hi>Day,</hi> may prove my Damage to <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;</hi>
and if it should, whatever Part I act to <hi>Day,</hi>
it will oblige me to act the contrary to <hi>Morrow.</hi>
When therefore a Man hath let go his <hi>Religion,</hi>
and hath nothing but his Interest to hold him,
it is <hi>Cross or Pile</hi> for the <hi>future</hi> whether you find
him an <hi>honest Man</hi> or a <hi>Knave;</hi> because from
henceforth he will be <hi>Knave</hi> or <hi>Honest</hi> according
as it serves his Turn, and that which serves his
Turn to <hi>Day</hi> may prove his Loss and Prejudice to
<hi>Morrow;</hi> so that whether to <hi>Day</hi> or to <hi>Morrow</hi> he
proves a <hi>true</hi> Man or a Cheat, wholly depends upon
the <hi>Die</hi> of Fortune, and you must consult his Stars
to find the <hi>lucky</hi> Hour or Moment when you may
safely trust him. For after the Wretch hath
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:63657:244"/>
been so <hi>perfidious</hi> as to renounce his <hi>God</hi> and his
<hi>Religion,</hi> he hath no <hi>one</hi> Principle remaining in
him upon which you can fasten any <hi>lasting</hi> Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
As for his Interest, that is such a <hi>fickle</hi>
and <hi>inconstant</hi> Thing that there is no trusting it;
if it plead for you <hi>now,</hi> the <hi>next</hi> Turn of Affairs
it may be retained against you, and the Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
got loose from all the Tyes and Obligations
of Fidelity, you may be sure he will stick at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be it never so <hi>foul,</hi> that his <hi>present</hi> Interest
invites him <hi>to</hi> to serve himself; he will make no
Bones, whenever he hath a <hi>fair</hi> Opportunity, to
<hi>cheat</hi> and <hi>betray</hi> his own Father; or supplant his
<hi>dearest</hi> Friend or Benefactor; and what should
hinder him? his Conscience and Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gone, and with them all <hi>binding</hi> Principles of
Truth and Honesty. For when a Man forsakes
his <hi>Religion</hi> out of any <hi>vicious</hi> Affection, he doth
in Effect make this publick Declaration to the
World: <hi>By this my own Act and Deed I do here
for ever renounce all the Obligations to Honesty and
fair Dealing with God or Men, and am resolved
for the future to be deaf and inexorable to all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of Conscience and Religion. From hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
I will listen to no other Call but that of my world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Interest; when that bids me be honest, I will be
honest, and when it bids me play the Knave, I will
play the Knave; and therefore for the future I warn
all that know me to trust me no farther than they can
make it my Interest to be true, and not to venture the
most trifling Matter in which they are unwilling to be
wronged, either upon my Faith, or Word, or Oath,
without demanding of me such ample Securities as
may render it impossible for me to wrong them without
wronging my self. For this is the Principle I now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:63657:245"/>
to live by, That is always best and fittest to be
done, that is most subservient to my present Interest.</hi>
This in Construction of Fact is the Profession
which that Man takes <hi>up,</hi> who in Compliance
with any <hi>vicious</hi> Affection abandons the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Consider the <hi>shameful</hi> Cowardize of it.
The Advantages of <hi>true Religion</hi> are <hi>great</hi> enough
to encourage a Mind of any Constancy or Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to charge through the <hi>greatest</hi> Difficulties
the World can interpose between <hi>them</hi> and <hi>him.</hi>
Who that hath the Spirit of a Man would ever
boggle to wade through a <hi>narrow shallow</hi> Stream
of <hi>temporary</hi> Sufferings, whilst on the <hi>farther</hi>
Shore he beholds a <hi>Heaven</hi> of <hi>immortal</hi> Joys rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to receive and reward him? But for a Man
to turn his Back, and run away from <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Heaven</hi> for Fear only of being disappointed by
some <hi>leud,</hi> or <hi>covetous,</hi> or <hi>ambitious</hi> Hope, is such
an Instance of <hi>vile, prostitute</hi> Baseness as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
even Contempt and Derision. For what
Danger or Difficulty dares that Wretch encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that dares not stand by his <hi>Religion,</hi> in
which he confesses all his <hi>future</hi> Hopes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved,
for Fear of losing <hi>such</hi> a Place, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
disappointed of <hi>such</hi> a Preferment, which
within a <hi>few</hi> Days or Years he knows very well
he must lose <hi>for ever?</hi> He who hath a Mind ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being scared out of his <hi>Religion</hi> by such
<hi>mean</hi> Considerations as these, is <hi>good</hi> for nothing
but only to be made the Foot-Ball of Fortune;
to be kick'd <hi>up</hi> and <hi>down</hi> upon her <hi>scornful</hi> Toe
at Pleasure, who by threatning him with the
<hi>smallest Evil,</hi> can huff him out of the <hi>greatest
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:63657:245"/>
Good,</hi> and finding him a <hi>wretched passive</hi> Thing
that hath not Strength enough to resist her
<hi>weakest</hi> Impressions, makes him her Sport and
Recreation, and turns him into any Thing, and
tosses him any whither she pleases; from <hi>Truth</hi>
to <hi>Falshood,</hi> from <hi>God</hi> to the <hi>Devil,</hi> and from
<hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>Hell</hi> without the <hi>least</hi> Controul or
Opposition. For the <hi>poor</hi> Man's Soul is grown
so <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>effeminate,</hi> that for the <hi>greatest</hi> Good
in all the World he cannot endure the <hi>least</hi> Air
of Suffering to blow upon him: Tell him of Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for <hi>Righteousness Sake,</hi> and the very Thought
of it frights and appales him. Present but a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
at his Breast, and bid him stand and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,
and the <hi>crest-fallen</hi> Pultroon is presently
ready to cry out, <hi>O spare my Life, spare my Skin!
and take my Religion, take my God, and all my Hopes
of Heaven and Immortality.</hi> And who but an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous</hi>
Coward would ever endure to be hector'd
out of so <hi>vast</hi> a Good by the <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>impotent</hi>
Evils of this World; which if they do their
<hi>worst</hi> can only rob him of a <hi>few transitory</hi> Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which without their Constraint he must
ere long take his leave of <hi>for ever?</hi> How ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously
<hi>mean-spirited</hi> would it be for a Man to
deliver <hi>up</hi> his Purse to a Thief, who he knows
hath no <hi>other</hi> Weapon but a <hi>slender</hi> Switch to hurt
and offend him? But for a Man to deliver <hi>up</hi>
his <hi>Religion,</hi> and with that his <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Heaven,</hi>
at the demand of a <hi>short Skin-deep</hi> Affliction,
which can only disease him for a <hi>few</hi> Moments,
and shall then determine in <hi>everlasting</hi> Pleasure
and Delight, is a thousand times more <hi>mean</hi> and
<hi>ridiculous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="482" facs="tcp:63657:246"/>
5. And Lastly, Consider the <hi>vast</hi> Hazard and
Insecurity of a Man's parting with his <hi>Religion</hi> in
Compliance with his <hi>vicious</hi> Affections: For that
which moves him to it is only his Prospect of
living at Ease a <hi>few</hi> Years longer, or gratifying
some <hi>covetous</hi> Desire or Ambition; but whether
he obtain these Ends by parting with his <hi>Religio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
is vastly <hi>hazardous</hi> and <hi>insecure.</hi> Perhaps, when
I have acted this <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>perfidious</hi> Part, I
may be cast into such Circumstances, as may
force me upon <hi>impartial</hi> Reflections, and make me
see, whether I will or no, the Blackness and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
of my Revolt and Apostacy; which if it
should happen would inevitably raise such a
Swarm of Horrors in my Conscience, and cast
me into such Agonies and Convulsions of Soul,
as will render me a <hi>Hell</hi> and a <hi>Devil</hi> to my self,
and give me a thousand times more Pain and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness
than all those <hi>temporal</hi> Evils could have
done, for fear of which I ran away from my
<hi>Religion.</hi> And if to shun <hi>Poverty,</hi> I should throw
my self into <hi>Desparation;</hi> if to avoid a <hi>Prison,</hi>
which to an <hi>innocent</hi> Mind with a <hi>righteous</hi> Cause
can make a <hi>Heaven</hi> upon Earth, I should cast my
self into a <hi>Hell</hi> upon Earth; if to keep in a <hi>whole</hi>
Skin, I should bring upon my self the <hi>intollerable</hi>
Anguish of a <hi>wounded</hi> Spirit; if to escape being
<hi>rejected, disgraced,</hi> and <hi>discountenanced</hi> by Men, I
should expose my self to the <hi>perpetual</hi> Clamour
and Reproaches of <hi>my own</hi> Conscience: If these
Things, I say, should happen, as its very <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
they may, I shall find my self miserably dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed
of that Ease and <hi>quiet</hi> Enjoyment for
the sake of which I basely abandoned my <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>
I shall find that to save my Garments from
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:63657:246"/>
being singed, I have thrown my Body into a
<hi>consuming</hi> Flame, and only exposed my Breast to
save my Buckler. But then suppose this should
not happen; suppose my Conscience should be
<hi>stupid</hi> and <hi>insensible</hi> enough to bear the Guilt of
my Apostacy without Remorse or Relenting; yet
my Prospect of Gain and Advancement in this
World is extreamly <hi>hazardous</hi> and <hi>insecure.</hi> For it
is a thousand to one, but they to whose <hi>Religion</hi> I
turn, and upon whose Favour I depend, will
by <hi>one</hi> Means or <hi>other</hi> discover my Falshood and
Insincerity; and if in the Course of my Actions,
or any other <hi>suspicious</hi> Indication, they should
find Cause to be <hi>jealous</hi> that I embrac'd their
<hi>Religion</hi> only to serve my Interest, and against
the Persuasion of <hi>my own</hi> Mind; if they are <hi>wise</hi>
they will treat me as a <hi>dangerous</hi> Person, upon
whom there is no Reliance; For how can they
imagine that I should be <hi>true</hi> to them who have
been <hi>false</hi> to my <hi>Religion?</hi> It is a <hi>Proverb</hi> among
the <hi>Iews, That Proselytes are not to be trusted to the
Tenth Generation;</hi> and by <hi>too</hi> many <hi>woful</hi> Instances
in <hi>our own</hi> Neighbourhood, we find it a Maxim
in some Mens Politicks, That a <hi>New Convert</hi> is
no more to be trusted than an <hi>Old Heretick.</hi> And
though for a while they may think fit to use me
as a <hi>proper</hi> Tool to serve a <hi>present</hi> Design, yet to
be sure they will use me no longer than they
needs must; and when I have done their Work,
I must expect to be thrust out to make Room for
such as they can more safely depend on. And if
this should not happen, as it is very probable
it may; yet seeing all <hi>humane</hi> Affairs are liable
to <hi>perpetual</hi> Turns and Mutabilities, perhaps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>next</hi> Revolution a <hi>contrary</hi> Interest may
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:63657:247"/>
appear upon the Stage, and then I shall find my
self deserted of all my <hi>present</hi> Supports and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies,
and like a <hi>forlorn</hi> Wretch utterly
abandoned both by <hi>God</hi> and Men, without any
<hi>other</hi> Company to entertain me in this my <hi>mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Solitude, besides the <hi>woful</hi> Remembrances of
my Guilt and Shame. To such <hi>infinite</hi> Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties
of obtaining their Ends are those <hi>misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Men exposed, who desert their <hi>Religion</hi> in
pursuit of their <hi>worldly</hi> Interest. And so I have
done with the first Inference: But then,</p>
            <p>2. From hence I infer, How <hi>cautious</hi> a Man
ought to be in changing his <hi>Religion,</hi> or any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of it, least that which induces him to it
be not so much his Conviction as his <hi>profligate</hi>
Conscience. I do not pretend, that Men are
always to maintain the same Persuasion in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Religion;</hi> for such an Obligation would as
effectually serve the Interest of <hi>false Religion,</hi> as
of <hi>true.</hi> Whatever some Men pretend, we are
all of us from <hi>Top to Bottom,</hi> a Company of <hi>falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
Creatures; and if we are in an Error, as it
is possible we may, it is our Duty to endeavour
to be <hi>better</hi> informed. Nor do I deny, But an
<hi>honest-minded</hi> Man, without being in the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
by a <hi>bad Conscience,</hi> may be innocently,
or at least pitiably seduced from <hi>Truth</hi> to <hi>Error</hi>
by <hi>false</hi> Colours and <hi>probable</hi> Appearances, for
want of <hi>sufficient</hi> Sagacity to distinguish between
<hi>Sophistry</hi> and <hi>true Reason.</hi> But if in Compliance
with any <hi>vicious</hi> Affection, or in Pursuit of any
<hi>worldly</hi> Interest, a Man deserts the Truth, and
takes up <hi>false</hi> and <hi>erroneous</hi> Principles, his Error
is no longer imputable to the <hi>Weakness</hi> of his
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:63657:247"/>
Understanding, but to the <hi>Wickedness</hi> of his Will;
and a <hi>willful</hi> Error in his Faith will prove as
<hi>fatal</hi> and as <hi>damnable</hi> to him, as a <hi>willful</hi> Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
in his Manners; and whenever his <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
Soul shall appear before the <hi>great Searcher of
Hearts,</hi> it shall certainly be treated by him as a
<hi>willful</hi> Apostate that hath perfidiously renounced
his <hi>Baptismal Vow,</hi> and abjured his <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
Truth,</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> And seeing it is thus,
it very highly concerns Men, as they love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or have any Regard of their own <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi>
Well-being, not to desert their <hi>Religion</hi>
or any Principle of it, upon any <hi>other</hi> Motive
than a <hi>thorough</hi> Conviction of its Falshood; not
to suffer themselves to be seduced from it by any
<hi>temporal</hi> Interest or <hi>vicious</hi> Affection, lest in so
doing they <hi>reprobate</hi> themselves from <hi>God,</hi> and
all the <hi>blessed</hi> Hopes of a <hi>glorious Eternity hereafter.</hi>
For when Men are upon changing their Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in <hi>Religion,</hi> it is an <hi>ordinary</hi> Thing for their
Interests and Passions so to intermingle with
their Reasonings, that without some Care and
Observation of themselves they will not be able
to discern which of the <hi>two</hi> hath the <hi>greater</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon them; insomuch, that I am very
apt to think that there are a great many <hi>careless</hi>
and <hi>unreflecting</hi> People that are hurried meerly
by their Interest and Passions out of <hi>one Religious</hi>
Persuasion into <hi>another,</hi> who yet through <hi>gross</hi>
Neglect and Inobservance of themselves, believe
themselves to be Converts upon <hi>pure</hi> Reason and
Conviction. Perhaps upon the Sollicitations of
<hi>worldly</hi> Interest their Minds were wrought into
a <hi>strong</hi> Inclination to a Change; insomuch, that
they vehemently wish that they could but satisfie
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:63657:248"/>
their Reason and Conscience of the Truth and
Reality of that <hi>new</hi> Persuasion, which these their
<hi>importunate</hi> Passions so earnestly invite them to
embrace; and then with this <hi>strong</hi> Byass of
<hi>worldly</hi> Interest upon their Minds, away they run
hunting after Reasons and Arguments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
and satisfie themselves; and if in this Heat
of Affection they can but light upon any <hi>little</hi>
shew of Probability, that will quickly improve
them into <hi>irrefragable</hi> Proofs and Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
For when a Man enquires, whether such a
Doctrine be <hi>true</hi> with a <hi>strong</hi> Inclination of Will
to find it so, he will be afraid to consult the
Reasons and Arguments against it, lest they should
convince him that it is <hi>false,</hi> and thereby defeat
his Inclination. And when once a Man is so
prepossessed as that he will listen only to <hi>one</hi>
side of the Question, be that side never so <hi>absurd</hi>
and <hi>ridiculous,</hi> it is a <hi>hard</hi> Case if he cannot find
Reasons enough to wheadle himself into the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of it; for his very Inclination to believe it
will deter him from entring into a <hi>strict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of those Reasons, and being afraid to
examine them <hi>too</hi> far lest he should find them
<hi>false</hi> and <hi>unconcluding,</hi> if he can but discern the
<hi>least</hi> Colour of Probability in their <hi>first</hi> View
and Appearance, that will be sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him, and render him a <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>zealous</hi>
Convert: For indeed, the Man was a Convert
in his Heart upon Reasons of <hi>wordly</hi> Interest,
before ever he thought of those Reasons of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
that made him a Convert in his Judgment;
so that 'twas his Interest that converted his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and his Affections that Converted his
saith; and yet all this while, for want of <hi>Self-reflection,</hi>
               <pb n="487" facs="tcp:63657:248"/>
the Man imagines that his <hi>new</hi> Faith is
wholly owing to the Reason, and Evidence it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with it; whereas, would he but impartially
consult himself, and take a <hi>little</hi> Pains to review
the Steps and Progress of his Change, where it
began, and how it proceeded and concluded, he
would soon be forced to acknowledge, that the
<hi>first</hi> and <hi>fundamental</hi> Reason of it was nothing
but a <hi>worldly</hi> Interest. Wherefore to secure you
against this <hi>dangerous</hi> Piece of <hi>Self-delusion,</hi> by
which I doubt there are <hi>too</hi> many Men do eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
Ruine and Destroy themselves, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to give you some <hi>certain</hi> Signs and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
by which you may be able to judge, if
ever you should be tempted to change your <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Religion</hi> or Persuasion, whether you do it
sincerely and upon <hi>pure</hi> Conviction of Mind, or
in <hi>meer</hi> Compliance with any <hi>vicious</hi> or <hi>worldly</hi>
Affection: And I shall give them to you in
these <hi>following</hi> Queries, which I earnestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>eech
you seriously to propose to your <hi>own</hi>
Souls. whenever any such Temptation shall
befal you.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Whether upon your <hi>first</hi> Entrance on the
Debate of Changing, your Prejudice lie
on the side of your <hi>present Religion,</hi> or of
that you are invited to turn to?</item>
               <item>2. Whether you have not some distaste in
your Affections to your <hi>present Religion,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you entertained any Overtures of
changing it?</item>
               <item>3. Whether that which gave you your <hi>first</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to Change was not some <hi>temporal</hi>
Interest?</item>
               <pb n="488" facs="tcp:63657:249"/>
               <item>4. Whether before you entertained any Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Change, you were fully resolved to
consult impartially both Sides of the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</item>
               <item>5. Whether when you <hi>first</hi> entred upon this
Consultation it was your <hi>unfeigned</hi> Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whatever should happen to you, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to that Side which should appear most
<hi>reasonable?</hi>
               </item>
               <item>6. And lastly, whether before you were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to change; you did conscientiously
comply with the Obligations of <hi>Religion,</hi>
and continued to do so afterwards?</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. When you fall under any Temptation to
Change, ask your <hi>own</hi> Soul whether your Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
lye on the Side of your <hi>present</hi> Religion, or
of that which you are tempted to turn to? There
is no Man that sincerely professes any <hi>Religion,</hi> but
must be strongly prejudiced for it, especially if
he imbibed it betimes, and was principled in it
by his Education; for how can he sincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it without engaging his Affections towards
it, and heartily espousing its Interest? For though
I confess it is a Fault for Men so to preingage
themselves to any <hi>Religious</hi> Principles, especially
such as are not exceeding <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>evident</hi> (and
such are all the <hi>Fundamentals of Christianity)</hi> as to
shut his Ears against all <hi>contray</hi> Reasons, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
resolve never to part with them, or so
much as to admit into our Consideration any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
or Evidence against them; yet after all
it is impossible for any <hi>sincere</hi> Professor of any <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
whether it be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false,</hi> to be so indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
<hi>affected</hi> towards it as not to side with it
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:63657:249"/>
in his Will as well as in his Faith and Judgment;
so that whenever he is tempted to desert it the
Temptation must necessarily find him strongly
preingaged for it; and unless it bring along
with it <hi>sufficient</hi> Evidence not only to convince his
Reason, but also to captivate his Prejudice, it
will never be able to prevail. For if ever the
Man loved his <hi>Religion,</hi> his Passion will contend
for it as well as his Reason; so that all Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against it, be they never <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>cogent,</hi>
will at <hi>first</hi> especially find a <hi>difficult</hi> Access to and
an <hi>ungrateful</hi> Reception in his Mind; and though
he is so overborn by the Strength of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
against it that he can no longer forbear
<hi>doubting</hi> and <hi>suspecting</hi> it, yet still he is very loth
to part with it, and still he wishes it were <hi>true,</hi>
though he is not able to evince it so, till after
having endured a <hi>long</hi> Siege of <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>pressing</hi>
Arguments he is driven at length out of all his
Defences, and then his Prejudice yields as well
as his Judgment to surrender <hi>up</hi> his <hi>erroneous</hi> Faith
to the <hi>prevailing</hi> Power of his Convictions: This
is the <hi>natural</hi> Temper of every <hi>sincere</hi> Professor
of any <hi>Religion.</hi> When therefore you are at any
Time tempted to change your <hi>Religion,</hi> before
you proceed, pause a while, and consider serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
how you stand disposed, and which way your
Heart is preingaged; whether to the <hi>Religion</hi>
you have hitherto professed, or to <hi>that</hi> for
which you are invited to change it. Consult a
while with <hi>your own</hi> Souls to which side of the
Question you are most inclined to listen, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Side which asserts your <hi>present</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion,
or to <hi>that</hi> which contradicts and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
it. Observe but which Way your Wishes
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:63657:250"/>
and your Passions move, whether <hi>for</hi> or <hi>against</hi>
it, and which Reasons and Arguments you are
most concerned for; <hi>those</hi> that oppose, or <hi>those</hi>
that defend it. For assure your selves if the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to Change find you <hi>lukewarm</hi> and <hi>indifferent,</hi>
or so much as <hi>easy</hi> and <hi>plyable</hi> to its Proposals; if
it finds you <hi>unaverse</hi> to admit of a <hi>contrary</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion,
or <hi>forward</hi> to catch at every Shew of
Evidence against that <hi>Religion</hi> which you have
hitherto professed, or ready to be <hi>stagger'd</hi> out
of it upon the <hi>first</hi> Appearunce of any Reasons
or Probabilities against it; if, I say, you find
any of these <hi>evil</hi> Symptoms upon you when you
are <hi>first</hi> tempted to change, you have <hi>great</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to suspect that you are a <hi>false Hypocrite</hi> to that
Profession which you have hitherto made; that
there is some <hi>vile</hi> Affection in you that hath got
the Ascendent of your <hi>Religion</hi> and your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and that if in this Temper you proceed to
a Change you will be found to be a Convert of
your Lusts and not of your Convictions.</p>
            <p>2. When you fall under any Temptation to
change your <hi>Religion,</hi> examine whether you have
not entertained some Distast to it in your Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
before you proceed any farther; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you have not entertained some Quarrel
against it upon the Account of the Disturbance
it gives you in your <hi>vicious</hi> Delights and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
or because it <hi>too</hi> severely exacts of you
<hi>universal</hi> Sanctity of Life and Manners, to which
of all Things in the World your Heart is most
averse, and without which the <hi>inflexible</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of your <hi>present</hi> Persuasion will not permit
you to hope for any Favour from <hi>God</hi> either <hi>here</hi>
or <hi>hereafter.</hi> Consider whether upon these Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:63657:250"/>
your Mind be not cankered with a <hi>secret</hi>
Enmity against your <hi>Religion;</hi> whether under
those Qualms of Conscience it often gives you,
your Heart doth not rise against it, and you do not
sometimes secretly wish that you could release
your Faith from its <hi>tyrannick</hi> Principles which
give you so much Pain and Disturbance, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to some <hi>gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ler Religion</hi> that would permit
you to Sin in quiet, or at <hi>least</hi> prove more indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to your Lusts: For if this be your Temper
you are in very <hi>great</hi> Danger of being betrayed
by it into any <hi>false</hi> and <hi>corrupt Religion</hi> that shall be
tender'd you in Exchange for your own. For if
this <hi>other Religion</hi> offer but any <hi>fair</hi> Terms to your
<hi>vicious</hi> Affections, or propose but any Expedient
how to accommodate the <hi>vexatious</hi> Quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and your Consciences; if it doth but
any way reconcile your Hope of <hi>Heaven</hi> to your
<hi>vicious</hi> Manners, by directing you to some <hi>easier</hi>
Terms of Salvation than that of forsaking all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness,
and <hi>worldly</hi> Lusts, <hi>and living soberly,
and righteously, and godly in this present</hi> World; if it
will but admit of any Commutation of that <hi>unsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable</hi>
Penance of Godliness for <hi>bodily</hi> Exercise,
of <hi>inward</hi> Mortification for <hi>a long</hi> Fast or a <hi>sound</hi>
Whipping, of putting <hi>off</hi> the <hi>old Man</hi> for putting
<hi>on a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Shirt,</hi> of running the Race of a <hi>holy</hi> Life
for a <hi>sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ring</hi> Pilgrimage, or the like; this is a
<hi>Religion</hi> for your Tooth, with which your <hi>naughty</hi>
Heart will be ready enough to fall in love upon
the <hi>first</hi> Interview: and when once it hath gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our Heart and Affections, if we do not take
the <hi>greater</hi> Heed they will quickly gain our Faith
and Judgment: For when a Man is <hi>angry</hi> with his
own <hi>Religion</hi> because it sits <hi>uneasy</hi> on his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:63657:251"/>
if a more <hi>easy Religion</hi> presents it self to him
he can hardly forbear wishing it were <hi>true</hi>
though as yet he hath no Evidence that it is so;
and then a very <hi>slender</hi> Evidence will suffice to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a Belief of the Reality of any Thing which
a Man earnestly wishes and desires. If in this <hi>ill</hi>
Temper of Mind therefore you should be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to change your <hi>Religion,</hi> it concerns you as
much as your Souls are worth to look about you;
for you have a Seducer in your Breast, a <hi>preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
insinuating</hi> Seducer, <hi>viz.</hi> some <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>sinful</hi>
Affection, who, if you listen to his <hi>charming</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasions,
will certainly betray you into a most
<hi>damnable</hi> Apostacy. Wherefore before you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to examin the Merits of the Cause, consider
seriously with your selves that <hi>that</hi> Disturbance
which your <hi>present Religion</hi> gives to your <hi>vicious</hi>
Affections, for which you are so <hi>angry</hi> with it,
is so far from being a <hi>just</hi> Ground to suspect it,
that it is a <hi>real</hi> Evidence of the Truth of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is a <hi>sensible</hi> Demonstration of its Holiness,
which is an <hi>inseperable</hi> Concomitant of Truth;
and therefore for you to desert it upon this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
is in Effect to pronounce it a <hi>false Religion;</hi>
because it gives you a <hi>sensible</hi> Experiment of its
Truth and Reality.</p>
            <p>3. When you fall under any Temptation to
change your <hi>Religion,</hi> consider whether that
which gave you the <hi>first</hi> Inclination to change
was not some <hi>temporal</hi> Interest; whether before
ever you admitted any Thought of a Change,
you did not perceive <hi>another Religion</hi> appear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage attended with all the <hi>fair</hi> Hopes and
Advantages of this World, and whether this
Prospect did not <hi>first</hi> suggest to you a <hi>great</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
<pb n="934" facs="tcp:63657:251"/>
to enter into its Retinue. I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but that even <hi>worldly</hi> Considerations may so
far influence <hi>honest</hi> Minds as to put them upon a
more <hi>severe</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> Scrutiny of their <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>
Persuasions in <hi>Religion;</hi> and unless it be in
Case of <hi>palpable</hi> Truth or Falshood it is but <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest</hi>
Prudence, when a Man's <hi>temporal</hi> Interest
lies at stake, to take Care that he is sure of his
Hand, that he doth not throw it away upon a
<hi>false</hi> Persuasion in a Fit of <hi>blind</hi> Humour or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy,
and sacrifice that to an <hi>erroneus</hi> Judgment
which he ows to no <hi>other</hi> Altar but Truth's.
And indeed before I throw my self upon any Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
whether it be <hi>Loss</hi> or <hi>Pain,</hi> I am bound
in Conscience diligently to enquire whether it be
for <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Righteousness sake,</hi> lest instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Crown of Martyrdom I am sent away
to seek my Reward in the <hi>Paradise of Fools.</hi> But
if meerly upon the Consideration of any <hi>present</hi>
Loss or Advantage I find my self strongly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to change my <hi>Religion</hi> before ever I enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Merits of the Cause to examine the Reasons
<hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> it is a <hi>certain</hi> Sign that <hi>that</hi> Loss or
Advantage that inclines, me hath a more <hi>powerful</hi>
Influence upon me than my <hi>Religion;</hi> that I love
the World better than <hi>God,</hi> and do prefer my
<hi>earthly</hi> Expectations before all my Hopes of <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi>
Happiness. And if in this <hi>ill</hi> Temper of
Mind I should be tempted to a <hi>present</hi> Change,
it concerns me as much as my Soul is worth to
be very <hi>careful</hi> what I do; For I stand upon the
Brink of a Precipice, the <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>fatal</hi> Precipice of
Apostacy, into which if I fall I am ruined <hi>for ever.</hi>
For if in changing my <hi>Religion</hi> it be found that I
followed this my <hi>wicked</hi> Inclination more than any
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:63657:252"/>
               <hi>sincere</hi> Conviction, I must expect to be treated
by <hi>God</hi> as an <hi>Apostate</hi> and <hi>Renegado,</hi> as a <hi>wilful</hi>
Deserter of his Cause, and Betrayer of his <hi>sacred</hi>
Truth. But if I change while I stand thus incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
it is fearfully <hi>hazardous</hi> but this will be found
to be the Truth of the Case; for in all Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
my <hi>wicked</hi> Inclination will cast a Mist before
my Understanding, and so darken its Prospect
that it will hardly be able to distinguish the <hi>gross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi>
Sophistry from the <hi>clearest</hi> Reason. So that
now those Arguings which before I saw through
with half an Eye; and look'd upon as most <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd</hi>
and <hi>ridiculous,</hi> will appear to my <hi>abused</hi> and
<hi>byass'd</hi> Mind in the Colours of <hi>clear</hi> Evidence and
<hi>plain</hi> Demonstration, and I shall be ready to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
<hi>up</hi> my Faith to those <hi>trifling</hi> Pretences of
Reason and Authority, which before I laughed
at and despised: Now, <hi>Thou art Peter, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Rock will I build my Church</hi> will seem a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>pregnant</hi> Proof that all the <hi>Bishops of Rome</hi> from
St. <hi>Peter</hi> are ordained the <hi>Supreme Heads</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> and the Fountains of all <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
though they are not so much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in it, no nor from any thing that appears
so much as thought of. Now <hi>This is my Body</hi>
looks like a <hi>substantial</hi> Evidence of the Truth of
<hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and of all those <hi>wild</hi> Absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
it contains; though those Forms of Speech,
<hi>I am the true Vine,</hi> and <hi>I am the Door</hi> do as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
prove that <hi>Christ</hi> bears Grapes, and
turns upon Hinges. Now every Thing will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to me in a quite <hi>different</hi> Guize from what it
did before, and I shall fancy that I spy Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
where before I could only discern Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;
for a <hi>good</hi> Sum of Money, or a <hi>rich</hi> Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:63657:252"/>
is a <hi>strange</hi> Clearer of some Mens Eyesight.
Thus when a Man begins to think of changing his
<hi>Religion</hi> under the <hi>powerful</hi> Influence of his <hi>world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
Interest, that is usually the only <hi>effectual</hi> Reason
that leads and persuades him: As for <hi>other</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
they only serve for Form-sake to disguise
the <hi>foul</hi> Apostacy into some Resemblance of a
<hi>sincere</hi> Conversion; for till his Interest struck
in with them, they signified nothing with him,
made not the <hi>least</hi> Impression on his Mind; but
being back'd with that, all on a suddain they are
wondrous <hi>cogent</hi> and <hi>persuasive;</hi> from whence it is
evident that they received their Strength and
Force from his Interest, without the Air of which
they are not able to operate; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that the Change of his Faith is owing to the
<hi>over-ruling</hi> Interest of his Covetousness and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
and not at all to the Prevalence of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and <hi>sincere</hi> Conviction. For 'twas <hi>that</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
that strongly inclined him to change before
ever he knew any Reason for it, and then 'twas
<hi>that</hi> Inclination that made his Reasons, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Convictions; and let him talk what he
pleases of <hi>Reason, Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Authority;</hi> if he
was strongly inclined to change before he was
moved to it by Reason and Evidence, it is plain
that the <hi>prevailing</hi> Motive of his Conversion was
either the Fear of losing some <hi>good warm</hi> Place,
or the Hope of gaining some <hi>important</hi> Station or
Preferment. And if this be found the Truth of
his Case when he comes to appear before the
Tribunal of <hi>God,</hi> it had been a thousand times
<hi>better</hi> for him that he had never been born; for
then he will be found a <hi>base</hi> Deserter of his <hi>God,</hi>
a <hi>treacherous Iudas</hi> to his <hi>Saviour,</hi> and a <hi>perfidious
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:63657:253"/>
Renegado</hi> from his <hi>Religion,</hi> and according to the
Quality of his Sin and Guilt receive his Portion
of Damnation.</p>
            <p>4. Consider whether before you entertained
any Intention to change, you were fully resolved
impartially to consult both sides of the Question.
I doubt there are <hi>too</hi> many among us that <hi>first</hi>
resolve to change their <hi>Religion,</hi> and then begin
to enquire after Reasons and Arguments against
it, and that their Resolution to change is so far
from being the Effect of <hi>sincere</hi> Conviction, that
their Conviction is the Effect of their Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>First,</hi> Some <hi>vile</hi> Affection, or some <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi>
Interest recommends another <hi>Religion</hi> to
them that either gives them leave to be <hi>wicked</hi>
without Remorse or Disturbance, or promises
them Gain and Advancement; upon which they
resolve <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi> to entertain and embrace
it; and then to excuse themselves to their own
Consciences, or to vindicate their Reputation to
the World from the Scandal of being <hi>down-right</hi>
Apostates, they fall a hunting after Reasons
and Arguments to convince themselves of the
Truth of it, or at least to make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that it was not their Interest but their
Conviction that turned them. And when Men
thus resolve <hi>first,</hi> and enquire <hi>afterwards,</hi> to be
sure their Enquiry will be very <hi>partial;</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fully resolved to change their <hi>Religion</hi> upon
some <hi>vicious</hi> or <hi>secular</hi> Motive, it is become their
Int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rest to pick Holes in it, and to reason or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
themselves out of the Belief of it. And this
makes them shy of bringing the Matter under a
<hi>fair</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> Examination, lest while they
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:63657:253"/>
are seeking Reasons to overthrow their Faith,
they should find Reasons to establish and confirm
it. So that they begin their Enquiry with these
secret Intentions; <hi>We will listen only to one side of
the Cause, and leave the other to shift for it self;
and seek for as many Arguments as we can against
our Religion, but none for it. We will read the Books
and consult the Teachers of one side only,</hi> viz. <hi>the
opposite side to our present Belief and Persuasion, and
if among them we can but find Arguments enough to
render the contrary Persuasion any way probable, we
will submit our Faith to it without any farther En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
and not trouble our selves to examine the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on the other side, for Fear we should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
in spight of our Teeth that the Truth lies there;
and then our Conscience will never let us be quiet, but
be perpetually clamouring against us for base and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Apostates.</hi> That this is the <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical</hi>
Intention of <hi>too</hi> many among us is <hi>notorious</hi>
enough by their Practice; they leap from <hi>Church</hi>
to <hi>Church,</hi> and from <hi>one</hi> Communion to <hi>another,</hi>
without any Pause or Consideration; they are
with us to <hi>Day,</hi> and gone from us to <hi>Morrow,</hi>
and are such <hi>Mushroom, extemporary</hi> Converts,
that before ever we hear they doubted of their
<hi>own,</hi> they are confirmed in a <hi>contrary Religion.</hi>
In short, they steal out of their <hi>Religion</hi> so soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and with so <hi>little</hi> Noise, that they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
gone before ever we hear they are going,
as if they were afraid we should stop and detain
them by <hi>better</hi> Reasons and <hi>fuller</hi> Convictions.
Whereas had these Men any Conscience or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
in them, they would consider, that <hi>Religion</hi>
is a Thing <hi>too sacred</hi> and <hi>serious</hi> to be thus dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
and trifled with, and that to change ones
<hi>Religion</hi> is a matter of such <hi>vast</hi> Importance as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:63657:254"/>
a <hi>long</hi> and <hi>through</hi> Consideration, and a
very <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>full</hi> Conviction of Mind; that
there is <hi>too</hi> much depends upon it to part with
it upon <hi>slight</hi> Pretences, and that it concerns
them as much as an <hi>Eternity</hi> of Bliss amounts to,
not to desert it upon any <hi>other</hi> Inducement but
that of a <hi>through well-weighed</hi> Persuasion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
And if they had <hi>had</hi> any such <hi>honest</hi>
Thoughts about them while they were under the
Temptation to change, they would never have
admitted any Doubt of their <hi>Religion,</hi> but upon
<hi>great</hi> and <hi>palpable</hi> Evidence; and then they would
have doubted long before they would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
against it, and not have precipitated their
Judgment <hi>hand over head</hi> into a <hi>contrary</hi> Persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
till they had <hi>first</hi> applied themselves for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
again and again to their <hi>old</hi> Guides and
Pastors, and with all <hi>due</hi> Deference to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
had strictly examined all their Reasons
and Answers, till they had throughly inspected
their Arguments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> and equally heard
both sides of the Cause; till they had read, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised,
and consulted on both sides, and weighed
the whole matter <hi>over</hi> and <hi>over</hi> with the <hi>greatest</hi>
Care and Exactness. But when Men run away
from their <hi>Religion</hi> in an Instant, without ever
observing this <hi>regular</hi> Process of <hi>sincere</hi> Enquiries,
it is a <hi>plain</hi> Case that their Wills were resolved
before their Understandings, and that they were
converted before ever they were convinced; and
consequently that it was not Reason and Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that turned them, but Lust or Interest:
For though when they are turned they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be very <hi>diligent</hi> to seek Conviction, yet this
is only an After-game which they are fain to play
to save their Conscience or their Reputation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="499" facs="tcp:63657:254"/>
5. Consider before you entertain any Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to change, Whether it be your <hi>unfained</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
whatever shall happen to you, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to that side which shall appear most <hi>reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
Perhaps you are not yet arrived to that
Height of Impiety as to resolve <hi>right</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi> to
change your <hi>Religion,</hi> whether you find it <hi>true</hi> or
<hi>false</hi> upon a <hi>just</hi> and <hi>fair</hi> Examination; for this is
such an <hi>horrible</hi> defiance of <hi>God,</hi> such an <hi>express</hi>
and <hi>absolute</hi> Renunciation of all that is <hi>sacred</hi> and
<hi>good</hi> as no Man can be guilty of who is not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abandoned of all his <hi>natural</hi> Sense of <hi>Religion,</hi>
and Relish of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi> But yet perhaps
you may be tempted to change with the Prospect
of such Advantages on the <hi>one</hi> side, and Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
on the <hi>other,</hi> which though it doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of you that <hi>base</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi> Resolution; yet
doth so far prevail as to engage you upon a <hi>fresh</hi>
Enquiry to try whether upon <hi>second</hi> Thoughts
and <hi>better</hi> Consideration, you can satisfie your
own Minds of the Truth of that <hi>Religion</hi> you are
invited to turn to, that so you may, if possible,
comply with a <hi>good</hi> Conscience, and secure your
Interest in doing your Duty. And thus far you
are safe enough; but before you proceed any
farther, it concerns you, as you tender your
<hi>everlasting</hi> Interest, to look into your <hi>own</hi> Souls,
and consider seriously whether you are unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
resolved, whatsoever the Consequence of
Things may be, to cleave fast to the Truth of
<hi>God</hi> on which side soever you shall find it. Put
the Question to your selves over and over, <hi>O my
Soul, here are such Advantages, and such Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
before you, importuning you to change your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
discountenanced Religion for a more thriving and
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:63657:255"/>
prosperous One: Are you now resolved fairly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
to examine the Merit of the Cause?</hi> And
if thereupon you still find Reason to believe
that your <hi>present Religion</hi> is the very Truth of
<hi>Iesus,</hi> will you rather renounce <hi>those</hi> Advantages
and incur <hi>those</hi> Calamities than forgoe it? Will
you follow the Truth wheresoever you find it,
and whithersoever it shall happen to lead you,
though it be from Preferment into Persecution?
Are you resolved by the Grace of <hi>God</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
all your <hi>temporal</hi> Hopes and Fears before
it, and rather to lose any <hi>Good,</hi> or suffer any
<hi>Evil</hi> than desert it? For let me tell you, if you
find your Heart shrink at this Proposal, or that
you have any <hi>reserved</hi> Intention, if the worst
come to the worst, rather to part with your
<hi>Religion</hi> right or wrong, than to shake hands
with your <hi>temporal</hi> Interest, you are in a very
<hi>unfitting</hi> Temper to examine on which side the
Truth lies. For it is a <hi>plain</hi> Case, your Mind
is under a <hi>prevailing</hi> Byass of <hi>temporal</hi> Hopes and
Fears, which will be sure to incline it to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that side of the Question which is most
for your Interest, and 'twill be impossible for
you to examine fairly and judge impartially
whilst your Judgment is thus bribed and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by your Interest. For your Will hath
already determined upon the Matter before ever
your Understanding hath heard the Cause, and
it is your <hi>secret</hi> Intention, right or wrong, to
forgoe your <hi>Religion</hi> rather than your Interest,
if ever they come in Competition. So that now
you will be obliged in your <hi>own</hi> Defence to use
your <hi>utmost</hi> Art to set the <hi>fairest</hi> Colours upon
the Evidences against your <hi>Religion,</hi> and to stifle
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:63657:255"/>
and enervate those that assert and maintain it, lest
they should so confirm you in the Belief of it as
that, when Occasion requires, you will not be
able to surrender it <hi>up</hi> without committing an
<hi>horrible</hi> Outrage and Violence upon your selves.
Wherefore before you suffer your <hi>worldly</hi> Hopes
and Fears to summon your <hi>Religion</hi> upon a <hi>new</hi>
Tryal, be sure you fix this Resolution in your
Souls; <hi>By the Grace of God I will now lay aside all
Interest and Affection, and strictly examin the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on hoth Sides with an equal and unbyass'd Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I will attend to nothing but the Reasons of
Things and the pure Merits of the Cause; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I find the Truth lies, whether on the Side of my
Interest or against it, I will be sure to follow it what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall be the Event and Issue.</hi> For if upon the
Temptation of any <hi>worldly</hi> Interest you bring
your <hi>Religion</hi> to a <hi>new</hi> Tryal, with this <hi>secret</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
that though it should still approve it self
to your Judgment, yet you will rather part
with it than abandon <hi>that</hi> Interest, this very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
will be apt to blind and mislead your
Judgment, to arm your Wit and Reason against
your <hi>Religion,</hi> and to set all your Faculties at
work to argue you out of it, and pervert you
from ii to a <hi>contrary</hi> Faith and Persuasion; which
if it should accomplish, you will certainly be
found <hi>guilty</hi> of a <hi>wilful</hi> Apostacy when you
come to be tryed before the Tribunal of <hi>God,</hi>
to whose <hi>all-seeing</hi> Eye the most <hi>secret</hi> Motions of
your Souls are as <hi>visible</hi> as if they were written
on your Foreheads with a Sun-beam; who sees
your <hi>treacherous</hi> Heart, and <hi>false</hi> Intention rather
to forsake his Truth than your Interest, and
knows very well that it is this that seduces you,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:63657:256"/>
and gives Force to those <hi>false</hi> Reasons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
that impose upon your Judgment, and
betray your Faith.</p>
            <p>6. And lastly, When you fall under any Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to change your <hi>Religion,</hi> consider whether
before you were inclined to change you did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously
comply with the Obligations of it.
We have <hi>too</hi> many Men that pretend to be mighty
<hi>inquisitive</hi> after the <hi>true Church</hi> and the <hi>true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
and yet live as if there were no such Thing
as <hi>true Religion</hi> in the World, and quietly allow
themselves in such <hi>impious</hi> Courses as do openly
affront the <hi>common</hi> Principles of all Religions.
There is nothing they dread so much as <hi>Heresy,</hi>
and, if you will believe them, are monstrously
concerned to examine whether the <hi>Church</hi> with
which they now communicate be <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical;</hi>
and yet all this while they persist without
any Concern or Remorse in the most <hi>damnable
Heresy</hi> in the World, and that is a <hi>wicked</hi> and
<hi>immoral</hi> Life. So that upon comparing their <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istical</hi>
Lives with the <hi>loud</hi> Cry they make about
the <hi>true Catholick Faith</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> one would be
tempted to think that their <hi>Christianity</hi> began at
the <hi>wrong</hi> End of their <hi>Creed,</hi> and that they believed
in the <hi>Holy Catholick Church</hi> before they believe
<hi>in God the Father Almighty,</hi> or <hi>in Iesus Christ his
only Son our Lord;</hi> Which is such a <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som</hi>
Piece of Hypocrisy as one would think any
<hi>modest</hi> Man should be ashamed of. For in the
name of <hi>God;</hi> Sirs, What have you to do to
wrangle and make a Noise about <hi>Religion,</hi> whose
<hi>prostigate</hi> Manners are a Shame and Scandal to
<hi>common</hi> Humanity? It is a Reproach to any <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
for <hi>you</hi> to name it, and Shame to any <hi>Church</hi>
               <pb n="503" facs="tcp:63657:256"/>
for <hi>you</hi> to pretend to it; and therefore when such
as <hi>you</hi> raise a Cry after the <hi>true Church</hi> and <hi>true
Religion,</hi> it is a <hi>plain</hi> Case that whatever Pretence
you bring upon the Stage you are prompted by
some <hi>base</hi> Interest behind the Curtain. And is it
not a <hi>pleasant</hi> Thing to hear such <hi>Profligates</hi> as
these pretend to be <hi>Converts,</hi> who only turn from
<hi>one</hi> Opinion to <hi>another,</hi> but still continue as <hi>wicked</hi>
and <hi>unreformed</hi> in their Manners under the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
they turn to, as they were under <hi>that</hi> they
turned from? These are such Converts as there
is no <hi>Church</hi> is the World that advances <hi>true</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
above <hi>worldly</hi> Interest, but would glory to
lose, and blush to gain: And what <hi>Diogenes</hi> said
of a <hi>wicked</hi> Fellow that praised him, that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
may say which those Men turn to, <hi>What
Hurt have I done, what wicked Principles am I guilty
of that such vile Wretches as these should commend
and embrace me?</hi> For for God's sake, what is it
that they are converted to? Is it to any Thing
that renders them <hi>wiser</hi> or <hi>better</hi> Men? No, The
contrary is <hi>too notorious</hi> through the whole Course
of their Actions. Well then, it seems they are
converted to something that doth them no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Good, that serves them to no <hi>true</hi> End of
<hi>Religion,</hi> that is to a <hi>meer empty</hi> Notion that only
gingles about their Understandings, but hath no
<hi>good</hi> Influence on their Hearts and Manners. Had
their Conversion proceeded upon <hi>pure</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Conscience, that would have obliged
them to change their Manners as well as their
Opinions; there being very <hi>few</hi> Opinions in
<hi>Religion</hi> so <hi>contradictory</hi> to the <hi>natural</hi> Sentimnents
of Conscience as a <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>immoral</hi> Life. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that the <hi>Papal Supremacy, Purgatory,</hi>
               <pb n="504" facs="tcp:63657:257"/>
and <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> were true, yet that the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>
Doctrins to these are Errors can never be
so evident to any Man's Conscience, as that
<hi>Drunkenness, Adultery, Fraud</hi> and <hi>Oppression</hi> are
Sins; and therefore for any Man to pretend that
he forsook <hi>those</hi> Errors out of Conscience, who
yet makes no Conscience of continuing in <hi>these</hi>
Sins is such a <hi>transparent</hi> Hypocrisy as hath not
Vizor and Disguize enough to abuse either the
most <hi>Candid</hi> or <hi>Credulous.</hi> If therefore before
you are resolved to forsake your Sins you are
tempted to forsake your <hi>Religion,</hi> it is a <hi>plain</hi>
Case that it is not your Conscience or Conviction
that tempts you, but your Lust or Interest. Had
it been Conscience, it would have been far more
<hi>importunate</hi> with you to reform your Manners
than your Faith, and to become <hi>good</hi> Men, than
<hi>Catholick Believers;</hi> and therefore under your
<hi>present</hi> Circumstances you ought to be very <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
what you do, and how you comply with the
Temptation, lest to all the Rest of your Sins you
add that <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>fatal</hi> one of Apostacy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
fill up the Measure of your Iniquities, and <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi>
provoke <hi>Almighty God</hi> to abandon you as
you have abandoned him, and give you up for
<hi>lost</hi> and <hi>desperate.</hi>
