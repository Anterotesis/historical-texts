         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſayth, that the diuell was dumb, who being caſt out of the

dumbneſſe, not to the diuell as firſt was affirmed, but to
the bodie poſſeſſed, which (hauing beene dumbe) ſpake.
<hi>Et cum eieciſſet Demonium, loquutus eſt mutuis.</hi>

            <p>Now although the right ſenſe be, that he who firſt was

agreeing with the hidden voyce of the letter, it is
true that the dumb ſpake, abyding alſo in his dumbneſſe,
becauſe he ſpake well, as the Euangeliſt noteth; <hi>Et loque.
batur rectè:</hi> hee being dumbe, and yet ſpeaking by the
meanes of the holy ſpirite, therefore wee alſo are ſilent,
and God ſpeaketh in and by vs, when we ſpeake well and

be reputed as a foole, and many haue incurred very great daungers,

of the flatterer is moſt perillous, and, by breathing foorth many euils,
it interdicteth the trueth, especially among Noble perſonages, in
whoſe houſes flatterers do moſt of all abound, onely to enioy the goods
which they poſſeſſe. This is confirmed by many liuely examples, ſundry
probabilities out of holy Scripture, and other ſimilitudes: All which

there comes another more fooliſh, or rather more malitious then the
firſt, who ſo ſtirs &amp; blowes the little ſparke, that it breaks forth into a

A great fault was it in the firſt, but much greater (me thinkes) in the

                  <p>Diſcourſing of the double tongue, to wit, that of the hypocrite and falſe
man, who hath one thing in his mouth, and another in his heart:
Whereby he makes himſelfe hatefull to God, to the very deuils, and
alſo to men. Of an hypocrite, what thing it is, how hardly he is to be
knowen of men, and of deuils: being compared to the Comedian; the
gallant dogge, that hath a ſmooth quick tongue; and to the vapour
exhaled by the Sunne vp into the ayre. The hypocrite hath his mouth
in heauen, and his tongue on earth. And he is alſo compared to the
ſwoord of Holofernes, of Saul, and of Goliah. &amp;c.</p>

ſlight words you ſeeme to paſſe it ouer. For, if man him ſelfe, no, nor
the Angels, but onely God alone knowes the inward of the heart;
<hi>Deus autem intuetur cor,</hi> how can your ſpeeches holde? The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
ſpeaking holy words, and doing deeds correſpondent to thoſe

becauſe vertue conſiſteth not in the verbe,<note place="margin">Sentence.</note> but in the aduerbe, that
is to ſay, not in lip-labour, praying, giuing almes, faſting, pardoning
offences outwardly, puniſhing the body, ceremonious viſitation of

truely, well, iuſtly and really to the glory of God.</p>

ſuch perſons are not worthy to bee bidden to this eternall

                  <p>Hee that would talke with God, muſt eyther learne to bee ſilent, or
speake farre otherwiſe then he did before: becauſe his heart is
to bee firſt purged of wicked thoughtes, and his lippes made
cleane from ſpeaking of euill. Hee that conferres with God,
muſt either holde his peace, or ſpeake very little, in regard of
the greatneſſe of diuine myſteries. Or he muſt talke highlie, by
a new kinde of ſpeaking, as being lifted vp by diuine aſſiſtaunce
of the holy Ghoſt. For approbation whereof, diuers ſound teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
out of ſacred Scripture are produced. As of Moyſes,
Ieremie, Daniell, Paul, and the other Apoſtles, Silence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
makes the foole to ſeeme wiſe, and the want of ſpeech is the
gift of God, as well as talking in many languages. Heerein like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
is diſcourſed, whence it proceedeth that ſome are borne dumbe,

the ayde of much heate, and moderate dryneſſe. Wherfore, they

tardy of ſpeech, becauſe their tongue is very cold and moiſte, aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
alwayes with much water, and ſpettle in the mouth. By which
diſpoſition, they haue a very moiſte and relaxe tongue, becauſe they
ſpit much and often; which quality both ſlowes, and alſo greatlie
weakens the tongue, ſo that it cannot duely attend on the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
part: which contrariwiſe better in the diſpoſed body, makes it
to be very ſtrong and gallant. And the tongue cannot run to ſpeake
ſo diſtinctly and readily, as when it receiueth due order from the

that the tongue which is faſtened to the palate, by reaſon of ouer

doe they vtter theyr mindes with very gracious eloquence. Which
in Phlegmaticke bodies is cleane contrary, who being quiet and

                  <p>If the impediment of the tongue in ſpeech, do come by

<hi>Moyſes,</hi> he was hindred by the ſelfe ſame infirmitie, when

                  <p>I beſeech thee (O my Lord) lay not this burden vpon me, becauſe
the execution of ſuch an office, had need of ſuch an eloquent perſon,
as can very readily and with eloquence deliuer his Embaſſie, wherin
I know my ſelfe to be vtterly vnable. For ſince I thy moſt vnworthy

the infinite maieſty of God, do breake foorth into continuall diuine

to ſtand all ſilent, diuinely contemplating this exceeding maieſty, &amp;

loue abates and extinguiſheth another. The loue of God chaſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all loue of our ſelues, and of the world, &amp; the neerer we neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

the more knowledge hath he of his owne defects, euen as by the

Therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> reputed himſelfe vnwoorthy, to talke vnto
God, ſaying; <hi>Quomodo poterit ſeruus Domini mei loqui cum Domino

would haue ſayd. I am not woorthy to behold, much leſſe to ſpeake

vile dirt and aſhes. And, in great humility, our forefather <hi>Abraham</hi>

                  <p>We may yet hereto adde another notable myſtery vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this place,

<hi>Moyſes,</hi> before he talked with god, ſpake well and freely enough:
but ſo ſooone as god ſpake to him, he became a ſtammerer. And <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi>

                  <p>Al which happened,<note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between our ſpeaking to God, and to men.</note> becauſe there is great difference, between
our ſpeaking to god, and our conferring with men. In our ſpeaking
to god, we learne to be ſilent, as may be diſcerned by thoſe former
alleadged examples. And in that to men, we learne nothing elſe but
to talke onely. For he that among men talketh not, is held to be a

                  <p>To the end, that in our diſcourſing we ſhould not grow offenſiue to God,
it behooueth vs (with deuout heartes) to beg of him that he would
purifie our minds, and purge our lippes. According as Dauid
did, who prayed to the Lord, that he would open his mouth, to the
end that he might woorthily praiſe him. And, without him, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
speake well, becauſe he hath the keye of our mouth. Which is
approoued by a ſentence produced out of Eſay, where he ſayth, that
Chriſt is the key of Dauid. He therewith openeth the mouth, and
giueth not much of what we know to aske for, becauſe we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
things correſpondent to his greatneſſe. Moreouer, not onely
are the lippes opened therewith, but likewiſe the heart, the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
the Scriptures, types and figures, yea, heauen it ſelfe, and
the mouthes of the Saintes and Prophets: and without this keye, all
things remaine ſhut vp, and euery mouth dumbe.</p>

ſometime producing authorities from holy writ, and other whiles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the auncienteſt Philoſophers. At length (after a ſweete and ſent enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
arguing) they conclude, that there is more ſecuritie in ſilence,
then indiſcreete talking: in regard, that while each man ſtriues to
speake beſt, his owne conceipt doth ſooneſt deceiue him. And this
is confirmed by diuine proofes, witty ſayings of Philoſophers, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
reaſons. Chap. 1. Fol. 1.</item>
               <item>Proceeding further on, it is here approoued, that the firſt inſtruction a
man ought to haue, is to ſpeake diſcreetely, without offence to any.
Heere (in an ample diſcourſe) the negligence of Fathers in their
families is much reprooued, for not inſtructing their children in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
whereby they may attaine to a perfect order of ſpeaking.
For which purpoſe, many curious ſentences of the auncient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
are herein entercourſed, beſide diuers other out of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Chap. 2. Fol. 11.</item>
               <item>Heere are deliuered many examples of worthy men, true affecters
of ſilence: And in this Chapter, they diſcourſe on the foure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

Chap. 3. Fol. 25.</item>
               <item>Herein is handled, which is the hardeſt matter for a man, eyther ſilence
or ſpeaking. And to this purpoſe each one alleageth ſeuerall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
with many examples out of the auncient Philoſophers, as alſo
authorities out of the ſacred Scriptures: they ſhew, likewiſe, many
inconueniences which ariſe by the tongue. A diſcourſe very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,

God onely is truth, and euery man a lyer: conſidering that many
haue spoken the truth, as well Philoſophers of the Gentiles, as alſo
many Chriſtians: A diſcourſe ful of learning, and pleaſing curioſities.
Chap. 5. Fol. 43.</item>
               <item>Declaring, what cuſtodie we ought to haue of our tongue, to auoide er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

when we talke: which although they be foure in number, yet one
onely guarde is ſufficient for them all. Chap. 6. Fol. 54.</item>
               <item>Declaring, that to keepe our ſelues from idle wandering in our talking,
it behooueth, that our ſpeech ſhould haue fiue conditions or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
which the tongue it ſelfe hath, namely: ſweet, Roſe coloured,
ſharpe, flexible, and cloſe couched: which are approoued by many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
of Scripture, as alſo witty ſayings of the Philoſophers, and
naturall examples. Chap. 7. Fol. 66.</item>
               <item>Approouing, that indiſcretion in talke, makes the wiſe man him ſelfe to
be reputed as a foole, and many haue incurred very great daungers,
by talking careleſlie &amp; vnaduiſedlie. Among al tongues, the tongue
of the flatterer is moſt perillous, &amp;, by breathing foorth many euils,
it interdicteth the truth, eſpecially among Noble perſonages, in
whoſe houſes flatterers do moſt of all abound, onely to enioy the goods
which they poſſeſſe. This is confirmed by many liuely examples, ſundry
probabilities out of holy Scripture, &amp; other ſimilitudes: All which
do plainly prooue, how diſpleaſing to God, and hurtfull to men, is this
wicked vice of flattery, that (like another Iudas) kils a man with kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
Chap. 8. Fol. 82.</item>
               <item>Diſcourſing of the leaſing and lying tongue, what an infamous ſinne a
lye is, and how highly God is pleaſed with truth: of whoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie
and beautie, ariſeth a profitable ſhort diſcourſe, concluding,
that a ſtrict ſilence is more commendable, then telling of lyes, which
are greatly diſpleaſing to God, becauſe he is the truth himſelfe. Alſo
approouing, that lying is ſo brutiſh and damnble, as no one can ſo
much as thinke thereon, without a purpoſe, to deface ſome part of
truth. Chap. 9. Fol. 96.</item>
               <item>Herein, according to the courſe hitherto continued, they now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
on the ſeuerall tongues of the detractor and murmurer, and
vpon what occaſion, the Deuill (hauing a great delight to lye, and
<pb facs="tcp:16417:149"/>
accuſe vs) was ſaid to be dumbe. Herein likewiſe are handled many
deceipts of the Deuill, many myſteries of confeſſing our ſinnes vnto
God: and how one Angell is ſaid to ſpeak vnto another, without
ſight of each other: A diſcourſe very curious, learned and profitable.
Chap. 10. Fol. 111.</item>
               <item>Continuing on ſtill the ſame matter and diſcourſe, with diuers other
excellent reproofes of this mightie ſinne of vnwillingneſſe to repent,
and eaſing our conſciences of the heauy burthen of ſinne, wherein no
ſilence is to be kept. And that the detractors tongue is like the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents:
Alſo, how we ought ſometime to crye out, &amp; ſometimes to hold
our peace. Chap. 11. Fol. 127.</item>
               <item>Diſcourſing on the murmuring and detracting tongue, &amp; how fitlye
it ſhould bee bound to eternall ſilence; for the praiſe thereof is
ſhame, and the honour, moſt hatefull. Alſo, that the detractor
is not onely abhominable, but is meerely abhomination it ſelfe: for
whatſoeuer hee ſees, he makes a moſt vile interpretation thereof.
Chap. 12. Fol. 137.</item>
               <item>Murmuring is an infectious ſinne, worſe then any other diſeaſe, and
eaſie to bee taken, therefore it behooueth vs to fly the company of
talkeatiue detractors, becauſe they are the originall of many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilles.
Whence it is that murmuring firſt ariſeth. What pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
God hath inflicted on murmurers: who haue leapt out
of themſelues (as it were) to faſten holde on other mens imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and ſtealing much leſſe then they looked for, at laſt vtterly
loſt all. How they haue ioined the tongue with the ear; how they haue
deceiued themſelues ouer-much in iudgement, by their owne dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
facility in ſpeaking euill of all men, to which God will giue (as a
chaſtiſement) a perpetuall ſilence. With an exhortation of the holy
ghoſt, not to defame, but to refraine ſpeaking euill of our neighbor.
Chap. 13. Fol. 147.</item>
               <item>There is not any thing more vneaſie or inſupportable, neyther leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing
loue, then the tongue of the ſlaunderer and deprauer. And
more eaſilie the Aegyptians might ſuffer the plague offrogges, then
we can endure the defamers tongue. What the cauſe was, why God
ſent ſuch a puniſhment vpon the Aegyptians, by creatures ſo vile, &amp;
vn apt to offend. How difficult a thing it is to heale the plague of
the tongue, declaring and approouing, that God onely muſt heale it:
as he healed Aegypt, purified the lips of Eſay, and reſtored ſpeech to
the dumbe. The murmurer is worſe then a theefe, &amp; is figured in the
rauenous birdes, reiected in the diuine ſacrifices. Chap. 14. Fol. 156.</item>

Diſcourſing of the double tongue, to wit, that of the hypocrite and falſe
man, who hath one thing in his mouth, and another in his heart:
Whereby he makes himſelfe hatefull to God, to the very deuils, and
alſo to men. Of an hypocrite, what thing it is, how hardly he is to be
knowen of men, and of deuils: being compared to the Comedian; the
gallant dogge, that hath a ſmooth quicke tongue; and to the vapour
exhaled by the Sunne vp into the ayre. The hypocrite hath his mouth
in heauen, and his tongue on earth. And he is alſo compared to the
ſwoord of <hi>Holofernes,</hi> of <hi>Saul,</hi> and of <hi>Goliah,</hi> &amp;c. Chapter.
15. Fol. 166.</item>
               <item>The hypocrite, becauſe he hath holie words onely, without deeds, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the glow-worme: to the ſtatue which Nebuchadnezzer ſaw
in his dreame, that had a head of gold onelie: he hath his left hand
about God, &amp; his right vnder his head. He hath more faces the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one,
disfiguring it to appear onely, but not to be good indeed: he goes foorth
of his owne confines; he ſuffers himſelfe to be guided in his actions,
like vnto a brute beaſt: with his beſt vertue he buieth ſle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der rewards,
&amp; hangs his praiſe vpon other mens lips. He is like to the brood hen,
that cals her young ones to eat, &amp; almoſt ſtarues her ſelfe to death:
like to the theefe, that ſhooes a horſe backward, to deceiue the purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
with many other worthy by compariſons againſt the double hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
tongue. Chap. 16. Fol. 173.</item>
               <item>The tongue of the hypocrite, when it teacheth or inſtructeth, is like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, ſeuerally grafted vpon one ſtock: or, as when vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thornes,
there hangeth grapes: or like the fooliſh virgins, that had euery thing
anſwerable to the wiſe, but yet ſtaied without; whereon, a notable doubt
is reſolued. It is alſo compared to the Eſtridge whoſe wings doe reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Haukes in colour, but yet are not able to beare her body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft.
Or like to the vaine woman, who becauſe ſhe would ſeeme faire,
paints her ſelfe. How much it behooues vs to be readie, in ſubduing
the appetite of vaine-glorie, which is diſcouered moſt, in ſtriuing to
ſpeake fine and curiouſlie. Chap. 17. Fol. 182.</item>
               <item>Heerein theſe are reprooued, that are good onely of their tongue, but
wicked in their deedes. Reſembling the poore man, who would faine
take a rich wife, but (in regard of his pouerty) none in his owne
country will accept of him: Wherefore, cloathing him ſelfe in
ſtrange garments, he trauailes to ſpeede where he is not knowen.
Such men are compared to builders, that lay vnwrought ſtones in
the foundation, but aloft to the eye, they place curious ſtones of richer
labour. They are alſo like to Pyrates on the Seas, with lying ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
<pb facs="tcp:16417:150"/>
like as the Sichemites: like to Ioſephs cloake: like to the wife of
Potifar: and like to the aprons of figge leaues, which Adam and
Eue made for themſelues. They are like to <hi>Ahaz</hi> the king: like to
the Dolphine: like to the Phyſitian, that cures others, yet helps not
himſelfe. They are like to the white wall ſhewne to <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> they are
good for others, and hurtfull to them ſelues: Here is ſome ſpeeche
vſed, of the greate paines threatned to ſuch, as alſo of the reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
which God in his iudgement will giue them: A ſubiect, by howe
much the more curious, by ſo much it is the more true and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Chap. 18 Fol. 190.</item>
               <item>Herein is declared, that the ſinne of blaſphemy is moſt greate and
greeuous, inſomuch that it exceedeth euery other ſinne, euen
of the infidelles, and of the Iewes, who crucified our Lord and Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
It is aggrauated by many circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, and hath no appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
as diuers other ſinnes may ſeeme to haue. It is a ſinne eternall,
in regard of the exerciſe thereof; becauſe among all ſinnes, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
only remaineth with the damned, euen as charity dooth among
the bleſſed, and is puniſhed with euery part of the law. It is the ſinne of
vnthankefulneſſe; the puniſhment whereof ſometime beginneth in
this world, and yet is neuer finiſhed. It is a manifeſt ſigne of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
&amp; a ſin ſo abhominable, as the holy Scripture ſomtime forbeareth
to name it, among the reherſall of other grieuous offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. A diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
very profitable, ingenious, neceſſarie &amp; worthy to be noted for
feare of fulling into a ſin ſo horrible and deteſtable. Chap. 19. fol. 201<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </item>
               <item>Approuing that it is better to haue no tongue at al, and to be ſilent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally,
then to fall into any of the before remembred vices. What
benefit enſueth by the priuation of ſpeeche, of which, although wee
ſhould haue no vſe at all, yet we are not voyde of the ſpeeche of the
mind; which is much more excellent, and ſooner liſtned vnto by god
himſelfe, then to the careleſſe and idle babling of the lippes. He
that wanteth ſpeeche, is disburdened of a heauy loade, and may the
eaſier preſerue himſelfe from many heauy charges: becauſe by the
tongue of the body, we pleaſe men onely, but by the tongue of the hart,
we become pleaſing to God. Euery man hath two lips, but the iuſt
man hath his vpper lip much greater then the nether. Contrarywiſe,
the wicked man hath his nether lip ſo great, as therewith he couereth
his whole face, and all the ſtrength of bad men conſiſteth in their
lips; which is approued by a ſhort, yet ſweet diſcourſe, and afterward
pleaſingly concluded on the behalfe of ſilence, approuing it to be much
more allowable then ſpeeche. Chap. 20. Fol. 216.</item>

to bee firſt purged of wicked thoughtes, and his lippes made
cleane from ſpeaking of euill. Hee that conferres with God,
muſt either holde his peace, or ſpeake very little, in regarde of
the greateneſſe of diuine myſteries. Or hee muſt talke highlie, by
a newe kinde of ſpeaking, as being lifted up by diuine aſſiſtaunce
of the holy Ghoſt. For approbation whereof, diuers ſound teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
out of ſacred Scripture are produced. As of <hi>Moyſes,
Ieremie, Daniell, Paule,</hi> and the other Apoſtles. Silence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
makes the foole to ſeeme wiſe, and the want of ſpeeche is the
gift of God, as well as talking in many languages. Heerin like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

               <item>To the end, that in our diſcourſing we ſhould not grow offenſiue to God,
it behooueth vs (with deuout heartes) to beg of him that he woulde

did, who prayed to the Lord that he would open his mouth, to the
end that he might worthily praiſe him. And, without him, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

approued by a ſentence produced out of Eſay, where he ſaith, that
Chriſt is the key of Dauid. He therwith openeth the mouth, and
giueth not much of what we knowe to aſke for, becauſe we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
things correſpondent to his greatneſſe. Moreouer, not only
are the Lippes opened therewith, but likewiſe the heart, the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
