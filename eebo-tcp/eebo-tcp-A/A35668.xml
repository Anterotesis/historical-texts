            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe following Verses seem so bold in the design, and so much bolder in the execution, that tho I have made use of all the little Iudgment I had to distinguish this boldness from such horrible extravagancies as have been lately so falsly and unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly laid to my charge, yet lest some people should conclude from a bare appearance that I have gone too far, it will not be amiss to shew what the Ode and its Character is in general what <hi>Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi> and his manner was in particular, and how far it may be convenient to imitate him in our Age, and in our Language and Climate. <hi>L'Ode</hi> (says <hi>Rapin) doit auoir autant de no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesse, d' elevation, &amp; d'emportment, que l' eglogue a de simplicite, de pudeur, &amp; de modestie. Ce n'est pas seule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment par son Esprit qu'elle est grande, c'est aussi par sa matiere. Car elle s'occupe a chanter les louanges des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieux, &amp; a celebrer les actions les plus glorieuses des hommes. Ainsi elle demande pour soutenir toute la Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeste de son charactere, un naturel eleve, un esprit grand, une imagination hardie, une expression noble &amp; eclatante mais pure &amp; correcte. Tout ce que l'art a de vivacite par ses figures, n'est pas suffisant, pour eleuer l'Ode autant que demande son charactere. The Ode</hi> (says <hi>Rapin) ought to have as much greatness, elevation and violence, as the Eglogue is oblig'd to have modesty, restraint and simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. It is not only great by the sublimeness of its Spirit, but by the greatness of its Subjects. For it is made use of to sing the praises of gods, and to celebrate the most glrious actions of men. So that it requires, to keep up all
<pb facs="tcp:97825:3"/>
that majesty that belongs to its character, a great wit, an exalted genius, a daring imagination, and at once a pure and a noble and sounding expression. All the vivacity that art can supply by its most glaring figures is hardly suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to exalt the Ode so much as its character requires.</hi> Thus far goes <hi>Rapin;</hi> and we may conclude from the words of that famous Critic, that the Ode ought to have as much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, elevation and majesty, as Epic Poetry it self; but then it is certain that it ought to have more vehemence, more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport and more enthusiasm. The reason is evident, For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the Ode (I mean upon great occasions) is, like that of Heroic Poetry, to move the Reader, and cause in him admiration. Now by Heroic Poetry, the Readers mind is exalted gradually, with a more sedate and compos'd Majesty; but the Ode, by reason of the shortness of its compass, is oblig'd to fly into tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport at first, and to make use immediately of all its fury, and its most violent efforts, or else it would want time to work its effect.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Virgil</hi> begins his <hi>Aeneis</hi> calmly and modestly, whereas the greatest thought in one of the noblest Odes of <hi>Horace.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>Si fractus illabatur orbis</l>
                  <l>Impavidum ferient Ruinae.</l>
               </q>
Which I have imitated in my eleventh Stanza is in his very first. Let us now consider the Character of <hi>Pindar,</hi> which we may have from the same <hi>Rapin,</hi> and which will include the character too of his Wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ings. <hi>Il est grand dans ses desseins, vaste dans ses pensees, hardy dans ses imaginations, heu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reux dans ses expressions, eloquent dans ses discours. He is great in his designs (says</hi> Rapin) <hi>vast in his Ideas, daring in his Images, happy in his expression, and eloquent in his discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here <hi>Rapin</hi> falls short of his character, and leaves out some of his most considerable qualities, which may be supply'd from one divine Stanza which <hi>Horace</hi> has writ in his Praise.
<q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:97825:3"/>
                  <l>Monte decurrens, velut amnis, imbres</l>
                  <l>Quem super notas aluere ripas</l>
                  <l>Fervet, immensusque ruit profundo</l>
                  <bibl>Pindarus ore.</bibl>
               </q>
Which in <hi>English</hi> Poetical paraphrastick Prose is thus. <hi>As a stream that is listed above its usual banks by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of celestial waters, comes rowling headlong from some Mountains Top, so</hi> Pindar <hi>rais'd by influence divine, ev'n above his own exalted Genius; grows vehement, swells, and ferments with fury, then precipitately flows with a mighty sound, and knows no bounds to his impetuous course.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reader will easily discern that here are some great qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities conspicuous in <hi>Pindar,</hi> which <hi>Rapin</hi> seems not to take notice of. Here is his vehemence, his impetuousness, and the magnificent sounds of his numbers; and here is another thing which is the result of the rest, and that is something dreadful, something which terribly shakes us, at the very same time it transports us. There remains some other things which all the World has observ'd in <hi>Pindar,</hi> and that is, his affected digressions, his perpetual rambles, and his sudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected returns. But 'tis now time to consider how far he may be imitated in our Language and Climate. An <hi>English</hi> Writer may endeavour to imitate him in several of his greatest quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by the Genius of our Nation, which is bold and sublime, as Mr. <hi>Waller</hi> has observ'd. But then he ought to be discreet in his boldness; for our Language is not capable of some of the most violent figures of <hi>Pindar</hi>; and in aiming at two of his principal qualities, which are his Sublimity and his Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, he ought carefully to avoid two things, and those are Fustian and superfluity of Epithetes. Now 'tis the easiest thing in the World for a man to know whether he has avoided them, if he has but sensible Friends. Let him consult them, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve whether his Verses strike and warm them or not. Where
<pb facs="tcp:97825:4"/>
they do warm them and strike them, it may serve for an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rule, that there can be no Fustian, for a man of Sense must have a very fantastick opinion of himself, if he thinks that the false Sublime can warm him. Fustian is to such a one the coldest thing in the World. For I take it to proceed only from an Impotent effort of the mind to rise, when it wants both warmth and force to take its flight with vigour. Now as Verses that seem warm to a man of sense can never contain any Fusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, so the same rule may serve for superfluous Epithetes. For nothing makes Versifying colder than a clog of superfluous Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetes. Epithetes are execrable, where they are not necessary, or at least convenient. And they can never be necessary, but where they add to the Thought something which ought to be added; and they can never be convenient, but where they give force to the Expression, or grace or perspicuity. Words are to Thought, what Flesh is to the human Soul; now Flesh encreasing to such a degree, imparts Comeliness, and perhaps Majesty; but swelling beyond it, it brings Deformity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, and becomes a clog to the Mind. And as in a Body where the Soul performs all its functions freely, there cannot be too much Flesh, so in a work of the Mind, where there is a free Spirit, there cannot be too much Expression. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the business, from which I may be said to have in some measure digress'd. As we ought not to imitate <hi>Pindar</hi> in the boldness of some of his figures, so neither in the wildness of his frequent digressions; as Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> has imitated him. For the <hi>English</hi> Reader, generally speaking, not having half the degree of Fire which the <hi>Grecians</hi> had, nor Spirits so strangely volatile, cannot immediately Sympathize with an Author in his sudden and impetuous starts from his subject; nor discern in a moment the almost imperceptible connexion between the Digression and the principal matter. Experience is a proof of what I have said. For the generality of Readers, nay even some who are Men of Wit, are declar'd Enemies to the <hi>Olympick,</hi> and the <hi>Neme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Ode of <hi>Pindar,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> has so admirably made our own; and the reasons which they give, are the length and
<pb facs="tcp:97825:4"/>
wildness of the Digressions. But now since I have made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that great man, I beg leave to take notice of some other errors which he appears to have been guilty of in his imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Pindar.</hi> The one is an affectation of pointed Wit: For all points in a serious subject are little, and cold, and weak and wanton; whereas the Ode ought to be by its character, strong, and warm, and grave, and great, and exalted. The second is his want of Design in some of his Pindarick Odes. The third is the Neglect of his Style, which seems in several places not to have Pomp and Majesty enough to answer the sublimeness of <hi>Pindar</hi>'s Genius. The fourth is the frequent loosing his Rhime, and the roughness of his Versification. I have taken care to decline his errors as far as my little capacity would give me leave. And I thought my self the more oblig'd to avoid his faults, because I am very sensible, that I am far from having his excellencies which are his fire and his mighty Spirit. In the writing these Pindarick Verses, I had still <hi>Milton</hi> in my Eye, and was resolv'd to imitate him as far as it could be done without receeding from <hi>Pindar's</hi> manner. They have several great qualities common to both, and among the rest, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, elevation, and a terrible Majesty; qualities which are far above me, but the violent desire I had to show, how I honour the Memory of the great Queen that is gone, made me insolently resolve to aspire to them. How I have succeeded I must leave to the Reader<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I leave the following Verses to his Iustice. For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Writer sooner or later will be sure to have Iustice done him. If these Verses are of Heav'n, they will be sure to stand, no Malice of Man can hurt or suppress them; but if they are human they will fall, no mortal aid can support them. <hi>Debemur morti nos nostraque.</hi> Of us and ours Death has the sure reversion: But Genius is a sacred beam of Divinity respected by the grim Destroyer.</p>

               <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
               <p>THE Preface was writ in so great a Hurry, that I have omitted some things which I design'd to insert. I had
<pb facs="tcp:97825:5"/>
the hint of the design from the sixth Book of <hi>Virgil,</hi> which the knowing Readers will easily discern, and which I think my self oblig'd to own to the rest.</p>
               <p>A Young Gentleman who is my Friend, and whose Wit and Learning are very well known in the World, accus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d me, upon the reading these Verses, of too much description. I hope the accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is groundless; for the wantonness of description is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted at all times (and more especially in a grave way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) a most intolerable fault. But I desire the Reader to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that there is a great deal of difference between the describing of persons and places, and the describing of action. In a Poem where is any design, if I am not mistaken, there ought to be some action. Now where there is action, it ought always to go forward, and nothing ought to be much insisted on, which can put any considerable stop to that. For which reason all descriptions of persons and places which are any thing large, are extremely faulty in a Poem which has a design. Now the Reader will easily discern, that I have been very retentive in such descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For I have given very little description of the Court of Death, and none at all of those who compose it. I have but barely nam'd them. Not only because those beings have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd before (for poetical persons and places are general: whereas an action is still particular) but because it would have put a stop to the action. But describing of action is a different thing. For the action in some measure goes on by description, which is often necessary for the better representation of it. And indeed it is my opinion, that there can be no Poetry without such description that is without Painting. And I am very confident, that most of the beauteous places in <hi>Virgil</hi> are nothing but action, clearly and vigorously describ'd. I have but one thing to add, and that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the numbers. I am not satisfy'd with my choice of them; but I have taken all the care that I could, that they should be harmonious in their kind.</p>

               <l>And to thy boundless sway subjected all;</l>

               <l>To that sublime Degree,</l>
