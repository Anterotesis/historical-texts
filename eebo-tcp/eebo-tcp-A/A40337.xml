         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Exhortation to Families, who have deſires to ſerve the Lord God in their ſeveral places, that they may all learn in the light of Christ Jeſus, the Wiſdome and Power of God, who is the true Teacher.</head>
            <p>O Ye Fathers, and Mothers, ſtand in the pure fear of the Lord, and wait in his light, that ye may receive his living Wiſdom, and live in it, that ſo ye may be ordered by it, and with it order all things to Gods glory, and bring up your children in the fear of the Lord, watching over them in the ſeaſoned ſavoury Life of God, not ſuffering them to live to wildneſs, nor idleneſs, nor vain talking (unreproved;) but in the ſober, meek ſpirit, and in the Authority of Gods Lamb, reprove them, and that will reach the Witneſs of God in them, and correct them in the Fear, and Wiſdom, and Freedom of God, in the patience, and follow not their fooliſh wills, neither correct them in your own wills, nor in haſtineſs, raſhneſs, or paſſion; for if ye do, then that will uſe the Rod, which is to be beaten with the Rod of God, and that will make your children more ſtubborn and wicked, and this will offend God; but ſtand ye in Gods Counſel, and diſcourage nothing in your children, but evil, and let them have that which is meet, juſt and reaſonable, and no more, that none of Gods creatures be waſted; and be ye patterns and good examples (in all holineſs, gravity and uprightneſs) unto them, and let them have ſufficient liberty to go to godly Meetings, and rather ſtir them up and incourage them to go to ſuch, then hinder or diſcourage them, and keep your minds out of them unto the Lord, and let your love to them be in the Lord, that ſo ye may feel his bleſſing coming upon you, and them.</p>
            <p>And all ye Children who have Parents, honour (and be obedient unto) them, in the Lord, and mind the light of Chriſt (in you) and that will not ſuffer ye to be wild, nor wilful, ſtubborn, nor vain, but it will check and reprove ye for all evil, and if ye will own its reproof, and believe and wait in it, it will lead ye out of all evil, and it will bring ye into ſoberneſs and meekneſs, tenderneſs and innocency, and preſerve ye in it, and it will bring ye to know and remember your Creator in the dayes of your youth, and it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal Gods Power and wiſdom in ye, whereby ye will be kept in true order: So ſuffer not your minds to follow vanity, neither walk in ſtubbornneſs towards your Parents, (nor others;) I warn ye in Gods fear, leſt he ſhorten your dayes, and cut ye off by his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgements; but mind his fear, and wait therein, that ye may feel his grace, and be taught by it, and be obedient unto it, and then ye will feel the mercy and bleſſing of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And all ye that are Maſters and Dames, wait in the true Light, that ye may feel Chriſt the Power and Wiſdom of God, to be your Maſter, that ſo ye may rule in your places, in his Fear and Wiſdom; and lay no more upon your ſervants then ye would be willing ſhould be laid upon you, if ye were in their places and conditions: (Mark that) and forbear threatning them, and be not haſty to turn them away, if they bee willing to abide with you, but in patience and meekneſs ſhew them their place and ſervice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in teach them, if they know it not, and let them have for their ſervice that which is convenient, juſt and reaſonable, that they may have no juſt cauſe to murmure or complain; and keep out of covetouſneſs, leſt that hinder you from giving them ſufficient liberty (who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires it) for going to the Meetings of the people of the Lord; and if in the Wiſdom of God ye ſee freedom to turn any away, give them ſufficient warning, that they may provide themſelves other wayes, for this is but juſt and reaſonable; and be not haſty nor raſh with them, nor run into jangling with them, but if ye have cauſe to reprove them, let it be in the Fear and Wiſdom of God, in the Freedom and Authority of the Truth, and that will reach unto the Witneſs of God in them; ſo be not high-minded, but fear, and be patterns unto them in the lowly, meek and quiet ſpirit; and bear with the weak, and forgive them that treſpaſs againſt you, and render not evil for evil to any, but overcome evil with that which is good, and live in that which overcomes evil, that ſo the Truth of God may be exalted over all.</p>
            <p>And all ye that are ſervants, live in the fear of the Lord, and wait in his Light, and be obedient thereunto, and alſo be obedient (in your places) unto thoſe that are your Maſters and Dames (according to the fleſh) not onely to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward, ſerving them in faithfulneſs and uprightneſs of heart, doing what ye do for them, as diligently, faithfully and willingly, as ye ſhould do any thing to the Lord, for this is right in the ſight of God; and take heed that none of Gods Creatures be loſt, or waſted under your hands, through your neglecting them, or ſlothfulneſs in your places; and do not falſly accuſe any, or ſpeak evil behind any ones back, thereby thinking to get the favour or love of any, or upon any other account, for that is evil; and be as diligent in your places, when your Maſters or Dames are abſent, as when they are preſent, for this is juſt and right; and be not ſtubborn nor wilful, neither uſe many words to your Maſters or Dames, and if ye know not well how to perform your ſervice aright, then in true humility be willing to learn, and take heed of high-mindedneſs and pride, or of being wiſe in your own eyes; and when you have any ſpare time allowed ye, (being free from outward imployment) ſee that ye ſpend it in the fear of the Lord, in waiting upon him in his Light, that ſo all vain talking, corrupt communication, fooliſh jeaſting, and all vanity may be kept out of; and give ye not way to that mind which is unſtable, which would be oft ſhifting, and going from place to place, for this is not right in the ſight of God, but wait in the Light, that ye may be ſtaid, and ſetled in your minds; and if ye ſee freedom in the fear of God (mark that) to go to another place, then give your Maſters or Dames ſufficient notice of it; and if any of you, who know the truth, come to be moved of the Lord to go to any place his ſervice, be faithful to the Lord, and when your ſervice which hee required of you is done, then return to your places again (except it be otherwayes ordered in the Fear and Wiſdom of God) and be diligent in your places, doing the ſame that ye would others ſhould do unto you in the like condition; and mind the Lord in all things, and above all things, and be faithful unto him, and he will be your reward.</p>
            <p>And all ye Fathers, and Mothers, and Children, and Maſters, and Dames, and Servants, who have the Creatures of God to buy or ſell, or to exchange, live in the fear of the Lord, that ye may feel his wiſdom to guide you in your trading, and do not ſpeak better or worſe of the creatures then you know them to be, thereby to get the greater gain, for that is Idolatry, it ariſing from covetouſneſs; but wait to feel Gods Spirit to bridle your tongues, and uſe but few words in your trading; and if ye ask a queſtion therein, do it in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and keep in the light which is equal, that when ye offer or ask a price for the creatures, it may be in equality, and let that be your rule, and not the price of the Market, except that be equal, that ſo ye may reach the equal principle one in another; and then ſtand to your word, and here your yea will be yea, and your nay will be nay, and ſo ye will be kept in the Doctrine of Chriſt, with his light, out of all evil; and ye abiding in the light, it will bring ye to do to every one, as ye would be done unto; and take heed that ye ſtir not up the impatient crooked diſorderly nature, one in another, with your words or actions; but bear one with another, and forgive one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and when ye tell each other of a fault, do it in the Fear, and Wiſdom, and meek Spirit of Gods Lamb, that ſo ye may reſtore each other therein; and when ye have any convenient time, aſſemble your ſelves together in the Name and Fear of the Lord, and wait every particular in the meaſure and gift of God in you, which is given ye to profit withal; and all wait together in the light, and believe in it, that ye may be children of the Light, and therein watch unto prayer, and one over another, and this will beget ye into unfained love, and walking in the Light ye will have true unity, and fellowſhip one with another; and the blood (which is the Life) of Jeſus Chriſt you will feel cleanſing you from all ſin, and ſo ye will come into the unity with God. Alſo, to feel his Word, his Power, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (in you) by which all things were created and made, and are upheld, that therein ye may be ordered in the particular, and that therein ye may uſe and order all Gods creatures, to his glory; and then all falſe Weights, and Meaſures, and Wayes, and Worſhips will be deſtroyed, and then ſhall Truth, Equity, Righteouſneſs, and true Order and Mercy proſper, and run down as a River: So let your Faith ſtand in Chriſt Jeſus the Light, and Wiſdom, and Power of God, and then true Worſhip, true Weight, true Meaſure ſhall be ſet up and eſtabliſhed, and then ſhall the Lord be exalted over all the works of his hands, and ſo ye will feel his bleſſing; unto him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth the Dominion and Honour, for he is worthy of it for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>
