            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of Fighting for <hi>King and Parliament.</hi> But however, they lived to repent of the <hi>Felicities</hi> of them; for, having acted their parts too far, they were forced to yield to more su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Now though their <hi>Name</hi> was not so offensive to the then <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Army,</hi> as was that of the <hi>Cavaliere;</hi> yet they still kept an Eye equally wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full over them <hi>both;</hi> Especially now, upon their finding that they were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them capable of concealing their inward satisfaction at General <hi>Monk</hi>'s Remonstrating against the Army in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And indeed their Hopes upon this Occasion were so luxuriant, that some of them durst pray for his <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;</hi> others not only Drink <hi>His Health</hi> but the <hi>Kings</hi> too; and that Publickly. Nay he had not Marched many days from h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s cold Quarters on the North of <hi>Tweede,</hi> (his March being without
<pb facs="tcp:47558:5"/>
orders too) before the sound of Bells that welcomed us into <hi>England,</hi> had filled the Ears even of his very Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers with the noise of Jealousies and Apprehensions, touching the end of his making this long Journey. And though they had learned the Duty of Soldiers not to <hi>Mutiny,</hi> no nor so much as to expostulate with him; yet it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that several of them deemed there was more in the Action, then did openly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>But though the General was able to deal well enough with these; yet could he not overcome those of his Masters at <hi>Westminster;</hi> who did not well relish this hasty March even of their <hi>Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</hi> Yet they could not in gratitude refuse him and his Army the liberty of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit: and besides, should they by express orders remand him back to his Scotish Quarters, they could not be assured of security at home for the future, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the English Army being but new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return'd to their Duty, did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be fast and well-confirmed; they fearing that <hi>Ambition,</hi> in their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
<pb facs="tcp:47558:6"/>
was rather laid a slecp, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished. And indeed they did not so much as suspect General <hi>Monk</hi> to be guilty of <hi>This;</hi> his Deportment in their service being so modest, that none of them ever thought he aimed at the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; (whatsoever other Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies might be buzz'd in their Ears touching <hi>Charles Stuart</hi>) And this tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>s the greatest advantage he had of them: Besides, his natural Taciturnity was such, that most of his Friends (who thought they knew him thoroughly) look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>George Monk</hi> to have no other <hi>Craft</hi> in him, then that of a plain Soldier, who would obey the Parliaments orders, as well as see that his <hi>own</hi> were. So that had not the more subtle <hi>Smell-Plots</hi> of the Council of <hi>State (Scot</hi> their Secretary amongst the rest) divined something of Mr. <hi>Nicholas Monks</hi> Journey into <hi>Scotland</hi> the Summer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the Generals March into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> without, or rather against orders had been little suspected. But their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusts of him more and more encreased, the nearer he approached toward them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47558:6"/>And this he soon discovered, and was fully satisfied in upon his coming to <hi>Whitehall:</hi> For then his Authority was lessen'd by the presence of Co-General, and Impatient <hi>Hazlerig,</hi> who had much the ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>antage of him, as being a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the same <hi>Parliament,</hi> and able to vie with him in poynt of merit; he having been their Restorer in the <hi>South</hi> at <hi>Ports-mouth,</hi> as the other was in the North at <hi>Cold-stream.</hi> Nor was <hi>Monk himself</hi> without his suspitions that he should not only lose his limb of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralship,</hi> but be questioned for a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, rather than honored as a Restorer. So that having no Counsel left him, but sudden Action; what he was to do he did quickly, and made the <hi>Change</hi> as swift as Comedians do theirs: For in one Week's time he Courted the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Counsel</hi> of <hi>State</hi> not with <hi>words</hi> only, but with <hi>Deeds,</hi> and such too as must render him wholly their own; Unhindg'd all the Gates of the City of <hi>London,</hi> brake some of them, pulled up their Posts and Chains; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated all popular expectations of him
<pb facs="tcp:47558:7"/>
to such a Degree that I heard him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled in the streets (Himself but hard by too) to this Effect. <hi>Is This That</hi> Monk <hi>that would bring in the King? This is the</hi> Scotish <hi>Devil. What more mischief thence?</hi> But Sir <hi>Arthur Hazlerig</hi> (on the other side) sang his <hi>Paeans,</hi> Now George (said he) <hi>we have thee for ever, Body and Soul.</hi> Nay our little <hi>Scotish</hi> Army it self was astonished; and the Officers, in doing this Drudgery, spake merry di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, as if this odious action had been unavoidably forc't upon him; and indeed by the frowns and clouds in his Face they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>asily perceived whereabout he was, and readily took the Hint to Cabal
<pb facs="tcp:47558:7"/>
into new Counsel's against such Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Masters. This now he accepted; for upon his return out of the City, a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was fram'd in the night, sent the next Morning from <hi>Whitehall</hi> to the Parliament, and then he immediatly Marched his Army into the City; where he continued till he had let in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Members</hi> of 1648. Thus did he free himself from the Danger that threatned him for his forward Loyalty in <hi>August</hi> before; compleat his own safety, and the first step to the Kings Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration, all at a Blow.</p>
            <p>Although by premising these Things (my Lord) I have (designedly too) vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Laws of Method, yet I have not forgot that I am in a Dedicatory Preface; and that my business is, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore your Lordships Patronage.</p>

               </gap> a King as much as if he actually had received a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from his Majesty, for he told me afterwards,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47558:17"/>
that he was resolved to <hi>Commission</hi> the whole <hi>Scotch Nation</hi> against <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Army</hi> and all, before he would be taken tamely by them: But he had no other Authority to do it, than this aiery word of mouth, conveyed to him from Sr. <hi>John Greenvile,</hi> who had it in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the King.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> found his Brother engaged in Business, and in several Dispatches too, tho' it was in the declining part of the day; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was rare to find him otherwise: so the <hi>General</hi> sent him to my Chamber, under the conduct of an Highland Foot-Boy in the House, who proclaimed his Arrival at my Study-Door. I courteously received him, and asked how Affairs stood in <hi>England;</hi> for <hi>Booth</hi>'s being in Arms, and <hi>Lamberts</hi> march towards him, were now the common entertainment of News. I soon perceived that he had a mind to say something to me, which he as soon disclosed: The Tenor whereof was, that he was sent to his Brother by Sir <hi>John Greenvile</hi> to invite him in this juncture of time, to appear for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; telling how the design was laid, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal in all Counties; and he did not doubt (he said) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ut that his Country Men in the <hi>West</hi> had already made an Insurrection: adding further, that this was not barely a Combination; without <hi>Authority,</hi> for tho' the King was not named in the <hi>Declaration,</hi> sent out for a Free <hi>Parliament,</hi> and against Taxes and Grievances
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47558:17"/>
complained of; (some of which <hi>Declarations he ventur'd to bring with him</hi>) yet all this was done by his Majesties Privacy and countenance: Therefore was he sent by his Cousin <hi>Greenvile,</hi> to try if he could bring over his Brother into the King's <hi>Service,</hi> and, at this time, to espouse his Cause; and that Sir <hi>John Greenvile</hi> hoped that his Brother might be as succesful in it, as was the famous <hi>Stanly,</hi> who determined the day in <hi>Bosworth</hi> field to <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, tho he came thither to the succour of <hi>Richard</hi> the III. These were high hopes, but that which now puzled Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> was, that he knew not how to break this Message to his Brother; but if he would undertake so glorious a Work as the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing</hi> of the King, no encouragement (he was sure) would be awanting: he might set down his own Conditions, and the King would (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>Royal Word</hi>) perform them: For he had seen his Majesties <hi>Commission</hi> to Sir <hi>John Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> to treat with his Brother: And indeed in that Commission Sir <hi>John</hi> was left at large to promise or assent to any conditions of reward: But by his secret Instructions he was bound up to the definitive Gratuity of one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> for ever, to be disposed of at the General's discretion. So Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to me a broken piece or two of Money as Tokens, if need were, to be sent with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Correspondence to Sir <hi>John Greenvile,</hi> but under the disguised name of Mr. <hi>Legg.</hi>

               </gap>ensive least any body should over-hear him: I paused a while, and then asked him why he imparted a Message of so great concern (and which was to his Brother too) <hi>first</hi> to me; For I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seen him before, and then not half an hour. He return'd, that tho he did not know me, yet he had understood who I was, and what thoughts were conceived of me; as if I could not but have an inward and true Affection for the King and his Service; it being very notorious that <hi>Mine</hi> had been a great Sufferer for His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties <hi>Father:</hi> And so indeed he was, even to the loss of All: for otherwise, I had not then been found in that Employment. And it seems I was so well known in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as soon as I came there, that some of the <hi>Remonstrating Clergy,</hi> and of our own <hi>Officers</hi> too, told the General, that he had entertained a <hi>Cavalier</hi> for his <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain.</hi> And he was so kind as to tell me of this, and give me good Counsel upon it: But I am

not, to this day, conscious that eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> I discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my self, or gave them any distaste by word; tho my Actions were not a little Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive, I believe, in regard that several of the <hi>Montrossian Party</hi> would apply themselves to me, as an Intercessor for Ordinary Favours from the General.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> pressed for instructions how to open this Message to his Brother: I told him, that his brother must be satisfied of his secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, as well as of his Love and fidelity to him; for that an affair of this importance must sleep in as few breasts as might be; and that he would find, that he would put himself, his brother, and his negotiation for the King, into a very gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

            <p>Now, to encourage him, I told him, that I did believe his brother would be willing to close with any fair overture to redeem his <hi>Country</hi> from the slavery of the <hi>Army,</hi> under which it groaned; that he had been many ways disobliged since the return of this <hi>Old Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and that Officers of the more extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant sort of <hi>Principles</hi> had bin encouraged by Commands given them, in open contempt of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47558:19"/>
his Recomendatory Letters in favour of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: so that he talked oft of living a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Life upon his Estate in <hi>Ireland:</hi> And further, that there were many jelous eyes upon him, which the <hi>Cavaliers,</hi> who had been formerly of his acquaintance, had given much the occasion of: for that sometimes he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Letters from <hi>Holland,</hi> by a <hi>Dutch-Skipper,</hi> minding him of his Allegeance; which he was forced openly to protest against, as prudently supposing, that there might be a snare in them.</p>
            <p>Nay, <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> himself, not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, writ once to him with his own hand; and in the Letter there was this Drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Expression: <hi>'Tis said there is a cunning fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in</hi> Scotland <hi>called</hi> George Monk, <hi>who lyes in wait there to serve</hi> Charles Stuart; <hi>pray use your diligence to take him, and send him up to me,</hi> &amp;c. And this, I suppose, gave the rise to a trifling Report that <hi>Cromwel</hi> could not get him out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Withal, I told Mr. <hi>Monk,</hi> that his brother was but a <hi>new-man,</hi> brought in by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> into the <hi>English.

            <p>Besides, I <hi>thought</hi> it not amiss to insinuate, that his Wife had to some degrees, prepared him to appear, when the first opportunity should be offered: For her custome was (when the Generals, and her own work, and the day were ended) to come into the <hi>Dining-Room</hi> to him in her <hi>Treason Gown;</hi> (as I called it) I telling him, that when she had that <hi>Gown</hi> on, he should allow her the liberty to say any thing: And indeed, her tongue was her own then, and she would not spare it; insomuch that I, who still chose to give my attendance at those hours, (the General being alone) have oft shut the <hi>Dining-Room-Doors,</hi> and charged the Servants to stand without, till they were called in. 'Tis easy to conceive what her discourses were, when a Woman that had Wit enough, always Influence, and sometimes (as it was thought) too much, upon

that it might appear that there were previous dispositions in the <hi>General</hi> to serve the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Country,</hi> whenever he should conceive it proper to declare: and indeed his zeal to serve <hi>Both</hi> was so very forward, that he had like to have lost himself by it, and those who were engaged with him, and blasted that mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Restauration of his <hi>Sovereign,</hi> which was after<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The next day before Noon, Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> came to my Chamber, with the glad News that his Brother liked the Plot; and much the better, because the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, naming several of them to me, and not forgetting his Couzen <hi>Moric</hi> also; but he was most satisfied with the Assurance that the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> was engaged, with whom, afterwards, he kept correspondence. Collonel <hi>Atkins</hi> was now gone to make a Visit farther in the <hi>Country,</hi> but returned to us the Week after; Thus I found that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral stood Engaged, and from this time I do date, that his Resolutions were fixed

for the Kings <hi>Restauration:</hi> So happy it was for His Majesty to employ Sir <hi>John Greenvile,</hi> and so lucky for him to send his Clerk, Mr. <hi>Nicholas Monk</hi> hither; where he omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing of his Instructions, and prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly managed them, as may reasonably be inferred from the good effect they had. Thus did the sense of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and the Love of his <hi>Country</hi> prevail with his Brother against all hazzards: And, if I knew him right, the revenge of <hi>slights</hi> was some part of a grain in the Scales. It is not improbable neither, that he had been in the Night, quickned with a Curtain-Lecture of Damnation; a Text that his Lady oft Preac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>pation; he was somewhat better pleas'd at the return of the old <hi>Parliament;</hi> but being of quick apprehension he soon discerned that those few Members of it would keep themselves within those Walls of Empire at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and not suffer the Wheel to turn round; and as a generous person did not dissemble his discontents, but would speak them franckly and boldly enough to the General. And this too, was Sir <hi>George Booths</hi> quarrel.</p>
            <p>So the General (who knew how to make use of men) after some conference with him, made him his Minister of State: And having received instructions how to proceed, he came up to my Study, where he found me then busie and alone. So he bad me lay aside all thought of Preaching, for to Morrow; for he would undertake it for me.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47558:24"/>
Now at that time there happened to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work upon my hands which required a quick Dispatch; for I was transformed into a Secretary of State; my province be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to frame a Letter to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> according to directions given, which was to be sign'd by the General and such of the Officers as he could bring into this new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign: But Mr. <hi>Gumble</hi> said he was not fully satisfied of the grounds of the Generalls En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, now, after his Brother was come; for he might have done that sooner, and if he had, I am confident that Mr. <hi>Gumble</hi> would not have been wanting, on his part, to serve the Publique. But I told him that Mr. <hi>Nicholas Monks</hi> Journey was for his Daughter, and it was necessary to try what his Brother would contribute towards her Marriage, the match being to be with a Kinsman of theirs, which the General had desired, and approved. So the motives of this Engagement being waved (for Mr. <hi>Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> did not insist upon them as a hindrance to the good cause in which he was resolved to embarque himself) we proceeded to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of the Letter to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which was that day done.</p>
            <p>The next was the <hi>Lords day,</hi> and the work of it was carried on by Mr. <hi>Gumble,</hi> who, in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>s last Prayer, put up a Petition for the good Intentions of the General; which soon
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47558:24"/>
after were communicated in my Chamber; whither came the General and his Brother, Adjutant <hi>Smith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gumble.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any discourse was enter'd upon, I swore the General (his hands being laid upon the Bible open) in these words. <hi>You <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>

The rest I swore in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, one by one, after this manner. <hi>You shall truly swear that you shall not reveal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that shall be discoursed of or read unto you, without the consent of the General and all here present.</hi> And lastly, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But yet we took the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to mind them that we found the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>English</hi> Nation disatisfied with their proceedings, as apprehending that their Intention was to appropriate the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to their Individual persons; and that though there might possibly be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of danger in gratifying them, for fear of the <hi>old Enemy;</hi> yet however, it did not appear to the good People, who had fought for their Liberty, that they had entertain'd any thought of the fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of their Number; much less done any thing toward the prescribing of Rules for the Future Elections of such Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as were supposed to be contained under the name of a <hi>Common wealth,</hi> which themselves owned to be the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Government;</hi> and that otherwise their <hi>Armies</hi> could not protect them in their Authority; this not being the <hi>good old Cause</hi> for which they fought, and they could not answer to their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the effusion of so mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>In the mean time the General de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he would associate what force he could, till he saw that their Votes and actions were satisfactory. Here I confess
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47558:25"/>
that I have not related words, but things; for the Paper was the next day burnt, because our design proved abortive. This was the Substance of our intended Letter to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> which having been read by me, (the General, with his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, correcting or adding such expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as were thought fit) the Presenting of it to the Officers of our Army to signe, as their humble Petition and Advice to the Parliament, was resolved upon.

a while discoursed with us, left his orders to the <hi>Adjutant</hi> to hasten to Horse, for it was not above an Hour to night; but himself descended my Stairs having other, and more secret designs to fetch, in assi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e, he soon was: To whom, I (being impatient of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, and thinking every minute lost in which we were not visible upon the Stage of so Noble an attempt) addressed my self with some sort of forwardness, and told him of the danger (as I foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought) of the delay, and that his Brother had come to us already with the latest. The General (I can never forget his posture of answering me) laid his hands on my Shoulders, Frowned, and Paused; and then, in some anger, spake thus (<hi>Gradenker</hi> being at a good distance) <hi>what</hi> Mr. Price (said he) <hi>will you then bring my Neck to the Block for the King, and ruin our whole design, by ingaging too rashly?</hi> To whom I returned with submission, Sir <hi>I never named the</hi> King <hi>to you either now, or at any other time.</hi> But he dismissed me Thus; <hi>well, I know you have not, but I know you, and have understood your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Now the manner of my Addresses

to him used to be for our known <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> propounding the attempt as a thing which would render him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned to all <hi>Posterity</hi> and the Three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions happy: For in those days I durst not name <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> for the danger of the Relation. So that night he slept (or did not) in expectation of the Post, which came the next Morning Six Hours at least sooner than ordinary, and brought us the glad tydings that Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> was Beaten, and routed. Good news Fly apace, and by Noon several Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers (and those the most considerable of the <hi>Sectarians Sort</hi>) came to rejoyce, and Dine with the General; but his Ordinary Table served for a Thanks-giving Dinner for them. Mr. <hi>Monk,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gumble,</hi> and Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant <hi>Smith,</hi> had the good Fortune to Dine abroad; but my Duty was to be at the Generals Table, where I heard the expressions of joy that passed from Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to Officer, for the total defeating of Sir <hi>George Booth;</hi> and that the mercy was not ordinary, for the greatest part of the Gentry of <hi>England</hi> (they said) were engaged in it; and that their old <hi>Friends</hi> (naming the <hi>Presbyterians</hi>) were more forward in the action, then their old <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies</hi> the <hi>Cavali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

that <hi>Booth,</hi> and his Confederates, would have brought in <hi>Charles Stuart.</hi> Upon this the General gave them the Complement of a Thanksgiving day, that he could wish that the Parliament would make a Law that whoever should but mention the Restoring of him, should presently be Hang'd. I had reason to think that he was but in jest; otherwise, I could guess where the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lay.

boat. This division I have the rather menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; because it may be a word in season to the concerned to beware of the heats and pedantry of such <hi>Ecclesiastick Enthusiasts,</hi> who do so much contribute to the ruine of Kingdoms: and sometimes are destructive to their own <hi>Societies.</hi> These men, apart (keeping Intelligence each upon another, that they might not meet) did make their frequent visits to the General, being now a declared <hi>Presbyterian;</hi> laid open the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table condition of the Kirk of <hi>Christ,</hi> and implored his care, and Patronage of it; who gave them such comfortable words as his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would permit him then to do.</p>
            <p>The end of Mr. <hi>Nicholas Monk</hi>'s Embassy to his Brother, was now frustrated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, it created some disfidence of his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and secresie. In <hi>Negatives</hi> I can avouch for no man, but my self; and under the awe of the Searcher of hearts I do write and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the secret slept within my breast till after the King was restored, and actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return'd: and next, I do think so well of Mr. <hi>Monk</hi>'s care and prudence, that he did not in <hi>Scotland</hi> communicate it to any, but his Brother and me; for so, upon his return, he told Sir <hi>John Greenvile.</hi> But so it was, that there were suggestions of Information, or rather of Temptation to the General, that the good man was like to be sacrificed. But
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47558:30"/>
this went no further: either that the sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters would not stand the Test, or that the probation would be injurious to more the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> one: However I do conjecture there could have been found no other guilt in Mr. <hi>Monk,</hi> than the curiosity of the Suggester.</p>
            <p>This was a time of <hi>Hearsays</hi> and <hi>Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of Plots; for all Action ceased upon <hi>Booth</hi>'s Defeat: Mr. <hi>Gumble</hi> makes his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent visits to <hi>Dalkeith</hi> to hear and report news: keeps his correspondence with <hi>Scot,</hi> Secretary of State (to whom he was known when he was Vicar of <hi>Wickham</hi> in <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamshire</hi>) and by him understood how affairs went at <hi>London,</hi> and what jealousies began to arise between the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Army,</hi> and some of the more eminent Members and Officers of both; makes his advantage of them, and adds fuel to the fire.</p>
            <p>I was taken into his Counsel sometimes, and employed to write: so we sent Letters by the Post either with no name at all, or what we thought fit; and this was a divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thus to play in the blind with the <hi>Grandees,</hi> and to tell them those things, which themselves knew could not be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but by their Treacherous Confidents.</p>
            <p>The General now saw the usefulness and interest of Mr. <hi>Gumble,</hi> and the danger of disobliging him; wherefore he was retained as his Confident; insomuch that when the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47558:31"/>
               <hi>General</hi> appeared against the Army for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing the Parliament, the action was lookt upon as proceeding meerly upon Mr. <hi>Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>'s advice. This was rather the <hi>General</hi>'s Protection then otherwise; for had it been insinuated, that his Engagement proceeded from any sinister hand, he would have found at home among his own Officers, that suspitions would have more increast upon him. But <hi>Gumble</hi> was looked upon as the <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> man, and so represented by Mr. <hi>Welch</hi> from <hi>Leith</hi> to <hi>Wallingford</hi> house, who suggested, that had it not been for him, <hi>George Monk</hi> had never stirr'd.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Nicholas Monk</hi> was preparing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with his Daughter by Sea, as he came; but before he went we heard of the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Return of <hi>Lambert</hi> to his Masters at <hi>Westminster,</hi> who employed him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in chief in the expedition against <hi>Booth,</hi> which proved a Conquest easier than it was once thought it would have been. The Spoil was not yet divided: Nor was the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wherefore a Clamour was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and a Supplication framed, to bring those to condign punishment, who had in any measure, or to any degree assisted in <hi>Booth</hi>'s
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47558:31"/>
Conspiracy, or could be detected as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of it: And had this Inquisition been made, and a Sequestration passed upon it, This <hi>After-harvest</hi> would have been worth more pounds, than the former publick Sales of the Kings and Church Land; (as the gleaning of the Grapes of <hi>Ephraim</hi> were better than the Vintage of <hi>Abiezer</hi>) and how for this change of the face of things would have conduced to fix a new <hi>Interest,</hi> I leave to be judged.</p>
            <p>Though it became the Army to leave this Inquisition after <hi>Delinquency</hi> to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet the frame of this Petition seemed just; that they might not be always exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the fears of the <hi>Common Enemy.</hi> But there was a hidden intrigue in it, to pick a Quarrel with their Masters; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven some of them had not utterly lost the Consciences of <hi>English men,</hi> and were loath to have the Government of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> monopolized into so few hands; nay, and those of them which yet savoured of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> were themselves suspected for a sort of <hi>Delinquents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The general foresaw whither this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Souldiery tended; and very pleasantly told me, <hi>I see now that I shall have a better game to play than I had before.</hi> His expression was, <hi>I know</hi> Lambert <hi>so well, that I am sure he will not let those People at</hi> West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,

               <hi>October</hi> was begun, when Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> left <hi>Dalk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I parted with him upon the Sands of <hi>Leith,</hi> not without some grief and reflection upon our distracted Country; charging him to sollicite for the Prayers of good Men. I named unto him Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and Dr. <hi>Shelden,</hi> who were, upon the information given me, actually Bishops, but it seems I was deceived: So we comforted our selves, that God had in reserve his appointed seasons of Mercy. But the General, about this time, found en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from the Host of Heaven: And a <hi>Scoth-Noble man</hi> came to him, and told him plainly (after much Discourse with him) that the King would be restored, and that within some few Month; that he looked upon him as a principal instrument toward the effecting of it; &amp; that not a drop of Blood should be spilt in the action. This was the Earl of <hi>Nitzdale,</hi> whom I do not remember to have seen ever before with the General; for his <hi>Religion</hi> rather requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his retirement, than converse; and this the General informed me of; and of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47558:32"/>
Earls Prophetick apprehensions, that there should not be the blood of a cut Finger in the action; he spoke it merrily, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>efore was assured of his share in it.</p>
            <p>But at the <hi>Cockpit</hi> I have heard him tell it at large: Consonant hereunto I have a Paper (among others) by me of one Mrs. <hi>Katherin Johnson</hi>'s (a Copy of which was by her delivered to <hi>Cromwell.</hi>) I am very well satisfied of the truth of the delivery, I knew the Gentlewoman, She being of a good Family: and I can witness; that when she was in my House (for she was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to me) she spent much time in Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Prayer. The words of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are these; <hi>Great General! All the power</hi> of the World <hi>is in your hands; therefore let humility be your guide, for none shall correct you but God: The Lord gives,</hi> and <hi>the Lord takes, blessed be his Name. Have peace with all Men; refuse None.</hi> In <hi>the</hi> 16th <hi>Year of King</hi> Charles <hi>his Reign,</hi> I <hi>delivered him a Manuscript, wherein I told him of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction;</hi> but <hi>he took none of my Counsel, though I was sent from</hi> God. <hi>As for the</hi> Scotch King (as he is called) <hi>his right, here, must be in peace, not by the Sword.</hi> I can say more, <hi>if I be called to an account; but what I say is by Faith,</hi> and <hi>I shall justifie it with my life.

That which Mrs. <hi>Johnson</hi> forewarn'd the late King of was, not to sign the Bill for the death of the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> which the good King after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward repented of. And tho' she had the fate of <hi>Cassandra,</hi> not to be believed; yet Mr. <hi>Lenthal</hi> (the <hi>Speaker</hi>) who was satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the truth of this, gave such credit to her warning of him to beware of the Oath of <hi>Abjuration</hi> against the Royal Family, that he absented himself from the House for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Ten days, under the pretence of the <hi>Gout:</hi> And she assured him he should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given for what else he had done against the King.</p>

            <p>Upon the Relating of this, she askt what manner of Man the King was. I told her, that when I was an <hi>Eaton</hi> Scholler I saw at

            <p>This Rupture between <hi>Monk</hi> and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> was the talk and joy of <hi>London;</hi> whose Lord <hi>Maior</hi> and <hi>Common Council</hi> soon after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a large Letter from him, inviting them

Nay, from the then Governing Officers in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he was answered with a Resolution to declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, in case he advanced further.</p>
            <p>Yet did not these discouragements in the least stagger his firm purpose to go through with his Work: No not though Dr. <hi>Clergis,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:47558:39"/>
and Collonel <hi>Talbot</hi> were also expresly sent from <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> to supersede it; by whom they were entreated and conjured to use their utmost endeavors to allay the sudden heats of <hi>Monk,</hi> which had been kindled (they said) by ill Artifices or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of their proceedings; of which they assured him that he and his Army should receive a satisfactory Account. <hi>Clergis</hi> was Brother in Law to the <hi>General,</hi> Collonel <hi>Talbot</hi> a Gentleman whose Conversation was acceptable to him; both these came Post haste to us <hi>November</hi> the Second, with Instructions to cajole <hi>Monk</hi> out of his Armes and Reason; but the man would not yield. <hi>Talbot</hi> could not make him believe the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Friendship, nor the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his proffers of advantage; and <hi>Clergis</hi> did but prevaricate with them that sent him, and informed the General of the instability and Poverty of the Army in <hi>England;</hi> they having but little Money, and no means left them of raising any, when that was spent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but their Swords. Besides, that the Free Quarter-guests could not long be welcome; for as much as the men at <hi>Westminster</hi> (fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing their Doom) before their turning out, had Voted it High-<hi>Treason</hi> to Raise Money out of <hi>Parliament.</hi> Now, though themselves were but the shadow of the name, and had for many Years Usurped a Power

not due to them, yet did they cover their Spight and Revenge with a pretended ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness for their Countries Freedom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lambert</hi> waits not for the Return of his Messengers from <hi>Monk,</hi> but advances <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> with what Forces could be spared, at home, and his <hi>Troops</hi> increase in his March, for they lay conveniently in the Country, after the defeating of <hi>Booth,</hi> to be at the Summons of his Orders.

            <p>
               <hi>Fleetwood</hi> sent Captain <hi>Deane</hi> Treasurer of the Army (a Messenger of his own) to <hi>Monk</hi> with a very kind Letter, and an Offer of what Preferment in the Army, he would himself. He was kindly received, and entertained by the General at Supper; but he had done ill Offices in his passage to us by dispersing Papers to seduce ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> Soldiers; and his deportment to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral at his very Table was somewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemly, for he told him plainly that he had taken the direct course to bring <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> in upon them by dividing the Army, and by his influence so continuing it, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him point blank as if <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> was at the botton of his Design, Consonant to his dispersed Tickets.

            <p>The words were scarce out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But with Veneration to his Blessed Memory, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive that he had as much reason to be angry with this Messenger, as with me; for he exceeded the Decorum of an <hi>Envoy.</hi> I was one Morning at the Head of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Foot when he passed by, and told them, <hi>my Lord</hi> Lambert <hi>is coming upon you, and all</hi> Monk'<hi>s Army will not be enough for a</hi> Break-Fast <hi>for him.</hi> But he met with a Scur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>The General (to show that he was in earnest, and with a prospect of gaining Assistance from the Northern parts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>) sent Major <hi>Knight,</hi> with Four Troops
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47558:40"/>
of Horse, and Captain <hi>Miller</hi> with Six Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Foot, to enter <hi>New-Castle.</hi> But Collonel <hi>Lilborne</hi> had prevented them, and put in a force too great for them to Attack: So they retreated to <hi>Awick,</hi> and stayed there till they were Remanded. Yet did it make for the General's advantage, to be thus disappointed of enlarging our Quarters; for <hi>Lambert</hi> was hastning his March, and <hi>Monk</hi>'s Army was not yet fixed; and these Troops and Companies, with their Officers, were the choicest of his Men, and most devoted to his Design. So that the loss of them might have proved injurious to it. But this Project of Enlarging his Quarters (as I remember) was none of his own; but suggested to him as a probable expedient to gain him considerable supplyes of Horse, which he wanted.</p>
            <p>The effect of the Armies Message from <hi>England</hi> to us, was, that it produced a Treaty; which had like to have been <hi>Our</hi> Ruine, though it ended in <hi>Theirs;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was necessary for <hi>Monk</hi> to accept of it, he having not yet Modelled his Army: For though his procedure to dismiss his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting, or suspected Officers was quick, and Resolute; yet were they gently Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at first; some few of them having their <hi>Arriers</hi> Stated, if not paid, by Special War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and they su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>fer'd to stay among us.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47558:41"/>
But they made but ill use of the General'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> dealing thus gently with them; The loss of their Commands opened their Mouths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and their Tongues were Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cized to Debauch his Soldiers from their Duty; which being represented to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, caused their intire dismission, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hopes of <hi>Arriers</hi> to the casheir'd.</p>
            <p>So in the beginning of <hi>November</hi> a Treaty was set on Foot by the Generall, and his Officers; Coll. <hi>Wilks,</hi> Coll. <hi>Cloberry,</hi> and Major <hi>Knight</hi> were nominated, and dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated with instructions, and sent up to <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ford-house</hi> to treat with <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and his Officers. Now <hi>Lambert</hi> being upon his March from <hi>London,</hi> met with our peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Commissioners at <hi>York<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and would have spared them a further journey; for he assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them that he had Power from the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Safety</hi> and the <hi>General Counsel of Officers</hi> to treat, and conclude with them. But they insisting upon the return of the Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

However <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was not altogether without <hi>hopes,</hi> if not from our Commissioners (when they should further op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>n their. <hi>Credentials</hi> at <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ford-house,</hi> whither they were sent) yet from Major General <hi>Morgan,</hi> then at <hi>York,</hi> who artificially disliked <hi>Monks</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47558:41"/>
and it was well known that he had a great Interest in his Friendship, and in the Soldiers of <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Command there, being next to the Generals. Coll. <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi> (who Commanded at <hi>York</hi>) taking notice of this, represented it to <hi>Lambert;</hi> and it was concluded by them that <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> was a fit Instrument to send into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> Because that either by his Friendship with <hi>Monk</hi> he might create a better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing between them, or by his influence draw off a <hi>Party</hi> of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army for himself: which was indeed not impossible to have been effected, had his distast of <hi>Monks</hi> declaring against the Army been real, as it was feigned. And here I note, that it was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly observed how <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> a part, would cajole <hi>Monk</hi> for themselves.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Morgan</hi> was sent to us, his Message neglected; but his Person most kindly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the General, who much wanted him, and soon imployed him in the most difficult s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rvice that yet remained unattempted, which was, the reforming of our Horse; for very many even of our private Troops were great Malecontents. Of all evils I believe it was none of the greatest that our Number of Horse was so small, and that the last Summer <hi>Fleetwood</hi> had remanded two Regiments of them out of <hi>Scotland;</hi> though, it was conjectur'd, not without some
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47558:42"/>
distrust of the Commander in <hi>Chief</hi> there. <hi>Morgan,</hi> and Adjutant <hi>Smith,</hi> were Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant reformers from quarter to quarter, to dismount the dissenting Troopers, and to set <hi>Foot-Soldiers</hi> on Horse-back, that could buy Boots. But many prevented their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unhorsed, and ran from their Colours, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>thers again carried them over to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, not without threats to return upon us. In this, <hi>Lambert</hi> had much the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of us; for we knew of no Revolters from <hi>Them,</hi> till their money and hopes were spent; his nearness to us (being at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle</hi>) and the noise of the greatness of his Army, encouraged and frighted away all that would not cordially joyn with us: And yet this at the long run proved no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience to the General; now he thought his Men would stand by it, should he have occasion to use them.</p>
            <p>The Messengers from the Independant party, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, pressed the General with set Speeches to desist from his Enterprise. But he took them up round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with the eloquence and resolution of a Soldier; silencing their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ears of the <hi>Common Enemy</hi> with suggestions of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended necessity of doing his duty, in order to the Restoring of the Parliament. It took him up a compleat Month, the purging and forming his Army to his mind, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47558:42"/>
marching the Troops (from their several Quarters) towards the South of <hi>Scotland:</hi> But before he left <hi>Edenburg,</hi> he called a <hi>Convention</hi> of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Burghers;</hi> laid before them the Ground of his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, required their peaceable deportment during his absence, and the payment of what they were in <hi>Arrear</hi> to him, for his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;</hi> he having, in consideration of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of the Country, forborn them long. They frankly yielded to his demand; and some of the Members of that Assembly, by appointment, waited upon him afterwards, at <hi>Berwick;</hi> moving him to furnish them with Armes, that they might be capacita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to assist in the opposing of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion, which seemed equally to threaten (they said) both us and them. But the General look't upon the request as too ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and too dange<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ous for him to grant; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his own men were not to be disobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; beside that the two Armies were not as yet become so far exasperated, as to force us, in despair, to take in the Assistance of those who were Enemies to <hi>Both.</hi> In some things however they were gratified, and much was promised; so that they went not away discontented. Nay some of them better understood the General, I believe, then his own <hi>Officers</hi> did; many of which took it in great dudgeon that orders were given out
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47558:43"/>
to the Foot Captains to fill up their <hi>Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> with <hi>Scots.</hi> But indeed the General was necessitated to take this Course: And the Jealousie (be it where it would) was by most of our own party deemed groundless, and ridiculous; in regard that the General had not yet given any advantage to <hi>that</hi> Nation against the then <hi>English</hi> Interest.</p>
            <p>In which Particular he was so very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, that afterwards when he saw he had no need of them, he Marched back a part of his own Force (under the Command of Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>or General <hi>Morgan</hi>) to secure the peace of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Now this Action was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly canvassed, and adjudged an Argument not only of his prudence, but of his fidelity to that which they called a <hi>Parliament,</hi> at <hi>Westminster.</hi> So that he stopt the Mouths of his Invidious Adversaries, who were wont to be continually prating as if that Nation would soon be in Arms against them, were it once left to it self.</p>
            <p>Though the Armies attended the issue of the Treaty at <hi>Wallingford-house;</hi> yet <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:47558:43"/>Now if <hi>Lambert</hi> had not lingered so long at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> but with his Horse only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced directly into <hi>Scotland;</hi> beside that he could then have met with little or no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, he would also have confined us to very narrow Quarters; and all the Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Oates and Straw (of which, at that time, there was plenty) would have been his own: And in truth, being destitute both of Money and Authority, <hi>Sudden Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion</hi> was his true Interest.</p>
            <p>The General on the other hand, had both these; and only wanted Power; so that <hi>His</hi> was <hi>Delay.</hi> But it was the Almighties good time to disappoint the <hi>Strong,</hi> to infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their Counsells, and to sow seeds of Strife and Division amongst them; for a great many of those that had followed <hi>Lambert</hi> into the North were not through paced to serve his <hi>Ambition,</hi> some of them looked back upon <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> (he being acknowledged to have the Superiority in Command) and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers again began to aba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:47558:44"/>By the Eighteenth of <hi>November</hi> the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral had reached as far as <hi>Haddington;</hi> intending for <hi>Berwick,</hi> and to visit the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses upon the <hi>Tweede,</hi> that so he might be able to Post his Men to the best advantage. Now upon the same night, and to the same place (after grace had been said at Supper, for Peace) came Information that our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners had concluded with the Officers at <hi>London;</hi> which news, I knew was very unwelcome to him; whereupon very early next Morning he returns to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults his Counsellors, Convenes his Officers, and requires their sence upon the matter. It was easy for him (without the help of a <hi>Familiar</hi>) to foretell what it would be; for now his Army was not the same thing that it was Five Weeks ago: And the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers knew very well that should they tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly submit to this peace, the consequence must be that his Honor the <hi>Collonel</hi> must sink down into a <hi>Captain,</hi> and the <hi>Captain</hi> shrink into an <hi>Ensigne,</hi> and the <hi>Ensigne</hi> return to his <hi>Halbert;</hi> one Article of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being this, that <hi>all Osficers who had been suspended, or laid down their Commissions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>This Convention of Officers, on both sides, was by Compact to meet at <hi>Neweastle,</hi> the first of <hi>December</hi> then ensuing. Now since <hi>Monk</hi>'s declaring against the Army, he had displaced about 140 Officers, who had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been shufled upon him by the then Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in lieu of a very considerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Stoutest and Bravest Men (upon whose Courage and Fidelity he principally rely'd) whom they had removed before the 11th of <hi>October</hi> then last past: And though the General sent frequent Letters of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for them, yet so great an Influence had the Factions of the Anabaptist and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent at that time, that they prevailed against his mediation: Neither (probably) would they have stopt here, had not the <hi>Westminsterians</hi> been interrupted in their Session.

            <p>But our Counsellors were more moderate, and came to this resolution, that a new Treaty should be desired, upon pretence that there were some <hi>Articles</hi> in that <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that required a further explication, refusing to ratifie any part of it, till that were done.

He was not satisfied however with this Answer; and we talked on till it was too late for him to pass by the Centinels to his Quarters. So he was forced to lodge that Night with me, but he was still awaking, and telling me; <hi>the General is for the King:</hi> and I as often desired him to forget that idle Fancy, and let us both sleep.</p>

The Souldiers began now to be revived in these cold Quarters, as hoping for better. Hither came some of our Officers to us that were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from their Commands, when the General first declared; alledging in excuse of their staying so long away, that they were stop'd by <hi>Lambert</hi> at <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>This Stream of good News notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>General</hi> continu'd his wonted care of his <hi>Guards:</hi> It being now evident, that <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> within a few days, must either fight or fall. And as for my self, I must confess that I was inwardly displeased at thus many favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable expresses; as apprehending that this name of a <hi>Parliament</hi> would by nominating and shifting Commissioners for it, engage the Army so much to their Devotion, and get such other advantages of fixing their Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47558:48"/>
that it would be no easie matter to dispossess them. With these foolish whimsies in my head, I was resolved to steal privately to the <hi>General;</hi> (who had cautioned me before hand, not to be seen to appear in these publick Transactions) and to do this, I knew between <hi>Midnight</hi> and the <hi>Morning</hi> to be the only time: so between 2 and 3 of the Clock by the help of a Corporal I came to his Chamber-door, found it only latched, the <hi>General</hi> in his Cloaths, his head laid on the side of the Bed, and his Body resting upon two Stools or a Form; Fire and Candles being in the Room: He awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at my first entrance; I desired his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and he kindly gave liberty of Speech.

            </p>
            <p>I then took the further liberty to mind him of the Papers he had signed to stand to this <hi>Parliament</hi> as it sat the 11 of <hi>October,</hi> and no other; and of several other Restrictions which he had needlesly (as I conceived, put upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

So that it was now manifest, that <hi>Lambert</hi> must of necessity break up his quarters at <hi>Newcastle,</hi> and march either against <hi>Monk</hi> or <hi>Fairfax,</hi> both <hi>Generals</hi> of a fortunate name in War, and acting for that authority from which this Rebel-Army had their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions; their <hi>Committee of safety,</hi> having never given out any, that ever I could hear of.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>But God was pleased to decide the Quarrel without Blood: for upon the return of the men at <hi>Westminster,</hi> they immediately voted that all their <hi>Armies</hi> should betake themselves to their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> this was brought to us by Letters only; but an express order was sent to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> to

            <p>These good Tydings created much joy in our little <hi>Habitations;</hi> tho' the <hi>Vote</hi> for retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into Quarters somewhat perplexed our <hi>General.</hi> But our Officers would not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand a bare Letter of News to concern Them; being more comforted this cold Winter with the hopes of living near their own homes, (now the <hi>Parliament</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned) then of the Golden Chains and Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals that had been promised them by those who would have promised Mountains rather than not have sitten again.

            <p>'Twas troublesom to descend the River on <hi>Horseback,</hi> and a supersticious care was taken that the <hi>General</hi> should not trip: The Frost

And of this I had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward occasion to tell him.</p>
            <p>The 2d. of <hi>January</hi> we came to <hi>Wooler;</hi> where the <hi>General</hi> received a kind Letter from the <hi>Speaker,</hi> signifying indeed, that they were returned to the exercise of their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but not one word about his marching towards them.

            <p>The 3d. of <hi>January</hi> we came to a Village, not worth my naming, because here I met with worse Quarters than at <hi>Cold-stream.</hi> I and some few more, after we had consumed our Landlord's Fuel, bargained for his <hi>emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Vessels for our Chimney, drank out his sull ones, and without any disturbance to our Brains, and lodged that Night in the best Room of his House, which was, within the <hi>Chimney<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Mantle.</hi> The next Morning, our Landlord had no reason to complain; (tho' I

               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:47558:52"/>In our March afterwards, we made no <hi>Halt</hi> till we came to <hi>York.</hi> Here we staid five days, one of them being <hi>Sunday,</hi> and Mr, <hi>Bowles</hi> gave us a good Sermon in the <hi>Cathedral.</hi> This Gentleman was the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Chaplain, Counsellor and Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator; and dealt with the General about weighty and dangerous Affairs; One night above the rest keeping him up so very late, that upon my Entering the Chamber to go to Prayers, I found <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>Bowles</hi> in very private Discourse; and the General order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to go out for awhile, but not to Bed: Sometime after Midnight <hi>Bowles</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; so that then our Servants hoped to Sleep: But the General sent for Me into to Him, and commanded them to stay <hi>without,</hi> as before. He took me close to him, and said <hi>what do you think?</hi> Mr. Bowles <hi>has pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed me very hard to stay here, and declare for the King; assuring me that I shall have great assistance.</hi> I started at the boldness of the Proposition, and asked him whether he had made <hi>Bowles</hi> any such promise. He answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, <hi>no truly, I have not,</hi> or, <hi>I have not yet:</hi> For I found him a little Perplexed in his thoughts; And I my self was as much: But after a little Pause, I spake to this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; That after the Famous <hi>Gustavus</hi> (King of <hi>Sweedland</hi>) was Slain in <hi>Germany,</hi> his <hi>Effigies</hi> in Wax (with his Queen's and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren)
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47558:53"/>
was carried up and down to be shown for 2 pence; the Spectators being enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with the story of his Life; of which I remembred this Passage, That when this King enter'd <hi>Germany,</hi> he said, <hi>That if his Shirt knew what he intended to do, he would teare it from his back and burn it.</hi> My Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it to the General was designed to entreat him to Sleep between this and the Walls of <hi>London;</hi> and when he came within them, (which I doubted not but would be very shortly,) then to open his Eyes and consider what he had to do. This Advice I also back't with such Reasons as I conceived to be most prevalent.</p>
            <p>But it was not the General only, that was here Solicited upon the Kings Behalf; some of his Officers being also set upon, and promised great Rewards: One of whom was Represented to have demanded no less then to be <hi>Lord Chancellor.</hi> This Sr. <hi>Edward Hide</hi> (who was so, when the King came in) told the General; and he to me.</p>
            <p>The Noon before this mighty Intrigue, the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> Dined with the General privately in his Chamber; and I was then deputed to be his Host, at his publick Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; where he allowed a <hi>Half-Crown</hi> Ordinary (large Commons!) for Twenty Men. And the General, to return the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s kindness, went one day and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47558:53"/>
Dined with him at his Country House, where He and his Retinue were Hospitably Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and returned the same night.</p>
            <p>Hither Now were brought Orders from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to March towards them. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral expected them sooner; and in requitable of their confidence in him publickly cudgel'd an Officer who had traduced him by saying <hi>this</hi> Monk <hi>will at last bring in</hi> Charles Stuart: charging his Officers to do the like to those under their Command that should so offend.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> were jealous of <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s late rising for them; and therefore proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thought this no fit place for <hi>Monk</hi> to lodge his Army in: from whence I suppose he would not have removed <hi>Southward,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out orders; and, it might be, have dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it had he been remanded <hi>Northwards.</hi> But if he had so fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> yielded to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as (overruled by the Apprehensions of the Army of <hi>England,</hi> and by the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that might have been taken of him in <hi>York-shire,</hi> outweighing all those that he could then reasonably propound to himself) to return from whence he came; yet his Army could not but have stomached the disgrace of the jealousie, to be sent back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland.</hi> And this resentment he might have made good use of; for <hi>there</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> would have been entirely at his devotion; and the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

from thence, together with some far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther modelling of his Army (the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents in <hi>England</hi> dayly increasing too) might have produced some formidable disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the <hi>Government;</hi> especially now the <hi>Parliament</hi> could not well trust their own Army at home. But the coming of orders to March forward, took away the Umbrage of all Distrusts.

            </p>
            <p>Here we left behind us Coll. <hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Regiment of Foot; and Major General <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> was sent back to <hi>Scotland</hi> with his two Regiments of Horse and Foot, to secure the peace of that Kingdom. From <hi>York</hi> we made no stay, till we came to <hi>Nottingham.</hi>

So this was waved, and the rather, because the Parliaments Commissioners were to meet us the next Stage, which was <hi>Leicester.</hi> However the General (to remove all distrust of himself) yielded that a Letter should be sent in his Name, to his Country-men in the <hi>West;</hi> wherein were <hi>State Reasons</hi> alledged, asserting the impossibility of the Kings <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> and his protestation against it; for now, it seems, he was informed what hopes these <hi>Western</hi> Gentlemen had conceived of him.</p>
            <p>As we entered the Town of <hi>Leicester,</hi> we saw the <hi>Ir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

His Counterfeits Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robinson,</hi> the Parliaments Commissioners, were now at Hand. From hence, the next night, we came to <hi>Harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> where Divers from <hi>London</hi> waited the Generals entrance. They complained of grievances, which he durst not promise to redress; for now <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinson</hi> (Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors of State, and Abjurers of the Kings

Family) were his Ears and his Mouth. This was a hard task for him to bear; and yet not so hard as it would have been to most other men; for he never loved to speak <hi>much,</hi> and cared for none that did. So he answered them in few and wary words, with submis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But these Citizens came full of hopes to find a more kind reception: For he had sent their City a Letter out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> desiring their assistance; however care was taken by others, that they should not despair of him; and so they returned.</p>
            <p>From this place till we came to <hi>Barnet, Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinson</hi> would still Quarter in the same Inn with the General; that they might be present to answer the Addresses of the Country; of which the most Famous, were at <hi>Northampton</hi> and St. <hi>Albans.</hi>

            <p>The summe of the Desires both of the City and Country, were either a full and free <hi>Parliament,</hi> or the Restauration of the Secluded Members of This.

Besides that the Parliament had fresh experience of the restless Spirits of their <hi>English Soldiers;</hi> and they could not but look upon their <hi>Scotch,</hi> as men of a different Temper; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed could they do less, for these

their Restorers (who had taken this long March, to gratifie them) then to take them for their Guards, the smallness of their Number, not being capable of working any notable change. Now when they were at <hi>London,</hi> they were not to be under the sole Command of <hi>Monk,</hi> because the Army was Governed by Commissioners; and <hi>Hazelrig</hi> stomached, that ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>At St. <hi>Albans,</hi> besides Addresses made by the Gentry upon the publick account, the General was busied in receiving numerous Visits; both which were distas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ed by our Honorable Spies (<hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinson</hi>) who sometimes in Civility, or for dispatch of their own business, would <hi>withdraw.</hi> But their Appartment was only distinguished from the Generals by a <hi>Wainescot-Door,</hi> in which either they found or made a hole to hear and see. This the General took notice of and complained of to me, with a sort of scornful Indignation.</p>
            <p>But here we spent one day extraordinary at the Church; the Famous <hi>Hugh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Peters,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lee</hi> of <hi>Hatfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47558:56"/>
with some Dexterity at the first, (allowing the Cantings of his Expressions) His Text was <hi>Psalm 107. v. 7. He led them forth by the right way, that they might go to the City where they dwelt.</hi> With his Fingers on the cushion he measured the <hi>right way</hi> from the red <hi>Sea</hi> through the Wilderness to <hi>Canaan;</hi> told us it was not Forty days March, but God led <hi>Israel</hi> Forty years through the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness before they came thither; yet this was still the Lord's <hi>right way,</hi> who led his People <hi>crinkledom cum crankledom.</hi> And he particularly descended into the lives of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> how they journy'd up and down, though there were promises of blessing and rest to them. Then he reviewed our civil Wars, our intervals of peace, and fresh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions, and hopes of rest; but though the Lords people (he said) were not yet come to the City of Habitation, he was still leading them on in the right way, how dark soever his dispensations might appear to us. Before he concluded, he seemed to me to preach his own Funeral Sermon, I looking upon my self to be on the <hi>left</hi> side of the Cloud. Thus my little remarques of him, and this <hi>Fast,</hi> were at an end.</p>
            <p>But it was in those days observed of an <hi>Army-Fast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that it commonly proved the fore-runner of some solemne mischief, and rendred their Governors, (whose Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47558:57"/>
in Causes Ecclesiastical was not owned by these kind of Subjects) jealous of them. For they would not scruple religiously to meet to seek the Lord, without the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat and Direction of their Masters; And in Truth they knew so well at what <hi>Turning</hi> to find him, that their <hi>Seeking</hi> was never in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> was now begun; upon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of which, the General moved with an easy March, to <hi>Barnet;</hi> here he parted with his long guests, <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinson,</hi> and took up Quarters only for himself and his domestique retinue; so we were better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated. Much business was here dispatcht; orders were distributed for our next days March into <hi>Town,</hi> and that our Soldiers should demean themselves civilly in their Quarters, and pay for them; for our Money held out still. But about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, <hi>Scot,</hi> (being frighted with a Letter from <hi>Westminster,</hi> intimating that the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who were to leave their old quarters were fallen into a high Mutiny, and that there was danger that they would joyn with the <hi>Prentices,</hi> who cryed up in the streets for a <hi>Free-Parliament</hi>) passionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, or rather by his Authority required the General i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>mediately to beat his drums and march. The very posture of <hi>Scots</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into us with his Night Gown, Cap and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47558:57"/>
Slippers, might have made us believe that the danger was eminent: But the General calmly answer'd him, <hi>I will undertake for this Nights <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> (says he) <hi>and be early enough in the Morning to prevent any mischief.</hi> However he yielded that a Messenger should be sent to see and report what the matter was. There had been an Uproar indeed, but it was soon qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ht, and the Soldiers were leaving the <hi>Town</hi> as the Messenger enter'd it. But the motion for such a hasty <hi>March,</hi> was looked upon as an Artifice of <hi>Scot's,</hi> so to mingle the Soldiers of <hi>both Armies,</hi> that they might be the less at the Generals devotion.</p>
            <p>The next day, before we came to <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> the General drew up his Forces, which consisted of Four Regiments of Foot, and Three of Horse; their Number being 5800, allowing 1000 to each Regiment of Foot; and 600 to each Regiment of Horse, besides Officers. We entred the Town at <hi>Gray's Inn-lane;</hi> and (the Bells ringing as we pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed along) stopped at the Rolls before the <hi>Speaker</hi>'s door; who was not yet returned from the House: but we met him in the <hi>Strand,</hi> at the opening of the Street. The General allight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and complemented (after his Soldiers fashion) this our <hi>Representive</hi> of <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> for the <hi>Mace</hi> was in the Coach; and so we came to <hi>Whitehall.</hi> The General's apartment there was the <hi>Prince</hi>'s <hi>lodgings,</hi> and his servants were

all such. Here our Butler (Sir <hi>Ralph Mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi>) who, at <hi>Holyrood-house</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to give a Bottle of wine at <hi>Whitehall</hi> on <hi>Candlemas day</hi> was now mindful of his promise, and his Prophesie, and presented me with one; and this was but the day after it. This was a merry Fellow, who with a <hi>Table-knife</hi> had been mock Knighted into the name by the late King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> (being at Supper) upon his relating the dangers he passed, in bringing intelligence from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke.</hi> We had more of this Stamp in our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who had served in the Wars for <hi>Charles</hi> the First. Here we rested on <hi>Saturday</hi> and <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> (which are the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Sabbaths) for we were come into a new World, and would please All.</p>
            <p>But on Sunday the General was disturbed by a secret Information, which was this. A Son of Secretary <hi>Scots,</hi> who lodged in one Mr. <hi>Sturdy</hi>'s house in <hi>Russel street,</hi> had (it seems) fo great a confidence in his Landlord (though a <hi>Romanist</hi>) that, upon discourse, he revealed a great secret to him; <hi>viz.</hi> that not only <hi>Monk</hi>'s power for Commanding the Army should be taken from him, in a few days, but that he should be sent to the Tower, and questioned for his Life; and that it was not doubted but that such things would be proved against him as would take off his Head from his broad shoulders. <hi>Sturdy,</hi> very
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47558:58"/>
early in the Morning, came to Captain <hi>Morrice,</hi> (an honest <hi>Cavaliere</hi> of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in the City) and reveals to him the Discourse of <hi>Scots</hi> Son. Whereupon <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> forthwith carries this <hi>Sturdy</hi> to Mr. <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall</hi> and Mr. <hi>James Muddiford,</hi> (who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the General) and they bring him with them to <hi>Whitehall.</hi> The General gave so much credit to this Relation, that <hi>Sturdy</hi> (for some time afterward) rode in the <hi>Life-guard.</hi> Thus much Captain <hi>Morrice</hi> (well known in the City) can avouch.</p>
            <p>On Monday, the General saw the Face of his Masters in the House; received so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne thanks from them by their <hi>Speaker,</hi> and returned his to them: But because he took upon him to mind them of some things which he judged were for the publique good, it was not well relished by some, and particularly not by <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinson,</hi> they reflecting upon him as if he sought to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his own sence of things upon the House; yet this was past over, they being content to impute it to his affection for their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, rather than to any distaste he had of their <hi>Proceedings.</hi> Thus (having been first nominated one of their new molded Counsel of State) he was invited to take his place among them. But then every Counsellor of State was by order o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> and all the Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendents of the lineage of King <hi>James;</hi> nay and of all other single persons who should pretend to the Government of these Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: All this was to be done too by the Solemnity of an <hi>Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This had been propounded to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by those who had argu'd to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for the necessity of it: That it was high time for them to descriminate their own party, that at last they might come to know whom they could trust; it being now found that there had been a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, even among themselves. The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was not unprovided of an answer, and so craves leave to demurr; adding that he had not seen any good come of their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misary Oathes,</hi> those who took them making no scruple to break them: He instanced in the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Engagement;</hi> and suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that seven besides himself, who were nominated to be of the Counsel of State, had not yet abjured; beside that he did not know how it would relish with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who were very tender in that poynt. And indeed I knew some of them who (though no friends to <hi>Monarchy</hi> yet) had taken up a Notion that it was <hi>not Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Swear against the Providence of God.</hi> But that they should see that they had no reason to suspect Him or his Army, he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47558:59"/>
desired that they would make Tryal of his and their Fidelity and obedience to them, and if they found that he either disobey'd or disputed their Orders, he was then in their power; for he brought not an Army with him to make them jealous of him; having sent back a great part of it, after he understood that they were establisht in their power.</p>
            <p>Hitherto his Actions had not been such as in the least degree, to make the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> or <hi>Counsel of State,</hi> distrustful of him; nay they were rather such as ought to have produced a good opinion of his constancy to them, not only by his send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great part of his Army back, after they were restored; but also by contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so eagerly for them: For when a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between both Armies was first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and the Articles of it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in <hi>Scotland;</hi> it was with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that he yielded to the calling of an other Parliament: and when he did, he recommended this his Condescention to his <hi>Commissioners,</hi> as the great secret of their Trust, charging them to try all wayes for an accommodation, before that should be discovered; nay and broke the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too, as much for this reason as any other; and removed Collonel <hi>Wilks,</hi> from his Command, because he disclosed this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47558:60"/>
Instruction unnecessarily; he resolutely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the Parliament of the Eleventh of <hi>October,</hi> and no other. And indeed no other could so well have done his business, for <hi>this</hi> was become odious to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But fears and jealousies are protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>contra factum;</hi> to which, besides po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular expectations at home, the Kings Court abroad administred fuel: for <hi>adversity will lay hold on a Bull-rush.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time a Gentleman (whose sufferings were better known to me then I to him) came to me and told me, with great secresie, what hopes there were beyond Sea of <hi>Monks</hi> March; expressing a desire to gain some from me, but I sent him away discontented. The General's March without orders, might (at first) reasonably create some diffidence; but it was soon authorized, and countenanced by the coming of Orders, and Commissioners, from what we were obliged to call a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was now the General's business to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Scot</hi>'s suspitions of him, as knowing him to be his Enemy, and to have plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his ruine. <hi>Scot,</hi> in our March, had very often complained of the great <hi>malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy</hi> of the City of <hi>London;</hi> (for which, the coming of it's Commissioners gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion enough) but the General would comfort him by hinting that the Parliament
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47558:60"/>
need not to fear any danger thence, so long as they had an Army by them: And it seems he had promised him to take down the Stomack of the City, if need requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The necessity at this time was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; for now the Lord Major, Aldermen, and Common Counsel men of <hi>London</hi> by a publique vote declared that they would pay no more Taxes and Contributions, till the Parliament was filled up with equal Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentitives of the People. Before this, only a few popular tumults gave the Government a disturbance; but now the Authority of the whole City rebel'd against the <hi>Men of Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi> and I amy safely say that the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens the rather made choice of this time, because the General (only with his <hi>Scotch</hi> Army) was in their Suburbs, and at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> of whom they had entertained good hopes, from the time that divers Citizens of good note had given the General visits at <hi>St. Albans</hi> and <hi>Barnet;</hi> They knew too that many of the Officers had relations and Friends among them: Nor did any Citizens return from us with the ill news of despair; nay some of them used to carry more hopes back, then they had reason for; their affection for their County supplying the deficiency of promises from us. Thus most of them hoped well, and none would des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of <hi>Monk</hi> and his <hi>Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:47558:61"/>On Tuesday night the General was detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Council of State till past two in the Morning; which (he being no Member as yet because no Absurer) created some suspitions in his Friends and Servants, as if the Counsel meant not well towards him; and by some it was whisper'd as if it was designed that he should be sent to the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Now to speak the Truth, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel might (without reproach of jealousie; upon their wisdom) have suspected that the <hi>City</hi> would not have thus boldly remonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, had not <hi>Monk</hi> given them some secret en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</p>
            <p>But his Superlative foresight of things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the City, the Counsel of State, and his Friends and all; for he accepted of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the next day Executed them: He went into the City, and after he had plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his main Guards for his own Security, he distributed the remainder of his small Army to their several posts, charged them to pull down the City-gates, break their Port cullies, and pluck up their Posts and Chaines; himself, in the mean time send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, and imprisoning the most daring and disaffected Members of the Common Counsel, persuant to his orders.</p>
            <p>It is God's prerogative to change times and seasons, and to set up and pull down Kings and Governments: And this was the

            <p>At this time the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and such like <hi>Sectaries</hi> in and about the City (who were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of Peace and a National Interest) took heart at the pulling down of the City Gates, and fell to remonstrating to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that none were fit to bear any Office civil or mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, that would not abjure <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> and his Title and Family, This was understood to have been the artifice of some <hi>Abjurers</hi> in the <hi>Counsel of State,</hi> to win over assistance to their narrow and almost despised Party: And could they have gained the point of encouraging Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners of this nature; I doubt not to say but that the <hi>Counsel of State</hi> would have given a List to the <hi>Parliament</hi> it self, as Traitors to their Trust, because they were such squemish rebels, as not to abjure the heirs of the Crown.

            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Council of State,</hi> upon the first revolt of <hi>Monk,</hi> and retiring to the City with his Army, easily saw what they were to trust to; however they still court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his return: But not trusting to the charms of words to allure him; they distributed those Arms to <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and <hi>Fifth-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> and employed Agitors in their Army (now by <hi>Monks</hi> succesful artifice dispersed in Country Quarters) to whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per his Treason against the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and to give out openly, that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> was like to come in.</p>

This pinched; but it was artificially shuffled off by suggesting, that the <hi>Writs</hi> to be issued out for the next <hi>Parliament</hi> must necessarily run in the Name and Stile of <hi>the Keepers of the Liberties of the Commonwealth of England;</hi> and that the State of publick Lands was already as secure as the <hi>Government</hi> could make it.</p>
            <p>The Men at <hi>Westminster</hi> understanding that the <hi>secluded Members</hi> were like to keep House with them again, began to be very froward upon it, as if they should not have Elbow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Room enough; yet they durst not remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate against it, because they could not get the Crafty General (who was now judged ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable with a little help, of giving check to the Army) out of his Hole in the City: Beside, that the Popular cry ran for a <hi>full and free Parliament;</hi> This <hi>Rump</hi> in the last weeks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, touching Qualifications for Members to serve in the ensuing <hi>Parliament,</hi> having also exasperated and incensed the People, by voting as if none were fit to serve in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for the future, who had not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted equal guilt with themselves. Now to obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate <hi>Monk</hi>'s design to restore the <hi>secluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> some of them fell to offering at a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy resignation of their own power; giving

out that within a few days they would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the qualifications, before them, for the next <hi>Parliament;</hi> for they thought it not fit to resign up their authority to those who would cut their Throats: But they sound it to be too late for this <hi>Pin</hi> to be driven for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>For the General having gained, in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at least, the consent of his Officers for the resisting of the <hi>secluded Members</hi> upon certain conditions, they all of them that were in and about the Town, were sent for; and the <hi>Articles</hi> of their Readmission (which were these following read to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </list>
            <p>To which, with chearfulness, they agreed and subscribed; and before they left the place (in confidence that <hi>Monk was</hi> a true <hi>Patriot</hi>)
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47558:70"/>
promised to make him Commander in Chief, both by Sea and Land. Thus they went away rejoycing, that they should be accounted worthy to be the Restorers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys freedom.</p>
            <p>So on Tuesday <hi>February</hi> the 21, these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen met the General at <hi>Whitehall;</hi> (for to that end only, he returned thither) he spoke some few words to them, reminding them chiefly of their promises to him, and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them that he would not impose any new thing upon them, and he was as good as his word. That Morning they were conducted by Adjutant <hi>Miller,</hi> to take their former places in the House of <hi>Commons;</hi> which as soon as they enter'd, some of the <hi>sitting Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> arose in a heat, and left the House: <hi>Hazlerig</hi> and others, openly cry'd out (but too late) that <hi>Monk</hi> was a Traytor; but <hi>Hazle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rig</hi> met with no other punishment afterward for his <hi>Treason,</hi> than his own native rage and fury.</p>
            <p>Some of the Noble <hi>Peers</hi> who had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed with the House of <hi>Commons</hi> to draw the Sword against their King, watched the Readmittance of these seculded Members, and would have entered their own House; but the General having, before, intimation of their intents, commanded <hi>Miller</hi> to withstand them, in case any such attempt should be made. So the surly Souldier obeyed his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral's
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47558:70"/>
orders, though he was threatned that he did he knew not what. Now because the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral owned this, one of their Lordships was afterwards, even with him, by labouring to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>The General had now quitted the City, and came to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where in the evening he was informed of that Days Transactions of the <hi>Parliam.</hi> He was now his <hi>Excellency Capt.

            <p>This day was spent by the General, and his Officers, in signing Copies of Letters to be sent to the Commanders of the Armys in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to several Colonels and Commanders of Garrisons in <hi>England;</hi> in which was signified that they had let in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The <hi>General</hi> went to bed that night, not late, but in a very good humour: And indeed he had good reason for it; for now he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected his own safety, and stood no longer in fear of being questioned for interesting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in <hi>Booth</hi>'s Conspiracy. I came into his Chamber, and understood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e was in bed: so I was about to retire; but his Lady entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning me with discourse, he perceived that I was in the chamber, and so commanded me to his bedside; vvhere I found him satisfyed with what he had done, and pleasant with me. I told
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47558:71"/>
him I came (over and above the Duty of my Attendance) to give him thanks for his Dayes work. He answered me (with great courtesie of words) <hi>No, no; This is none of your business; you but dissemble with me: You come now for somewhat else; and I believe I know for what.</hi> I humbly asked him what he could think I came for? <hi>Sit down then</hi> (says he) <hi>and I'le tell you: You come for</hi> Bishops. He spake it not so softly, but his Lady overheard it; and mistook it as my proposal: at which she was angry. But the Curtains and the Generals Favour skreen'd me; he assuring her, that I had not spoken to him of <hi>Bishops.</hi> So she went off; but he detained me with thi serious Discourse upon the thing, that he thought <hi>This</hi> could never be done; for <hi>not only their Lands are sold</hi> (says he) <hi>but the Temper of the Nation is against them.</hi> I told him, that as yet he could not see the Temper of the Nation; the <hi>Royal Party</hi> having judg'd it prudence not to appear openly, or make any Addresses. But since he had mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, I entreatcd him to grant me one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; which was, that he would not be drawn to engage <hi>against</hi> them: and this I thought he might safely grant me, now, who would not be ensnared to abjure the King, and the Royal Family. He paused a while; (as his manner was) and taking

me by the hand, <hi>Well then</hi> (said he) <hi>so much I will promise you, that I will not be engaged against</hi> Bishops. I thank'd him, and kissed his Hand; adding, that it was best to leave it to God's Providence and the next Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament; when we should be able to discern the temper of the Nation in reference both to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Secluded Members,</hi> from all parts of the Kingdom, returned to the House of Commons; which was now open for them: of which number Mr. <hi>Morrice</hi> of <hi>Devon</hi> was one. This Gentleman was somewhat allied to the General, but more to his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> than his <hi>Blood;</hi> for he had a great o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of his Prudence and Integrity. He was one that much conversed with Books, and had lately written one against the Practice of <hi>Independent Teachers,</hi> who would admit none in Parochial Cures, to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> but such only as, being distinguish'd by their <hi>Separation,</hi> were most peculiarly their own Flock. This had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him very grateful to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> whose Cause he seemed most to serve; for the Ministers of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were generally contented with the exercise of their Religion in private houses; tho' even These also, were often disturbed by Souldiers or Constables, who used to hale them from their very <hi>Communion-Tables</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>The General, from and before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Enterprize, had pretended to be a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> (and indeed I knew his <hi>Godmother,</hi> who did her share too) and had not yet renounced his Faith; but now it most behoved him to appear one, and to act his part well in it; for it was his <hi>last:</hi> Wherefore Mr. <hi>Morrice</hi> was received into his House. This pleased his new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters at <hi>Westminster,</hi> who were most of them of this Religion; some few only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, who by beholding the calamities of the Church, and their own Errours, had been converted to a better esteem of <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy;</hi> which the Learning of Mr. <hi>Morrice</hi> could not but favour: so that I looked upon him to have the good Repute only of a <hi>Presbyterian.</hi> Him the General retained as his Elbow-Counsellor, and a State-Blind; concealing his own sense of things, and very often speaking contrary to his own thoughts, that so he might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understand the sence of others, and take
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47558:73"/>
his Measures accordingly. This is a sort of Cunning which will fail no Man, who meets with the plain and open-hearted. But whether this was inherent in the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This would not satisfie them; nor could I prevail with the General to have him Preach, tho I got Mr. <hi>Morrice</hi> to be my Advocate, who kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly represented the Learning and peaceable temper of Mr. <hi>Pierson.</hi> To this I might add a <hi>Fast</hi> kept at St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> where Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> preached; his very Text pointing at more than the Return of the <hi>Secluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi> It was <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>They have healed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the hurt of the Daughter of my People slightly; saying, Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace.</hi> This Doctor had, before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed the lamentable state of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in a Printed <hi>Folio;</hi> being an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Preacher, and dying afterwards Bishop

            <p>But the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Military</hi> Affairs were upon the Wheel of Motion; for the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> constituted a new <hi>Council of State,</hi> took off the <hi>Engagement</hi> that was upon the File against the <hi>King</hi> and House of <hi>Lords,</hi> and had been imposed on the Subject, <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. when the Army (after the Murder of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First</hi>) had set up the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the House of <hi>Commons</hi> for a <hi>Free State:</hi> But the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> (which was for <hi>Monarchy,</hi> in some sence, but, in all, <hi>against Prelacy</hi>) hung still on the Walls of the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> with the Names of the Renowned Subscribers; being left to the Censure of the next <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Genéral</hi> kept a vigilant eye upon his Enemy the Army; set new Colonels at the Head of most <hi>Regiments;</hi> and removed their inferiour <hi>Officers,</hi> as they were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to be either <hi>Troublesome,</hi> or <hi>Disaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> But the Parliament eased him of much trouble, by setling the <hi>Militia,</hi> in which neither <hi>Independent, Anabaptist, Fifth-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy-man,</hi> or <hi>Quaker,</hi> were allowed any sort of Command; a <hi>Cavalier</hi> being now become a less odious Name.

            <p>Col. <hi>Overton,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Hull,</hi> whose Ambition was equal with <hi>theirs,</hi> thought this a fit time to appear, and draw over the Malecontents of the Army (which every day increased in Number) to his Party.

            <p>
               <hi>Overton</hi> from <hi>Hull</hi> (a place fatal to the old King) sent forth his <hi>Emissaries</hi> to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the appearance of <hi>Monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> (for some men only hate <hi>Kings</hi> because they are not Kings themselves) and to tell the Souldiery that the abandoned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> did seem to shine in the face of the publick Transactions, Conjuring the <hi>Brethren</hi> in the Army, (who remained faithful to the <hi>True Cause</hi>) to signifie their concurrence with him.

            <p>The General did not only use his <hi>own</hi> Authority, to command <hi>Overton</hi> out of <hi>Hull,</hi> but recommended the matter to the

of another Parliament. Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> spake it openly, That if the King must come in it was safest for them that he should come in by <hi>their</hi> Votes who had made the War against his Father. Whereupon <hi>Prin</hi> was sent for, and admonished to be quiet; and it was the bufine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>s of Mr. <hi>Morrice</hi> to keep this expiring Session of Parliament steddy, and clear from intermedling with the change of the <hi>Government;</hi> in which case he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Service, punctually observing the Directions of the <hi>General,</hi> who so passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately longed for their Dissolution, that at last he took the Liberty to mind them of it; they having done his work. So they authorized the Issuing out of <hi>Writs</hi> for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parliament, which was to Meet the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> next, at <hi>Westminster</hi> (their Promise being, that it should be the <hi>20th.</hi>) But before they broke up, they Vote (to Justifie themselves) That the General should give no Commission to any Officer to serve in the Army, who should not declare in these Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> N. <hi>do Acknowledge and Declare, That the War undertaken by both houses of Parliament in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive part, against the Forces rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Name of the late King, was Just and Lawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Ordered, That the <hi>Commission-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:47558:79"/>
should further Declare, That they believed <hi>Magistracy</hi> and <hi>Ministry</hi> to be the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of God. By <hi>this</hi> may <hi>Posterity</hi> understand to what a fine Pass their pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Arms had brought Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
            <p>And there was a <hi>Second</hi> like to the <hi>First, viz.</hi> That <hi>all and every Person and Persons, who have advised, aided, abetted or assisted in any War against the Parliament, since the first of</hi> January 1641, <hi>he, they or their Sons shall be uncapable to be Elected to serve as Members of the next Parliament, unless he or they have since manifested their good Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to this Parliament:</hi> The longest Day will have an end; and this Long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Dissolved themselves <hi>March</hi> the <hi>17th.</hi> But as for their Votes, they were no more regarded than dead men's Shoes; the Countrey hastening to their Elections, as the <hi>Writs</hi> came down.</p>
            <p>The <hi>General</hi> being at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, was now besieged with <hi>Business</hi> and Visits; his own he very well knew how to dispatch; and I do affirm that in all my several years of Attendance on him, it was rare that ever he left any thing of the <hi>Day</hi> to be done on the <hi>Morrow:</hi> Nay, at Night, when he found his <hi>Secretaries</hi> offered him nothing, he used to ask if <hi>any thing more was to be done?</hi> chiding them, that they should be
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47558:79"/>
sooner weary of Writing, than he of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctating. But Visits (tho' fit to be paid to his Honour and Authority) were a new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; of which the most weighty at that time, was the Address of Sir <hi>John Greenvile.</hi> He had before made his Applications, as others had done; and that without suspition too; they being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. And though <hi>Greenvile</hi> had the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to be a known <hi>Cavalier,</hi> yet he was <hi>Monk</hi>'s near Kinsman. But as near as he was, he could not gain an opportunity of having any Conference with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for though he would often spin out his Visits to an extraordinary length, in expectation of the Rooms being cleared, by the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Company; yet so soon as ever it was, and a convenience offered of unfolding part of his Errand, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral (well knowing the reason of <hi>Greenvile</hi>'s long Attendance,) would immediately rise from his Chair, and say, <hi>Good Night Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin; 'tis late:</hi> or otherwise excuse himself, by pretending Business. But Sir <hi>John</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been so often frustrated, and being impatient till he could give the King his Master some further assurances of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>'s good Intentions, than what Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> (who said no more to him than that he was under an Oath of Secresie with his Brother) could afford him: At last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47558:80"/>
himself of making his Application to Mr. <hi>Morrice,</hi> by his Mediation to obtain the favour of a little private Discourse with the <hi>General,</hi> to whom he was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a Negotiation of great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. <hi>Morrice</hi> gave particular heed to what he said, and acquainted the <hi>General</hi> with it; but he refused to have any secret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with him, in regard that being a known <hi>Cavalier,</hi> notice would be taken of it, should he be admitted to any such pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy as desired. Yet he Ordered <hi>Morrice</hi> to wait upon his Cozen, to try if he could learn of what quality his Business was; and to make his report accordingly; giving him leave to assure him in his Name, that he was Authoriz'd to receive his Message (of what secresie soever it might be) and he promised to return the <hi>General</hi>'s Answer to it. This <hi>Morrice</hi> earnestly pressed <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> to do, but he refused the Proposal, and would not give him the least intimation of his business; only telling him that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned none but the <hi>General</hi> himself; and yet him so very much, that without all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay he must necessarily impart it to him; and in case he still obstinately persist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deny him a private Hearing, he was resolved to speak to him where-ever he should meet him next. Upon <hi>Morrices</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of this to the <hi>General,</hi> he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47558:80"/>
pleased at it; so the next night was appointed for disclosing this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Greenvile</hi> came to <hi>Morrices</hi> Chamber at St. <hi>James</hi>'s; whither the General upon <hi>Morrice</hi>'s intimation, soon after came like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. Sir <hi>John Greenvile</hi> and the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>General</hi> being now alone (and <hi>Morrice</hi> Door-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Conference) he addressed himself to the General in this purport of words; (they are his <hi>own</hi>) That<q> he was infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to his Excellency, for giving him this opportunity of discharging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of a Trust of great importance both to himself, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that had been long deposited in his hands; and that whatsoever became of him, he thought himself very happy to have this good occasion of performing his Duty in obeying the Commands of the King his Master.</q> At the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, he presented the General with a Letter from his Majesty, and produced another directed to himself, as also the <hi>Commission</hi> which he had from his Majesty, to Treat with him.</p>
            <p>The General stept back; and (hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Paper in his Hand) with a frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Countenance demanded of him how he durst to speak to him in such a Matter, without considering the danger he was to

                  </gap>n this great Affair; and I am much pleased al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so at your resolute secresie in it; for could I have understood that you had reveal'd it to any body living, since you first trusted my Brother with it,</hi> I would never have Treated with you; <hi>which now I sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

                  </gap>ny nearest Kinsmen, and of a Family to which I owe many obligations.</hi> So the General read the King's Letters, and the Commission; for which he said, <hi>I hope the King will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give what is past, both in my Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to the Contents of his Gracious Letter; for my heart was ever faithful to him,</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:47558:81"/>
               <hi>but I was never in a condition to do him Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice till this present; and you shall assure his Majesty thas I am now not only r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To witness this, I call this honest man from the Door.</hi> So he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Mr. <hi>Morrice</hi> to him, who by this time could not but understand the Design of <hi>Greenviles</hi> coming to the <hi>General. Morrice</hi> likewise chearfully e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>braced the Proposal, and was assistant in it. Sir <hi>John</hi> now intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the General to send some Confident of his own to the King; which the General willingly yielded to; but told him the <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> must be himself; for he would send no Letters as yet, for fear of the worst; and without them, the King had no reason to give credit to a Messenger from him: tho' his Majesty might well believe his <hi>own,</hi> whom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had employed to him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the next Conference Instructions were prepared, which <hi>Greenvile</hi> wrote out; and after he had diligently perused them, and fixed them in his Memory, as he was desired, the General threw the Paper into the fire, with charge not to commit his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions</hi> again to Paper till he came to <hi>Brussels</hi> (where the King then was) and there to communicate them to none but his Majesty.</p>
            <p>This is that Noble Sir <hi>John Greenvile,</hi>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:47558:82"/>
(the now Earl of <hi>Bath</hi>) to whom the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath Dedicated this <hi>Memorial,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming him a Witness of the Designed Loyalty of General <hi>Monk;</hi> (the late Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi>) whose successful Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, began and compleated the Restauration of our present Sovereign, and with <hi>Him,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> our Laws and Liberties, which we now See and enjoy. But there was yet more Work to be done.</p>
            <p>The Officers of the Army, who from their several Quarters in the Country, came to Town, to hear and make new distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, were remanded to their distinct Charges by the <hi>Council of State:</hi> But men of greater Quality than these Officers (and by some thought to be of a greater guilt too) were very earnest with the General, that the King, if he must be brought in by the next Parliament, should be admitted to his Throne upon no other than the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of the Isle of <hi>Wight.</hi> These were Articles too streight for <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and wholly destructive of the Constitution of the <hi>Church,</hi> as formerly (and now) govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Charles</hi> the First having yielded to them when he was a Prisoner in <hi>Carisbrook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Castle,</hi> 1648. And because the <hi>Parliament</hi> then Voted them to be sufficient Grounds for a Treaty with the King, the Army turned out the <hi>Voters,</hi> who were afterwards

               </gap>eliminary Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for a Peace (as propounded by the Parliament) was, that neither they nor their Armies were Rebels in making War against the King. To this his late Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty answered that then <hi>He</hi> and <hi>His</hi> Army were. To this a late Noble Lord replied, <hi>Nay, Sir, if you are thereabout, there is no peace for us with your Majesty, but the peace of God, which is past all understanding; from which God of his Mercy deliver us.</hi> But it behoved the charitable to pray that his Lordships Prayer were not heard, for the Blood that was spilt; for in one and the same Commonwealth there cannot be understood to be two <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> who can equally write <hi>Dei Gratia;</hi> and no <hi>less</hi> Power than what is delegated from God, and so bears the Sword, can warrant the shedding of Blood.</p>

            <p>But soon after; the General's danger was sreely represented unto him, should he by yeilding to such Proposals, anticipate the next Parliament; because in probabilitie it would bring a fresh War upon the Nation: for if upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But to return to the matter, <hi>Greenvile</hi>'s ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation was managed with such secresie, and his Journey to <hi>Brussels</hi> was so speedy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, that few knew of it before his arrival t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ere; and those who did, and went in his Company, did not so much as suspect the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand he was sent on. The King, upon intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his being come, went privately to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For the King (to debate what was to be done) consulted with his Lord Chancellor <hi>Hide,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and Secretary <hi>Nicholas,</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of <hi>Greenvile.</hi> And in this privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil <hi>Monks</hi> Commission Was signed to be Cap. <hi>General</hi> of all his Majefties Land Forces in the

Likewise then the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the <hi>Spanish</hi> to the <hi>United Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> according to the advice given by the General to <hi>Greenvile:</hi> and this was done both in hast and Privacy. His Majesty being come to <hi>Breda,</hi> dated his publick dispatches from thence; and there Sir <hi>John Greenvile</hi>

               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:47558:85"/>
and <hi>that he took more comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in that now he hoped he was able to do his Majesty and Country service, then in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of greatness.</hi> Besides that the General had given him this as a special charge that he should not propound any thing to his Majesty as a gratification for service, either for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or for any Friend or Officer of his, upon His accompt. The King then pressed <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> to know what he should do for Him; but he, after the General's example, nobly refused all Proposals of reward for the service in which he had been so eminently successful, till he should <hi>happily</hi> see his Majesty at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.</hi> However the King had then put up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Greenvile</hi>'s Pocket (though unknown to him) a Warrant under his Hand and Seal for an <hi>English Earldom,</hi> and the assurance of 3000l <hi>pr. annum</hi> for ever, to support his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, together with a Promise to pay his and his Fathers Debts, which had been contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the War Time in the service of his Majesty and his Royal Father.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Greenvile</hi> was sent back by his Majesty to the General, and brought with him (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the above mentioned Commission) his Majesties Seals and Signet by which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was empowred to make a <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>State;</hi> which he conferred upon Mr. <hi>Morrice</hi> by the advice of Sir <hi>John Greenvile: Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> upon the Kings <hi>Return</hi> was soon after

toward the latter end of <hi>May, (Greenvils</hi> return to the General being about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>April</hi>) was Knighted and confirmed in his place of Secretary of State. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his publick Letters, which were reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be communicated; he brought with him a private one to the General from his Majesty; written with his Maiesties own hand; to this the General returned an answer to by Mr. <hi>Bernard Greenvile</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And indeed he could not but be as welcome to his Majesty, for he brought now the assurances under his hand of the <hi>Generals</hi> resolution, to adhere to the Kings cause against all opposition whatever.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47558:86"/>
by the <hi>Souldiery;</hi> for which reason <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> when he was Protector, revered but displaced him; as divining that he would not only tread in his <hi>Steps,</hi> but upon his <hi>Heels</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The News of <hi>Lamberts</hi> escape soon came to us at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and almost at the same time a private information where he was hid. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the General fen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, and found it true; but he was got away before, to set up the Trade of War in the <hi>Countrey.</hi> Wherefore as soon as ever it was adver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ised where <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was, the General prepared (or seemed to do itat least) for a <hi>March:</hi> From which he was easily prevailed upon to defist by those who represented unto him the necessity of keeping the Town, in regard the Common Souldiers of the Army were not yet fixed to him, however he had modelled the Officers of it: and indeed many of <hi>these</hi> had already subscribed, that they would rest satisfyed in what the Parliament should determine about <hi>Government,</hi> as did all of them afterwards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who continu'd in their commands; and these Subscriptions, not long after, were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red even of private Souldiers. <hi>Lambert</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gained some accomplices to his Designs, they shisted Quarters into <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Warwickshires,</hi> to pick up more; all whom the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>State</hi> declared Traytors: But Col.

               </gap>e skill in the art of War the General had no great Opinion, and of which I can make no Judgment. But if <hi>Lambert</hi> intended to make a Rape upon the <hi>Government,</hi> as it was thought he did; he had not unqualified himself for it: For I never heard that he had listed himself into any Religious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but being a <hi>Latitudinarian</hi> to all, he might with less opposition have ruled the Rost: Nay and even a Party then most odious did not dispair of fair quarter from him.</p>
            <p>This unhappy Captain fell sooner than the General once thought he would; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause now the Kings Interest was become visible upon the Stage, and the Souldiers and under-Officers would soon have resor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>uppressed. This piece of Service none could so luckily have performed as Colonel <hi>Ingoldsby;</hi> for he was both known an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> beloved in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and had affection, as well as <hi>Courage</hi> to do it, as having been (though covertly) in <hi>Booth</hi>'s Conspiracy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:47558:87"/>But whilst <hi>Lambert</hi> was thus in the Field, and threatned a War, the General sent for Sir <hi>John Greenvile,</hi> and told him that if Col. <hi>Ingoldsby</hi> was beaten, and the Army so went over to follow <hi>Lambert</hi> that he could not be suppressed but by a War; Then he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to put off his disguise, declare the Kings Commission, own it for the authority by which he acted, and Commission the royal Party into Arms in all places through <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> Wherefore he required Sir <hi>John</hi> to attend him, and receive orders from him for his Majesties service.</p>
            <p>But Providence had appointed the Kings Restauration to be without Blood; nay and some few of our Officers (for it was no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick combination) expressed their willingness to do it; making this overture to the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> that if he would undertake by his sole authority (as <hi>Generalissimo</hi> at Land and half a one by Sea) to restore the King, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised their own assista<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> prudently alledging, that such a Course would be more for his honour, than to give way to a <hi>Parliament</hi> to do it, and then they might expect better terms, afterwards, for themselves. He knew the Men and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, and returned this answer; <hi>That the Parliament which was to be, was called upon</hi> a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47558:88"/>
Commonwealth-Accompt; <hi>and it did not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now at least, become Souldiers to meddle with the change of Government: for he would be true to his Declaration to keep the</hi> Military Power <hi>in ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>dience to the</hi> Civil: reminding them that themselves had promised to rest contented with what the Parliament should do touching Government. To this the Royal Party in and about the Town had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so subscribed, testified their submission to he present Power, as it then resided in the <hi>Council of State,</hi> in expectation of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Parliament,</hi> and promised to bury all rancors and animosities. This Declaration was by them published, with the subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of several Noble Men and Gentlemen of eminent quality.</p>
            <p>However Affairs now were in a fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure towards a National Settlement, yet there wanted not Agitators to disturb it; who went up and down in the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi> to Spirit the Army into Discontent. Wherefore the Reward of 10 <hi>l.</hi> was publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and promised for the Discovery of any one of them. But Agitators enow of this sort (as well <hi>Lay</hi> as <hi>Clergy</hi>) came to St. <hi>James</hi>'s; <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> was of both <hi>Coats;</hi> for he had a portion of the Lord <hi>Craven</hi>'s Lands, and feared a secular Restitution too. This Noble Lord, (Nobler now, being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Earldom of <hi>Craven,</hi>) had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fought against the <hi>Parliam.</hi> but from his
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47558:88"/>
Youth generously hazzarded his person, and spent his Estate in Foreign wars to the Honour of his Country; whom the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral always honoured, and who succeeded him after his Death in the Command of the Regiment of the King's Guards, (my most Honourable and Noble Colonel.) And by what contrivance, or for what Delinquency his Estate was forfeited, is not an Enquiry proper for this place. But the General's Lady was so bold as to ask <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> if he was not for <hi>Restitution?</hi> The Ministers of <hi>Independency</hi> likewise were very solicitous to know what they must trust to, &amp; disturb'd the hopes of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> by telling them that <hi>Episcopacy</hi> and <hi>Arminianism</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in upon <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Twas my Portion to hear these things, being sometimes deputed to attend them: But I was an Infidel to all these Fears; for the General still adhered to a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and neither Jest nor Earnest could make any other Discovery of him: For once he was set upon in Jest by a late <hi>Long-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Common-wealths-man,</hi> who was good at it: He told the General, that he had always had a great esteem of him (I think he had once at a pinch happily served him) and asked him what he aimed at, a <hi>King</hi> or a <hi>Commonwealth?</hi> The General answered, you have known me a long time, and you know that I have been these many years
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47558:89"/>
for a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and I am still of that opinion. He returned, I ought to believe your Excellency; but will you give me leave to tell you a Story; 'Twasthis; A City<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Taylor was met one Evening in the Country with a <hi>Pick-Axe</hi> and <hi>Spade;</hi> a Neighbour of his asked him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was going with those Instruments? He answered, to take measure for a new Suit of Cloaths at such a House, and for such a person. His Neighbour demanded, what with a <hi>Pick-Ax</hi> and <hi>Spade?</hi> Yes, quoth the Tailor, these are the Measures now in fashion; so he left the Application to his Excellency, whether his new Models in the Army were fit Tools to make a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> with,</p>
            <p>Nor could Monsieur <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> (then Resident Ambassador for <hi>France</hi>) gain any certainty of his Designs; though he made an attempt to dive into them: He sent for Commissary <hi>Clargys,</hi> and propounded the Assistance of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> either to help the General to the Sovereignty, or to restore our King; adding his Advice, that the King might be desired to retire into <hi>France,</hi> and that speedy notice should be given him to leave <hi>Flanders,</hi> if the General aimed at his <hi>Restitution.</hi> But the General would not allow the Ambassador the liberty of this <hi>Discourse</hi> to him, though he refused him not a Visit, upon the Request of <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis.</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:47558:89"/>
The Story is at large related in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>'s Chronicle, <hi>pag.</hi> 717. Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1674. whither I refer the Reader, because I knew nothing of it till I found it there.</p>
            <p>The Parliament was now ready to sit down, and the King's Return was visible to the wise and discerning; provided that the General had not his Reserves to give a stop to it; for he still kept himself in a Cloud. Wherefore the prying and suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (of which sort were Women) found out little <hi>Devices</hi> to sound what were his Intentions, by giving small gifts to his Son (a Child then between six or seven years of age, the now Duke of <hi>Albemarle</hi>) who innocently told these busie Enquirers, that his Father and Mother in Bed had talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the King's coming home. I dare promise that he shall not be so easily out, witted or surprized now; and I doubt not, but that he will be heir of his Fathers <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> as well as of his <hi>Estate:</hi> And may he live to out-do him in both! However I wish so; for I love and honour him, whose Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was sometimes committed tomy Charge.</p>
            <p>Though the Parliament were not met, yet all apprehensions of danger were already over: only a few Libels were thrown in the night at our Guards, against the King and his Party. Wherefore now we were entertained with <hi>Feasting,</hi> to which the Worthy Citizens of <hi>London</hi> did invite the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47558:90"/>
General and his Officers; and it would be ungrateful not to mention their great and sumptuous Entertainments; <hi>Thanks</hi> being the proper Reward of <hi>good Cheer.</hi> These <hi>Feasts</hi> were performed in the publick Halls of the more Ancient Companies; where, (besides <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Musick</hi>) we had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Sin-Songs</hi> of more than <hi>Ballade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Poets,</hi> who hope yet for better things, than what they saw. At which some of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers would say, that they were <hi>Beasts set up a fatting for the Slaughter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now came the 25th of <hi>April,</hi> when both Houses of Parliament (the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storers of their Countrys freedom) set down. It was not disputed who call'd, and gave them this authority, but the most Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous submitted to it. Now it appeared that Gods) mercy which must be first revered, and eternized) then the Kings <hi>Clemency,</hi> the Generals <hi>Conduct,</hi> and this <hi>Parliaments</hi> sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, had prevented our Officers fears, and the effufion of Blood, either by the Sword of <hi>War</hi> or of <hi>Justice:</hi> for none suffered upon the old score, those only excepted, who were after adjudged to Death for the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Charles</hi> the First; (and some of these too had their Lives given them) unless I should add the further exemption of some few others; as Mr. <hi>Henry Vane</hi> (the very Son of his Father) and <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> whose

whose Guilt was thought greater than some of the greatest of the <hi>Criminals,</hi> who sate in a Court of <hi>Mock-Justice,</hi> upon the Life of their <hi>Sovereign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament adjourned for some few days; &amp; Sir <hi>John Greenvile</hi> consulted with the General about the delivery of his message from his Maje<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
