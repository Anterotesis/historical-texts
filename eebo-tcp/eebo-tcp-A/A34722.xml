            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am not ignorant, that
this later Age hath
brought forth a ſwarm
of buſie heads, which
meaſure the great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries

are better knowne, then to thoſe that ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loofe
off; they would perhaps be more ſparing
if not more wary in their Reſolutions.</p>
            <p>For my owne particular, J muſt confeſſe,
that J am naturally too much inclined to his

vixit,</hi> and freſhly recalling to mind, the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Functius</hi> to his Friend at the houre of
his untimely Death:
<q>
                  <l>Diſce, meo exemplo, mandato munere fungi:</l>
                  <l>Et fuge ceu Peſtem, <gap reason="foreign">

I proteſt to maintaine, rather deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratively
then by the way of a concluſive aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion;
Therefore without waſting precious
time any longer, with needleſſe Prologue, I
will briefly ſet downe the queſtion in the
termes following:</p>
            <p>Whether it be more expedient to ſuppreſſe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
practiſes, againſt the due Allegiance to his
Majeſtie, by the ſtrict execution of the Lawes
Touching <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and <hi>Seminary Prieſts,</hi> or to
reſtraine them to cloſe Priſon during life, if no
reformation following.</p>
            <p>The doubt propounded conſiſting of Two
Branches, neceſſarily requireth to be diſtinctly
handled, that by comparing either part the
conveniency, mentioned in the Queſtion, may
be cleered with more facilitie.</p>
            <p>1.
In favour of the firſt Diviſion there are not
a few, who grounding themſelves on an ancient
Proverbe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>A dead man bites not:</hi>
Affirme that ſuch are dangerous to be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47272:3"/>
alive, who being guilty, condemned, and
full of feare, are likely for puchaſe of life and
liberty, to ingage their utmoſt in deſperate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
againſt their King and Countrey.</p>
            <p>2. No leſſe is it to be feared, that while the
Sword of Juſtice is remiſſe in cutting off hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
offenders, againſt the dignity of the
Crowne, the miſled <hi>Papall</hi> multitude in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim,
may enter into a jealous ſuſpence, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that forbearance proceed from the feare
of exaſperating their deſperate humours, or
that it is now become queſtionable, whether the
execution of their Prieſts be ſimply for matter
of State, or pretended quarrell for Religion.</p>
            <p>3. And whereas in a remedileſſe inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
it is lawfull to uſe the extremity of Lawes
againſt ſome few, that many by terrour of the
Example may be reformed; what hope can
there be, that clemency may tame their hearts,
who interpret his Majeſties grace in Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Prieſts out of this Realme to be a
meere ſhift, to rid the Priſons of thoſe whom
Conſcience could not condemne of any capitall
crime.</p>
            <p>4. Neither are their vaunting whiſperings
to be neglected, by which they ſeeke to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the fearefull Soules of their party, and to
inveigle the ignorant, doubtfull, or diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
perſons; for if the glorious extolling of
their powerfull Friends, and the expecting of
a golden day be ſuffered, to winne credit with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47272:4"/>
the meaner ſort, the relapſe cannot be ſmall, or
the meanes eaſie to reforme the Errour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a generall combuſtion of the State.</p>
            <p>5. Let experience ſpeake ſomewhat in this
behalfe, which hath evidently diſcryed within
the current of few yeares; That the forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Severity hath multiplied their Roll
in ſuch manner, that it remaines as a Corraſive
to thouſands of his Majeſties well affected
Subjects.</p>
            <p>6. To what purpoſe ſerves it, to muſter the
names of the Proteſtants, or to vaunt them to
be ten for one of the <hi>Roman</hi> faction, as if bare
figures of numeration could prevaile againſt an
united party reſolved and adviſed aforehand,
how to turne their faces with aſſurance unto
all dangers, while in the meane time, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
neſtling in vaine ſecurity, ſuffer the
weed to grow up that threateneth their bane
and mercileſſe ruine?</p>
            <p>7. Sometimes the <hi>Oath of Supremacie</hi> cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
their preſumptuous imaginations, and yet
could not that infernall ſmoake be wholly
ſmothered, nor the Locuſts iſſuing there-out,
be cleanſed from the face of this Land. Now
that the Temporall power of the King, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the <hi>Oath of Allegeance,</hi> is by the <hi>Papall
Sea,</hi> and many of the Adorers thereof, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
avowed to be unlawfull; ſhall the
broachers of ſuch Doctrine be ſuffered to live,
yea to live and be received of us, for whoſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47272:4"/>
deſtruction they groane daily?</p>
            <p>8. To be a right <hi>Popiſh Prieſt,</hi> in true En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
ſenſe, <hi>is to beare the Character of a diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Renegade, of his naturall obedience to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne;</hi>
Whom, if by connivence he ſhall
let ſlip or chaſtice with a light hand; what
immunity may not Trayterous delinquents in
leſſer degrees expect or challenge after a ſort,
in Equity and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>9 <hi>If there were no receivers there would be
no Theeves:</hi> Likewiſe, if there were no Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> it is to be preſumed
that they would not trouble this Iſle with
their preſence; Therefore Rigor muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
againſt the Receiver, that the <hi>Jeſuite</hi>
may be kept out of doores; were it then indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Juſtice to hang vp the Acceſſary and let
the Principall goe free; namely to ſuffer the
<hi>Prieſt</hi> to draw his breath at length, while the
entertainer of him vnder his Roofe ſubmits his
body to the Executioners hand? Without
doubt if it be fit to forbeare the chiefe, it will
be neceſſary to receive the ſecond offender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
protection. Wherewith a miſchiefe muſt
enſue of continuall expence; and ſcandalous
reſtraint of ſo great a number.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Reputation</hi> is one of the Principall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teryes
of the Common-wealth, which <hi>Maxime</hi>
is ſo well knowne to the Secretaries of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie;</hi>
That by private Forgeries and publicke
impreſſions of Calumniations, they endeavour
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47272:5"/>
to wound us in that vitall part; Howſoever
therefore, ſome few of that ſtampe being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
tempered then their fellowes in defence of
this preſent government, have not ſpared to
affirme; <hi>That tyranny is vnjuſtly aſcribed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,
for ſo much as freedome of Conſcience, after
a ſort, may be redeemed for money;</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
there want not many Pamphleters of
their ſide, who opprobriouſly caſt in our
teethes, the converting of the Penalty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on Recuſants, and refuſers of the <hi>oath
of alleageance</hi> from the Kings Exchequer to a
particular purſe: ſurely we cannot preſume
that theſe <hi>Libellers</hi> may be diſſwaded from
ſpitting out their venome maliciouſly againſt
vs, when they ſhall ſee their <hi>Prieſts</hi> mewed
vp without further proceſſe of Law: For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they will attribute this calme dealing to
the Juſtice of their cauſe, the ſtrength of their
party or patience, or that tract of time hath
diſcovered our Lawes importing overmuch
ſharpeneſſe in good policy, to be thought fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for abrogation, by non vſance, then repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by a publicke decree.</p>
            <p>11. Moreover it is fore-thought by ſome, that
if theſe Seminaries be onely reſtrayned, that
they may prove hereafter like a ſnake, kept in
the Boſome, ſuch as <hi>Bonner, Gardiner,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the ſame Livery ſhewed themſelves to
be after Liberty, obtained in Queene <hi>Maries</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:47272:5"/>
dayes; And if the loſſe of their Ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
agrieve them, it is probable, that they will
take Armes ſooner, and with more courage to
free the Living, then to ſet vp a Trophie to the
dead.</p>
            <p>12. How ſoever the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> Band is knowne
in their Native ſoyle, to be defective in many
reſpects, which makes them vnderlings to
the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> as in authority, armes and the
Protection of the Lawes, which is all in all:
Nevertheleſſe, they inſinuate themſelues to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Princes, favouring their party, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of ſtrange aſſiſtance at home; if they
may be well backed from abroad; To which
purpoſe they have divided the Inhabitants of
this Realme into foure Sects; Whereof
Ranking their Troupes in the firſt place (as
due to the pretended Catholiques) they aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
a full fourth part to their property, and
of that part againe they made a Subdiviſion
into two portions; namely of thoſe that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
renounced the eſtabliſhed Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
and others whoſe certaine number could
not be aſſigned: Becauſe they frequented our
ſervice, our Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, reſerving their hearts to
their Lord God the Pope. The ſecond party
they allot to the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who retaine yet,
as they ſay, ſome Reliques of their Church;
The third Ranke and largeſt, was left vnto
the <hi>Puritans,</hi> whom they hate deadly,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47272:6"/>
in reſpect, that they will hold no indifferent
quarter with Papiſtry. The fourth and laſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niple;
They aſſigne to the <hi>Politicians:
Huomini</hi> (ſay they) <hi>Senza Dio, &amp; Senz ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma:</hi>
Men without feare of God, or regard of
their Soules; Who buſying themſelves onely
with matters of State, retaine no ſenſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
without doubt, if the Authors of this
partition have caſt their account aright, we
muſt confeſſe, the latter Broode is to be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
properly vnto them; For if the vndermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Parliament Houſe, the ſcandalizing
of the King in Print, who is Gods annoynted;
And the refuſall of naturall obedience, be
workes of thoſe that neither ſtand in awe of
God or Conſcience; well may the Papiſts
boaſt, that they are aſſured of the firſt number;
and may preſume likewiſe of the laſts friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
when occaſion ſhall be offered; For the
preventing of which combination; it is a ſure
way to cut off the Heads; that ſhould tye the
knot, or at leaſt, to brand them with a marke in
the forehead, before they be diſmiſſed, or after
the opinion of others, to make them vnwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to the faeminine Sexe; which now with
great fervency imbraceth them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are for the moſt part Arguments ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in ordinary diſcourſe, by many who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a <hi>Prieſts</hi> breath to be contagious in our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Ayre; others there are, who maintaine
the ſecond part of the queſtion, with reaſons

Therefore howſoever it is in the power of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to ſuppreſſe the perſon of a man, the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for which he ſuffered (conceived truly or

               </gap> how ſharpe
or keene ſoever: I confeſſe that the Teeth are
ſoone blunted, that byte only out of the malice
of a ſingular faction: But where poyſon is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
through the veynes of a Common-wealth
with intermixture of Blood, good and bad, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
is to be made rather by vacuation,
then by preſent inciſion: The greateſt byter
of a State is <hi>Envie</hi> ioyned with thirſt of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi>
which ſeldome declares it ſelfe in plaine
Colours, vntill a Jealouſie conceived of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
dangers breaketh out into deſperate reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
Here comes it to paſſe, that when one
mal-contented member is grieved, the reſt of
the body is ſenſible thereof; neither can a
<hi>Prieſt</hi> or <hi>Ieſuite</hi> be cut off without a generall
murmure of their Secretaries, which being
confident in their number, ſecretly arme for
oppoſition, or confirmed with their Martyrs
blood, (as they are perſwaded) reſolve by pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and ſufferance to glorifie their cauſe; and
to merit heaven. Doe we not daily ſee, that it
is eaſier to confront a private Enemy, then a
ſociety or Corporation: And that the hatred
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47272:7"/>
of a State is more immortall then the ſpleene
of a Monarchy; Therefore except it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated,
that the whole <hi>Roman</hi> City which
conſiſts not of one broode, but of a ſucceſſion
of Perſons may be cut off at the firſt ſtroake,
as one entrei head, I ſee no cauſe to thinke our
ſtate ſecured by ſitting on the ſkirts of ſome
few <hi>Seminaries,</hi> leaving in the meane time
a multitude of ſnarlers abroad, who alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſhew their Teeth and onely waite opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to bite fiercely. I will not deny, that
whom we feare, we commonly hate; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
alwaies, that no merit hath interceeded a
reconciliation; For there is great difference
between hatred conceived againſt him that
will take away the life, and him that may
juſtly doe it, and yet in Clemency forbeares
to put it in effect, For the latter breedeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
awe, whereas the former ſubjecteth to
ſervile feare, alwaies accompanied with deſire
of innovations. And although it hath bin affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

then that the Papall ſide, affecting merit,

the reſtraint of their <hi>Seminaries;</hi> that cannot

their eaſe of durance before the Rigor of

their ſpirituall Children, to thruſt their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
into the fire, by refuſing the <hi>oath of allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance:</hi>
Notwithſtanding we have many Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies
in Judiciall Courts, and printed
Bookes, that the greater part of them are of
that Theban Hunters mind, who would rather
have ſeen his Dogs cruell Acts, then have felt

Letters lamented, that after his death,
hee ſhould not be enroled amongſt the
Martyrs: Becauſe that no matter of
Religion was objected againſt him, yet
it plainely appeares in his demeanure;
That hee would gladly have ſurvived
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47272:8"/>
the poſſibility of that glory, if any ſuch hope
had remained, neither is it to be preſumed, that
being in priſon, he would ever have conceived
that we durſt not touch his Reverence, or that
the Law was remiſſe, which had juſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him and left his life to the Kings mercy, it
was the diſtance of the place and not perſons,
that interpreted the ſending over Seas of the
<hi>Prieſts,</hi> to be a greater Argument of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
then of his Majeſties forbearance:
For had Father <hi>Parſons</hi> himſelfe bin <hi>Coram no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi>
his ſong would rather have been of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

Therefore if the Lawes printed, &amp; indictments

or that the vices of the City, ſeated on 7. Hils,

if then it doth appeare that terror prevailes not

in their minds, that their ſufferings are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47272:9"/>
either expreſly or by implication for matter of

a matter of ſmall conſequence, <hi>Purpuratis Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,

Rightly did <hi>Clement</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> conſider that by

in <hi>Rome</hi>) ſolemnly proteſt; <hi>That none of

<hi>as it were chalked out vnto the Papiſts, by

that by taking away of one, we have confirmed and

if I thought any ſcruple were made in that

            </p>
            <p>As for forraigne parts, which hold with the
<hi>Papall Supremacy,</hi> it is cleere, that they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47272:10"/>
will be ſevere and partiall Judges in this cauſe;
For albeit that here in <hi>England</hi> it is well known
to all true and loyall Subjects; that for matter
of <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine, no mans life is directly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into queſtion: But that their diſobedience
in reaſon of State, is the only motive of their
proſecution; Nevertheleſſe where a great Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
of Chriſtendome is rooted in a contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
&amp; things in this world are for the moſt
part eſteemed by outward appearance; this
Land cannot eſcape malicious ſcandals, neithet
ſhal there be want of Colledges to ſupply their
faction with <hi>Seminaries.</hi> Therefore again, and
again I ſay, that if the ſtate of the queſtion were
ſo ſet that it were poſſible by a generall execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and their <hi>Adherents,</hi> to end
the controverſie, J could in ſome ſort with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

little hope in that courſe, J hold it ſafer to be
ambitious of the victory, which is purchaſed
with leſſe loſſe of blood, and to proceed, as <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
teacheth his Orator; <hi>who when he cannot whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

So ſhall it fare with this ſtate, if private whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings

with their lying phanſies, and in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the Corner-creepers leave ſome badge of
their malicious ſpleen againſt vs, crying out of
cruelty and perſecution: But if the penalty of
death be changed into a ſimple indurance of
Priſon, what moate can they find in our eyes

with tract of time gotten a hard ſkinne on

inſight, behold how this great quantity of
Spawne is multiplied, we muſt eſpecially aſcribe
the cauſe thereof to their Prieſts, who by their
deaths prepare and aſſure more to their ſect, then
by their lives they could ever perſwade.</hi> It were
incivility to diſtruſt a friend, or one that hath
the ſhew of an honeſt man, if he will franckly
give his word, or confirme it with a ſacred
Oath: But when a proteſtation is made upon

And though theſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> having indeed a

by thoſe that lay their ſoules to pawne vnto

into an Iſland, or ſome remote Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
even in the caſe of Religion, they were

And for that cauſe, it behoved to be very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

An Oath is a weake Band to containe him
that will, for pretended Conſcience ſake,
hold no Faith with Hereticks, or by abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from a Prieſt, thinketh himſelfe at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <p>Therefore when I remember, that <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone
the Prieſt,</hi> notwithſtanding his invectives
againſt the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> gained liberty to forge
his trayterous inventions, and had others of

this queſtion, I will firſt ſhew the Reaſon,
why they are not purſued and taken, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
make an overture, how they may be
boulted out of their Hutches. The Nature
of Man, howſoever in hot bloud it be thirſty
of revenge; in a cooler temper, it hath a kind
of <hi>Nauſea,</hi> as I may call it, or a diſtaſte of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away of the lives, even of the Nocent:
Inſomuch that in all <hi>Aſsizes and Seſſions,</hi> an
offender can hardly be condemned, whom the
fooliſh pitty of many will not after a ſort
excuſe, with laying ſome imputations on the
<hi>Judge,</hi> part on the Jury, and much on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer;
and ſuch is their blind affection, that
the <hi>Priſoner</hi> who, perhaps, was never recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for handſomneſſe, will be eſteemed
of them, for one of the propereſt men in the
company: from hence it comes, that the name
of a <hi>Serjeant, or a Purſevant is odious,</hi> and
the Executioner, although he be the hand
of Iuſtice, is eſteemed no better then an
Enemy of Mankind, and one that loſt hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
and Humanity in his Cradle. Reverend
<hi>Maſter Foxe</hi> was wont to ſay, that Spyes

for his owne part, he would not be of any of
that number, or wiſh his friends to affect
ſuch impliments, and albeit that the Law
permits and commands every man to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
a Fellon; doe we not commonly ſee
very many content to ſtand by and looke on,
while others performe that office?</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, it is evident, that if ſuch as are

It followeth now, according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode
preſcribed before, that an overture be
made, how to get the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and their ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
the <hi>Prieſts</hi> into poſſeſſion: it hath bin
heretofore recited, that the unwelcome name
of a Blood-ſucker, a Buſiebody, or a Puritane
hath bin ſhrewd <hi>ſcarecrowes</hi> unto many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
minds, by abrogating therefore of thoſe
or ſuch like imputations, many will be ſtirred
up to undertake the apprehending of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries</hi>
unto the truth: eſpecially, when
for their paines and time imployed, they
ſhall deſerve, and have the titles of good <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots,
dutifull Subjects, and zealous Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi>
how ready is every common perſon to
carry a <hi>Malefactor to the ſtokes,</hi> rather then
to the goale or Execution, and doubtleſſe, they
will be no leſſe forward to attach a Prieſt
when they are aſſured that the worſt of his
puniſhment ſhalbe a ſimple reſtraint within
the walls of ſome old Caſtle. A certaine kind
of People there is, with whom mony playes
a more forcible Orators part, then any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
of the dutifull ſervice, which they
owe to their Common-wealth: Theſe men
will not be negligent to give intelligence, and
alſo to procure it faithfully provided, that
reward may helpe to line their thred-bare
purſes, and exempt them from need to ſell
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47272:15"/>
liberty unto <hi>Seminaries:</hi> and where aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of gaine is propounded, for diſcovery
what Maſter or Houſekeeper will truſt his
ſervant with keeping of his Prieſt, or ſleepe
quietly while he is engaged to the danger of
a Mercenary? I remember, that in <hi>Italy</hi> it was
often told me, that the bountifull hand of Sir
<hi>Francis Walſingham,</hi> made his <hi>intelligencers ſo
active,</hi> that a Seminary could ſcarcely ſtirre
out of the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> without his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
which ſucceſſe, by mediation of Gold,
may as readily be obtained from <hi>Sivill, Valc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolid,
Doway, Lovaine, Paris, and other places,</hi>
and by forewarning given of their approach,
they may be waited for at the Ports, and from
thence, ſoone conveied to a ſafe Lodging.
But whence ſhall the ſtreame follow that
muſt feed this bounty? It is a doubt eaſily ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.
If ſome thouſands of pounds out of
the <hi>Recuſants penalties</hi> be reſerved in ſtock,
and committed by his <hi>Majeſty</hi> into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of zealous diſtributers, who will
not be afraid to conclude <hi>Perdat fiſcus ut ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piat

ſuccour to repaire decayed Caſtles, and

a ſure guard to keepe them: then the
foreſaid forfeitures, that by the Juſtice
of the LAVV may bee collected:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47272:16"/>
which courſe, if ever it come happily to bee
entertained, and that <hi>Recuſancy</hi> cauſe to be an
ignominous prey to the ſubjects, the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
for Religion ſhall be leſſe blamed, and
perhaps altogether unjuſtly accuſed, by any
graceleſſe, <hi>Gretzerus or Cacodaemon, Johannes,</hi>
tincting their pennes in Gall, and vineger,
For beſides occaſion of calumniation, given
by ſuites of that nature, it is evident that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Recuſants that would be indicted for the
King, and the effecting of the project afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
ſhall eſcape without puniſhment, and be
borne out againſt the power of a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
begging them to no other purpoſe, then
hath heretofore bin uſed, and albeit the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
be rated at xxl a moneth, yet was it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Law-makers intent, that ſuch as was
not able to pay ſo great a ſumme, ſhould goe
ſcot-free. But that according to the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their abilitie, they ſhould doe the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of their purſes for their diſobedience;
whereas now (if the voice of the People,
which is ſaid to be the voice of God, is to be
credited) the poorer ſort is skipt over, as if
they ought no ſoules to God, nor duty to
their Soveraigne, a poore man, ſaith one, is to
be pittied, if he offend thorow neceſſity: but
he doe amiſſe voluntarily, he is more ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Let us now preſuppoſe that all the whole
Regiment of <hi>Ieſuites and Seminaries,</hi> were
lodged in ſafe cuſtody, may we then perſwade
our ſelves <hi>that Popery will vaniſh like a dumb

will onely lye hidden as a <hi>weed, that

Armes are Remedies ſerving for a time: but
the Spirituall ſword is permanent in opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and by an inviſible blow workes more
then Mortall man can imagine. <hi>The word of
God carryeth this two edged weapon in its
mouth, which is to be vſed by faithfull Miniſters
of the Church, whom pure zeale, without reſpect
to wordly promotion or perſons, ought to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</hi>
Of Judges, the Scripture ſaith <hi>Eſtote
fortes,</hi> and daily we ſee that ſitting in their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
ſeates, God inſpireth them with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
courage, then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as private Perſons, they
are to give their opinions: No leſſe is the
power of the holy Ghoſt in his ſervants,
that out of the Pulpit are to deliver his
Embaſſage. Let them therefore not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mai'd
to ſpeak out plainly, and tell the truth
without running a middle courſe betweene
heate &amp; cold. Unprofitable deſcanting upon
the Scripture with an old Poſtell, or for want
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47272:17"/>
of better matter, waſte the poore time ſhut

Rumour which is ever ready to take
hold of evill, hath raiſed a ſecret, though (as I
hope) a cauſeleſſe ſuſpition; that there ſhould
be ſome ſecret combination under hand, by
changing the ſtate of Queſtions, to put us in
our old dayes, to learne a new Catechiſme;
and when they haue brought us out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<hi>with the Reverend Interpreters of the
Word,</hi> to uſe us then, as the Wolves (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in <hi>Demoſthenes Apologie</hi>) handled the
Shepheards, when they had delivered up their
Dogs. Moſt ſacred was that Speech of our
moſt gracious King concerning <hi>Vorſtius;</hi> he
that will ſpeake of <hi>Canaan,</hi> let him ſpeake
the Language of <hi>Canaan.</hi> How can we draw
others to our Church; if we cannot agree,
where, or how to lay our Foundation? Or
how may we cleanſe the Leprous Diſeaſe of
diſſenſion, which the Papiſts, which are leaſt
aſſured to themſelves, and moſt doubtfull of
their ſalvation, are not aſhamed to aſcribe
unto many of us? I would not have Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
indiſcreet, like Dogs, to bark againſt all,
whether they know, or know them not. I like
better the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who adviſeth
thoſe that ſtand in guard of a place, to be
curſt; onely to ſuch as are about to endam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
the City. If Purſevants, and other civill
Officers, would learne to keepe this rule, they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47272:17"/>
might goe about their buſineſſe, with much
credit. The imagined feare of inviting the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> faction, by force to deliver their
ghoſtly Fathers out of priſon, move me not
a whit; For I cannot believe, that they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
them at ſo deare a price, that they
would runne the hazard, by freeing others out
of hold, to put themſelves into their places.
ſome will ſay, that a man of ſtraw is a head
good enough for a diſcontented Multitude.
That the Papiſts are very Cholericke, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
ſufficiently by their writings: yet it
hath pleaſed God to ſend thoſe curſt Cowes
ſhort hornes, that when they could not finde
a man of ſufficiency to ſerve their turne, they
were faine to doe homage to <hi>Garnets ſtraw;
forgetfull as they are,</hi> that ſuch ſtubble cannot
endure the tryall of fire; but unto us, that
ought to be doers, as well as Profeſſors of
the Goſpell, let <hi>this remaine as a memorable
Theoreme: Religion is the Mother of good
Order; good Order, is the cauſe of proſperous
Fortune, and happy ſucceſſe in all Counſels, and
enterpriſes;</hi> wherefore in what eſtate ſoever,
their wanteth good Order, it is an evident
Argument, that Religion goes backward.</p>
            <p>11. I have ever held it for a kind of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
to omit the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mean laws, made
to prevent the effects of idleneſſe, &amp; then to
apply main extremity of the ſword, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
proling habit gotten by <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> vice comes to light.
No leſſe is the courſe uncharitable (with par-don
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47272:18"/>
for this preſumption be it ſpoken, when wee

            <p>He that is in miſery muſt be borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

but the ordinary meanes in his Word:
if that means, in many places of this Land be
wanting; of what Religion is it likelieſt, the
people will be? I ſuppoſe, that few men will
gainſay my aſſertion, that outward ſenſe will
direct them to Popery which is fuller of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants,
then of ſpirituall doctrine. And what
is the cauſe, that after ſo many yeares of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Goſpell, that the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſtill retaine a ſent of the <hi>Roman perfume?</hi>
The <hi>cauſe is, for that the formall obedience of
comming to Church, hath bin more expected,
then the inſtruction of private families; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Catechiſing is of great vſe, but the firſt
elements thereof are to be learnt at home: and</hi>
theſe, which we learn from our Parents, ſtick
moſt ſurely in our minds. What was the cauſe

By the order contained in the <hi>Booke of

but there is no ward againſt Popiſh Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtreſſes,
that infect the ſilly Infants while
they carry them in their Armes, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
me to ſuppoſe that the former propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to examine how Children and ſervants
are brought up; and truly to certifie the liſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47272:20"/>
of the Communicants, and Recuſants, will be
the readieſt meanes to let his Majeſty know
the yearly increaſe or decreaſe of the church
in every <hi>Dioceſſe:</hi> And whoſoever ſhall ſend
his children, or any of his <hi>Majeſties</hi> ſubjects,
to be placed in <hi>Monaſteries, or Seminary
Colledges,</hi> or Popiſhly to be brought up in
ſorraine parts: I thinke that for puniſhment
both the one &amp; the other, worthily might be
diſfranchiſed of the <hi>priviledges,</hi> due to natural
<hi>Engliſh-men;</hi> ſo far-forth, as any good by the
Lawes may deſcend to them: But not to be
exempted from the penalties thereof; or the
Regall juriſdiction of the Crowne. J know
well that contradiction is odious, and makes
a man ſeeme ambitious, to be thought more
underſtanding then others. In which caſe, the
<hi>Spanyard</hi> uſeth onely to terme him preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous,
whom he would call <hi>Foole,</hi> if civility
would beare it. <hi>But in my defence, I hope it
ſhall ſuffice againe, to revive my former prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation,
that Idiſcourſe by the way of propoſition,
rather then Arrogance of defining any thing:
with pardon therefore, may I be permitted to
ſay.</hi> That the firſt eaſie Law of xij<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. inflicted
on him that could not give a reaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
for his abſence from Church or Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
was one of the beſt Ordinances, that
hath hitherto bin enacted. But while wee
ſought to make new <hi>Statutes,</hi> ſavouring of
more ſeverity, we neglected the old, and were
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47272:21"/>
loath to execute the new: For it is a certaine
Rule, that whoſoever in policy will give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and yet ſeeme to ſuppreſſe a crime,
let him procure ſharpe Lawes to be proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
which are onely neceſſary for ſome
times, and rare occaſions to be put in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but not to be an ordinary worke, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day of the Weeke. Daily uſe likewiſe
teacheth us, that it is leſſe grievous to puniſh
by an old Law, then by a new: <hi>Forſomuch, as
Truth it ſelfe, ſeldome gets credit without
proofe, and it is hard to free the people of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that new Lawes are not rather invented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the particular perſons and purſes of men,
then againſt the corrupt manners.</hi> By force of
which reaſon, I am induced to conceive that
the old uſe of the Church, contained in good
nurture, and Eccleſiaſticall cenſures will
much more prevaile to muzzell Popery, then
any freſh deviſes whatſoever. Neither doe J
thinke it blame-worthy, to affirme that our
cauſe hath taken harme, by relying more on
the Temporall, then the Spirituall Armes.
For while we truſted that Capitall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſhould ſtrike the ſtroake; we have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
the meanes, which would, for the
moſt part, have diſcharged the need of ſuch
ſeverity. The <hi>Oath of Allegeance</hi> is not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
generally, to ſervants and meane Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
who if they had taken the <hi>Oath</hi> by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> might recoyle from it,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47272:21"/>
or change their opinion at leiſure, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ready meanes to diſcover their <hi>Leger-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine:
that Oath I feare will not bee often
preſsed, and to them that ſhift from place to
place, how can it be tendered?</hi> The principall
Papiſts now cover themſelves, in the crowde
of the multitude: but if we can diſcover the
affection of the <hi>multitude,</hi> they eaſily will be
unmasked, and being ſingled out, reſt aſhamed
of their nakedneſſe; which under correction
of better judgment, may be effected, if every
new commer, to inhabit in a Towne, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
newly entertained within a Weeke, or
xiiij. dayes, be cauſed to repaire to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
there in preſence of the <hi>Churchwardens,</hi>
and other honeſt men; to ſubſcribe unto ſuch
briefe and ſubſtantiall Articles concerning
Faith, and <hi>Allegeance,</hi> as ſhall be according to
Gods Word, and Juſtice, ordained to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
the <hi>ſheepe</hi> from the <hi>Goates.</hi> In forraine
Countries, every Hoſt is bound to bring his
Gueſt before an Officer; there to certifie
his name, with the occaſion of his comming,
&amp;intended time of his abode in thoſe parts;
and in caſe he ſtay longer, <hi>he muſt again renew
his Licence, ſo curious and vigilant: alſo are
they to keepe their Cities from infection, that
without a Certificate, witneſsing their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from wholſome places, they may not eſcape
the Lazeretto. No leſſe ought wee to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to prevent the contagion of our Soules,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:47272:22"/>
then other Nations are of their bodies, every
thing is hard, and ſcarcely pleaſing in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning:
But with time, ſome ſuch courſe
may be readily put in Execution: which I
propound rather as matter for better heads,
to worke on; then peremptorily to be inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
on in the ſame <hi>Termes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But leſt any charge me with <hi>Temerity;</hi> that
when I deſire to know the multitudes incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
by the meanes aforeſaid: I ſatisfie
my ſelfe with their <hi>Parrots</hi> Language, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
it knowes not what: I thinke it not
impertinent, to put them in mind, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
I have required inſtructions, <hi>both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
and ſubſequent;</hi> and am ever of the
mind, <hi>that though all this cannot be done at
once; yet it is neceſſary alwayes to be doing our
beſt: knowing, that not to goe forwards in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
is the ready way to goe backwards.</hi> It is
not the outward obedience of comming to
Church, that diſcovers the inward thought of
the heart: it is the confeſſion of the Tongue
that muſt utter theſe <hi>ſecrets. And where the
Curates are inſufficient, or the Pariſh great, I
wiſh they had Catechiſtes to aſsiſt them, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the Purſes of the Recuſants:</hi> which
Penſion being collected for Gods cauſe, will
free us of ſcandall; though it grieve them to
pay the ſpirituall Army, waged againſt their
owne <hi>Stratagems:</hi> ſurely by giving them
way in petty matters, they are growne to be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47272:22"/>
very maſterfull in their party: <hi>Plato</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
<hi>that the Popular ſtate proceeded from the
Licence, which the people took to make immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Applauſes in the Theaters:</hi> when, as by
arrogating that immunity, without contro e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in place of their Governors, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the <hi>Nobility</hi> to joyne with them in
the ſame paſſions, they thought their Heads
as worthy to governe, as any of thoſe that
were made out of the ſelfe-ſame mould:
In like manner, while we ſuffer ignorance o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
to maintaine ſuch petty glimpſes of
Popery, as are thought to be ſcarce worthy,
to be look't at, and in ſmall matters runne an
indifferent courſe, which neither make ſure
friends, nor feeble Foes; unawares they take
the bridle from us, and eate out Religion, as
it were by an inſenſible <hi>Gangrena.</hi>

            <p>To comprehend all things in a Law, which
are neceſſary to the Reformation, I neither
hold it profitable nor expedient; yet it is
diſcretion to provide for the moſt important:
ſmaller matters, whereof the Lawes ſpeake
not, are to be commended to the diſcretion
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47272:23"/>
of Parents, Maſters, and other reverent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who by example and advice, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
younglings, by education and cuſtome,
to obey the Lawes: eſpecially ſuch as are in
high place ought, in this behalfe, to be like
<hi>Caeſars Wife. Non ſolum crimine, ſed etiam cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis
ſuſpitione vacare,</hi> and with circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to behave themſelves; that the world
may conceive, in requiring obedience to God
and their Soveraigne, that they hold the
multitude rather for companions, then ſlaves:
if great men take another way, they may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
many by example; though by Words
they expreſſe not their concealed opinions;
<hi>Tace &amp; loquere, ſaid God to Moſes,</hi> it is the
ſpeech of the heart, which utters more then
words and ſyllables: And in our common
Lawes, it is held maintenance, when a great
Perſonage, onely by his preſence countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
a cauſe. Neither let us ſecure our ſelves
with this Argument: the Papiſts are plyable
in ſmall matters, <hi>ergo,</hi> they will yeeld in
greater; And becauſe they tooke no Armes
in 88. therefore it were needleſſe curioſity
to ſuſpect them now: for who knowes not,
that ſmall baites are uſed to take the greateſt
Fiſh, <hi>vt cum eſca una etiam hamus devoretur.</hi>
Warineſſe is the ſinewes of Wiſdome, and
nothing is more dangerous, then to be ſecure
in matters of State: Therefore for the Lawes
already made, I wiſh that the moſt effectuall
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47272:23"/>
of them, which leaſt concernes life, may be
executed; For better it were not to make
them, then by neglect to ſet them at liberty;
ſeeing that many offences there are, which
men would abſtaine from, if they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
but when a ſtrict commandement is
avoided without puniſhment, therout ſprings
an unbridled Licence, hardly to be reformed
by any rigour.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I ſay freely, that who ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his dayes by a naturall death, he ſhall be
ſubject to receive many mens doomes, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
particular offence; But when for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
ſake, a man triumpheth over the ſword,
that one eminent vertue razeth out the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of other errours, and placeth him, that
ſo dyeth, in Paradice; if common opinion
may be lawfully vouched; <hi>which glory having
many followers, and admirers, awaketh even dull
ſpirits to affect their footeſteps, and to ſell their
lives, for the maintenance of the ſame cauſe:</hi>
J need not envy the name of a Martyr to the
Jeſuit; for his cauſe if it be rightly weighed,
will blanch that title: but I deſire to have all
thoſe Lineaments defaced, which may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
that counterfeit Image, in proſecuting
of which purpoſe, if J have failed in my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and by confuſed handling intricated the
queſtion, J humbly requeſt, that a wiſe mans
verdit, may mitigate the heavines of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cenſure.
