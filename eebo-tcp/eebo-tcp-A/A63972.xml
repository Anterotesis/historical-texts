            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>PRithee, Old Friend, Shall I make bold to Ask,</l>
               <l>What <hi>Angry Stars</hi> have doom'd Thee to this Task?</l>
               <l>What Powers Sway'd thy <hi>Fancy?</hi> What thy <hi>Mind?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To Seek a Thing, so <hi>Plaguy hard to Find.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>First try thy Fate, see how such Projects hit;</l>
               <l>Find out something that's Parallel to it.</l>
               <l>Find out a <hi>CITY</hi> destitute of Vice;</l>
               <l>Find out that Spot, call'd, The Old <hi>Paradise</hi>:</l>
               <l>Find a <hi>French Courtier</hi> without Genteel Lyes,</l>
               <l>Or any <hi>English</hi> one that Gold denies.</l>
               <l>Find out a <hi>Beauty,</hi> and no <hi>Pride</hi> Lodg'd there;</l>
               <l>An <hi>Honest Thief,</hi> and Gen'rous <hi>Usurer</hi>;</l>
               <l>Find out the <hi>Unicorn,</hi> and <hi>Phoenix</hi> too,</l>
               <l>And from what Cause in Nature they first grew:</l>
               <l>When these are found, then we perhaps may see</l>
               <l>Some dark blind steps of <hi>Light-Heel'd-Honesty.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I once was Led, by Curious Thoughts, to know,</l>
               <l>On what Strange Soil this <hi>Honesty</hi> did grow:</l>
               <l>But those I Askt for it, return'd me No.</l>
               <l>I from the <hi>Lawyer</hi> first, Direction sought,</l>
               <l>And begg'd his Aid to this my New-born Thought.</l>
               <l>Tush, Tush, quoth he, Our Trade is to Adjust</l>
               <l>Nice Points of Law, and Doubtfull-Deeds of Trust,</l>
               <l>By which we make Men Poor, but seldom Just.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Doctor</hi> felt my <hi>Pulse,</hi> quoth he, Thou'rt <hi>Mad</hi>;</l>
               <l>Goe <hi>Bleed,</hi> use <hi>Hellebore,</hi> and Shave thy <hi>Head.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Then to a <hi>Priest</hi> I went, and told my Want;</l>
               <l>Who Fairly Answer'd, He knew nothing on't.</l>
               <l>Nay then (quoth I) if this is own'd by All,</l>
               <l>I'll Vse it Sparingly, or not at All:</l>
               <l>I'll <hi>Talk</hi> on't too, like others, without Ground;</l>
               <l>The <hi>Crowd</hi> they'll <hi>Stare, Believe,</hi> and so't goes round.</l>

What is this thing, that Men so Lamely Know?</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>This Honesty?</hi> so much Pretended to.</l>

               </l>
               <l>This Truth all know; and some Men to their Sorrow:</l>
               <l>One's <hi>Honest</hi> now, perhaps a <hi>Knave</hi> to Morrow.</l>
               <l>Then what's the <hi>Honesty</hi> in Common Vogue?</l>
               <l>When he that hath it, Proves next Day a <hi>ROGUE.</hi>

               <l>Our <hi>Bard</hi> Confounded with the City Cheats,</l>
               <l>Like Pious <hi>Lot,</hi> from <hi>Sodom</hi> he Retreats;</l>
               <l>Where he his <hi>Goddess,</hi> or his Fate may find,</l>
               <l>Nor casts one Unauspicious Look behind:</l>
               <l>He Walks a-foot along the Dusty Road,</l>
               <l>Where Waggons Groan beneath their Mighty Load;</l>
               <l>Where, from the Towns on <hi>Albion</hi>'s distant Coast,</l>
               <l>Men, to <hi>Augusta,</hi> Travel, like an Host:</l>
               <l>When <hi>Sol</hi>'s Hot Station did oppose the North,</l>
               <l>And, through the Air, Warm Beams were darted forth.</l>

Beneath a Shrub our <hi>Poet</hi> lays him down,</l>
               <l>To Ease his Limbs, and pass the Heat at Noon;</l>
               <l>No Dainties here Grace his Contented Board,</l>
               <l>But what the Brambles and the Hedge afford.</l>
               <l>What Liquor Nature had created first,</l>
               <l>Did from the Brook allay his Heat and Thirst.</l>
               <l>With Gentle Slumbers, and with Ease Refresht,</l>
               <l>(Not Men, on Downy Beds, more sweetly Rest;)</l>
               <l>He Travels o'r the Melancholy Heath,</l>
               <l>And Views the Valleys, and the Heards beneath;</l>
               <l>Till <hi>Sol</hi> Retir'd unto his Place of Rest,</l>
               <l>And all in Darkness the <hi>Horizon</hi> Drest:</l>
               <l>Our <hi>Poet</hi> now a Lonesome Wood had found,</l>
               <l>Beneath whose Boughs he lays him on the Ground:</l>
               <l>Unto his <hi>Goddess</hi> first his Prayers he made,</l>
               <l>Whilst Birds did Sing their <hi>Vespers</hi> o're his Head.</l>
               <l>No Beast of Prey disturb'd his soft Repose,</l>
               <l>But in the Morning to his Toil he rose.</l>
               <l>Long o're the Hills and Mountains he Complains,</l>
               <l>And makes Enquiry of the Pagan Swains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>Some little notice of the Swains he had,</l>
               <l>His <hi>Goddess Honesty</hi> that Way was Fled.</l>
               <l>

One Evening, as he past a Loansome Plain,</l>
               <l>Scorch't with the Sun, and seldom Blest with Rain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>Hither for Herbage Beasts do ne're Repair,</l>
               <l>Nor will the Soil reward the Tillers Care<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>A Little Village near the Plain there stood,</l>
               <l>Contiguous to a Small, but Lofty Wood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>Like some, more happy, Unfrequented Grove,</l>
               <l>Where Turtles Wooe, and Swains Commence their Love:</l>
               <l>Whether Inspir'd, or Destitute of Food,</l>
               <l>He Steers his Course by the obliging Wood;</l>
               <l>Beneath the Shadow of whose Spreading Trees,</l>
               <l>Guarded by <hi>Cottagers,</hi> his <hi>Goddess</hi> Sees.</l>
               <l>Though her Mean State Proclaim'd aloud Despair,</l>
               <l>She still was Charming, and her Features Fair<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>He made Obeysance at his <hi>Goddess</hi> Feet,</l>
               <l>And She did kindly her Adorer Greet:</l>
               <l>Dear Youth! She says, From whence proceeds this Toil?</l>
               <l>What makes thee Ravage this Deserted Isle?</l>
               <l>Long I Her Cities and her Towns have Left,</l>
               <l>Of all their <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Honesty</hi> Bereft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>To seek New Converts in the Thickest Shades<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </l>
               <l>Free from the Crowds the Noisy Town <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Honesty</hi> is every where the same,</l>
               <l>Though Courts may hate <hi>Her,</hi> nor <hi>Her</hi> Worth Proclaim.</l>
               <l>Each Rising-Sun does Fresher Charmes Engage;</l>
               <l>She's not Decay'd, but more Improv'd by Age.</l>
               <l>Then Sit Down, Youth, and See my Homely Court,</l>
               <l>What Humble Pageantries my Pomp Support.</l>
