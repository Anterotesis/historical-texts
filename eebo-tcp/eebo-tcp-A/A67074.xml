            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT's Storied that the <hi>Athenians,</hi> were a Politick people, and car'd not that their Women ſhould bare away the ſpoiles of their Eſtate; who therefore had Officers on purpoſe, who were to order the Apparel and Geſtures for Women, and and to take ſingular care, that not one might wear any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming her place or degree, and thoſe were called <hi>Gyneconomi.</hi> Now in this our Age, ſuch a Committee is very much wanted, to ſettle the Affairs of the <hi>Females</hi> in our Kingdom, to keep them in their Reſpective Limits and due order.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ephori,</hi> to Correct the <hi>Spartan</hi> Extravagances had the like power. <hi>Licurgus's</hi> Laws for Youth, were ſo Remarkably choice, that the very Reading of them would make us Reflect on our Impudencies, and reduce us to ſo high degrees of Civility and Modeſty, with the people of that City, that paſſing through the Streets on their Lawful Occaſions, they wrapt themſelves up in their Cloaks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaſt they ſhould prattle to every one they met, or Gaze up and down, acting the <hi>Peacock</hi>: By the Practice of which method, the <hi>Maſculine</hi> Sex, excelled in all Baſhfulneſs and Gravity; the principal Perfections of the <hi>Feminine,</hi> their Voices were no more heard than Statues of Stone, neither their

Damoſels more Chaſt, than thoſe young<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Men walked in the Streets. Now this may make thee Bluſh, and throw down your lofty head to the Ground (though not ſo exalted with horns to the Heavens as formerly) conſider the rudeneſs, wild and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt Geſtures, Staring, Gaping, the Idle and Diſſolute Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the very Virgins and Ladies, who ſet themſelves with their Naked Breaſts, Necks, and Sepulchred Bodies, to be pick't up and Gazed on, to incend (as if not enough) kindled the Sparkles of the Fire of Luſt; till at laſt it's blowen up to a perfect Conſuming Flame. They ſtand, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>In the Corner of the Streets, turning their backs upon every Paſſanger,</hi> as it were to ſignifie, they'l Proſtitute themſelves at his pleaſure. There ſtarted out a Sect early in the Church called <hi>(Paterniani)</hi> poſſibly of the filthy Fountain of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who's opinion was; that the Upper parts of the Body were really made by GOD; but the Lower parts from the Girdle were made by the Devil: They grew ſo fond of their fancy, they imagined gave them a Liberty, to do with the Devils part as they Liſted, providing they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Chaſt the reſt to GOD: It's to be feared this Hereſie has got footing inſenſibly in the Land, Witneſſed by daily Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and taken a general hold, Encroaching beyond it's bounds, preſuming to make Invaſions on the poor remains it has left unto GOD, ſcarce left him an Eye, to behold his works of Wonder, or a hand to perform Acts of Chriſtianity, or a Lip to ſhew forth his Praiſes. The Tongue (the Trumpet of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Glory) is now ſet on the Fire of Hell (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſays) Belching out the Infernal Vapours with <hi>Mons Aetua</hi>; as furiouſly as the Tayle is Reaking with the Smoak and Streams of Impurity and filth. This is moſt ſad and Lamentable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, that our Ladies (ſo far from obeying the Apoſtle) yeild the more abundant Honour to the leſs Honourable parts, which theſe Hereticks ſay were made by the Devil: and become ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally Neglectful of God's, that (like a Manſion in a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or a Houſe on the top of a Solitary Mountain) they Deſert

it all bare and unfurniſhed, forſaking it utterly naked to Shift for its poor ſelf as it can, and ſhewing to all men how ready they are to Surrender Poſſeſſion to the Devil. Oh 'tis Pitty, that Women ſhould be ſuch Hereticks, but their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Necks and Fairly open Breaſts, are clear Demonſtrations of their Apoſtacy, ſhame, and Guilt. Yet I do except in Verity and upon Sound Equity, that there's Ladies ſo Graciouſly Virtuous and Illuſtrious with the Beautifull Ornaments of the Soul, that they Bluſh and are aſhamed of the Immoralities and Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of many of their Sex, giving Laſcivious precedents to others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adamiani</hi> I called them, becauſe partly like unto them Hereticks, that went Naked, by that Heretick, who called himſelf <hi>Adamus,</hi> and Feigned to be the Son of GOD: Commanding all people to go Naked, which became a great inlet to Wickedneſs.</p>

The Men of our Age I hope are ſo prudent and Crafty, as not to Buy Wares at their Publick Shops: Knowing by means of an Adultrous woman, a Man is brought to a Piece of Bread.

In our Degenerate Age there's ſuch a falling from the truth and Rules of Mortality and good manners (that's inconſiſtent with the Nature of Holineſs) they may have but cold hopes of ever Entering the Gates of the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but rather, (as they are now Harneſſed) be whirl'd unto the Dark Chambers of <hi>Acheron.</hi> Surely our Womens Practices and Faſhions do not agree with the Complexions of their Progenitors, neither their Faces, Breaſts, Heart, and Habits are alike: If thoſe under the Law ſend out their Cryes to you under the Goſpel, to be Civil, Holy, Meek, and Chaſt, and can echo back again to them, that you are ſo, and Clad in the ſame Livery, this would be your greateſt Glory and Honour, and happy Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: But alas! you make Religion vary in its Form, as you in your Faſhions, and to be Inconſtant in its Precepts, and you are in Faithfulneſs to them. Ladies the Attire and Spirit of an Harlot (Guilty of ſuch Apoſtacies and Gayieties, which only had allowancies by the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Law) cannot expect the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of a Pure and Chaſt Virgin: Harlotry Dreſs (having no Favour in Heaven, but only the Wedding-Garment of Fidelity and Purity) will make your Souls Shake and Tremble, far greater than ever your Shoulders under the Perſecution of Stormy Bluſtering Winds.

            <p>The evil of all this is in our Women, and are Plaguie Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous to the World: Their Faſhions give bad Examples to other Nations, we are all apt to <hi>London</hi> Faſhion, to follow either good or bad, and GOD knows, if that Whoreiſh Dreſs of Women be good, ſetting themſelves out to be Pick't and Admired by poor Mankind, with the Enchantments of the Painted naked Breaſts.

I ſay, theſe are ready to follow the <hi>London</hi> Faſhion, but not ſo apt as we do the <hi>French,</hi> Apeing them every way to our great ſhame, hurt, and Diſhonour. And ſo it is, if we conſult Hiſtory, <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> then King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> one time this Humour infected him and his Subjects, of attiring themſelves after the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all the Noble Perſons and Gentlemen practiſing nothing ſo much, than to ſpeak the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> Language (which it ſeems is very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant and Expreſſive) with the ſame Ambition as we do the <hi>French,</hi> between whom and them there was no great Natural Kindneſs, but a very bitter Antipathy, hating the Perſon whoſe Language they loved. It pleaſed GOD, that <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> Dying without any Iſſue,, and the Crown lying at the Stake, as the Golden Ball for every pretender, to venture at, who but King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Caſtile</hi> run faireſt for it, and with an eaſie ſtreach got it ſet on his head, to the general ſorrow, but little Redreſs of the Diſcontented Subjects, to whom afterwards he proved no favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Prince.

What Application ſhall we make of this to poor <hi>Britain,</hi> that our Garbs, and Ladies Dreſſes, are not only of the <hi>French</hi> Faſhion, but the very Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No proper handſome young Men, can be picked from the Sons of our Yeomen and Inferiour Gentry to make <hi>Vale de Chambres</hi> to our Gallants!
