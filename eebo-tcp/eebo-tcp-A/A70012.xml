            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

With a Call to all people to come out of Babilon leaſt they be made partakers of her plagues.</head>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>MAny, yea very many have been the warnings and admonitions which the Lord hath given unto the Prieſts of this generation, yet have they not repented and turned unto him, but have hardned their hearts againſt his reproof, and have gone on in their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and rebellion againſt him; even provoking him to pour down his Judgements upon them, and utterly to cut them off from being a people any more for ever. Long hath he waited upon them, to be gracious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; and long hath he born with them, that at length (if it were poſſible) they might ſee and be made ſenſible of their great unkindneſs, and monſtruous ingratitude wherewith they have continually repaid his great goodneſs and loving-kindneſs unto them; and yet how loath hath he been to ſtir up all his anger againſt them! how unwilling to deſtroy them!</p>
            <p>And now once more hath he ſtretched out his golden Scepter unto them, and hath raiſed up his Spirit in the meaneſt of his ſervants (ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his mighty voice through an earthen veſſell, that all the glory may be unto himſelf) to warn them yet once more of the eminent perill
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65511:2"/>
which hangs over their heads, and will ſuddenly drop upon them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they repent and return unto him. O that they would hear that their ſouls might live: for nothing but ſpeedy and unfeigned repentance, can divert the wrath of God from falling on their heads.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath in tender mercy unto them, given them a day to work in, but alas they have wrought the works of darkneſs; he expected they ſhould bring forth fruit unto him, but they have been fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in nothing but in doing evill. He viſited them in his tender love, and would have gathered them under bis wing, as a hen doth her chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, but they would not. Hitherto they have ſlighted the many offers of his love unto them, and have not regarded the day of their viſitation, but now their day flitteth away apace, and the ſhort Span of time which yet remains to them, paſſeth away as a ſhadow, and will ſoon be gone o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their heads; and then will they feel the Lord to be as juſt in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as mercifull in ſo long ſparing them: for he will ariſe in his might and viſit them in his fury, and their place ſhal be found no more.</p>
            <p>The perſecuting Spirit is a notable badge of Antichriſt. This Spirit hath all along accompanied them. They have run out of one form into an other, and out of that into a third, and ſtill this Spirit hath gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them. It appeared in the Biſhops againſt the Non-conformiſts, it appeared in the Presbyters againſt the Lord's people here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and it appeared in the Independents againſt God's faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Antichriſt hath long ſate (and ſtill doth ſit) as God in the Temple of God (I do not mean in the outward Temples, although he ſits there alſo) but now is the day coming, and the hour is even at hand, of the manifeſtation of the righteous judgements of God, upon all the wicked, and upon all the diſobedient; and then ſhall that wicked one be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the Spirit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſs of his coming. He that teſtifieth theſe things, ſaith ſurely I come quickly, Amen, even ſo, come Lord Jeſus.</p>

            <q>
               <p>HOul, houl you Merchants of Babilon, for the time is coming wherein none ſhall buy your merchandize. Houl and roar you children of Babylon, for your mother the falſe woman, the great harlot, the ſcarlet Whore ſhal ſhortly be ſtripped out of all her falſe coverings,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65511:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
out of all her harlots attire, and ſhall be diſcovered to the eyes of all people; nakedneſs and ſhame ſhall be upon her, and horrour and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon all her children. Lament and mourn you ſons of Belial, ſhriek and cry you Prieſt of Baal, for ſudden deſtruction is coming upon you, and utter deſolation ſhal ſpeedily overtake you, except you ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unfeignedly repent, and turn to the Lord with all your hearts, from whom you have gone a whoring even from the leaſt to the greateſt: I ſay except you ſpeedily repent, and turn from the wickedneſs of your hearts and hands, you ſhal utterly be cut off, and that right ſoon; for the Lord is ariſen to fight for Sion, and hath ſtretched out his mighty arm, to deliver his people from the cruelty, rage, and oppreſſion of all their enemies and perſecutors. Yet a little while and the cry ſhall be, Babilon the great is fallen, is fallen, the fall thereof ſhall make a great noiſe, the ſound thereof ſhal go through the earth, and ſhal ſtrike terror to all thoſe who admire and love her beauty: fear, amazement aſtoniſhment of Spirit ſhall ſeize on all thoſe that traffick with her; fire ſhall conſume her inward parts, howlings and roarings ſhall bee heard in all her quarters: the Prieſts <hi>(her Merchants)</hi> ſhall wring their hands for grief, and gnaw their tonges for pain and anguiſh; for now ſhall their trade be utterly loſt, now ſhal their merchandize utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fail them, the great Whore, <hi>(their mother)</hi> ſhall be ſtripped, and her nakedneſs ſhall appear to their ſhame and torment. Houl, houl you Idol-ſhepherds, for utter deſolation is coming upon ye, yes, ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſhall overtake ye, even as an armed man ſhal it come upon ye, and as travail upon a woman with child, and there ſhall be none to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver ye. For thus ſaith the Lord God of power, I, even I will take vengeance upon ye, and will recompence upon your heads the reward of your doings, for you have erred from my pure fear, and have daily grieved my pure ſpirit, you have crucified the Juſt in your ſelves and in others, and have hardned your hearts againſt my reproof, refuſing to let my people go, to worſhip me according as I have commanded them. How often, <hi>ſaith the Lord,</hi> have I warned ye by my Prophets, riſing up early and ſending them unto ye! yet have you rejected my counſel, and would have none of my reproof; but have dealt deſpitefully with my meſſengers, beating and ſtoning ſome, impriſoning ſome, diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring ſome, and ſlaying others. Yea, you have often rebelled againſt me <hi>ſaith the Lord,</hi> and have even kicked the heel againſt me; you have ſold your ſelves to act wickedneſs, and to commit fornication with the Whore of Babilon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have run with delight into her bed of Whoredems, and have gredily drunk down her cup of Fornications. How
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65511:3"/>
often <hi>ſaith the Lord,</hi> have you endeavoured to violate my peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences! How often have you exalted your ſelves againſt me, preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly attempting to thruſt me out of my ſeat, &amp; to make your ſelves Lords of mine heritage, by impoſing laws upon my peoples conſciences, which is my prerogative alone to do! You have ravened from my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in your ſelves <hi>ſaith the Lord,</hi> and thoſe that will not run to the ſame exceſs of riot with you, are even devoured by you. <hi>Lo, thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> you have blinded the peoples eyes, you have taken away the key of knowledge, you will not enter in your ſelves, and thoſe that would enter in you forbid: you have ſet up Idolatry inwardly in your hearts, and outwardly alſo in your Idol-Temples: you have worſhipped the Beaſt; and imbraced the Whore, and are crept into a dead loathſome form and way of worſhip which ſhe hath provided for you. And like Iſrael of old you offer unto me the lame, the blind, the imperfect Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, inſtead of ſound, unſpotted, perfect, pure ſacrifices, but away with your ſacrifices <hi>ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp; put away your vain Oblations from before me; for your Sacrifice of praiſe is abominable in my ſight, the ſtink of your incenſe is loathſome in my noſtrils, your offerings are unſavoury and irkeſome unto me, and all your praying and preaching, your preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded duties and ordinances are a weight and a burthen upon my ſoul, and my ſpirit is grieved with them <hi>ſaith the Lord:</hi> therefore I will caſt you off <hi>ſaith the Lord,</hi> even becauſe of the wickedneſs that is found within your gates, and the blood of the Innocent which is found upon your skirts, and becauſe you hate to be reproved, and ſtrengthen your ſelves againſt me <hi>ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider this well <hi>ſaith the Lord,</hi> did I not caſt off my choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Jews for the ſame iniquities which are found to abound amongſt you? and ſhal I now ſpare you, O you rebellious and ſtiffnecked genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! what are you better then Iſrael of old, that I ſhould paſs by that in you, for which I caſt them off? You have propheſied lies in my name, <hi>ſaith the Lord,</hi> you have run but I never ſent you, you have ſpoken a divination of your own brains, you have ſtolen the Word from your neighbour, and therewith have you traded O you Merchants of Babilon You have devoured my people <hi>ſaith the Lord,</hi> and with feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed words have made merchandiſe of ſouls; you have drawn away my people from my ſtatutes and ordinances, which by the finger of my ſpirit are written in their hearts and you have brought them again under a yoke of bondage, which neither they nor their fathers were able to bear. You have carried my people captive into <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and have hindred their paſſage into the ſpirituall Canaan. You have defiled my living Temples <hi>ſaith the Lord,</hi> and joined them unto harlots, and are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65511:3"/>
crept into houſes which the Beaſt ſet up for the Babiloniſh Whore to ſit in.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Ah fooliſh people! think you that the living eternal God wil be worſhipped in houſes made of ſtones, or will be found there? hath he not ſaid <hi>that he dwelleth not in Temples made with hands but the Temple which he dwelleth in is a living Temple, and the worſhip which he accepteth is in the Spirit and in the Truth?</hi> but this Temple you have defiled, this worſhip you have apoſtatized from, you are gotten into the Whores Temple, and are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the beaſt inſtead of the living God. O what ſhall I ſay unto you, you diſobedient people! What could the Lord have done for you that he hath not done? Did he not about 100 years ago rend the thick vail of darkneſs (wherein the miſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity did then work) from off the eyes of many of your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and gave them a little glimmering of his light to walk in? And did he not (as it were) take them by the hand, and lead them out of the City Babilon, the mother of harlots; and gave them his Spirit to be their leader? but alas, they rebelled againſt their leader; and having once deſpiſed and contemned the light in their own conſciences, how ſuddenly did darkneſs (thick darkneſs) overſhadow them again! and then how quickly were they run back into the Subburbs of Babilon again! yea, and preſt hard to have entred the city again, and doubtleſs they had prevailed, had not the Lord in love and pity to them, overthrown them.</p>
            <p>And after that the Biſhops had had their day, and that the curtains of the night began to be drawn upon them: Oh how clearly did the Lord manifeſt himſelf unto many of you! how did he open your eyes, and let you ſee the groſſeneſs, deadneſs and emptineſs of that form wherein the Biſhops had long held you? O how did he raiſe up in many of you a Spirit of Prayer and of ſupplication, to groan and cry mightily for deliverance, and that the ſeed might be redeemed out of bondage, and from under the yoke of the oppreſſor! And was there not in many of you a living, freſh deſire and panting after God and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of his preſence begotten, and for ſome time preſerved? Oh why did you ſwerve from it? did he not draw you (for then you were willing to follow him) out of Epiſcopacy, and give you his pure fear to walk in? and did you not Vow to him in your hearts and before men, that you would walk in his fear and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65511:4"/>
be guided by his Spirit? O that you had ſo done) &amp; did you not make a ſolemn Covenant both with God &amp; men, that you would utterly aboliſh &amp; extirpate Epiſcopacy? &amp; did you not confirm that Covenant with reitterated Engagements, Proteſtations and Oaths? &amp; wil you now in the revolution of 20 years, wheel round about again, and take up a falſe reſt in that dead, empty, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome form? Ah, <hi>who hath bewitched you that ye ſhould not obey the Truth?</hi> what, do you not plainly ſee that it bends to its mother Babilon from whence it came? and will you run again into Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon? were not your ſtomacks once burthened with Epiſcopacy, and did you not ſpew it up? and will you now turn back again and lick up your old vomit? Oh, do not ſo; do not ſo, do not run wilfully into deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Oh the exceeding weight and guilt which lies upon the Prieſts of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! for of them hath this people learned to break their Vows, to break their Proteſtations, to break their Engagements and to violate their Oaths; none ſo forward now to plead for Babylon, to fight for Babilon as they: they have drawn the people from ſerving the living God, and have cauſed them to ſerve ſtrange Gods, even graven Images, faſhioned with the graving tools of their own wicked inventions, and framed in the mould of their vain imaginations, one while they ſet up Epiſcopacy, another while Presbyterie; and he that will not fall down and worſhip the Image which they have ſet up, is he not forthwith caſt into the fiery furnace of their cruelty and perſecution? but for theſe things is the Lord coming upon them, and will pour out the vialls of his wrath upon them; verily a day of ſad calamity ſhall ſuddenly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, and there ſhall be none to help or pity them.</p>
            <p>Oh, the exceeding unutterable love which the Lord hath extended to this Nation! how often O you Prieſts hath the Lord warned you, both by his Spirit in your conſciences, and alſo by his ſervants whom he hath dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed up, and ſent unto you to reprove your deadneſs and barrennſs: but alas you have ſtill gone on in your rebellion, and quarrelled with the meſſengers which the Lord hath ſent unto you: they have either ſeemed too mean and contemptible in your ſight to be taken notice of, or their meſſage hath ſeemed too harſh for you to bear: and thus have you deſpiſed the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers which he hath ſent, and ſlighted the many offers of his love unto you. Oh how ready hath he always been to ſhowre down his mercies upon you! and how unworthily have you requited ſo great love! how gently did he at firſt ſhake the Biſhops, and after that more roughly, before he quite over threw them! yet would they not take warning.

O I ſay, ſpeedily repent you of your wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do good,</hi> for your moment of time wil ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly paſs away, <hi>the Bridegroom will come, and the door shall be shut;</hi> and then though you knock and cry aloud, yet ſhall you not be ſuffered to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but your anſwer ſhall be, <hi>Depart from me you workers of iniquity, I know you not.</hi> And it wil not avail you then to ſay, Lord we have propheſied in thy Name; for hitherto <hi>you have propheſied lyes, and have ſpoken a divination of your own brains, you have preached for hire and filthy lucre, and like a troop of Robbers have you murthered by conſent; and in Babylon have you made merchandize of ſouls.</hi> And becauſe of theſe things is the Lord ariſen in Night and Power, to plead with you; therefore humble your ſelves ſpeedily before the Lord, and return unto him with broken hearts, and contrite ſpirits. O turn in, turn in unto Chriſt the Light, who lighteth every man that cometh into the world; obey his Light in your own conſciences, <hi>which Light is ſufficient to lead you unto God:</hi> Follow the leadings and motions of his holy Spirit in your ſelves, and leave every one free to do the like; oppreſs not the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of any, but let all weights and burdens be taken off, and leave the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple free to worſhip God, where, when, and how himſelf ſhall command them. And ceaſe any longer to deceive ſouls, or to traffick any longer with the Whore of <hi>Babylon:</hi> for verily for theſe things the Lord God will viſit, and if you wilfully perſiſt in your rebellion againſt him, you ſhall not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the ſtroke of his Juſtice, but his indignation and fury ſhall break out upon you, and ſhal utterly conſume you from off the earth. <hi>O you Prieſts, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this thing, and be not ſtout-hearted againſt the Lord, neither reject the Meſſage which he hath ſent you: For behold, I call both Heaven and Earth, both Men and Angels to witneſs againſt you, that I have delivered unto you the Meſſage of the Lord, which if you reject, his Plagues shall be your portion.</hi>

               <hi>Babylon</hi> the great is falling, is falling, the Whore, the great Whore (with whom the Kings of the earth have committed Fornication, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched the Nations with the cup of her Sorceries) ſhall be deſtroyed, and that ere it be long; her Scarlet coverings ſhall be torn off, and her fleſh ſhall be burnt with fire; her Merchandize ſhall decay, her Traffick ſhall fail her, her children ſhall howl and roar, for grief and anguiſh of ſpirit ſhall come upon them; all her Officers and Attendants ſhall lament and mourn bitterly for her; her Prieſts and her Prophets, her Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Deacons and Deans; her Parſons, Rectors, Chaplains, Vicars and Curates, ſhall ſit down and bewail for the deſtruction of their Mother, and ſhall ſigh and lament for the miſery that is coming upon them. For this ſhall be the judgement of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) in one day ſhall her Plagues come upon her, <hi>death, and mourning, and famine, and she shall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly burnt with fire;</hi> for great is the Lord God who judgeth her.

They ſhall fall as ſhe falls, they ſhall periſh as ſhe periſheth even from the higheſt pinacles of her temples ſhall they precipitately tumble down, and be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her ruine. Inſtead of her ſoft perfumed beds, ſhall a bed of torment be prepared for them; and inſtead of her ſweet delicious potions, which out of her golden Cup they drank, ſhall the pure wrath of the Lord be given them (without any mixture of mercy or pity) in the Cup of his burning fury; the Vials of his Wrath ſhall be poured out upon them, rottenneſs ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their bones, their memory ſhall rot, ſtink, and be loathſome unto the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round about them, and they ſhal be tormented with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of the holy Angels, and in the preſence of the Lamb for ever and for ever; and the day haſtens wherein this ſhall be accompliſhed: the Lord hath ſaid it and it ſhall aſſuredly come to paſs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>Come out of her, come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues:</hi> For her ſins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembred her iniquities. Make haſte out of her, O people, and eſcape for your lives, ſtay not in all the plain, but eſcape to the Mountain, leaſt you be conſumed; run no longer from hill to mountain, &amp; from mountain to hill, wandering about like ſheep without a ſhepherd; but eſcape quickly unto <hi>that Mountain which shall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the top of the Mountains, and ſhall be exalted above the hills.</hi> And take heed that you look not back; <hi>Remember</hi> Lot's <hi>Wife. Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out from the midſt of her, caſt away from you all your tranſgreſsions whereby ye have tranſgreſſed, and make ye a new heart, and a new ſpirit; for why will ye dye, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O ye Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> hear the Word of the Lord concerning ye: <hi>Wo unto ye, Wo unto ye from the Lord God, for you have gone in the way of</hi> Cain, <hi>and ran greedily after the error of</hi> Balaam <hi>for reward, and are like to perish in your gainſaying as did</hi> Core. <hi>You drink of the beſt, and feed of the fat, but this know aſſuredly, that the fatted beaſt is for the ſlaughter: you clothe of the fineſt of the Fleece, and like greedy wolves ye devour the Flock; you cauſe the people to err, you lead the ſimple out of the way, &amp; the blind into the ditch: you have blaſphemed my Name, &amp; defiled my Temples, joyning your ſelves unto Idols, yet you are not ashamed to lean upon the Lord, ſaying, is not the Lord amongſt us, none evil ſhall come upon us?</hi> What! ſhall not the Lord viſit for theſe things? yea verily, for theſe things will the Lord God viſit, he will bring you down into the Valley of <hi>Jehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> and will plead with you in the valley of deciſion, and the ſlain of the Lord ſhall be many.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But peace shall be to Sion, and to the whole Iſrael of God, and there ſhall be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make them afraid, for this is the Word of the Lord concerning them, Say unto the Righteous, that it ſhall be well with him; for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings.</hi>
