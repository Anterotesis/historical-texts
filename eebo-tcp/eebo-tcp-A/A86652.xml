         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the immortall light: and take heed of looking back at the pleaſures of ſin you have formerly lived in, but wait upon the pure light of Chriſt Jeſus in patience, that ſo you may ſee the enmity which is againſt God, and it ſlain in you daily: that ſo you may ſee him that is the Saviour of the ſoule, and take heed of rebelling againſt the Lord who hath given you a meaſure of his true light, to lead you from ſin if you love it unto righteouſneſſe, from whence it comes, even from the righteous Judge of all the world, who judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every man out of the Book of his conſcience: and ſo prize the everlaſting love of God to your ſoules, that you may ſee him who lives for ever.</p>
            <p>And all Babes who are born again, who have ſuffered the pangs of death: and know the indignation of the Lord againſt ſin, and the terrour of the Lord againſt the man of ſin, who have roared for the diſquietneſſe of your hearts, who have born the indignation of the Lord, and are come to the giving forth of the Law, where there is thundring and earthquakes, and terrour, and great haile, and fire, and ſmoke, even ſuch as was not ſince the beginning, in ſo much that you could not hear his voyce and live, nor ſee his face and live.</p>
            <p>Stand ſtill in patience, and let it have its perfect work in you, and bear the indignation, ye that are in it; if you endure the tribulation with patience, hope you will ſee, and a time of refreſhment will come: endure the Croſſe that the mortall, and earthly, and carnall may be judged, and the ground ſhaken and taken away, and that you may ſee the living hope to ſtay your minds upon.</p>
            <p>And yee who are enlivened, and doth witneſſe the Law of righteouſneſſe ſet up in you, which is a Schoolmaſter, and keeps in the fear, ſtand in it, and keep in the fear low, in ſoberneſſe and calmneſſe, and then you will ſee your hearts purified daily, and the curſed nature judged, which is out of its courſe, and it bridled and ſubjected: and the Law which is pure, and holy, and eternall, which ſtands for ever in power and force againſt the tranſgreſſour, to judge all unrighteouſneſſe: and ſo wait that you may ſee

the Lyon tamed, and the wild Heifer yoked, and the yoke of Chriſt born: and the wild Colt tamed by him, upon which never man ſate before: then and not till then is <hi>Hoſanna</hi> ſung.</p>
            <p>And all wait in your meaſures, dear Babes, that the milk of the word you may ſee, and be nouriſhed by it, and grow up as living branches about the Table of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And all you Young men and Virgins, that know virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, keep your virgin-you in whom the Prince of this world is judged and caſt out: and the righteous Law of God revealed and given forth, in which you ſtand and walk and hath peace, from him who is the Law-giver and Judge: who hath ſaved you from your iniquities, and blotted out your ſins for his owne name ſake: You who knowes the living water and Spirit of which you are born again, and witneſſes the birth which enters into the Kingdome of God, where no mortall or unclean Beaſt can come. Keep in the life and power of God which limits all, and chaines all under, that the life of the Son of God may live and ſpeak in you, and be bould: in the dread of God ſtand: and that which leads into ſlavery keep out.</p>
            <p>And now being made partakers of his everlaſting love, walk worthy of his love, and of the high calling whereunto you are called, who hath created you in Chriſt Jeſus unto holineſſe and righteouſneſſe for ever: that to the praiſe of his grace which you are ſaved by: by which you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the remiſſion of ſins, and an inheritance amongſt them that are ſanctified: ſo wait in the living hope, and the living faith, in which God is well pleaſed, in which you ask and receive of him, and are accepted of our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father. And this faith ye know, which is a preſent power, and a ſhield againſt all temptations, and a Helmet, and as a Fortreſſe by which ye are preſerved, ſafe ſtanding in it, and putting it on in the day of triall.</p>
            <p>My dear brethren of the everlaſting kindred, and heires of the everlaſting promiſe: wait all in patience, having received an earneſt of the Inheritance that never fades away: to the end abide, in the fathers counſell, and at

wiſedomes gate. Yee know what I ſay. I write not unto you, becauſe you know not the truth, but becauſe you know and are made free in your meaſures by him who is the truth and the way: in which all our fathers and you alſo have obtained a good report: even of all the houſhold of faith: and take heed of the glory of the world, and look not at hardſhip: for verily all the ſuffering is not worthy to be compared to that glory which is revealed and to be revealed unto all that wait and abide in patience and faithfullneſſe unto the end: but be yee as good ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, endure hardſhip, that you may receive the end of your hope, and the everlaſting prise, and the purchaſed poſſeſſion, and the Crowne of glory which God will give unto you in his owne day: which is coming on towards you, if you continue in the hope, in the faith, and in the love unfained, which thinks no ill: by which and in which love we have victory over the grave, ſin, and death: which he hath freely ſhed abroad in our hearts, unto whom be everlaſting praiſe for ever and ever: to him which was dead, and is alive, and lives for evermore, the mediator of the new Covenant of life and peace, in which we have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe freely to the Throne of Grace, and are accepted in him who is the condemnation of all the World, who hate the light: but your life the light of the World God bleſſed for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>And all you fathers and Elders and honourable women, who are not a few, whoſe bones and ſinewes are filled with marrow and fatneſſe; who waite at the Altar of the Lord, and knovves the mercy-ſeat, vvhich hath overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovved you; and the golden veſſell in vvhich is the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>Manna,</hi> by vvhich all the Children of the Lord are fed round the Table of the Lord, out of the everlaſting treaſure-houſe of my father.</p>
            <p>Watch over the Flock of Chriſt Jeſus in every place, and Region, and quarter vvhere the Lord hath ſet you, and govern them in all vviſedome and righteouſneſſe, that the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt may be adorned: and take care of them vvillingly knovving this the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires

            <p>And therefore my dear brethren be diligent in the vvork of the Lord, ſo much the more as you ſee the day is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached: and the Harveſt is great, and the Vineyard of the Lord is great and large, and but fevv labourers: yea, the Lord is enlarging his borders, and ſpreading forth his everlaſting truth, and ſtretching forth his eternall arm over the Nations, and opening the treaſures of Heaven, and bringing raine out of his treaſury to vvater the Earth that hath been parched and dry, and to make his plants to grovv.</p>
            <p>And ſo all vvait that you may ſee the povver and preſence of the Lord in all your Aſſemblies: and ſee that there be no ſtrife nor contention nor exaltation amongſt you, but all in meekneſſe, and quietneſſe, and long-ſuffering, and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: even as the Lord hath ſpared and forborn you: one ſubmitting unto another, even as you have heard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived vvhen the vvord of the Lord came firſt unto you: and he that vvill be the greateſt ſhall be the leaſt: but all in meekneſſe and lovvlineſſe of mind ſerve one another, in love even as you have received: and the everlaſting God of life and povver be vvith you all, and make you grovv in the living povver and virtue of God: to order all things in his vviſedome, as good ſtevvards of the manifold mercies of the Lord, vvhich you are made partakers of: that he alone may be glorified throughout all the Churches of Chriſt Jeſus every vvhere.</p>

Gird on your ſword upon your loines, put on the tried Armour, and follow him for ever who rides upon the white Horſe, and is cloathed with the ſame: who makes War in righteouſneſſe: Ride on, ride on, my beloved brethren and fellow ſouldiers, make all plain before you: threſh on with the new threſhing inſtrument which hath teeth: beat the mountaines to duſt, and let the breath of the Lord ſcatter it: make the Heathen tremble, and the uncircumciſed fall by the ſword: the Lord of Hoſts is with us, and goes before us.</p>
            <p>Spare none, neither Ox nor Aſſe, neither old nor young, kill, cut off, deſtroy, bath your ſword in the blood of <hi>Amaleck</hi> and all the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> and all the uncircumciſed, and hew <hi>Agag</hi> to pieces: break the Rocks, cut down the Cedars and ſtrong Oakes, make the Devils ſubject: caſt out the unclean ſpirits, raiſe the dead: ſhut up in priſon, bring out of priſon: caſt in your nets, lanch into the deep, divide the Fiſh, gather the good into veſſels, caſt the bad away: bind the Tares in bundles, caſt them into the fire: the Angel with his ſharp ſickle is come, the Angel of the everlaſting Covenant is come: thruſt in your ſickles, reape the Earth, the word of God is come, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, let all fleſh keep ſilence, divide the word rightly, feed the Lambs and Babes, fill the hungry, ſtop the Lyons mouths: feed the fat and the ſtrong with plagues and judgements: declare his name, publiſh his eternall truth which ſhall ſtand for ever.</p>
            <p>Eternall life is come, glory to him for ever: Silence all Diſputers and Diviners for ever: trample upon all the chaff and dung, and mire for ever, which all the wiſedome of the World feeds upon. <hi>Greater is he that is in us, then he that is in the world.</hi>

Let joy and long-ſuffering and meekneſſe and temperance ſpring out, and be you perfect as your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father is perfect.</p>
            <p>Stand upon your watch Tower, and be not ſhaken nor drawn aſide to follow any other Gods, nor to bow to any other Image, nor joyn your ſelves to ſtrangers, and mingle not your ſeed with the adulterous Generation, nor take not nor give not in marriage with them; but keep your ſelves from the Idols of the Heathen, be not defiled with them; but abide in your ſtrength, you know where it lyes, by which you may work good, and be preſerved from evill; and you need not that any man teach you, for you are taught of God, and are far from oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>Ye Children of light, worſhip your God for ever, who is light, and in whom is no darkneſſe at all, who is the ſame and changes not, whoſe mercy endures for ever: Be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the Lamb as undefiled Virgins, and let your ſoule ſcorn the glory of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> for ever; for you are not your own, but are bought with a price, no more to ſerve your ſelves, but the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>Put on your Armour, and gird on your ſword, and lay hold on the ſpear, and march into the field, and prepare your ſelves to battel, for the Nations doth defie our God, and ſaith in their hearts <hi>Who is the God of the Quakers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we ſhould fear him, and obey his voyce?</hi> Ariſe, ariſe, and ſound forth the everlaſting word of War and Judgment in the ears of all the Nations, ſound an Alarum, and make their ears to tingle.
