            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>CHildren, if they are virtuous, are great Bleſſings, and a publick good. It is therefore the duty of Parents to inure them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to a Regular courſe
<pb facs="tcp:63566:9"/>
of Life, nor ought Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the beſt Quality to think the guidance of their Children beneath them. For <hi>Cornelia,</hi> the Mother of the <hi>Gracchi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and <hi>Aurelia</hi> the Mother of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> were Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſſes to Children; and <hi>Cato,</hi> tho' he kept a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in his Houſe, did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf frequently inſtruct his Son: So did <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Grand-children, and the great <hi>Theodoſius</hi> wou'd

often ſit by the Tutor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while he was inſtructing his Son. And certainly it is beſt and ſafeſt for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to have their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren under their own Eye and inſpection. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, the Fathers Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is of greateſt force to inſtruct the Son, and his Actions Authoriſe the ſame in the Child, nor can the Father chaſtize him, for what himſelf is guilty.

She muſt not lace her ſelf ſo cloſe as ſhe was wont to do, for ſtrait lacing hinders the growth of the Child, and often makes it either Abortive or Mis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſhapen. If the Mother can't or will not ſuckle the Child herſelf, care muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to procure an heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ſtrong, and vigorous

                        </gap> which purpoſe you muſt firſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether the Mother was healthy at the time ſhe was with Child; for that is a ſign of a healthful Child, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecially if the Father be alſo of a ſound onſtitution: Afterwards you muſt ind what is the colour of the new born Infant; it is beſt when the colour
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63566:16"/>
is reddiſh all over the Body, for that by degrees turns daily florid: but thoſe Children that are at firſt Florid or White, are moſt commonly of an ill temperament, Cold, Dull, and not long lived. The crying of the Child new born, ought to be loud and clear, becauſe it ſignifies plenty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Spirits, and a ſtrong breaſt: But if the Child cries low, it is a ſign that the vital ſtrength is ſmall, and the Spirits few, and the Muſcles of the Breaſt weak: You muſt more over conſider whether the magnitude, figure, paſſages, ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the parts be as they ought; and therefore the Midwife ſhould handle it gently, and ſearch whether any thing be amiſs in any part that it may be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as much as may be: Let her often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and contract the Arms and Legs, and cleanſe them from filth, and ſhe muſt ſee whether the Eyelids, the Ears, the Noſtrils, the Fundament, and Privities are as open as they ought to be, and ſhe muſt take notice of the Fingers and Toes that they do not ſtick together. She muſt put her finger into the Mouth and cleanſe it from filth, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Child be Tongue-tied or not afterwards the Child muſt be ſwaithed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63566:16"/>
up, and laid in the Cradle. <hi>Galen</hi> ſays that before it is cloathed, the body muſt be ſprinkled all over moderately with Salt, that the skin may be rendered thereby more denſe and ſolid than the inner parts; for he ſays, they are all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſoft in the Womb: But it is to be feard that the ſalt by its biteing quality ſhould occaſion itching and other inconvenienceis, and therefore this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom was ſoon left off, and inſtead of it they waſhed new-born Children with Wine, and what <hi>Galen</hi> ſays is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reaſon; for the skin in the Womb has a peculiar Conſtitution dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the internal parts; nor is it ſafer to thicken the skin and to hinder tranſpiration, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſays in another place, much leſs is the cuſtom of ſome barbarous people to be imitated, which was alſo uſed formerly in <hi>Germany,</hi> viz. the dipping the warm Infant from the Womb in the next Brook, that thereby it may be rendred more ſtrong and luſty, and to try the ſtrength of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whom they chiefly deſign for the Wars; for without doubt none but ſtrong Children would ſurvive ſuch a dipping.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:63566:17"/>
Before the Teat be offered to the Child, ſome Honey or Oyl of Almonds ought to be given it, to carry off from the ſtomach and bowels ſome filth Collected in the Womb; for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain black and pitchy matter is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in the Womb, and ought to be preſently evacuated, for if it be not, ſits are occaſioned, and ſome think the Child ought to be dieted three whole days with freſh Oyl of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and Sugar, and others Order ſome other Woman to ſuckle, the child, till the Mothers milk is pure. The child muſt be defended from all external injuries, and it muſt be kept in an Air moderately hot; and if it be not of a very good conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an Air inclining to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry muſt be choſen: But reſpect muſt be had to the ſeaſons of the year. The Cradle muſt be placed where there is not too much light, and ſo as that the light of the Sun or of a Candle may be ſeen directly, and great care muſt be taken that the child be not frightned, and it muſt never be left alone, left it be injured, by ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous Creatures, or ſome other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal injuries, which they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63566:17"/>
for it is known that Scorpions, Serpents, and ſuch like Creatures have crept into Childrens mouths, or other wiſe injured them, or Cats by lying upon them have ſuffocated them. Let th Child lie in a Cradle by it ſelf and not with the Mother or Nurſe, till it has its hands and feet at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to help it ſelf, leſt, as has been often found, it be ſuffocated by the Nurſe, or by the Bed, and the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſhould be ſo made, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be overturned by Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Infants ſhould ſleep more then they do wake, that thereby Concoction may be the better perfected, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits invigorated, and therefore if watchings are troubleſome, ſleep muſt be endeavoured by Singing, Rocking, and offering the Teat often: but care muſt be taken that the Stomach be not over burthened with Milk</p>
                     <p>The new born Child muſt be Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed once a day; and moderately rubbed; for ſuch frictions help Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and the diſtribution of the nouriſhment, and ſerve inſtead of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and motion, which the Infant by reaſon of its Tenderneſs cannot
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63566:18"/>
undergo, and they ſtrengthen the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and make them firm. After ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the Infant muſt be ſwathed up, leſt it ſhould move its hands and feet too freely, and thereby diſtort the bones, which are yet very flexible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but after four months the hands and arms may be let looſe, but the whole breaſt and belly muſt be ſwathed for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>above a year to comfort the heart, and to defend the parts, and you muſt be ſure to cleanſe the Child often, to prevent Itching and Excoriation. And care muſt be taken that the body be kept open, which may be eaſily done if the Milk be good, and in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient quaintity. But if the Belly be bound, it muſt be anointed below the Navel with ſome Oyls, or emollient liniments, or an emollent gliſter muſt be injected.</p>
                     <p>Moderate crying Conduces to the evacuating the brain, to dilate and cleanſe the Lungs, and excites the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat: but when it is immoderate it is wont to occaſion fluxions upon the eyes, Catarrhs, and Ruptures. It does leaſt hurt before ſucking, and and when the milk is concocted, but becauſe moſt commomly Children do
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63566:18"/>
not cry without a cauſe, but are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by ſomething that diſturbs them, a Prudent Mother or Nurſe will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find out what is the cauſe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hat that being removed, the Child may be at quiet: She will ſee whither the Linnen be foul'd for Children love to be clean, and will not ſleep quietly till filthy cloſe are removed from them: the Mother will ſee whether they are ſwaithed too hard, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are not pinched by the wrinkling of the Linnen, or pricked by a pin, or whether gripes be the occaſion.</p>
                     <p>As to the nouriſhment it muſt be fed with milk for ſome months, and it may ſuck as often as it will, if it be not ſubject to a Vometing or looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and provided the Stomach be not over-charged, and in ſuckling of a Child you muſt take notice to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by turns the right and left breaſt, eſpecially after it is permitted to uſe its hands; for if you do not obſerve this, it will be accuſtomed to uſe one hand. After ſome months you may feed the Child with Pap.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:63566:19"/>
But it is not convenient to give ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid meats before they have their Teeth; for they cannot chew them: But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Teeth are bred, it is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to accuſtom them by degrees to ſolid food; yet notwithſtanding you muſt not deny them milk, bread, pulſe boyled, and fleſh, firſt chew'd by the Nurſe may be ſometimes given them, but hard meats muſt not be allow'd. In this mixture of aliment we muſt take care, while milk is in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach that no acid or auſtere thing be given, which may coagulate or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the milk in the Stomach.</p>
                     <p>When the Limbs of the Infant are ſtrong, and it begins to uſe its hands and feet you muſt not too early al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of ſuch motions, much leſs muſt you put them upon their feet too ſoon, as ſome unskillfull Nurſes do, and by that means crook their Legs but when they are able to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Legs, they muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſuſtained by the Leading-ſtrings and afterwards that they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to go alone, you muſt put them into running-Chairs, ſuch as are common in Families, and ſuffer them to puſh them along themſelves, and by this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63566:19"/>
ſort of playing exerciſe, they will be accuſtomed to their feet, and learn to go, and to ſtop themſelves: But when they begin to go without help, they muſt not be left alone, and to prevent all danger it is beſt to put roll's about their heads. As to bathing, a Child new born ought to be waſhed every day, but from the third month, to the ſeventh month till they are weaned twice a week. If the Child be apt to uſe its left hand, you muſt bind it up and leave the right free, that by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe it may become agile and ſtrong.</p>
                     <p>The Child muſt not be weaned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it has all its Teeth, for till then it cannot chew ſolid Meats; beſides, in breeding the Teeth, eſpecially the Dog-Teeth, Children are ſubject to Fevers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pains of the Gums, and other Symptoms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is to be ſear d that weaning them encreaſes their miſery. But here can be no certain time ſet for weaning Children; for thoſe that are brisk may be ſooner weaned, and thoſe that are weak may ſuck longer, and ſometimes Children are to be weaned before they ought, by reaſon the Nurſe or Mother are ſick, or have conceived; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63566:20"/>
ſome are weaned in the tenth month, and ſome in the twelfth, and yet it is moſt convenient that the Child ſuck a year and an half, or two years; and it is proper to diet them with milk a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer; for the parts being ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by this agreeable aliment, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the benefit of it for the whole life. but at what time ſoever the Child is weaned, unuſual meats are not ſuddenly to be offered to it; it ought therefore to be accuſtomed to them by degrees while it does Suck; for all ſudden changes are dangerous, and a Man is offended by good Meats, if he be not accuſtomed to them; therefore Pape and Chicken-broath are firſt to be given, and when they have been wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a while, Pulſe, and fleſh of eaſie dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and good juice, firſt chewed by the Mother or the Nurſe. It is better ſo wean a Child in the Spring or Autumn, than in the Summer or Winter, leaſt to the alteration of the body, which is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the new diet, another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the heat or cold of the ambient air be added to it, and ſo the Child be prejudiced: Some Women think, and not without Reaſon, that it is better to wean a Child at the increaſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63566:20"/>
of the Moon, than at the decreaſe: and becauſe it ſometimes happens, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren cannot be drawn from the Teat by any means, the Papes muſt be anointed with the juice of Wormwood, or with the following Liniment.</p>
                     <p>Take of Honey two Drams, of Aloes half a Dram, of the juice of Wormwood one dram.</p>
                     <p>But theſe things muſt not be uſed too much, leaſt the Lips and Gums of the Children ſhould be inflam d, or the Stomach hurt: and becauſe ſometimes ſome Children diſlike Honey and ſweet things, you may anoint the Papes with them, and ſo cauſe an averſion: but the beſt way of weaning them is for the Mother or Nurſe to get out of ſight; for if the Children do not ſee them they will not cry for the Breaſt.</p>
                     <p>As to the Diet of Children that are wean'd till they come to be ſeven years old, it ought to be very different from that of the adult; for Children are yet weak, and their bodies tender, and ſo cannot eaſily bear errors in diet: at this age they ought to be fed often, and ſo much meat ought to be given them, as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63566:21"/>
may not only ſuffice for their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but for their growth alſo, as <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> rightly obſerves, Children ſays he, are leaſt able to bear Hunger, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch thoſe eſpecially that are of a quick Wit.</p>
                     <p>As to the Paſſions of Mind, we muſt endeavour that Children be not violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved with Anger; or affected with Sorrow, nor Frighted; for theſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Paſſions of the mind make great impreſſions upon the Body, and ſo occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the falling Sickneſs and other Diſeaſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iniquity is connatural to Infants, and they are more prone to Evil than to Good, we muſt not therefore indulge them too much, but from their tender years we muſt ſo endeavour to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate all the Faculties and Affections of their Soules, that they my be obedient to Reaſon; for in this Age the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a good Life is to be laid. Do we not ſee that young Lyons and Bears, when they are young, can be made ſo tame, as to obey the very nod of the Keepers; whereas if you let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone till they are grown up, they will for ever after remain Fierce and Wild, why then ſhould not the mind of a Child be ſo tamed, as to obey Reaſon,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63566:21"/>
and to harken to advice: but there are not the appearances of all the affections in the firſt years; anger ſhews it ſelf firſt by crying and the like; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhould endeavour to nip this animoſity in the bud, and they that will not be reclaimed by admonition, muſt be diſciplined by the rod, that in time to come they may be ſit to perform the Offices of a Man: Play muſt be allowed them to moderate their affections, and indeed this age can ſcarce do any thing ſeriouſly, only you muſt take care that their play does not injure their bodies; ſuch exerciſes muſt be allowed as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to their years, and they muſt not be bred up in ſloath; for it being neceſſary that they ſhould be plentifully ſed, as has been ſaid, unleſs they uſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, the nouriſhment will not be well diſtributed to all the body, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive heat will be ſuppreſſed; In this Age they muſt be often waſhed: They that converſe with them muſt take a ſpecial care that nothing blaſphemous, ſcurillous, or immodeſt be ſaid or done, ſo as to give an ill example to them: About the ſixth year of their age, they ſhould be put to Schoole to a Maſter, who is to inſtruct them in all things neceſſary to a good Life.</p>

                     <p>WHat ever diligence has been uſed for the right ordering of the Diet of Infants, yet notwithſtanding they are often ſubject to Diſeaſes; for that blood which was wont to be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated every month, and thoſe vitious humours that were wont to be carried off with it, being detained nine whole months in the Womb, it may eaſily happen that the Child be injured there by, eſpecially all Mothers being not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually healthful, and beſides many great errors being committed in Diet, many vitious humours are communicated to the Fetus with the nouriſhment; all which, tho not always, diſorder Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the Womb, and ſometimes after they are Born, occaſion various Diſeaſes and Symptoms; and ſometimes the Child is injured in the Birth, or by the cuting of the Navel-ſtring, or by the change of place; for when it was in the Womb,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63566:22"/>
it was encompaſſed with peculiar cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, fleſh, membrans, and humours all warm and ſoft.</p>
                     <p>The Diſeaſes and Symptoms of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are many, ſome common with the adult, which being added by ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to Treatiſes of Childrens Diſeaſes makes them bulky; and therefore I will here paſs them by, and treat only of ſuch as are proper and familiar with them.</p>
                     <p>In the cure of Infants a ſpecial regard is to be had to the Methods and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, for Children by reaſon of the weakneſs of their bodies, cannot under go ſevere methods or ſtrong Medicines: They do not well bear bleeding, nor ſtrong Purges, but where purging is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, a Suppoſitory ought to be uſed, or a Gliſter muſt be injected. For inſtance.</p>
                     <p>Take of the leaves of Violets, and Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, each one handful, of the Flowers of Camomile, and Violets, each one pugil: boyl them in a ſufficient quantity of fountain water. Take of the ſtrained liquor four or five ounces, according to the age, and add to it of Syrup of Roſes ſolutive, half a ounce, ſix drams, or an once of oyl of Violets, half an ounce, make a Gliſter:</p>

                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:63566:23"/>
Take of the Whey of Goats-milk a ſufficient quantity, add to it of Syrup of Succory with Rubarb, or of Honey, or of Syrup of Roſes ſolutive ſix Drams, of Oyl of Violets half an ounce, make a Gliſter.</p>
                     <p>But if there be occaſion for other Purges they are moſt conveniently given to the Nurſe or Mother; for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative quality is imparted by the Milk to the Child; or lenitive purges may given to Children, reſpect being had to their age, as Syrup of <hi>Roſes</hi> ſolutive, Syrup of <hi>Succory</hi> with <hi>Rhubarb, Caſſia, Manna,</hi> or the like.</p>

                     <p>THere are two ſorts of them, the diſtinct and confluent the diſtinct begin with a ſhivering, and coldneſs, which is preſently followed with exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive heat, a violent pain in the Head and Back, Vomiting, a great propenſity to Sweat in grown perſons: But I have not obſerved, ſays <hi>Sydenham,</hi> any ſuch diſpoſition in Children, either before or after they come out: A pain at the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Breaſt, beneath the region of the Heart, if it be preſſed with the hand, dullneſs and ſleepineſs, eſpecially in Children, and ſometimes convulſive fits, and if theſe happen to them that have all their Teeth, I reckon the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> are at hand, which, moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, coming out a few hours after, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently anſwer the prognoſtic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tion:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63566:29"/>
For inſtance, if the Child has a Convulſive fit in the evening, as it uſually happens, the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> appear the next Morning; and more over I have very often obſerved, that when they come immediately after theſe fits, they riſe in large Puſtles, and are mild, and favourable, and ſeldom Flux<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is to be noted that ſometimes the courſe of ſeparation is paſt over gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually without any ſickneſs, but moſt commonly, as we ſaid before, the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before the eruption is moſt violent.</p>
                     <p>The diſtinct <hi>Small-Pox</hi> uſually come out on the fourth day incluſively, and ſometimes a little latter, but rarely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at which time the Symptoms moſt commonly abate, or totally vaniſh: The eruption is after this manner, firſt pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as big as ſmall pins heads here and there ſhew themſelves, and firſt of all in the Face, Neck, and Breaſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the whole body: At this time the Jaws are afflicted with a pain, that increaſes as the Puſtles riſe, which, growing daily bigger and higher, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the neighbouring skin and fleſh; for about the eight day, from the firſt approach of the ſickneſs, the ſpaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that before were ſomewhat white now begin to be red, and ſwell more or

                     <p>
                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:63566:30"/>
A Looſneſs afflicts Children in the Flux-Pox, but does not invade Children ſo ſoon, as Spitting does grown people; But at what time ſoever it comes, if it be not ſtopt by art, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues thro the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>I have always obſerved, that when the Diſeaſe was violent, the ſick had as it were a fit in the Evening, and then the Symptoms raged as it were more cruely.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as the ſigns of this Diſeaſe ſhew themſelves, I keep the ſick from the open air, and forbid them the uſe of Wine and Fleſh, and allow them Small bear gentlly warmed with a Toaſt for their ordinary drink, and now and then permit them to drink as much of it as they will. I order them for victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, Oat-meal and Barley-broths, and roaſted Apples, and other things which are neither too hot nor cold, nor hard to be digeſted, I forthwith prohibit an hot regimen, and the uſe of all manner of Cordials: On the forth day I commit the ſick to his Bed, and then if the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles come not out well, ſome gentle Cordial may be properly preſcribed, at leſt for once to drive them out. Among
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63566:30"/>
the Medicines for this purpoſe, thoſe they called Paregorick, ſuch as liquid <hi>Laudanum, Diaſcordium</hi> and the like, if they be mixed in a ſmall quantity with ſome proper Cordal waters, excell the reſt: when the Puſtles firſt come out, I then carefully conſider whether they be of the diſtinct or confluent kind, becauſe they differ exceedingly one from the other, though they agree as to ſome ſymptoms; if therefore from the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and paucity of the Puſtles, and the ſlowneſs of the coming out, and from the vaniſhing of ſickneſs and other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which tire the Patient after the eruption of the Flux-pox, it appears that they are the diſtinct ſort, I take care that the ſick be refreſhed with Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beer, Oat-meal and Braley gruel, and the like: and if the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> be but few, and in Summer time, and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot, I ſee no reaſon why the Patient ſhould be kept ſtifled in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed, and why he may not rather riſe a few hours every day, provided the inconveniences of too much cold or heat may be prevented by the place and cloathing: but if either the cold ſeaſon of the year, or a large eruption of the Puſcles put the Patient under a neceſſity of keeping his Bed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63566:31"/>
I take care that he lye not hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor has more cloaths on him, than when he was in health, and that he have a fire kindled only in the Morning and Evening, unleſs it be Winter, nor do I require, that he ſhould be always fixed to one place, leaſt he Sweat, which I confidently affirm cannot be promoted without great danger: when the Diſeaſe is going off, it is proper to give ſome proper Cordial Medicine, and at the ſame time alſo a little hotter, and more cordial-diet may be allowed: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance Sugar-ſoaps, and Oat-mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>-cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and the like; nor is there any need of any other thing at all in the diſtinct and gentle ſort, if the Patient be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted moderately with this method and diet, unleſs by chance reſtleſſneſs or watchings ſhould now or then perſwade the uſe of a Paregorick.</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> flux, the caſe is very hazardous, for this ſort is no leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the other, than the Plague is from this, tho among the vulgar, who take names and words for things, the cure of both is ſaid to be the ſame; for towards the end of the Diſeaſe, the ſick is in great danger, namely, on the Eleventh day, in the common Flux-pox,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63566:31"/>
on the fourteenth in a worſer ſort and on the ſevententh in the worſt ſort, and ſometimes tho rarely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the 21ſt. day, the Fever, the reſtleſſneſs, and other ſymptoms invading together, whereby the ſick is generally deſtroyed, unleſs art relieve him; wherefore ſeeing there is ſo much danger, when they flux, the Phyſitian ſhould endeavour all he can to hinder their fluxing, by bleeding preſently in the Arm, if there be the leſt ſuſpicion of the Flux-pox, and by giving a Vomit afterwards, and by keeping the ſick up till the ſixth day, from the firſt ſickneſs, afterwards he muſt be put to Bed, and kept there till the end of the Diſeaſe: But he muſt have no more Cloaths on, nor a greater Fire in his Chamber, than he uſed to have, when he was well, and he muſt drink freely of Small beer, or other coolling Liquors. But becauſe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Sick freequently grows hot, light-headed, and reſtleſs, I give an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodyne every night, but a little earlier than is uſual; becauſe in this Diſeaſe, a ſit of heat and reſtleſſneſs comes, almoſt every day, towards the evening.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:63566:32"/>
But, which is to be lamented, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe, and all other phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical helps, the Sick is very often ſeized on the eleventh day, or on ſome other of thoſe days, which we ſaid were moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, in the various kinds of Flux-pox, with a violently Fever, difficulty of Breathing, and reſtleſſneſs, and dies ſuddenly: Therefore in this deplorable caſe, blood muſt be taken away, according to the ſtrength and age of the Patient; from a young man ten or twelve ounces muſt be taken, and in the evening a large Anodyne muſt be given, as before, and ſo afterwards morning and evening, and ſometimes oftener: but it is to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently noted, that in ſome the fury of the Diſeaſe is ſo high, that a very large doſed Anodine cannot ſtop its force in twelve hours; in which caſe it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to repeat the Anodyne every ſixth or eighth hour.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe it happens often at the lattor end of the Diſeaſe, that the Body is bound up ſo much, that the Sick is like to be ſuffocated, and conſequently is in great danger; in this caſe I have given ſucceſsfully to grown people an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ounce and an half of Lenitive Electuary diſſolved in four ounces of Succory wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63566:32"/>
or the like, which draught generally gives ſome ſtools before night: but if it does not, an Anodyne muſt be given in the evening, and ſooner notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Purge, if great reſtleſſneſs, or ſome conſiderable ſickneſs threatens dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: if therefore the Purge does not anſwer the firſt day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it muſt be repeated the next, and then it ſeldom fails: and in this manner Bleeding and Purging may be repeated by intervals, as occaſion requires. But it is to be noted, that the ſick muſt not be purged till the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day, or after, nor then, unleſs bleeding has gone before.</p>
                     <p>For ſpitting of blood and bloody U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine coming upon the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> (for both theſe Hemorrhagies come ſometimes at the beginning of the Diſeaſe) after Bleeding largely once, give an Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne.</p>
                     <p>Take of red Poppy-water two Ounces, liquid Laudanum, <hi>14</hi> drops, of diſtilled Vinegar three Drams, of Diacodium half an Ounces; make a draught to be repeated every night at bed time.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>OF all the particular diſeaſes of the parts of the humane body, that are proper to, and familiar with Children, if we begin with the Head, and ſo proceed to all parts of the body, theſe Scabs and Ulcers are firſt to be conſidered; they come at the time when the Child ſucks, and perpetually emit a Sanies, or purulent matter. The Scabs are white, but the Ulcers are of another colour: The Scabs are alſo all over the body as well as in the Face, whereas the Ulcers are chiefly in the Head: But becauſe the cauſes of them do not much differ, and the method of cure is the ſame, we will treat of them together in this Chapter: they ariſe from excrementious humours which are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and accid, and they occaſion itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Theſe humours are collected partly in the Womb, and they ariſe partly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63566:40"/>
from a fault in the Mothers or Nurſes milk, and afterwards are caſt out by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the habit of the body: It is commonly held that theſe Ulcers keep Children in health, and not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for by this means nature expels the vitious humours from the inner parts of the body to the habit of it, and if they vaniſh, Children are ſubject to Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and other Diſeaſes, and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, that if there be Ulcers in the Head, about the Ears, in the Face, or in any other part of the body, Children will be free from fits.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Scabs generally go off of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in time, but if they continue long, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But when there is no danger to be feared, eſpecially when the Face is not deformed, nor the Eyes hurt, the Ulcers ought to be left to themſelves, yea we ought to endeavour that the other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be expell d, and if the Ulcers vaniſh, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63566:43"/>
or from the ill milk of the Nurſe, or Mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by progreſs of time, and the long continuance of the diſeaſe, and neglignce, (for it moſt commonly befalls poor peoples Children) it turns to this diſeaſe. Moreover it is eaſily imparted to Infants, when the cap of that which has it, is put upon another infant: This diſeaſe is not always the ſame, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is ſcaly, ſometimes viſcous.</p>
                     <p>This diſeaſe plainly appears to ſight and is commonly known, for ſome cruſty and dry Ulcers are ſeen upon the Head, ſometimes they are green, ſometimes yellow, and ſometimes of an aſh-colour, ſcarce any thing flows out of them, and that which does is very fetid.</p>
                     <p>It is very difficult to cure; that which is new, and of a yellow colour, and a little moiſt is eaſieſt cured: But that which is old, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But becauſe tender Infants cannot bear theſe Medicines, leſt the diſeaſe take too deep root, you muſt in the mean while apply to the ulcers leaves of Cabbage or Beet, greaſed with Butter or Lard, to mollifie and to make a paſſage for the matter.</p>

                     <p>Take of Sulphur two Drams, of Muſtard half a Dram, Staves-Acre, of the roots of Briony, each one Dram, of the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Vinegar, one Ounce, of Turpentine half an ounce, with a ſufficient quantity of Bears fat, make a Liniment. Or,</p>

                     <p>THO grown people, if they live naſtily and wear foul Cloaths, and do not change often their Woolen, as well as their Linnen, are ſubject to lice, yet this naſty diſeaſe is moſt familier to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nor can Gentlemens Children be free from them, for they breed in their Heads: They are occaſioned by putrifaction: It is a troubleſome and naſty diſeaſe, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions great itching, and is dangerous, if they poſſeſs the whole body; for ſome have died of them.</p>
                     <p>Lice forſake people when they are a dying, and run away in Troops; they being offended with the ill vapours that ariſe from dying bodies.</p>
                     <p>To prevent Lice, Children muſt be kept clean, and have an orderly dyet, They muſt abſtain from meats of ill juice, eſpecially Figs: But if Lice are generated, they muſt be removed by univerſal remedies, if their be occaſion;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63566:47"/>
but firſt ſuch external Medicines muſt be uſed, as take of the matter that breed Lice, and kill them when they are bred, as Staves-acre, Wormwood, Scordium, Rue, the leaves of Pine, and Cypreſs, the roots of Elecampane, Long Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, Lupins, the Seeds of Nettles, Black Hellebore, Coloquintida, Sulpher, Bulls-Gall, Soap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sea-water, of all which Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Liniments may be made. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of long Birthwort and Lupins, of the leaves of Pine and Cypreſs, each equal parts, boyl them for a Lotion to the Head. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of the roots of Elecampane two Ounces, of Briony half an Ounce, of Beets, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury and Soapwort, each one handfull, of Lupins one Ounce, Nitre, half an Ounce, boyl them for a Lotion for the Head.</p>
                     <p>Or you may make perfumed Waſhballs for the ſame pupoſe.</p>
                     <p>Take of Venice Soap ſix Ounces, of the powder of Cinnamon, half an Ounce, of Oyl of Aniſeeds one Dram, of Musk grains five; make Balls.</p>

After waſhing the Head, anoint it with ſuch an oyntment as Follows.</p>
                     <p>Take of the powder of Staves-aere three Drams, of meal of Lupins half an ounce, of white Agarick three Drams, of live Sulphur two Drams, of the Gall of an Ox half an ounce, with a ſufficient quantity of Oyl of Wormwood, make a Linement. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Staves-acre one ounce, of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and Rue, each half an ounce, of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and Nitre, each two Drams, make a powder, and with Oyl of Laurel make an oyntment.</p>
                     <p>The ſtronger Medicines are white Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore, Quick-ſilver killed with faſting Spitle. Some uſe Arſnick, but this is dangerous. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Seeds of Staves-acre one ounce, white Hellebore three Drams, of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver killed with faſting Spitle two Drams, with Lard and Oyl of Laurel, make an oyntment.</p>

                     <p>AN Hydrocephalus is a watery Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the whole Head, it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeiſes grown perſons, of which <hi>Carolus Piſo</hi> has two obſervations; but it moſt freequently befalls Infants, their heads being ſo ſoft, as that they may be eaſily extended. Some Children have had this Diſeaſe in the Womb, but many have been afflicted with it after the birth. <hi>Rhaſis</hi> ſays he ſaw a Child, whoſe head was ſo increaſed in length and breadth, that the body was not able to bear it. <hi>Pareus</hi> ſays he ſaw four ſuch Children, and cured them.</p>
                     <p>If the water be contained within the Skull, it is much more difficult to cure than when without, and is moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deadly: The indication is to evacuat the waters, and to dry them up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This may be done by medicines applied to the Head, Ears and Noſtrils.</p>

Take Snails in their Shells number Thirty, of Marjoram and Mugwort, each one handful, and beat them, and add to them one ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Camphor, and half a dram of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron with oyl of Camomile make a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm, and inject the following water into their Noſtrils.</p>
                     <p>Take of Nutmegs, Cloves, and Cubebs, each one ſcruple, of common ſweet ſmelling Flag, and of the bark of Frankincenſe, each half a Dram, of the water of Marjoram, three ounces, mingle them.</p>
                     <p>Or with the balſom of Marjoram, Cloves, and Nutmegs, Musk, and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre the Noſtrils may be anointed; and hot Oyls may be injected into the Ears.</p>
                     <p>But if the water be not carried off in this manner within twenty days, inciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be attempted, and the brain muſt be opened, and the water extracted, but by degrees, and by turns, leſt the Childs ſtrength be too much djected, and care muſt be taken, that the cold air does not hurt the Brain.</p>
                     <p>Authors make mention of another Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the head, which they call infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is generated by wind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under the skin of the head, or membranes of the brain, and ſo it diſtends

                     </head>
                     <p>TO come now to the ſymptoms of the animal faculty, in the common ſenſe, and imagination two ſymptoms happen, <hi>viz.</hi> Frights in ſleep, and great watchings: and firſt as to frights in ſleep, they are nothing but ſleep diſturbed by terrible dreams, according to <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, parvis &amp; nuper natis puerulis acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt pavo res inter dormiendum.</hi> Tho <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> ſays that Children do not dream be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are four years old: but experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teaches us otherwiſe; for it appears plainly, by their laughing and frights in ſleep.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of frights are impure vapours mingled with the animal Spirits, that diſturb them, and repreſent to the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination terrible Phantaſms: Theſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours ariſe from the Stomach, and are cauſed by ill concoction, and therefore this diſeaſe chiefly happens to ſuch Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as ſuck greedily, and more than
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63566:51"/>
the Stomach can Concoct, upon which account the milk corrupts, and raiſes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours to the brain, that diſturb the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal ſpirits, and it is not abſurd to think that theſe vapours are ſent to the head by the veins as well as by the Oeſopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus: For as in the Night-Mare, that is generated by a too great quantity of food, affording blood filled with groſs wind, thick vapours aſcend thro the veſſels to the brain, and occaſion this diſorder; ſo if Infants fill their Stomach with too much food, blood alſo full of groſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours may be generated, which being elevated to the brain occaſion this diſeaſe. Theſe frights alſo happen in Fevers, and in the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> and <hi>Meaſles,</hi> and they alſo ſometimes come from Worms.</p>
                     <p>This diſeaſe is eaſily known by the ſtanders by; for the Children groan and ſhake in their ſleep, and cry out of a ſudden, and a hot and fetid vapour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hals from their mouth moſt commonly.</p>
                     <p>This diſorder muſt not be contemned, for it is often the forerunner of ſits, wherefore you muſt endeavour to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it in time, by removing the vitious humours from the ſtomach, that corrupt the meat: In order to which, the Nurſe ought to be healthy, and to eat mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63566:51"/>
of meats of good juice, and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all, that yeild an ill nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the milk which the Infant ſucks may be good: The Infant alſo ought to ſuck ſparingly, that the Stomach be not burthened, nor muſt the Infant after ſucking or feeding be preſently laid aſleep, but muſt be kept up a while, that the meat may deſcend to the bottom of the Stomach, and be the eaſier concocted, and that the corrupt meat may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Stomach, or vomited up: Oyl of Sweet-Almonds may be given to the Child, or you may give a ſpoonful or two of Honey of Roſes ſolutive, to carry off the vitious humours by ſtool.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of the diſeaſe being taken off, the Stomach muſt be ſtrengthened, which may conveniently be done with magiſtery of Coral, and conſection of Hiacinth given in milk, and you may anoint the Stomach with the Oyls of Wormwood, Mint, Maſtick, or Nutmegs: And before ſleep it is good to give the Child a Lozenge of Diamoſch diſſolved in Milk: If this ſymptom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a Fever, you muſt take care of that, if from Worms proper remedies muſt be uſed.</p>

                     <p>ALL the while the Child is in the Womb, it is almoſt perpetually aſleep, and for ſome times after it is born, if it be well, it is always almoſt aſleep, for the brain is yet very moiſt, and abounds with a great deal of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medity, therefore when it watches much, and cannot be brought to reſt, either by rocking, ſinging, or giving the breaſt, nor by any other way, it is to be reckoned of a ſickly conſtitution.

Altho' the breeding of Teeth be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures work, yet by reaſon of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes and various Symptoms, which ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily accompany it, it is reckoned amongſt Childrens Diſeaſes. As ſoon as Children are born, they have Teeth, but they lie in the gums: Yet ſome Children have been born with Teeth, appearing as <hi>Pliny</hi> relates in his natural Hiſtory of <hi>Marcus Curius,</hi> who was therefore called <hi>Dentatus.</hi> But the Teeth moſt commonly do not come forth till the ſeventh Month; firſt thoſe that are called Inciſores, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Dog Teeth, and at length the Grinders. There are many preternatural

diſorders, that ariſe from the ſolution of continuity.

The firſt Teeth fall away about the ſeventh year, and new ones come in their room, without pain, becauſe the Gums were perforated before.</p>
                     <p>Tho' Children cannot tell the pain they ſuffer in breeding Teeth, yet it may be known, firſt by the time they uſe to come out in, which is about the ſeventh month; and then becauſe Children fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently put their fingers in their months to aſſwage the pain; thirdly, becauſe the Mother or the Nurſes perceive they ſqueeze the nipple harder than they uſed to do; fourthly, the Gums are white in the place where the Teeth endeavour to come out, and ſometimes at length vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ill Symptoms ariſe, as pains, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Looſneſs, Fevers, and Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

                     <p>CAtarrhs ariſe in Children from their natural conſtitution, and moiſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of their brains, whereby many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements are heapt up there; for too great a quantity of milk burdening the ſtomach ſends vapours to the head and ſill the brain, and Children being unaccuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Womb too cold, the extream coldneſs of the air, or too much heat, or much Cloaths upon their heads, pour the matter upon the Noſtrils Jaws, or Lungs, and if the excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours cannot be evacuated by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils they fall upon the Aſpera Arteria, and cauſe a Cough; but if they fall upon the Bronchia of the Lungs, they cauſe difficulty of breathing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:63566:64"/>
Theſe Symptoms are eaſily diſcovered, but whether the humour be cold or hot, may be known in the following manner: if the humour be hot, the Catarrh is thin, the Children often ſneeze, the face is florid, and the jaws look red, and a hot vapour exhales from their mouths, and the Nurſes perceive it when the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſuck. If the humour be cold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is thick, and the Children do not ſneeze, nor is there any redneſs in the face or jaws nor heat in their mouth. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the difficulty of breathing ariſe from matter coming from the head or from phlcgmatick blood, may be known as follows: If it come from the head, there is a Catarrh, and alſo a Cough, and in breathing a noiſe is perceived, the air not paſſing freely through the obſtructed Bronchia: But if it be occaſioned by a phlegmatick humour ariſing from the hypochonders, there is no Catarrh nor Cough, and the hypochonders appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated and tumid.</p>
                     <p>Catarrhs, Coughs, and difficulty of breathing are not to be neglected in Children; for Coughs do not only occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Watchings, and frequent Vomitings but alſo ruptures; and Catarrhs occaſion ſuffocations, and ſometimes kill.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:63566:64"/>
They are not eaſily cured, becauſe children cannot bear all ſorts of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and beſides they do not know how to ſpit up the matter.</p>
                     <p>We muſt principally endeavour, that the intempers which occaſions the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be rectified, and the fluxion of the humour to the breaſt hindered. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe children cannot take or bear many Medicines, and nature it, ſelf without the help of Medicines, does moſt commonly concoct the cauſe of the Catarrh, and ſo ſtop it, if a good diet be obſerved; therefore great care muſt be taken that neither the Child or Nurſe commit any errour in diet; wherefore the Infants ſtomach muſt not be filled with milk, or any other meat, and the nurſe muſt abſtain from Acid Salt, and acid things and all other things which ſend many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours to the head, and it is uſeful to give a Pectoral decoction to the nurſe.</p>
                     <p>Take of figs and jujubs, each number ten, Sebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins number thirty, raiſins ſtoned, ten drams, Liquoriſh two drams, Maiden Hair, Hyſſop and Violets, each half an ounce; boyl them in three pints of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain water to the Comſumption of a third part.</p>

                     <p>THe Hickops happen to Children, by reaſon of the coruption of Meat in the Stomach, or by the repletion of the ſtomach with Milk, or becauſe of the refrigeration of the ſtomach by external Air, whereby the expulſive faculty of the ſtomach is ſo much offended, and irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to expel that which troubles it.</p>
                     <p>The Hickops, for the moſt part, are not dangerous in Children; but if the câuſe of it be ſo great, as to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the reſt of the Nerves, and to occaſion other Convulſions, it is moſt commonly deâdly.</p>

                     <head>Chap. XXI. <hi>Of Vomiting.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THis is occaſioned in Infants moſt commonly by ſucking too greedily, or by reaſon of Worms: it may alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from flegm in the ſtomach, and ſometimes from a weakneſs of it.</p>
                     <p>If Vomiting proceed from too great a quantity of Milk, the Nurſe may ſoon know it, and the Child is at eaſe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after vomiting: if it be occaſioned from the corruption of the Milk, it may be known by what is brought up and it is either yellow, green, or ſome other vitious colour, and it ſmells ill. Worms may be known by their proper ſigns.</p>
                     <p>Vomiting in Children, is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly not dangerous, and Women com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, that thoſe Children are longeſt lived, who Vomit ſometimes from the very Birth; and this opinion is not irrational; far Infants having col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſome vitious Humours in the Womb, that lie in their ſtomachs, which is moreover laxed, humid, and weak, they eaſily generate crudities, by ſucking too much, and ſo the Milk is corrupted; therefore if the vitious humours collected
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63566:67"/>
in the ſtomach, are ejected by vomiting, it is much better, and more for their health, than if theſe humours were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and diſtributed to the innermoſt parts of the Body.</p>
                     <p>If Vomiting proceed from a great quantity of Milk, there is little danger; for moſt commonly the Children are better âfter it: but if it proceed from corruption of the Milk, it is ill; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſymptoms are apt to accompany it. If it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>continue long, it is dangerous; for it cauſes a Conſumption, and often kills. If that which is rejected be white and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>egmatick, it is better than that which is of a ſafron, green, or blackiſh colour.</p>
                     <p>If the Vomiting proceed from a great quantity of Milk, the Child muſt not ſuck often, nor never fill the ſtomach. If the Vomiting proceed from a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Milk, it muſt be rectified by proper Remedies, and that which is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, muſt be carried off with Syrup, or Honey of Roſes ſolutive; and to ſtrengthen the Childs ſtomach, you muſt give Syrup of Mint, or Syrup of Quinces.

                        <hi>Chap. XXIV.</hi> Of a Looſneſs.</head>
                     <p>A Looſneſs is very common to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and it moſt commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens about the time they are breeding their Teeth but ſometimes alſo when they are not breeding their Teeth, when either their Stomach or Bowels are cooled by the external Air, and ſo a due concoction is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:63566:71"/>
hindred; or it may happen though the Stomach be very well, when it is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened with too large a quantity of Meat or Drink, which breeds Crudities, and corrupts the Meat, and Meat that is crude, unconcocted and corrupted, if it be not rejected by Vomit, cauſes a Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. A Looſneſs may alſo happen by a fault in the Milk or Meat, from whence ill chyle is generated in the Stomach, which provokes Nature to frequent Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations; the humidity and looſneſs of the Bowels may be alſo a cauſe.</p>
                     <p>A Looſneſs appears of it ſelf, but whether it be occaſioned by breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Teeth, or from ſome other cauſe, may be known by the ſigns of breeding Teeth. If it proceed from an Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries of the Stomach and Bowels, ſome external cauſes went before, which might occaſion a cold or moiſt Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Stomach or Bowels. If this Flux proceed from an Humour falling from the Head, it may be known by a Catarrh being preſent, and what the matter is, which is evacuated, may be eaſily known; for if the Humours are crude, the Meat is evacuated Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, the Child is troubled with belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Excrements are ſlegmatick
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63566:71"/>
and white; but if the Humours are hot, and the Meat is corrupted, thoſe things which are evacuated, are yellow or green, and ſtink, and the Child is much griped.</p>
                     <p>What <hi>Celfus</hi> ſays in general of Fluxes in the Belly, is alſo true as to Children, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Looſneſs for a day or more is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten good for the health if no Fever accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it, and if it go off within ſeven days; and therefore a Looſneſs in Children, if they bear it well, muſt not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtopt; for corrupted Humours in the Stomach are often commodiouſly eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated thereby, whereas if they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, many grievous ſymptoms would ariſe; and therefore <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays in his Book of breeding Teeth, that thoſe Children that have a looſneſs in breeding Teeth, are leaſt ſubject to Convulſions.</p>
                     <p>But if Children do not well bear their Looſneſs, and it takes away their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and makes them weak, it muſt be ſtopt; and a Looſneſs is dangerous in Children, if it come upon an acute Fever, and if that which is evacuated be black.</p>
                     <p>In the Cure, we muſt firſt conſider, whether the Child ſucks or not, and next, whether it be breeding the Teeth, or not; for if the Child yet ſuck, the cure muſt not be directed to the Child, but
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63566:72"/>
to the Mother, or Nurſe; and we muſt conſider whether the Milk be good, or not; for if the Milk be bad, it muſt be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or if that cannot preſently be done, the Nurſe muſt be changed. The Nurſe muſt uſe an aſtringent Diet, and muſt abſtain from Fruits, and crude Meats, and ſuch as are of difficult concoction. But if the Infant does not ſuck, the cure muſt be directed to it: but whether it ſuck or not, the vitious Humours that are evacuated, muſt not be unſeaſonably ſtopt, eſpecially when Children are breeding their Teeth; for that which would otherwiſe occaſion a Fever, and other miſchief, is thereby evacuated; and therefore the buſineſs muſt be left to Nature, eſpecially if the Flux be not large, and if the Child bear it well: but if it does not bear it well, the cauſe on which it depends muſt be removed, and the Humours muſt be carried off by ſuch Medicines as afterwards bind, as by Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup or Honey of Roſes ſolutive, or with Conſerve of Roſes made with Manna. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the decoction of the Seeds of Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, and all the Myrobalans, each two or three ounces; of the Simple Syrup of Roſes, one or two ounces, make a Gliſter,</hi> when the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63566:72"/>
Humours are cleanſed away, if the cauſe be hot, give the Syrups of dry'd Roſes, of Quinces, Myrtles, or Coral, or the Powders of Pearl, Coral, Maſtichs, Harts-horn, and Red Roſes, or the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Myrtles with a little Dragons Blood. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take of Nutmeg, and Maſtich, each one ſcruple, give them mixed with Syrup of Quinces.</p>
                     <p>Let the Belly be anointed with the Oyls of Myrtle, Roſes, and Maſtich. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of Oyls of Myrtle one ounce, of Oyls of Maſtich and Roſes, each half an ounce, wax a little and mingle them. <hi>Or foment the Belly with a decoction of Red Roſes, Mullein, and Plantain made in Red Wine Or,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of Red Roſes and Mullein, each one handful; of the Roots of Cyperus, two drams; of Maſtich, half an ounce: make a Linnen Bag, <hi>put theſe Ingredients into it, and boil it in red aſtringent Wine, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Bag to the Belly. Or,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of Quinces boiled in Red Wine, and pulped through a Sive, four ounces; of a Toaſt ſprinkled with Vinegar, one ounce and an half, with a ſufficient quantity of Oyl of Maſtich, make a Cataplaſm. <hi>Or,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Take of the Roots of Comfrey, one ounce;

of the Leaves of Platain and Mullein, each three handfuls; of Red Roſes, one handful; of Balauſtines, half an ounce, boil them in Water for a Bath.</p>
                     <p>But if the Looſneſs proceeds from a cold cauſe, and the Excrements are white give Syrup of Maſtich, or Syrup of Quinces, mixed with Mint Water; and outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply Medicines made of Mint, Wormwood, Maſtich, or Cummin. As,</p>
                     <p>Take of the Oyls of Nard, Maſtich, Mint, each half an onnce; of the Powder of Coral, half a dram; of Oyl of Nutmeg by expreſſion, two ſcruples, with a ſufficient quantity of Wax, make an Oyntment.</p>
                     <p>Or you may apply to the Belly, Mint boiled in Wine, or a cruſt of Bread moiſtened with Mint-Water, or a Bag of Mint, Wormwood, and Red Roſes, Maſtich, Nutmeg, and Cloves.</p>

                        <hi>Chap. XXV.</hi> Of Coſtiveneſs in Children.</head>
                     <p>IT often happens that Children are bound in their Bodies, or go to Stool ſeldomer than they ought, which happens by reaſon of a cold and dry In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperies of the Bowels, or becauſe the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63566:73"/>
Humours are viſcid and flegmatick; but this chiefly happens by a fault in the milk, when the Mother and Nurſes uſe a groſs, viſcid, and aſtringent Diet, and drink too ſparingly. A hot Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries of the Liver, Spleen, or Reins, may alſo occaſion Coſtiveneſs, or an obſtruction of the Gall, which ſhould ſtimulate the Guts to excretion.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe is manifeſt of it ſelf, but what is the cauſe of Coſtiveneſs, or of going to ſtool ſeldom, muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſidered. If a natural dryneſs of the Guts is the cauſe, the Belly is ſcarce ever orderly diſchârged, if groſs and viſcid Flegm is the cauſe, the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments when they are evacuated, are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with it; if any error in Diet of the Nurſe or Mother be the cauſe, it may be known by them. If a hot and dry Intemperies of ſome neighbouring part be the cauſe, it will be manifeſted by the ſigns of them; if Choler, which irritates the Guts to excretion, does not flow to them, the Excrecrements will not be tinctured, but be white, or of an Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour, and the colour of the Childs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will be yellow.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe grown People, whoſe Bellies are bound, are ſometimes very healthy,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63566:74"/>
Nature being accuſtomed to evacuate the liquid parts of the Excrements, or to diſcuſs them inſenſibly: but it ſeldom happens that Children, whoſe Bellies are bound, are very healthy; and it is beſt for Young People to have their Bellies open; for when they are bound, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours from the Excrements are caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole Body, and gripes, pains of the Head, and other ill Symptoms are occaſioned.</p>
                     <p>The cure of Coſtiveneſs in Children is to be performed two ways; firſt by removing the Cauſe, and then by looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Belly. Firſt we muſt endeavour that the cauſe of Coſtiveneſs be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and if the temper of the Bowels be cold and dry, Children muſt be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently waſhed, and when the Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is cold, you muſt uſe a Bath of hot Stomach-Herbs; when it is dry, you muſt uſe things that moiſten, as Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Marſh-mallows, Pellitory of the Wall, and Bears-breech.</p>
                     <p>If the Mother or Nurſe have uſed meats, which bind the Belly, as Quinces, Medlars, Pears, Beans, or the like, they muſt for the future, abſtain from all ſuch things, and inſtead of them, they muſt uſe ſuch things as molli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ie the Belly,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63566:74"/>
as Mallows, Raiſins, Pruns, and the like.</p>
                     <p>If the Infant be pretty big, and eats as well as ſucks, it muſt abſtain from all aſtringent things, and uſe ſuch things as looſen. If viſcid Flegm ſtick to the Guts, and the Excrements are covered with it, things that incide and cleanſe, muſt be uſed, as Honey of Roſes ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or Syrup of Horehound, or the like: If any neighbouring part be hot and dry, the Intemperies of it muſt be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected with the Syrups of Violets, or Succory, or with a decoction of Barly, or with an emulſion of the four greater cold Seeds, and the like. If the Choler does not paſs from the Gall-Bladder to the Guts, the obſtructed paſſages muſt be opened with a decoction of the roots of Graſs, of Fennel, Aſparagus, Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hair and the like.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt not always wait till the Cauſes are taken away; for the Belly muſt be ſeaſonably looſned to prevent ill ſymptoms, which may be done by external and internal Medicines. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Externals are Suppoſitories, which may be made of Honey and Salt, or with crude Honey put into a Rag, or
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63566:75"/>
with Lard, Soap, or the root of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows beſmeared with Butter. Or,</p>
                     <p>Take Mouſe-dung, half a dram, with Goats-ſuet, make a Suppoſitory.</p>
                     <p>But Nature muſt not be accuſtomed to the too frequent uſe of Suppoſitories<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if ſo, ſhe will not eaſe the Belly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe be provoked by them: it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore better to uſe Gliſters, and other external things, which may alſo remove the cauſe of the Diſeaſe, and correct the dryneſs of the Guts, or carry off the viſcid Flegm, according as their is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. As.</p>
                     <p>Take of common Oyl three or four ounces, of brown Sugar two or three drams, the Yolk of one Egg, of Salt three grains, make a Gliſter. <hi>Or,</hi>

                     <head>Chap. XXVI. <hi>Of Worms.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>WOrms are chiefly bred in the bowels of Children, and ſome have them in the Womb after they are born, they are generated by eating too much, and by the confuſion of the milk with other meats, and by reaſon of their hot and moiſt conſtitution, which is very apt to produce Worms; and the ſweet things which Children eat, and are delighted with, are apt to generate Worms; but they are chiefly generated by Fruit, which Children eat greedily.</p>
                     <p>There are three ſorts of Worms, round and long, like Earth-worms; broad and knotted, and the ſmall which are called Aſcarides. The firſt ſort are moſt frequent to Children.</p>
                     <p>If Worms are ejected by ſtool or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, there is no need of other ſigns: but becauſe they often lie hid a long while, before they are evacuated, and becauſe Children do not underſtand, or cannot diſcover what they all, there is need of ſigns to find out Worms. And firſt in general, when Worms lie hid in the Bowels, the mouth is full of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63566:78"/>
Spittle, which often runs out, and a peculiar ſtink exhales from the Mouth; they have terrible Dreams, as may be known by various motions in Sleep, they grind their Teeth after an unuſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in Sleep, their Sleep is diſturbed, they put forth their Tongues, ſcratch their Noſes often, and ſeem to Chew, they have a dry Cough, ſometimes they are troubled with Nauſeouſneſs, Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and Hickops, ſometimes they have too great an Appetite, and ſometimes none at all; and they are moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Thirſty, the Belly is ſwelled; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are bound in their Bodies, but moſt commonly they are looſe, their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is moſt commonly thick and white, they are grip'd, eſpecially when the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is empty, and when the Worms want to be fed: The Body is thin, by reaſon of the defect of Nouriſhment, which the Worms conſume. The Children are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten troubled with cold Sweats, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they have Fluſhing in their Faces, and preſently again they are Pale. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are ſeized with Convulſions, and often with ill Fevers: But theſe Signs belong chiefly to long and round Worms; for broad Worms, and the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones called <hi>Aſcarides</hi> have other ſigns;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63566:78"/>
for thoſe which have broad Worms have too great an Appetite, and unleſs they are ſupplied, they perceive a gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pain in their Bellies, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they faint away, if they are not preſently fed; but otherwiſe, the Gripes are very gentle; for the broad Worm is ſlow, and ſticks to the Bowels, and ſo does not eaſily move from place to place. The Body is much extenuated and weak, and ſometime alſo, ſome of the Signs above-mentioned are preſent: But the following is the moſt certain Sign, <hi>viz.</hi> if with the Excrements, ſome <hi>Corpuſcles</hi> like the ſeeds of gourds are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. When there are Worms called <hi>Aſcarides,</hi> there is a violent Itching in the Fundament, and a continual endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to go to Stool; for, ſticking in the right Gut, they continually provoke it.</p>
                     <p>Children have Worms often a long time without any great Detriment; but oftentimes grievous Symptoms come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, ſuch as we mentioned above. The <hi>Aſcarides</hi> are the leaſt hurtful; for they are ſmall, and ſtick in the right Gut, a place far diſtant from the noble Parts, and they are eaſily caſt out; yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they occaſion Ulcers in the right Gut. The broad Worms are very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63566:79"/>
cured, and often grow old with the Man, yet they do not occaſion gire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Symptoms, nor Death. The long and round Worms are the moſt hurtful for they induce ſometimes various Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and it has been found, that they have eaten thro' the Guts, and Belly too.  Thoſe that are thin and extenuated, are not ſo bad as thoſe that are thick and great, and full of Blood; for if they are thin, it is a ſign that the matter wherewith they are nouriſhed is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry copious; on the contrary, it is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, when they are big, there are many excrementious humours in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: White Worms are better than Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, Livid, Red, or Blackiſh. Thoſe that are of a plain Figure are better than thoſe that are of a Serpentine, or other prodigious Figure: It is better that they ſhould be evacuted by Stool, than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and worſt of all when they eat their way out. Worms are dangerous when they are accompanied with a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; if Convulſions, and a grinding of the Teeth come upon Worms, it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. If dead Worms cannot be expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the force of Remedies, or by the defect of Aliment, it is dangerous.</p>
                     <p>It is better to prevent the Generation
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63566:79"/>
of Worms in Infants, than to kill and expel them, when they are Generated. The Generation of Worms is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Diet and Medicines; the Diet ought to be ſuch, as no way conduces to the Generation of them, namely, Meats of good Juice, ſprinkled ſometimes with the Juice of Pomgranats, Oranges, or Citrons; ſweet, fat, and viſcid things are to be avoided, eſpecially the frequent uſe of Milk or Fiſh; alſo Summer Fruits, and Figs, Wine and clear Beer, is good againſt the Worms, it is good alſo to put into the Beer ſhavings of Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn.</p>
                     <p>As to medicines, we muſt endeavour that the matter which generates Worms, be either evacuated, or rendered unfit to generate them; and therefore the Belly muſt be kept open, that the matter may be gently Evacuated.

Amongſt Medicines, which reſiſt the generation of Worms, bitter things are moſt proper, as Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Scordium, and the like: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Children will not eaſily take them, thoſe things that are more pleaſant, may be ſometimes given, as a Decoction of the Roots of Graſs, and of Mouſe ear, the juice of Lemons, and Citron, and ſometimes a drop or two, of Spirit of Vitriol, may be given in a convenient Liquor.</p>
                     <p>But if it plainly appears, that Worms are generated, we muſt endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel them.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the Medicines, which may be conveniently given to Children, the following are the chief, Coralline, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, the Roots of white Dillany, Hartſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, the Water and Decoction of Graſs Roots, and Mercurius dulcis: As,</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>CHildren are afflicted with Ruptures, by the fall of the ſmall Guts into the Scrotum, the Peritoneum being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed, or broken by violent crying, a cough, and much ſtraining in going to Stool: But grown Children are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times burſten by violent motions of the Body, and indeed the Peritoneum in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is tender, ſo that it may be eaſily relaxed, or broken.</p>
                     <p>There is another Tumor, which often happens in the God of Children new Born, which is commonly reckoned amongſt Ruptures, and yet the Peritoneum is ſound; it proceeds from watery Humours aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the Belly. A Rupture, or Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Scrotum appears to ſight: But we muſt carefully mind, whether the Swelling be occaſioned by the falling of the Gut into the Scrotum, or from a watery Humour that flowes thither; in a Rupture the Swelling is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in one ſide of the Scrotum; for the Peritoneum is ſeldom broke in both ſides, and you may percieve that by touching with your Finger, and the hole,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63566:82"/>
through which the Gut falls may be felt with the Finger: But the watery ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Cod is moſt commonly on both ſides, and the Scrotum is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed than when there is a Rupture, and no Hole can be perceived in the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toneum, and no cauſe, that might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Rupture, went before, and there are ſigns of Crudity preſent.</p>
                     <p>A Rupture in Children is eaſier Cured than in grown perſons, for the Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum in them is ſoft and eaſily unites.</p>
                     <p>Some ſay, that all watery Swellings in the Scrotum, are harder cured than a Rupture, but this is falſe in Children; for experience Teſtifies, that this wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Swelling is eaſily Cured by Diſcutients, nay, it often goes away of it ſelf, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of time, the Humours being dried up.</p>
                     <p>In the Cure of a Rupture, we muſt endeavour to keep the Childrens Bodies open, that they do not fill their Bellies too much, nor cry much, and if they are ſome what grown, they muſt abſtain from all violent Motion.</p>
                     <p>You muſt lay them on their Backs, and gently put up the Gut, and apply a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Plaiſter, or Cataplaſm, and bind it on with a Truſs.</p>

                     <p>THe ſticking out of the Navel is near a kin to a Rupture; it happens when the Navel is not rightly bound, or when the Peritoneum is relaxed, and Humours, and Wind are collected there.</p>
                     <p>If the Midwife has not rightly cut the Navel, but left it longer than it ought to be it is incurable, but it is rather trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome than dangerous; but if the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, being conſolidated after the Birth, is afterwards two much extended or Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, or Ulcerated, it is often incurable, if it be neglected at firſt, and if it be not cured in Infancy, it may in the adult age occaſion a deadly Iliack paſſion, if the Guts that lie upon it are inflamed.</p>

                     <p>THe falling of the Fundament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens to Children, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of the looſeneſs of the Muſcle which ſhuts it, or by the too great moiſture, and ſoftneſs of it, which frequently follow upon a looſeneſs; or it ſometimes happens by the too great endeavours in going to Stool, or in a Teneſmus.</p>
                     <p>It is eaſily known, but whether it proceeds from too great moiſture, and from humours following to the Belly, or from too great endeavours in going to Stool, may be eaſily known, by the By-ſtanders. If it proceed from too great endeavours in going to Stool, it is eaſily cured, if it be taken in time; for the longer it is out of its place, the more it is altered, and the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly put up: but if it proceed from too great moiſture, it is difficultly cured, eſpecially if a looſeneſs accompany it;
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63566:87"/>
for it can ſcarce be perfectly cured, till the Flux be ſtopped: beſides Medicines that are neceſſary are not eaſily retained, and the vertue of them is apt to be ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Excrements.</p>
                     <p>The whole cure conſiſts in putting up the Fundament, and retaining it in its place; it ought therefore to be preſently put up; but if it be ſo ſwell'd that it cannot eaſily be put up, it muſt firſt be fomented with a decoction of Mallows and Marſh-mallows, and anointed with the Oyl of white Lillies; or the Infant muſt ſit in a bath made of the ſame Herbs; and afterwards the Fundament muſt be retained in its place by aſtringent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>

                     <p>THe Stone is frequently generated in Childrens Bladders, and very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in their Reins: whereas, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, old Men are generally afflicted with the Stone in the Kidneys.</p>
                     <p>The Stone in the Bladder in Children is chiefly generated by Milk, and if it be impure, not only Stones but alſo other Diſeaſes are generated; but all impure Milk does not breed the Stone, but only that which is made of groſs and viſcid Meats, and of ſuch as are apt to breed the Stone, eſpecially if the Child ſuck greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and burthen the Stomach with thoſe things that generate crudities: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

we ſee many Children fed with Milk, and with Pap, and yet are not troubled with the Stone, other Cauſes muſt be added, namely firſt, ſome weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Liver and Stomach, upon which account, the Meat is not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, and that which is unprofitable is not ſeperated, but much of the earthy, and Stone making Juice remains in the Chyle, and moreover the hot intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Reins is a cauſe.</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as there is any rudiment of a Stone, new Matter gathers about it daily, and grows to it; but Boys are more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Stone, than Girls, becauſe the urinary paſſages in Women is ſhorter, and more open than in Men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Matter which is apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Stone is eaſier ejected in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                     <p>You may know the Stone in Children by the following Signs; they make water with pain, and oft render it drop by drop, yea, often the Urine is quite ſuppreſſed, and that Urine which is evacuated is ſometimes clear as water, ſometimes as white as Milk, or like Whey, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſome Blood is evacuated with the Urine, and Sand appears with the Urine; Moreover Infants perceive an itching in

                     <p>If from the difficulty of Urine, and other ſigns it appear, that the Child is diſpoſed to the Stone, we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour all we can to prevent the breeding of it; and therefore the Stomach muſt not be filled with too much Meat, and the Nurſe and Infant muſt abſtain from all Meats, that are groſs and viſcid, and apt to generate the Stone, and the Belly muſt be always kept looſe, and the breeding of the Stone muſt be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by external and internal Medicines; and therefore a Bath muſt be prepared forthe Infant, made of Mallows, Marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mallows, Pellitory of the Wall, Parſly, Dill, and of the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>SOmetimes Children render their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine with difficulty and pain, and often by drops, and ſometimes it is quite ſtopt. In Children there are two cauſes of this, namely that groſs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour whereof the Stone is generated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which alſo occaſions a Stranguary and diſury, and then the Stone which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a ſuppreſſion of Urine: the cauſes which generate this groſs humour, are groſs and viſcid Milk, Pap made o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:63566:90"/>
The retention of the Urine plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, if there be a difficulty of Urine, it may be known by being rendred by drops, and by the crying of the Child, and the Urine is groſs and turbid: if there be a Stone, that may be found by the Catheter, and thereby it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the Orifice of the Bladder, to make a paſſage for the Urine.</p>
                     <p>This is a very dangerous Diſeaſe; for if it proceed from groſs Matter, it will turn to the Stone, if it be not timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved If the Suppreſſion of Urine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Stone, it is as dangerous as the Stone it ſelf, and ſuppreſſion of the Urine it ſelf, is dangerous, eſpecially in Children, becauſe no natural evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them can be ſuppreſſed without danger.</p>
                     <p>The cure therefore muſt be begun early, and it is in a manner the ſame with that which was propoſed in the foregoing Chapter of the Stone, namely the cauſes of the difficulty, or ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Urine muſt be removed; therefore care muſt be taken in the firſt place, that the Nurſe and Child uſe ſuch Meats, which do not conduce to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the humour that generates the Stone, and then Medicines muſt be given

                     <p>THis Diſeaſe began about ſixty Years ago, in the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> it ſeizes Children when they are about half an Year old. The proportion of the parts is Irregular. The Head is bigger than ordinary, ſo is the Face; the Wit is ſharper than is uſual in ſuch an Age, the Members are thin and waſted; the Skin is looſe; the Bones are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly bowed, and the Joynts knotted. The Breaſt is narrow and ſharp; the Ribs are knotted, and the Belly is big. Theſe things are obſerved outwardly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:63566:94"/>
As to the inward parts, the Liver is larger than uſual, the Stomach and Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els are larger, than in thoſe that are well; the Meſentery is affected with Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duls, that are larger than ordinary, the Lungs are ſtuff'd and ſwell'd, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Purulent, and often ſtick to the Pleura. The Jugular Veins, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotide Arteries are ſometimes larger then they ſhould be. All the parts are weak, and unfit for motion; and ſuch Children will Play only ſitting, and do not care to ſtand: And at length, the Head can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuſtained by the weak Neck.</p>
                     <p>Tho' this Diſeaſe is not commonly deadly, yet the Symptoms growing to a height, it ſometimes degenerates into a Con ſumption, hectic Fever, Dropſy of the Lungs, or an Aſcites, and ſo at length is deadly.</p>
                     <p>The ſooner it comes, the worſe it is, if it be not Cured before Children are five Years old, they are ever after very Sickly. An Itch coming upon this Diſeaſe, much conduces to the Cure.</p>
                     <p>As to the Cure, we muſt begin with Purging; becauſe moſt commonly, there is abundance of Flegmatick Humours heap'd up in the Belly, and the Bowels are frequently afflicted with Scrophulous Tumours.</p>

Sometimes immoderate ſweating afflicts the child, which if it follow a Feveriſh Fit is critical, and ought not to be raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtopt: but if it flow in ordinately, it is a ſign, that the Body is oppreſſed with ill Humours; therefore this ſort of ſweat muſt be corrected by a gentle Purge, eſpecially with Rhubarb.
