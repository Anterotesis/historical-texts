            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

there was any ſuch) then from a deſire of ſubverting Religion. Not

had not prevented them) of the ſlavery of ſoule and body, and this
agreeth with all: Or elſe for the ſtrangeneſſe of the diſcoveries of
their miſchiefes, (ſometime almoſt miraculous) before they have
come to their birth, or diſappointing them of their purpoſes, when
the Authours have put them in practiſe; and theſe two reſpects, the
one or the other, which may well denominate Gods goodneſſe to us,
in diſappointing them to be great, may be found in all likewiſe. So

us, for that cauſe, that inſtead of extirpating Popery and ſuperſtition
(a thing nor hard to be done in humane reaſon, if the children of

their Religion tolerable, and nothing ſo dangerous to ſoul or body

Religion of ſuch a generation, as count they doe God good ſervice,
by killing us? witneſſe the bloudy Perſecution under Qu. <hi>Mary,</hi> and
the damnable plot of the Gun-powder-Treaſon. Yet ſome there are
that would ſeem Proteſtants, and yet deny that their cruelty was
ſuch, as the Authour of the Engliſh Martyrology makes the <hi>Marian</hi>
perſecution to be: Others of no ſmall eſteem in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
inſtead of acknowledging <hi>Foxes</hi> Hiſtory a Monument of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
call it a Book fraught with Traitors and Heretiques. And
for the Gun-powder conſpiracy, ſome affirm it the deeds of a few
male-contents, farre from the approbation of the Catholiques, others
as falſely, that there was no ſuch Treaſon intended, but that it was an
invention of him, whom in reverence I forbeare to name. But yet
this may incourage us, that God will ſtill preſerve us, for their ſakes
that have now and heretofore ſtoutly defended Gods true Religion,
and that in very many places of this Land, we have had thoſe that
with all their power have oppoſed the very beginnings of Popery.
But wonderfull it is, and ſcarcely credible, that any ſhould ſo much
have forgotten the Gun-powder-Treaſon, as to ſay, that they would
rather truſt a Papiſt then a Puritan; as if they believed not there was
any ſuch Treaſon, or had forgotten it; or that they thought that
thoſe whom men call Puritans, were traiterouſly minded, and bloudy
perſons. In the moſt Reverend and Judicious Aſſembly of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
a Member of that Aſſembly, declared in particulars, how the
beſt men have bin branded with the name of Puritan, (it was where
any man might freely have ſpoken) yet no man contradicted him.
If it be given ſometime to the beſt, without queſtion thoſe ordinarily
called by that bie-name, are none of the worſt; becauſe from like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
at leaſt divers men have one Name. We will acknowledge hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
among them, but becauſe one is ſuch, no man will conclude
they muſt be all ſo. No man of us almoſt abhorreth the name of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
to be given him, and yet of theſe, ſome will lie, others will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52557:5"/>
ſteale, and a third ſort will do worſe. Since this Parliament (perhaps I
imagine the time, and reaſon aright) the Jeſuites and Jeſuited have
invented a ſtrange name for ſuch men, and let fall the reproach of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
They call them by a figurative name, which is ignorantly ſpoken
by moſt, falſly by all; and as the roundeſt figure is of the largeſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
ſo they have ſhaped them a name, which larger then <hi>Preciſian,
Browniſt,</hi> or the like, ſurroundeth every one, that thinketh it not a juſt
thing to rail againſt the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or curſe the Fathers of his Country.

from the <hi>French</hi> King of 12000. crowns by the yeare, and Duchy

of <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Loraigne</hi> Qu. <hi>Dowager;</hi> a thing for a woman to be Regent
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but once before known. She had made many promiſes
unto the <hi>Scots</hi> of the freedome of exerciſing the Proteſtant Religion,
but being now ſetled in the Regency, ſhe diſcovered her mind whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bent to alter Religion. She told her friends in plain tearmes, that
though the Miniſters whom ſhe named ſhould preach more honeſtly,
or (as ſhe called it) more ſincerely then they had done, yet they
ſhould all be baniſhed. She expreſſed at the death of a young-man,
whom ſhe ſeemed to bewaile, being ſlain, for that his father had not
rather excuſed him, being a ſtout defender of the reformed Religion,
that ſhe was cruelly minded toward the Profeſſours thereof. <hi>Eaſter</hi>
alſo was commanded to be celebrated after the Romiſh cuſtome. For
theſe and divers other overtures of her, Meſſengers were ſent unto her,
to deſire her to be good to the Proteſtants, and to remember the many
promiſes ſhe had made unto them to that end. But all in vaine. She
told the Earle of <hi>Glencarne,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Cambell,</hi> who were ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her; that performance of promiſes was to be expected from Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
no farther then ſtood with their profit. Upon this they told one
another that they then renounced all obedience and duty toward her.
Violence now with art was to be uſed for effecting her purpoſe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Religion.</p>
               <p>Hereupon advice was given by <hi>Labroſſe</hi> a French Commander in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> to put to death all the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for that the
people being bereaved of their heads, would after be eaſily brought to
undergo any yoake; but that things might appeare with a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
colour, there was a ſhew, as if the Queen had laboured, and
would endeavour to convince her adverſaries in Religion by no other
way but by arguments. Into <hi>Scotland</hi> were ſent 3. Sorbon Doctours
with the Biſhop of <hi>Amiens.</hi> But with what ſafety might any man
diſpute with them, when he that did ſo was in the midſt of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
enemies, and there was greateſt feare of violence from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puters
themſelves. For the Biſhop of <hi>Amiens</hi> counſelled the Queen
Regent, that if any there were which ſhould be found to diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
theſe Romiſh Decrees, he ſhould be put to death, yea even
thoſe who but ſeemed to be of another mind only, We are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52557:6"/>
that the Qu. Regent put in practice the fore-going counſels,
perhaps the time was not altogether ſeaſonable, nor doe we take every
ſingle action, which might conduce to the ſubverting of Religion, to
be a conſpiracy: but we may well eſteem by the Queens words,
the Counſellours and Commanders intents and purpoſes, the placing
of ſuch a Regent, all this to be a continued conſpiracy, to ſtrangle in
the birth the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> having yet ſcarcely taken breath in
the world. Not long after the Qu. Regent dyeth, and although it
will perhaps be ſaid, there was no diſcovery of any conſpiracy which
was in acting (as to put to death all the Nobility, or all that would
dare diſpute againſt the Biſhop or Doctors, could be no eaſie taske to
goe about; the latter, becauſe the death of their laſt Martyr <hi>Walter
Mille</hi> did ſeem ſo grievous unto them, and if any more ſhould ſuffer,
how would ſuch a thing be taken by <hi>French-men,</hi> people of another
Nation?) It may be objected from the above named arguments, that
there wanted no endeavour. After the death of the Mother, the
Daughter returning into <hi>Scotland,</hi> was married unto <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
who being of the ſame Religion with the Queen, and they both
a brothers and ſiſters children, did ſtrongly maintain Popery againſt
the Proteſtant Religion. We cannot imagine here that any thing
ſhould be contrived againſt the lives of thoſe Princes by a Popiſh party
to overthrow Religion. For to ſubvert Religion no way could be
found better, then by maintaining in life and honour ſuch Princes as
theſe two were, who profeſſed and maintained Popery; as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to ſubvert Religion, Laws, Liberties and the like, the beſt means
are thorough the ſides of ſuch Kings and Queens as are projectors and
maintainers of them. So the holy Scripture declareth by word and
example, <hi>I will ſmite the Shepheard and the ſheepe ſhall be ſcattered.</hi>
For this Queen was ſo far from furthering the eſtabliſhment of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
nay from connivence at thoſe who ſhould goe about any ſuch
matter, that ſhe profeſſed that ſhe would follow the example of her
couſin Qu, <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which was no other thing then main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
in her dominions the Pope and Popery, and puniſhing the
contrary minded as Hereticks. It will not be thought (I ſuppoſe)
that either the Papiſts at home in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or thoſe in <hi>France,</hi> or els
where, would go about to take away the lives of ſuch Princes, whoſe
lives ſecured their <hi>Religion.</hi> For what was attempted againſt the life
(and moſt unhappily ſucceeded,) of the King, was not any way to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52557:7"/>
ſubvert Popery; becauſe the deed was committed, and the plot chiefly
layed by Papiſts. It rather was undertaken againſt the life of this Prince,
by ſome, to make way for their own family to inherit the Crowne of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> by others, to get the Kingdome, and admit any Religion.
But thoſe which look farther into matters judge this act to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
againſt a Profeſſour of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, that he being taken out
of the way, another might ſucceed, which had greater power and
friends to bring to paſſe, what K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Queens husband, had a
mind, but not power enough to do. And that made thoſe which were
no enemies to the King in point of Religion, not diſlike the Treaſon
for the ends ſake. I cannot be of their minds altogether, who judge that
of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> being now in reſtraint in <hi>England,</hi> not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
married to Earle <hi>Bothuile,</hi> and preſently to deſire a divorce from
him, and to require that he ſhould be ſummoned within the ſpace of a
very few days, to return into the Kingdom, to make anſwer and defence
to the Queens ſuit of divorce, to have proceeded from the changing
fancy of the Queen, not ſo much from conſcience. For it was as well
known before her departure into <hi>England,</hi> as after, that Earle <hi>Bothuile</hi>
had a wife living when he married the Queen; in ſo much that at the
publiſhing of the banes of their Matrimony, one ſtood up in the Church
and forbad them. It was generally thought that it was, that a way
might be open for the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who then made ſuit unto her.
He indeed was ſuch a man, as being of great wealth, mighty in friends,
and ſingular abilities of mind, could better bring about what was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
then a man of no great riches at any time, but was now in extreme
poverty and diſgrace in the Dominions of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and

Dukes Secretary, one <hi>Higford,</hi> who was commanded by the Duke to
burne ſuch Letters as came from the Qu. of <hi>Scots,</hi> but did it not, and hid
them under a mat in his chamber, and being under examination, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them to be produced. This was when the two Earles of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
and <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> had ſecretly complotted to raiſe Armes, and
not long after the Dukes apprehenſion, they fell into open Rebellion.
One of the Letters which was ſhewen at the Dukes arraignment was
to this purpoſe. That the Qu. was ſorry that the ſaid Earles of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>
and <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> were in Armes, before the Dukes forces were

called it a bloudy Law. Preſently after he was accuſed of practiſing the

the Queens pardon for breaking into the chamber and wounding one <hi>Hare</hi>
(for which he was condemned) he being a ſworne ſervant to the Queen.
From <hi>England</hi> he went into <hi>France,</hi> and was reconciled. Afterward at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
in conſultation with <hi>Benedict Palmeus,</hi> he told him that he had found
out a way to help the afflicted Catholikes in <hi>England:</hi> if the Pope or ſome

               <p>NOw againe there was a moſt abominable treaſon conſpired and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily

<hi>Gilbert Gifford,</hi> and <hi>Hodgeſon</hi> Prieſts, perſwaded one <hi>John Savage</hi> a
bloody fellow to undertake to kill Queen <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> To hide their

who were very carefull to fore-ſee all danger, they wrote a
Book, in which they adviſe the Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> not to goe about
to hurt the Queen. For they were to uſe no other weapons againſt
their Prince, then the Chriſtian weapons of Teares, Faſting, Prayers

that <hi>George Gifford,</hi> one of the Queens Penſioners had ſworne to kill
the Queen, and for that cauſe had gotten from the <hi>Guiſes</hi> a very great
ſumme of Mony. The <hi>Eaſter</hi> following <hi>John Ballard</hi> an Engliſh

was drawn by them, ſhewing him moſt aſſured hopes of honour from her,
to addict himſelfe to them; and by their meanes had favourable letters
from her. <hi>Ballard</hi> and <hi>Babington</hi> conferred together concerning the
invaſion of <hi>England;</hi> but it was not deemed a thing could be done, Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> being alive. Then <hi>Ballard</hi> informed <hi>Babington,</hi> that <hi>Savage</hi>
had undertooke to kill her. <hi>Babingtons</hi> advice was, that it ſhould not
be committed to <hi>Savage</hi> alone, leaſt perhaps he might be hindered, but
to ſix reſolute men, of which number <hi>Savage</hi> ſhould be one. Vpon this
<hi>Babington</hi> took into his conſideration the Ports, in which the invaders
ſhould land the confederates, that ſhould joyne in the act of murdering
Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and delivering the <hi>Scots</hi>-Queen. In the mean time a letter
was brought from the impriſoned Queen to <hi>Babington</hi> in a ſecret character,
blaming <hi>Babingtons</hi> long ſilence; but he excuſed it, becauſe ſhe was under
the cuſtody of Sr. <hi>Amice Paulet</hi> a ſevere keeper, declared unto her, that which
<hi>Ballard</hi> and he had reſolved before, and that himſelf with one hundred
more would deliver her. The purpoſe by her letters unto <hi>Babington</hi> was
commended: and it was adviſed that it ſhould be undertaken conſiderately,
and nothing ſhould be moved before they were ſure of externall forces;
that they ſhould make an aſſociation, as if they feared the Puritans, that ſome

Barnwell, Charnick</hi> and <hi>Savage,</hi> took an Oath to kill her with their
own hands. <hi>Babington</hi> enjoyned that whoſoever was admitted into the
conſpiracy, ſhould take the Oath of ſecrecy. They were ſo confident of the
ſucceſſe, that they did not feare to cauſe the undertakers of the Treaſon to

had bin preſent, the deed might eaſily have bin done. That the aid from

<hi>Savage</hi> in his wicked reſolution, and that letters might ſafely be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him to the Q. of <hi>Scots. Gifford</hi> corrupted with mony, or for feare,
revealed the plot to <hi>Walſingham,</hi> and promiſed to communicate unto him,
all his letters. <hi>Walſingham</hi> kindly uſed him, ſent him into <hi>Stafford</hi>-ſhiere
to Sir <hi>Amice Paulet,</hi> in a letter perſwading Sir <hi>Amice,</hi> to ſuffer ſome of his
ſervants to be corrupted by him. <hi>Gifford</hi> for ſome gold prevailed with Sir
<hi>Amice</hi> his Brewer, who conveyed the letters to and from <hi>Gifford,</hi> which
by meſſengers for that end appointed, came ever to the hands of Sir <hi>Francis
Walſingham,</hi> who coppied out the letters, and by the art of <hi>Thomas Philips</hi>
found out the character, and by the help of one <hi>Gregory</hi> ſealed them up, that
none could ſuſpect them opened, and then ſent the letters as they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
The Queen hereupon commanded <hi>Ballard</hi> to be apprehended, which

               <head>The Maſſacre and Treaſon in Ireland, extracted out of the Iriſh Remonſtrance,
and Irelands Teares.</head>
               <p>VPon the 23 day of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. a moſt prodigious and nefarious viper
gnawing the bowels of its native-parent <hi>Ireland,</hi> burſt out of the womb
therof, &amp; viſibly appeared moſt epidemically deſtructive to that whole State
and Kingdome. It had lien long (as ſome of the Rebels reported) undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
but was all that while hatching by many hot and high-built hopes,
both by fortaine and domeſtick encouragements. The accurſed Midwives
of this baſtard-birth were Popiſh-Prieſts, Pryers and Jeſuites, together
with other fire-brands and incendiaries of that State and Kingdom. Their
hideous and helliſh hopes were mightily ſupported and corroborated by
ſtrong aſſiſtance from <hi>Spaine, France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> together with deeply
engaged aſſurance of full correſpondency in <hi>England,</hi> and an equivalent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> beſides their great encouragements by Popiſh Buls from
<hi>Rome,</hi> authorizing the ſpeedy and immediate Surrender of all ſuch places
of ſtrength as they had beleagured, promiſing free pardon of all ſins what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
before hand committed by any of them, tending to the advancement
of this great work, thundring (or rather roaring) out excommunications
againſt any that ſhould refuſe ſo to joyn with them therin, terming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the Catholike Army, and the ground of their work (as all their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
and bloody plots are) the Catholike-cauſe. Their deſperate and
moſt divelliſh reſolution was therin not to leave a drop of <hi>Engliſh</hi> blood in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſo conſequently not the leaſt ſparke or glimpſe of the Goſpell
and pure Proteſtant Religion, giving out in words and deſigning in their
hearts, that the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Edenborough</hi> and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of <hi>Dublia</hi> were to be ſurpized by their Faction in all theſe places all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one day. In all which time (this therefore might the more eaſily have
bin done, eſpecially in <hi>Ireland</hi>) there was not the leaſt feare or ſuſpition of
treachery; yet there were (a little before the day of this bloudy-birth) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
gathered together about 400 <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, elected out of moſt parts
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> deſperate and damnably bloudy minded perſons, deſigned for
this horrid and helliſh attempt, who had all privately convayed and ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
themſelves in ſeverall places of the City and Suburbs of <hi>Dublin,</hi> wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and expecting the time and watch-word, when to give the on-ſet. In
this plot all the Popiſh Nobility and men of quality in <hi>Ireland</hi> were inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed,
and it was profeſſed by that moſt impious and barbarous Arch-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
Sr. <hi>Philim O Neal,</hi> that what he and they did was by the conſent of the
<hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Yea ſome of them have bin ſo impiouſly audacious,
as to profeſſe and perſwade others of their accurſed confederates to believe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52557:18"/>
that they had regall authority for it, and were ſo bold as to term themſelvs
the Queens Army.</p>
               <p>And for the more ſtrongly proſecution of this their moſt exorbitant vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany,
the Conſpirators and Traitors entred into a moſt accurſed Covenant
(juſt as our Popiſh-Pouder-Traitors did in their damnable deſigne) and
bound themſelves by an oath of Confederation and Secrecy, <hi>Reily</hi> a prime
Popiſh-Prieſt and others (like his father the Devill) compaſſing the Earth

whole Kingdom. And as the hearts and tongues of theſe moſt baſe and
abhominable Traitors and Rebels, were boundleſly and extremely cruell
in intention and profeſſion: So it pleaſed the Lord for the ſins of his
people there, to permit power unto theſe barbarous Rebels to act with
their hands the moſt accurſed and profane perpetrations that ever Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
eyes beheld or eares have heard of, both for impiety againſt God
and his holy Goſpell, and almoſt unexpreſſible inhumanity toward the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52557:18"/>
true Profeſſours therof among them, blaſpheming our God, ſtripping
his Servants ſtarke naked, and then bidding them goe to their God
to be cloathed againe; breaking into Churches, burning Pulpits, with
extream hatred to our Religion, and exceedingly tryumphing in all
their impieties. Dragging ſome Profeſſours of the Goſpell by the
haire of their heads through the Streets into the Churches, and there
ſtripping and whipping them, and with moſt cruell and taunting
termes abuſing them, telling them if they came to morrow they
ſhould heare the like Sermon. Yea ſo exceſſively impious was their
hatred to the Goſpell of Chriſt, that they tooke the ſacred bookes of
the holy Scriptures and caſt them into kennels and puddles of dirt
and mire, treading them under-foot and leaping and skipping on them
and (ò horrid impiety) cauſing a bagg-pipe to play all the while,
and bidding a plague upon them, ſaying they were the cauſe of all
quarrels, and burning ſome, and ſaying it was hell-fire that was then
flaming, and wiſhing they had all the Bibles in Chriſtendome that they
might uſe them ſo.</p>
               <p>And as for the moſt inhumane and more than <hi>Scythian</hi> cruelties of

in child-bed drawne out thence and caſt into priſon; one delivered of

two children taken out of her, and all caſt unto and eaten up by Swine. One
ſtab'd in the breſt her child ſucking. An infant cruelly murthered, whom
they found ſucking his dead mother, ſlain by them the day before. A child
of 14 years of age taken from his mother, in her ſight caſt into a Bog-pit
and held under water while he was drowned. Together with many other
yet more horrid, hideous and more than ſavage or beaſt-like barbarities, too
terrible for me any farther to relate, but may be more fully found in that
moſt lamentable Remonſtrance of this <hi>Iriſh-Rebellion,</hi> and all there proved

The good Admirall, then, replyed, it is not long ſince I diſpoſed my ſelf to

The Common-people (like Prieſt, like people) ran to the Admirals lodging,
where they cut-off his hands and his privy members, and drew his body
for the ſpace of three dayes about the Towne; which done it was borne to
the Gibbet of <hi>Monifaucon</hi> and there hanged by the feet. The Gentlemen
officers of the Chamber, Governours, Tutours and houſhold Servants of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52557:21"/>
the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> the French Kings brother in law, lately married to
his ſiſter, and of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> were driven out of their Chambers
where they ſlept in the <hi>Lonure,</hi> and forced into the Court, were there
maſſacred in the Kings owne preſence. The like was done to the Lords
and Gentlemen that lay round about the Admiralls lodgings, and then
throughout the Towne, in ſuch ſort that the number ſlain that Sunday at
night and the 2 next dayes enſuing, within the Towne or City of <hi>Paris</hi>
and the Suburbs thereof, was eſteemed to be above 10000 perſons, Lords,
Gentlemen, Pages, Servants, Juſtices of all ſorts, Schollars, Lawyers,
Phyſitians, Merchants, Artificers, Women, Maids, and Boyes, not
ſparing little children in their Cradles, no nor in their Mothers bellies.
The Courtiers of the Kings guard and ſtrangers that maſſacred theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
ſaid, that in one day, by weapons and diſorder they had ended
thoſe proceſſes, which pen, paper, ſentences of Juſtice nor open warre
could not find the means to do or execute in 12 years ſpace. And thus theſe
moſt honourable Proteſtant Lords and Gentlemen, falſly accuſed and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of conſpiracies and practiſes againſt the King, being ſtarke naked,
thinking only upon their reſt, ſcarce awakened out of their ſleepe, utterly
unarmed, in the hands of infinite, cruell, crafty and moſt treacherous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
not having ſo much leaſure as to breath, were barbaronſly ſlain, ſome
in their beds, others on the roofes of houſes, and in whatſoever other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where they might be found. It would be too tedious to recite at
large the names and ſurnames of all the honorable perſonages of divers qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
that were then ſlain and butchered, it ſufficeth that their names are
written in heaven, and that their death (though ſhamefull and deſpicable
in the ſight and preſence of men of this world) is precious in the ſight of
the Lords moſt holy Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Now let the tender hearted Chriſtian Reader, but conſider and ponder in
his heart, how ſtrange and horrible a thing it might be in a great Town or
City, to ſee at the leaſt 60000 men with Piſtols, Pikes, Courtlaſſes, Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,
Knives and other ſuch bloody inſtruments, run ſwearing and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming
the ſacred Majeſty of God throughout the ſtreets, and into mens
houſes, where moſt cruelly they maſſacred all whomſoever of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they met, without regard of eſtate, condition, ſex or age, the ſtreets
paved with bodies cut and hewed in peeces, the gates and entries of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Palaces and publike places died with bloud. A horrible plague of ſhou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and howlings of the murtherers mixed with continuall blows of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols
and Calivers, together with the pittifull cryes of thoſe that were
murthered, the bodies caſt out at windowes upon the ſtones, drawne
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52557:22"/>
through the dirt with ſtrange noyſe and whiſtlings, the breaking open of
doors and windows with bils, ſtones and other furious inſtruments, the
ſpoyling and plundering of houſes, Carts carrying away the ſpoyles and
dead bodies, which were throwne into the river of <hi>Soame,</hi> all red with
blood, which ran in great ſtreams through the Town, and from the Kings
Pallace into the ſaid river.</p>
               <p>As for the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> himſelf, and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> they were
called into the Kings preſence, who muſt himſelfe ſpeak with them, who
with his own mouth certified them, what had thus paſt all this while, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that he had ſaved their lives only upon condition that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their Religion, and follow his; otherwiſe that they muſt look for the
like puniſhment that their Adherents had and ſhould receive. The King
of <hi>Navarr</hi> beſought the King to remember his promiſe of alliance newly
contracted, and not to conſtraine him in his Religion. The Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> alſo more fervently anſwered, that the King had given his faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him and to all thoſe of the Religion, with ſo ſolemn a Proteſtation and
Vow,<note place="margin">Mark here the vowes of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Princes.</note> that he could not be perſwaded that his Majeſty would falſifie ſuch
an authentick oath, and that thereupon he had thus farre yeelded to his
Majeſties demands, and faithfully performed what he had required of him
on this aſſurance. But as touching the Religion, whereof the King had
granted him the free exerciſe, and God the true knowledge, to whom he
was to make an account therin, for this his Religion, he ſaid, he was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſolved to remaine moſt conſtant therin, and which he would alwayes
maintain to be true, although it were with the loſſe of his life. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
of the Prince, ſet the King into ſuch a choller that he began to call
him rebell, ſeditious and ſon of a ſedit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ous perſon, with horrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
to cauſe them to looſe their heads, if within 3 dayes they tooke not
better counſell: and indeed theſe threatnings, and other crafty carriages
in this way, ſo wrought on both theſe Princes, at laſt, that they
forſooke their Faith and firſt Love, and turned to Romiſh abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Now the King perceiving that this maſſacre of <hi>Paris</hi> would not
quench the fire, but rather kindle it the more, fearing leaſt thoſe of
the Religion in his other Provinces and Townes might aſſemble and
unite themſelves together, and ſo give them new worke; he with
the ſpeedy adviſe of his Counſellours, ſent two Meſſengers with two
ſeverall Meſſages, the one to the Governours and ſeditious Catholikes
of his remoter Townes, wherein were many of the Religion, with
expreſſe command to maſſacre them; the other containing certaine
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52557:22"/>
Letters to the Governours of Provinces, by which he pretended this
Maſſacre to be perpetrated by the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the Admirall
to be murthered on a particular and private quarrell twixt them two,
and that the Kings honeſt meaning and intention was utterly againſt
theſe things, and ſeriouſly to maintaine his former Edict of a generall
Pacification; and therfore that his care and vigilancy had ceaſed it
the ſame day it began; and yet (as my Authour recordeth in his
Hiſtory) on the Tewſday following, being the 26. of the ſame <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi>
the King accompanied with his Brethren and the chiefeſt of
his Court, went to his Court of Parliament, and there publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in expreſſe tearms, that whatſoever had hapned in <hi>Paris,</hi> was
done, not only by his conſent, but alſo by his commandement, and
of his own motion. And as for his other former mentioned Meſſage
and Letter to other Townes and Provinces, for the maſſacring of thoſe
of the Religion among them alſo; his bloudy command herein was
immediately put in execution at <hi>Lyons</hi> and many other places, where
the poore Proteſtants were murthered and maſſacred in moſt hideous
and horrible manner, by thoſe mercileſſe and inhumane Butchers of
bloody <hi>Rome,</hi> who knockt down the innocent Chriſtians among them,
as ſo many doggs, cut their throats, mangled their bodies, ſlaſh'd off
their hands with great ſharp knives, as on their knees they held them
up to the villains, praying for the ſparing of their lives; yea, and
were knowne to rip up their bellies and take out their fat from their
bowels, and to ſell it to their Apothecaries to make medicines. Thus
alſo in thoſe remoter parts from <hi>Paris</hi> were very many thouſands of
the Religion murthered, without any difference or diſtinction either
of Sex or Age. And ſo deeply enraged was the King and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and ſo deſperately reſolved to root out and extirpate the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of thoſe of the Religion, eſpecially of any note or eminency,
that the King having at laſt got into his cuſtody one <hi>Briquemant</hi> a
noble <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, of the age of ſeventy yeares, one that had
valiantly imployed himſelfe in the Service of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi>
having been found in the Houſe of the Embaſſadour of <hi>England,</hi> then
reſident in <hi>France,</hi> wherein he had hid himſelfe, whiles the greateſt
fury of the maſſacre was executed, was by the Kings command put
in cloſe priſon, together with another vertuous Gentleman <hi>Cavagnes</hi>
Maſter of the Requeſts, both which Gentlemen bare great affection,
both unto the Religion, and alſo unto the renowned Admirall, and
were themſelves of great eſteeme and reputation in <hi>France;</hi> but the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52557:23"/>
King having them now faſt in hould, threatned to teare them in
peeces upon the rack, if they would not write and ſigne with their
hands, that they had conſpired with the Admirall to kill the King,
his Brethren, the Queene and the King of <hi>Navarr.</hi> But they having
moſt conſtantly and juſtly refuſed to avouch ſo horrible a lye againſt
their owne and their godly friends innocencies, were racked and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
tormented, and by a moſt unjuſt ſentence of the Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in <hi>Paris,</hi> they were both declared guilty of Treaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to be hanged upon a gibbet, which was accordingly execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
The Queen-Mother leading the King, her two ſonnes and the
King of <hi>Navarr</hi> her brother in law to ſee the Execution. Her
Counſellours thinking that at this laſt exploit, what they had wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
projected (namely, the falſe transferring of the cauſe of this
bloody maſſacre on a treaſonable plot, intended by the Admirall and
others of the Religion againſt the King, as was fore-mentioned)
would now be wrought out and effected, if <hi>Briquemant</hi> in preſence
of all the people, now at the time of his expected death would aske
pardon of the King, withall (to worke it on the more) ſending
one to him to certifie and aſſure him that ſo he might eaſily ſave his
life, for the King was mercifull, and that he ſhould have pardon, if
he would deſire it, confeſſing this fact wherewith hee was charged.
But <hi>Briquemant</hi> anſwered boldly and with a good courage; that it
belonged not unto him, but to the King to aske pardon of God for
ſuch an heynous offence: That hee would never aske pardon for
a fault, wherein hee had not offended, but knew himſelfe to bee
moſt innocent, whereof hee called GOD to witneſſe, deſiring him
to pardon the Kings ſo great diſloyalty and cruelty. <hi>Cavagnes</hi> alſo
the other noble Gentleman, did the like untill hee dyed. Inſomuch
that this execution (contrary to the Kings expectation) ſerved to
no other end, but more to publiſh the iniquity of all thoſe cruell ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micides,
and of all their moſt pernicious counſels.</p>

that would make amends for their patient expectation, and produce much good to their
holy Union. The <hi>Monck</hi> being now fully ordered and inſtructed for the execution of the
deſigned plot, departed from <hi>Paris</hi> and went toward S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Clon.</hi> As ſoon as he was departed
the D. <hi>de Main</hi> cauſed more then 200 of the principall Citizens and other rich men whom
he knew to have friends and credit with the K. party, to be taken priſoners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a gage, to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52557:24"/>
ſave his <hi>Monck,</hi> if after the attempt he were ſtaied or arreſted. The <hi>Monck</hi> being come to S.
<hi>Clon,</hi> and preſented to ſpeak with the K., he having fained that he had letters from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
of <hi>Harlay</hi> and <hi>Credence</hi> on his part, the K. cauſed him to be called into his Chamber,
vvhere was none with the K, ſave only the L of <hi>Bellegard,</hi> chief Gen. of the ſame, and the
Procurator generall, whom he deſired to retire a while, the more privately to give eare and
audience unto him; the undaunted villain having addreſſed himſelfe vvith a countenance
very modeſt and demure, neare the K. perſon. The <hi>Monck</hi> now perceiving himſelf alone
vvith the K. and an oportunity put into his hand to do the deed he mainly came for, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
his audacious countenance more and more fixedly, drew out of one of his ſleeves
a paper, which he preſented to the K. and out of the other, a ſharp knife, with which he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
and ſuddainly ſheathed a thruſt within the K. ſmall ribs, the K. being ſeriouſly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the preſented paper, but thereupon perceiving himſelf wounded, pluckt the knife out
of the vvound, and therwith ſtruck the <hi>Monck</hi> above the eye, and thereupon ſome of his
Gentlemen hearing a noyſe and much buſtling within, came running in moſt violently,
who ſeeing what vvas done, and moved with vvrath at the indignity of ſo execrable a
fact, could not contain, but forthwith killed the murtherer with their Svvords, who there
expired and vvent (like <hi>Iudas</hi>) to his own place, being canonized and adored for this deed
by thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh-League,</hi> but deteſted and abhorred by thoſe that clave to the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-royall
and party of the Religion. The K. being carried to his bed, the Phyſitians and
Chirurgeons dreſt his wound, and ſuppoſed it had not bin mortall, but the next day, he
dyed of it, and left the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> to his brother, <hi>Henry</hi> D. of <hi>Burbon</hi> and K. of

or rare myſteries, namely, that he was a King and had no Crowne; he was a husband,
but had no wife; he waged warre and had no mony: which ſeeming riddle is thus reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
he was King of <hi>France,</hi> but was long time kept from the kingly poſſeſſion of his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52557:25"/>
Crown and Royalty. He was married, but could not enjoy his Queen: He waged vvarre
but not being able to pay his Souldiers, his neighbour Princes came in as Volunteers and
ſerved in his warres at their own charge. Yea, I ſay, ſuch a noble and renowned Prince,
in matter of Religion, in his former dayes eſpecially, that it being obſerved by ſome of
his Nobles, Commanders in armes, how much he confided in thoſe of the Religion, in
moſt of his greateſt and weightieſt affairs, ſome of them ſaid unto him, they marvelled
he would ſo much rely on their fidelity. To whom his anſwer vvas as pithy as pious, that
he vvould never be afraid to confide in thoſe, the principles of whoſe Religion vvas,
<hi>Never to eat their God, nor kill their King.</hi> Now from all theſe remarkable paſſages of
the plots and conſpiracies of theſe barbarous and bloody minded <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> I vviſh the
godly and impartiall Reader, whoſe eyes the Lord hath in any meaſure opened to ſee the
truth of things; to take notice briefly of theſe 3 particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt of the admirable providence and good hand of God in preſerving thoſe Princes
and States from the moſt puiſſant forces, and moſt politick frauds and villanies of
Traitors and enemies of his Truth and Goſpell, ſo long as they loyally loved and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
it; this being moſt cleare and evident in our bleſſed Qu <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of ever glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
memory, in the ſtate of <hi>Geneva, Holland,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of the high diſpleaſure and juſt jealouſie of the Lord againſt thoſe Princes
or people who halt 'twixt a opinions in matter of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or maintaine mixtures in
his pure vvorſhip, vvhich he hath alſo manifeſted againſt Princes, otherwiſe moſt noble
and renowned, potent and prudent, permitting and raiſing up baſe and ignoble hands to
bereave them of their lives, as hath bin clearly demonſtrated in theſe two laſt great Princes
of <hi>France, Henry</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and might be farther proved by many ſuch like Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
extant in Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, of the moſt bloody and blaſphemous principles of <hi>Romes</hi> Religion,
teaching and encouraging the practiſe and perpetration of ſuch horrid and hideous mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and maſſacres of the Lords moſt harmleſſe and innocent lambes juſtifying King-kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and Country-deſtroying machinations, plots and conſpiracies, and all theſe under a
moſt execrable pretence of advancing their Catholik-cauſe, forſooth, as if the Lord, the pure
and holy God of Heaven, ever intended to build his <hi>Church</hi> with ſuch baſe and bloody ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,
which muſt needs be moſt blaſphemous to ſayor once think. Moſt worthily therfore
is <hi>Rome</hi> ſaid to be founded and finiſhed in its crimſon architecture of blood; vvhether we
reſpect materiall <hi>Rome</hi> in its firſt riſe and originall, firſt founded in the blood of <hi>Rhemus</hi>
murthered by his brother <hi>Romulus,</hi> the very firſt King of <hi>Rome:</hi> or ſpirituall <hi>Rome,</hi> the
mother of ſpirituall Whoredomes, moulded and maintained all along by thoſe Popiſh-<hi>Caines,</hi>
in the bloud of their more righteous brethren, Gods beloved <hi>Abels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore I deſire that the uſe of this 3 fold obſervation, may be, firſt inſeparable love
of God in cleaving faſt to his ſoul-ſaving Truth and Goſpell: and ſecondly irreconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
hatred of that abominable and diabolicall Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> which thus delights in
the moſt fearfull and finall deſtruction of ſoules and bodies.</p>
