         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAppily amidst these our late Distractions here at <hi>London,</hi> you may expect some other News, either from hence or from abroad, which in all the, intercourses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, you know I have evermore avoided, and left that to Diurnals, and such as delight to tell of Novelties; On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to that, which is I presume long since known to you and all the three Nations; I send you this as it is, the grounds of the present, and late differences, between the Army Officers, and remnant of the old Legal Parliament; for so I stile it, in respect, that it was summoned by the late King. As to all the other Assembl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>blished Government, upon this Reason and Ground, that the Grandees would nor admit of any single Person; as also, for that the Parliament as 'tis alleaged, acted irregularly, and not according to the humor of the Souldier. This is generally conceived to be the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46419:3"/>
ground of the present Destractions; in the mean time, judge you, where we are (the Legislative power being laid a side) and the Nation left without any Government, but that of the Sword.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, it is in common discourse, that there is a Government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, but what that is, or will be, God knows; you know Kings, single Persons, Peers, and Parliaments, are not now in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> neither any Settlement in any of the Courts of Judicature, that may rightly, and legally, determine <hi>meum et tuum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some there are, that say the Grandees will pitch on that frame, which hath been so happily established by the Hollanders; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their case, and ours, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of so near a Kin, in discarding Kings and single Persons, that I confesse it may invite our great Masters to follow their pattern.</p>
            <p>Others there are, that propose a Government answerable to that of the Romans, on their putting down <hi>Tarquinius Superbus</hi> their last King, when as the Senate assumed the sole power of, Government to themselves, as the best and most d<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>able, though this soft look not back to those interruptions which often befel them by the Tribunes of the people, their Censors, Dictators, and at last, that of their Armies, in the election of their Emperors without either the consent, or approbation of the Senate, to speak in tearms of truth, our case and theirs, are much alike.</p>
            <p>Others there are, that propose the Venetian Government, were their Duke as a single Person, rules no otherwise, than as their Grand Councel shall admit and approve.</p>
            <p>But the Major part of the people, are for <hi>Charls Stuarts</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, hoping that these our Destractions, conduce to th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll come in with a revengeful heart, and then no man can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him other measure, than a reseisure of all the Crown Lands, the Royal Houses, with their rich Ornaments, the Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and what not? that may right him, as well for the Crown Lands, a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nriched themselves, by buying the Crown Lands at under rates; neither must such, as have not been guilty of getting those good bargains, beleive to escape scot-free, for all mens Estates, will be then liable to his conquering Sword, neither will this be the worst of such a turn of fortune for our Religion, Laws, and immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of every free born Subject, must vayl the Bonnet to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing power.</p>
            <p>All this is too plain and manifest, which necessarily will befall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46419:3"/>
the Universal Nation, wherein not only the Nocent but the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent will be in a like condition.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, there's another sort, that say, we are too much English, in relation to the old Proverb (which you know) is, that an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish man knows not when he is well, and that there was a Government set up by old <hi>Oliver,</hi> between him and a Parliament, as also that during his time they lived in peace and quietness, as also that the Laws and Justice had a free and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen current, and many tedious sutes ended by his means by way of reference, and that he kept a Court, answerable to the State and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the English Nation, entertained all Ambassadours of forein Princes and Stares, with his Guards of Horse and Foot, with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller, Stewards, Master of Requests, and Master of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and that he was courted and admired by most of the Princes and States of Europe; whereas now there is no Person, no place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto any Addresses are to be made from abroad, to the dishonour and scorn of the Nation; They farther say, and allege our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.

            <p>The premises rightly considered, where are we now? otherwise than as Slaves of a new edition; But se<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To come nearer to the poynt, I do not conceive that either the late Protectors, <hi>Oliver</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> as single persons, were absolute, for they had a Parliament, and in the intermissions of Parliaments, an able Councel of State, that carried on the affairs of the Common-wealth as joynt Copartners with them: If it be abjected that <hi>Oliver</hi> was the first, that dissolved the long Parliament, the answer to this, is soon made, for that they began to call into question the new Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under which the universall Natives, lived in peace, and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without any disturbance, which to preserve, the Protector, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Ends, and Aims, dissolved them. You may remember how the late King made it his common practice to call Parliaments and Dissolve them, without their due Effects, at will and pleasure: Is it therefore of necessity; that some few of the Army Officers

should do the like as they have often done, and destroy the most Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall part of the old English Government, the old security of all the free born Subjects, of this Nation, and that Court which in all Ages hath stopt the currant of the Incroachment of the Royal Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and prevented that Inundation which would have swallowed up all the Subjects, Freedoms and Liberties; But the report goes that they will resolve to call a Parliament speedily, if that be their resolution, In Gods name then let it be a Free and Legal one, an the Election of the Members left to the Free-holders and not too much tyed up to the rack of their wills and pleasures, otherwise, where will they be found that will sit, when they shall be chosen? since 'tis already in common discourse, and the question put, why should any either accept the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>SIR,</hi> To conclude, without doubt there is somewhat if not much amisse, in the mannagery of this work of darknesse, (for so I call it) not pleasing to Almighty God; 'Tis most true, that all along our many sad and often changes, we have had frequent Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Prayers, and Preachings, but whither they have been rightly addrest, rests the doubt, the Apostle St. <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mes</hi> tels us we pray and ask but receive not, because we petition amiss, I fear me this is our case, and therefore let us all more fervently pray unto Almighty God, and heartily beseach him, that our Prayers and addresses may be more pleasing to him, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone must help and free us from these our Devisions, otherwise we are all lost; It is Unity and Concord, that must set us all aright, and in our right Wits. If a Kingdom, City, or House devided cannot stand, needs must our devisions ruine us, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia res parvae crescunt, discordia dilabuntur.</hi> Therefore let our great Masters lay aside their Ambition and Self-ends, then by Gods good grace, the cure of these our sad distractions will be soon perfected; Therefore it behoves us all to pray unto God, that Unity and Concord may be preserved amongst us, for without it, the Nation cannot be in safety, since as now the case stands, we are all in the highway of Confusion, and never more subject and open to forraign Invasions, then at present; we wish that they which now sit at the Healm, will bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and take it into their serious and timely consideration, that the new Amity and Friendship contracted between the two great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and neighbouring Princes of Christendome, presageth no good Omen to <hi>England;</hi> and that they will call to mimd the late passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and causes at <hi>Paris;</hi> as also to bethink themselves, that all things are not so safe at home as it should be, and might be <hi>remota causa tollitur effectus,</hi> then the cure will (by Gods good grace) be
