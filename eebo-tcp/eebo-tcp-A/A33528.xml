         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Coblers End:
OR
His (laſt) Sermno</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Browniſts</hi> are acknowledged to be the
<hi>Caterpillars</hi> of Religion, who doe daily
ſtrive to contaminate the ſincere purity
thereof; for they will not be exhorted by <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall
confirmation,</hi> and <hi>Propheticall Inſtitution</hi> of
the ſacred word of God, but according to the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of their owne roving fancies they ordaine
no Orthodox, but Hereticall opinions, and (that
I may uſe their own words) as the ſpirit (of Error)
moves them, they will broach new Doctrine to
their long eared Auditors. But leſt I ſhould ſeeme
to deviate from my intended ſubject, I will with
out any digreſſing aberration proceed herein.</p>
            <p>There have bin a ſurreptitious Lecture continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in St Georges pariſh in Southwark, in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of about three weeks, and laſt Friday (being
the appointed day for the aforementioned Lectur)
one <hi>Vincent</hi> preached there at the ſame pariſh, but
his Doctrine was ſo Schiſmaticall, that there was
a great mutiny among the confluxe of the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb facs="tcp:49356:3"/>
vulgar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet notwithſtanding by the peculiar, &amp;
particular ſuggeſtions of ſome of the ſaid pariſh,
being of his owne tribe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee was appointed to
preach on the Sabbath day immediatly ſucceeding
without the generall aſſent or conſent of all the
Pariſhioners, and being ſuppoſed by his externall
geſture to be ſome Scholler, he had more admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
then otherwiſe ſhuld have bin granted him.
And being confident of his reſolute inſolencie, he
nominated his text, and proceeded according to
the Tenour of theſe words following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>HIs text was taken out of the 30. Chapter
of</hi> Eſaiah, <hi>and the laſt verſe.</hi> For the fire
of Hell is ordained from the beginning, yea
even for the King is it prepared, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Which words he ſaid like the foure rivers, that
were divided into foure heads to water the garden.
So his Text was divided into three parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Damnation ordained.</item>
               <item>2. The time when, from the beginning.</item>
               <item>3. The diſreſpect of perſons, yea for the King
it is prepared.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And thus he began with his firſt point, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Damnation ordained: that all thoſe who would
not preach as Coblers, and Tinkers, were damned.
Secondly, that thoſe who heard the booke of
<hi>Common-Prayer</hi> (being in their imaginary ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
Popiſh) were damned. Thirdly, that thoſe,
who would admit of Biſhops, and ſuch Romiſh
<pb facs="tcp:49356:3"/>
prieſts were damned. Fourthly, that thoſe who
preached or prayed otherwiſe, then the ſpirit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him, did offend God, &amp; thoſe that offend God
ſhould be damned, therefore by conſequence, hee
that did not pray <hi>ex tempore,</hi> or preach according as
the ſpirit ſhall inable him, ſhall without doubt be
damned. And with that he cryed fire fire, ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently,
that I wonder ſome did not ſpit on his
face to quench and extinquiſh the flaming fire of
his luſtfull mind, and concupiſcence. Then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to his ſecond particular, <hi>viz.</hi> the time when
from the beginning: and then he affirmed poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
that all men were from the beginning pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated
to be damned. But this we know (as his
other) is a maine point of blaſphemy. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
that no learning, either morall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or divine, was
requiſite for the Miniſteriall function, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as the ſpirit moved them.</p>
            <p>And withall he gave his aſſertion, and direct a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipulation
to heare rather a Cobler, Felt-maker,
Tinker, Horſerubber, as thoſe reverend fathers, Mr
<hi>Greene,</hi> Mr. <hi>Marler,</hi> Mr. <hi>Spencer,</hi> &amp;c. then any other
Scholler, who ſhall premeditate his Sermon.</p>
            <p>Thus he proceeded in his erroneous opinions,
and hereticall doctrine, ſcolding, and rayling at all
men, and all profeſſions, that he could recall into
his memory, ſtill crying with a deplorable excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
fire, fire, but to what effect I know not,
unleſſe he himſelfe did feare Hell fire for his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable,
and ſcandalous words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49356:4"/>
But to omit many of his ridiculous proofes, he
at length came to his third point of doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi>
The diſreſpect of perſons, it is appointed for the
King himſelfe: but if I ſhould deſcribe in an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
declaration each particular Schiſme, that
he obſtinatly produced in this regard, I ſhould be
more blamed for expreſſing it, then hee was for
ſpeaking it: yea, I ſhould be more aſhamed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
that, which he was not aſhamed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
            <p>Therefore (judicious Reader) I omit the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of his facinorous inference to your better
mentall reſervation: neither will I rub the <hi>Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi>
of this wound, leaſt it ſhould bleed afreſh.
Wherefore when the alarme of his obſtreperous
tongue was ended in this <hi>prior diviſion,</hi> he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto ſome other particulars, which were not
leſſe dangerous, and hereticall in explication, then
the former.</p>
            <p>Firſt he affirmed that all Biſhops were contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the word of God, and therefore <hi>Diabolicall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that the booke of <hi>Common-Service</hi>
was diducted out of the <hi>Popiſh Liturgy,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought not to be admitted, or have any appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
allowance in our publick Aſſemblies, and
Congregations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that every one might exerciſe the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
according as the ſpirit ſhall enable them: for
firſt, whatſoever comes from the ſpirit is truth.
Secondly, the ſpirit cannot ſuggeſt a man amiſſe.
Thirdly, that the ſpirit guides a mans thoughts to
<pb facs="tcp:49356:4"/>
the right object of heavenly things. Fourthly,
that he which is led by the ſpirit, is an abſolute
child of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore he did aſſure them to embrace all
thoſe good Admonitions, which hee had declared
unto them; for he would warrant them that they
did all proceed from the holy ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Alſo, divers other things he did peremptorie
affirme in his Pulpit, all which would be too long
for me to relate. Therefore leaſt I ſhould treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
too far on your clement patience, J will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate
all in a word, and conclude; While my
daily prayers ſhall be, that the <hi>Parliament</hi> would
take theſe premiſes into their grave conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
&amp;c.</p>
