            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Middleſex,</hi> had taken Dr. <hi>Oats</hi>'s Depoſitions,

ſhould diſcover the reſt, whereby they, or

Days after, there being private Intimation,
that ſome Perſons who could diſcover the
manner of the Circumſtances, and yet were
with-held, through fear of the Revenge, the
Murtherers, or their Friends might take,
the King renewed his Promiſe, that they

            <p>The Murther of Sir <hi>Edmond Bury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>

Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon,</hi> giving place, the

brought to the Bar of the Lords-Houſe,
where kneeling, and afterwards ſtanding,
the Articles of their Impeachment were
Read; upon which they made ſeveral

aſſiſt them in matters of Law. And the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60425:10"/>
Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> was allowed, though abſent, a
Copy of his Charge. After this, thoſe that
were preſent, were remanded to the
<hi>Tower,</hi> and being brought again the 16th.
they delivered their Anſwers to the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Charge; and were reconducted
to the <hi>Tower;</hi> and on the 20th. of <hi>April</hi>
the King diſſolved his Privy Council and
called another, putting forth a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to ſhew his reaſons for ſo doing;
appointing his new Council to conſiſt of
Thirty Perſons, Fifteen whereof were
to be certain, and the reſt to be Elective

that next his great Council, he would
be adviſed by that Council; and on the

Speech to both Houſes, recommending
to them three particulars, <hi>viz. The Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the Plot, the Diſbanding of the Army,
and the ſetting out a Fleet.</hi> And after that
the Lord Chancellour opened to them
the Kings Mind, concerning the ſecuring

deſperate Ruffians on Horſe-back,
who Seizing him in his Coach, on the
Road, dragged him out, and not giving
him, as he earneſtly requeſted, ſo much
time as to ſay his Prayers, beat out his
Brains, for which ſeveral of them were
afterwards deſervedly Hanged, being
ridged Sectaries. And now the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>England,</hi> conſidering the Kings
urgent Occaſions, granted him a ſupply of

            </p>
            <p>In the begining of <hi>July,</hi> a dreadful Fire

            <p>On the 12<hi>th.</hi> the King Publiſhed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation

High-Treaſon, in Conſpiring the Death

Expectation of many; and perhaps their

as they were at Liberty, they went to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
other Countries. <hi>John Evans,</hi> and
<hi>William Lloyd,</hi> Two Popiſh Prieſts, were

About the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the

            <p>It having amongſt other things been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
that Four Ruffians were hired to

Proclamation for Apprehending them, but
they made their eſcape, till the ſtorm was

upon ſome Matters ſuggeſted, falling into

Great Offices, and Places of Truſt taken

Whereupon, he paſſed the Seas for <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>

Sentenced by the Lords Juſticers, to be

On the 12<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> a <hi>Proclamation</hi>

upon the Statute of the 27<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
who being born Subjects of the
King of <hi>England,</hi> and having taken orders
of Prieſt-hood by the authority derived
from the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> had come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in <hi>England,</hi> contrary to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute;
and all but <hi>Keemiſh,</hi> whoſe Sickneſs
rendered him incapable of it, were Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſix Convicted of High Treaſon,
and afterwards by Judgment attainted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Statute; but a ſpecial

Verdict was found for <hi>Lundſden,</hi> he being
a <hi>Scotch man,</hi> and a Queſtion ariſing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>On the 9<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Sir <hi>Lionel Ienkins,</hi> upon Mr. Secretary
<hi>Coventry</hi>'s requeſt to leave that Station, was
appointed Secretary of State.</p>
            <p>On the 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>February</hi> the Duke and
Dutcheſs of <hi>York</hi> arrived from <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and were received by the King with
much Joy and Satisfaction: And the
King having releaſed a Judgment, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
upon a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt the
City of <hi>London,</hi> concerning the duty of
<hi>Water-ballage,</hi> and cauſed a <hi>Nolle proſequi</hi>
to be entered; the Lord Mayor, Court
of Aldermen, Recorder, and Committee
of Common Council, went in a Body to
pay their dutiful acknowledgment to the
King; and afterwards many of them did
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60425:15"/>
the like to his Royal Highneſs the Duke.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>James Baker,</hi> alias
<hi>Hesketh,</hi> and <hi>John Naylor,</hi> were Tryed at
the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> for being Prieſts; yet on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the former was found Guilty. And
now ſome Heats ariſing amongſt great
Ones, to prevent the danger, the
King publiſhed a <hi>Proclamation,</hi> wherein he
declared, that he would not Pardon any
Perſon that ſhould Kill another in a Duel.
And thus ended the noted Affairs of this
Year.</p>
            <p>In <hi>May,</hi> 1680. A prodigious Storm of
Hail fell, the Stones being of a vaſt
weight, and 8 or 9 Inches in Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
did great damage to Houſes, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
Fowl, Herbs, Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
ſoon after Mrs. <hi>Celier</hi> getting herſelf Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi>
was acquitted by the ſaid Judges, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
of <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> as a good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
But not content with this narrow
eſcape, ſhe undertook to publiſh a Book
for ſhamming the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<hi>Prance</hi>'s Evidence as to the Murther
of Sir <hi>Edmond Bury Godfrey;</hi> for which
She was Tryed at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> Fin'd,
and Pilloryed. And the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſitting
according to prorogation, and the popiſh
Lords in the Tower having been obliged
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60425:15"/>
to give in ſufficient Anſwers, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to Try <hi>William</hi> Viſcount <hi>Stafford,</hi>
who had the whole Houſe of Peers for his
Judges, a place being erected in <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Hall</hi>
for that purpoſe; where after a
Tryal which held 4 or 5 days, he was by the
majority of Voices caſt, and attainted of
high Treaſon, for which he loſt his Head
on <hi>Tower-Hill:</hi> And ſoon after his Death,
a prodigious beam of Light ſtreamed in
the Night-time from the Weſt, and ſoon
after the Star from whence it darted ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
above the Horizon, and grew
nightly higher till it had compaſſed <hi>East</hi>
and <hi>West,</hi> and was admired by many,
who made different Judgments as their
Minds lead them. And the <hi>Parliament</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a conſiderable Sitting was prorogued
to a further time, but before the time of
their appointed Meeting, they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
and a <hi>Parliament</hi> called to meet at
<hi>Oxford</hi> on the 21<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>March;</hi> though the
Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and divers Lords petition'd
the King to have it ſit at <hi>Westminster;</hi>
however they did not prevail, for the
Parliament accordingly met at <hi>Oxford;</hi>
where the King in his Speech amongſt
other things, put them in mind of the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But they had not ſat many days, before
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60425:16"/>
they were Diſſolved, and the King came
in great haſte for <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One <hi>Edward Fitz-Harris,</hi> having been
diſcovered by Mr. <hi>Everard,</hi> and Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam

been Impeached by the Commons, but
in fine, was Tryed before the Lord Chief

of High Treaſon, was Executed at <hi>Tyburn</hi>
with one <hi>Oliver Plunket,</hi> condemned at
the <hi>Kings Bench Bar,</hi> for attempting to

but upon Information of ſeveral <hi>Iriſh Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
and others, ſoon after the Earl of
<hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi>
as were ſeveral other perſons, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
there a conſiderable time, a Bill of
High Treaſon was drawn up againſt him;
as likewiſe Bills againſt <hi>Stephen Colledge,</hi>
and others, and preferred to the Grand
Jury of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
heard in open Court at the <hi>Old Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
but after a long Examination, the Bills

were found <hi>Ignoramus;</hi> but <hi>Colledge</hi> was
ſoon after carried, by Water, to <hi>Oxford,</hi>
and there being Tryed, for treaſonable

ſiting of the Parliament there, was found
Guilty and Executed; and the following
<hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> Term, the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>
and divers others, were ſet at Liberty.</p>
            <p>A Parliament being called in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
the King ſent his Brother to preſide as
his High Commiſſioner; and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt

for aſſerting the right of Succeſſion to
the Crown, making it Treaſon for any to
queſtion or object it: and the Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyle,</hi>
for only making ſome Queries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
was committed to the Caſtle, and in
danger of his Life; but he eſcaped thence,
by changing Habit with a Ladies Page
that came to viſit him; and fled into
<hi>Holland,</hi> where he remained till his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
invading <hi>Scotland, Anno</hi> 1685,
of which more hereafter.</p>
            <p>The Duke being returned for <hi>England,</hi>
upon the concluding of the Parliament,
and leaving his Dutcheſs in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
whilſt he was on his way again by Sea,
in the <hi>Glouceſter</hi> Frigat, attended with

Frigat, under full Sail, ſtood in upon the

about One hundred Perſons loſt, beſides

with as many as his Barge (which was

and the Pilot being ſuſpected of

            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Moore,</hi> after the Mayorality

among the Citizens, about the Electing
two Perſons, to ſerve as Sheriffs for the

               <hi>William Pritehard</hi> was choſen Lord Mayor
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60425:17"/>
and upon the occaſion of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendings,
ſeveral Citizens, as Sir <hi>Thomas

Rioters; and haviug a Verdict found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them before the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<hi>Saunders</hi> at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> were the
following Term Fined at the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi>
Bar, very conſiderably. And this year
died the Illuſtrious Prince <hi>Rupert;</hi> a Prince
whoſe great Services, have all along,
been very conſiderable to theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
And a thing not known before,
two Ambaſſadors arrived, one from the
Emperor of <hi>Feſs</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the King of <hi>Bantam,</hi> with
rich Preſents; and were ſplendidly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
and much admired by the
crouding People, for their ſtrange Habits.
The firſt came to treat of Peace and
free Traffick. <hi>Tangier,</hi> an Engliſh Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
ſtanding in his Maſters Countries;
and the other to crave Succour for the
King his Maſter, againſt his Son, who had
riſen in Rebellion againſt him, and ſoon
after outed him of his Kingdom, by the
help of the Dutch, and our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Company of their Trade in that part of the
Country. As for the Emperor of <hi>Morocco,</hi>
he kept not the Truce or Treaty his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60425:18"/>
had made; whereupon the King
finding one Town very chargeable to
keep againſt a populous Country, and
that it turn'd to no great advantage, by
reaſon the Mould could not be finiſhed,
as had been propoſed, he ſent the Lord
<hi>Dartmoueh</hi> to fetch off the Garriſon, the
Inhabitants, and their Effects, and then
fired the Town, and blew up the Works,
which had coſt a Million of Mony.</p>
            <p>And now the Court being diſguſted at
the proceedings of the City of <hi>London,</hi> a
<hi>Quo Warranto</hi> was brought againſt their
Famous and Ancient <hi>Charter;</hi> and the
Controverſie admitted of many long Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and Debates, at the <hi>Kings Bench
Bar,</hi> between the Kings Council, and the
Council for the City; but it being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
in the end, it was declared by the
Judges, that the Liberties and Franchiſes
ſhould be Seized into the King's hands;
however Judgment was not entered up,
but the King appointed the Lord Mayor,
Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to Act by Commiſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
to himſelf the Nomination of the
Chief Magiſtrates, and the Common
Council was laid aſide; and ſo it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
'till the Charter was reſtored, <hi>Anno</hi>
1688. of which hereafter; for the City
finding it in vain to contend, when the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60425:18"/>
Opinions of the Judges were againſt
them, found themſelves conſtrained to
acquieſce in what was done, as did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
moſt of the Corporations of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
likewiſe the Companies, or Bodys
Corporate of <hi>London, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Franchiſes were either Seized or
Surrendered.</p>
            <p>About this time the Nation was allarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the appearing of <hi>Keeling, Weſt,</hi> and
others; who Depoſed there was a Deſign

the Earl of <hi>Eſlex,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi>

Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and others that fled;
many of which upon their not rendring

but the Duke a conſiderable time after
came in, and was received into Favour;
the proceedings upon Out-lawry having
been ſtopped by the Kings ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
but the Duke out of Diſcontent,
ſoon after went for <hi>Holland,</hi> and from
thence (after his Fathers Death) Invaded
<hi>England,</hi> of which hereafter. However,
this Buſineſs proved very Bloody, for the
Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was found with his Throat

Frozen over, and the Harbours and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens

neither Boats nor Shipping could ſtir for
the ſpace of ſix Weeks, People keeping
Fairs upon the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> with all

            <p>During theſe proceedings at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
the Duke left <hi>Lime,</hi> with about 60 Horſe

put off with a White Flag, to give notice

Shore, and took poſſeſſion of the Caſtle,
Ammunition, and what they found there,
which was very conſiderable. On the
17th of <hi>June</hi> the Earls Men paſſed the
River <hi>Clyde</hi> in the night time, and the
Earl of <hi>Dumbarton,</hi> Commander in Chief
for the King, paſſed the River <hi>Leuin,</hi>
and marched from <hi>Glaſgow</hi> very early the

Pariſh of <hi>Killerne;</hi> the Kings Horſe and
Dragoons kept up with the Earls men till
the Foot arrived; but they being Poſted
in a ſtrong ground, and it being late in
the evening, they ſtood in battle all night,
but before day the Earls men had paſſed
the <hi>Clyde,</hi> ſwiming over their Horſe, and
paſſing over their Foot in Boats; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

            <p>Upon this Retreat, part of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
took Guides to conduct them to <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway;</hi>
but miſtaking the way, were led
into a Bog, and thereupon obliged to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe
into ſmall Parties, as did the King's
Forces to purſue them, which cauſed great
Conſternation and Diſorder; and the Earl
of <hi>Argyle</hi> returning towards the <hi>Clyde,</hi> was
ſet upon by Two of <hi>Greynocks</hi> Servants,
but ſtoutly defended himſelf, till he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
a Wound in his Head; upon which,
not longer truſting his Horſe, he alighted,
and betook himſelf to the Water, into
which, a Country Fellow entered after him,
upon whom the Earl Fired, but his Piſtol

his Fall, He cryed out, <hi>Unfortunate Argyle;</hi>
and thereupon was made Priſoner, and

killed in the coming up, the Lord <hi>Roſs</hi>
ſlightly wounded, Sir <hi>Adam Blair</hi> ſhot in
the Neck, and Sir <hi>William VVallock</hi> in the
Side; before the Dragoons had time to
come up on Foot, the Earles Men had got
into a Wood, behind the Incloſure, which
the King's Forces beſet: and Five of the

Men begun with a great Volley of Shot

of receiving or being admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

and other Eccleſiaſtical Officers,
were required to take Notice of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
and Decree, and yield Obedience
to it: However, theſe worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
though turned out to make way for
the Creatures of the Popiſh Biſhops, were
kindly received wherever they came, and
not a little applauded for their Reſolution,
rather to relinquiſh then give a preſident
of Innovation upon that Foundation.
And in this Month (as a Fore-runner of
the Miſeries <hi>Ireland</hi> has ſince ſuffered) an
extraordinary Innundation happened at
<hi>Dublin, Rings-End, Cork,</hi> and other places,
occaſioned by violent Rains, the Water
not only breaking down the Bridges; but
riſing even to the firſt and ſecond Stories,
ſo that Boats for ſome days Rowed in the
Streets. A great deal of Goods and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
were deſtroyed, and ſome Perſons pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed

            <p>On the 16<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

allowing for <hi>Canary</hi> Wines, by Retail, no

And it being given out, that the Queen

a great Offering had been made at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Shrine of the Lady of <hi>Loretto;</hi> a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

Thankſgiving and Prayer throughout
the Kingdom, that is, in the Cities of
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> on the 15<hi>th.</hi> of
<hi>January,</hi> and ten Mlies thereabout, and
on the 29<hi>th.</hi> throughout the Kingdom;
and Prayers were formed and publiſhed
to that end, and read in the Churches
upon the Days mentioned. This made
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> greatly rejoyce, and not ſtick
to declare before hand it was a Son; and
many Flattering <hi>Poems</hi> were Written and
publiſhed on that occaſion, and the
Prieſts ſpread it loudly in their Sermons,
Attributing it as a Miracle to the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> or as a return of the Offering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And the privy Council of <hi>Scotland</hi> made
an Act likewiſe for a publick and ſolemn
Thankſgiving throughout that Kingdom,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60425:51"/>
to the ſame end, bearing Date the 17<hi>th.</hi> of
<hi>January,</hi> 1687.</p>
            <p>And now to ſmooth with the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi>
Commiſſioners were Appointed to Inquire
what Monies or Goods had been Received
or Seized by any Perſons Eccleſiaſtical or
Civil, within the Cities of <hi>London</hi> or <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
or the Counties of <hi>Middleſex,

1677. For matters Relating to Religion,
directing them to places where they ſhould
be heard and Redreſſed; and this way of
Proceeding, made a great noiſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Kingdom for a while, but in the
end it fell a ſleep, and came to little or
nothing. On the 2<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
was Exhibited, for-biding the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. to go into any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Service without leave by Sea or Land,
as they would Anſwer it at their utmoſt
Peril; and upon ſome Complaints that
the Soldiers in Pay were Diſorderly in
their Quarters; a General Court Marſhal
conſiſting of General Officers, and Officers
of the Army were Appointed to meet at
the Horſe Guard every <hi>Friday</hi> morning to
hear and Redreſs Grievances of that

an Extraordinary Council was called on

            <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing, the Lord
<hi>Delamere</hi> muſtered a great many Forces
upon <hi>Boddon Downs,</hi> and Declared for the
Prince. The King arriving at <hi>Salisbury,</hi>
was Lodged in the Biſhop's Pallace, and
while he continued there, a Skirmiſh hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
between an advanced Party of Foot,
who had gone too far from the main Body,
or elſe were going to the Prince's Army,
and Collonel <hi>Sarſefield,</hi> who commanded
a Party of the King's Horſe, Dragoons,
and Granadiers, in which, the former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very unequal in number, were worſted,
ſome being after a reſolute defence killed,
others taken Priſoners, and the reſt eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
on the Kings part Four were killed,
and Two wounded, one mortally; this
happened near <hi>Wincanton,</hi> where the Foot
upon the purſuit made after them, had
poſted themſelves in a ſtrong ground, and
had had the better, had not a Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
diſcovered a place, where the Horſe
might enter.</p>
            <p>The King finding great Numbers, as

of General Pardon to ſuch as would return

and Protection to all ſuch Foreigners,
as ſhould do the like; but it little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
availed, for we do not hear of any

the King came haſtily from <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
having firſt given Order for his Army
to retreat, which was done with great
Precipitation, even contrary to Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
conſidering for ſeveral Campaigns, it
had attracted the wonder of many, on

            </p>
            <p>The King thus returning, and hearing
that ſeveral ſtrong Places had declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

K. <hi>James,</hi> commiting ſeveral

Parliament beſought his Majeſty, to Iſſue
out a Proclamation, for apprehending and
ſurpreſſing them, which was accordingly
done, and more Forces ſent to quell
them; however, at firſt they prepared to
make reſiſtance, but the King's Horſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ready to attack them, they threw
down their Arms and ſurrendred upon

that all things tended to good order and

Methods taken of late Years by the

and Interest of your Kingdom, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the Invaſion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſupporting
your Majesties Rebellious Subjects there; not
doubting in the least, but that through Your
Majeſties Wiſdom, the Alliances already
made with ſuch as may be hereafter conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on this occaſion by your Majesty, may be
Effectual to reduce the <hi>French King</hi> to ſuch

nor prejudice the Trade and Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <p>To this end, we most humbly Beſeech Your

when Your Majesty ſhall think fit to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

give Your Majeſty ſuch Aſſiſtance in a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary

               </gap>ver be an Argument
to Incline me to engage a War, that may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Nation either to Danger or Expence;
but in the preſent Caſe I look upon the War,
ſo much already declared in effect by <hi>France</hi>'
againſt <hi>England,</hi> that it is not ſo proper an
Act of Choice, as an inevitable neceſſity in our
own Defence.</p>
            <p>I only tell you, That as I have ventured my
Life, and All that is dear to me, to reſcue
this Nation from what it ſuffered, I am ready
ſtill to do the ſame, in order to the preſerving
it from all its Enemies; and as I do not doubt
of ſuch an Aſſistance from you, as ſhall be
ſuitable to your Advice to me, to declare War
againſt a powerful Enemy, ſo you may relye
upon me, that no part of that which you ſhall
give for the carrying it on with ſucceſs, ſhall
be diverted by me to any other uſe.</p>
            <p>And that the Proteſtants who had Fled

               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:60425:78"/>
great care was taken to provide for
them, and moſt People wherever they
came contributed liberally to their relief
and aſſiſtance; and the King was pleaſed
to put forth a Declaration to encourage
the <hi>French Proteſtants,</hi> that ſhould Tranſport

this Kingdom; and a Proclamation
Prohibiting the Importation of all ſorts of

Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 1ſt. of <hi>May</hi> His Majeſty was

the 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> in hopes to meet them,
and on the 29<hi>th.</hi> his Scouts made a Signal,
that they diſcovered a Fleet keeping their

His all Night, to hinder them getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Kinſale,</hi> and the next Morning had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
they were gone into <hi>Baltimore,</hi> being
44 Sail; whereupon he ſtood away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the place, but not finding them
there, the Scouts however got ſight of
them again in the Evening, to the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of <hi>Cape clear</hi> whereupon ſteering af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, it was ſound they had got into
<hi>Bantry,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships lay off the
Bay all Night, and by break of Day ſtood
in, where they found them at Anchor,
who preſently got under Sail, and bore
down upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in a Line of 28
Men of War, and five Fireſhips; and
when they came within Muſquet-ſhot of
the <hi>Defiance,</hi> being the head-moſt of the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Admiral put out the
Signal of Battle, which they began with

ſmall and great Shot; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
made ſeveral Boards to gain the Wind,
or engage them cloſe, but that way of
working not being advantageous, the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral ſtood off to Sea, as well
to have got his Ships into a Line, as to
have gained the Wind of the Enemy; but
the <hi>French</hi> were ſo cautious in bearing
down, that this advantage and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
could not be obtained, ſo that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
continued Battering upon the
Stretch 'till Five in the Afternoon, at
what time the <hi>French</hi> tacked, and ſtood
further into the Bay; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral's
Ship, and ſome of the reſt being
diſabled in their Rigging, could not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them, but continued ſome time before
the Bay, and gave them a Gun at parting.
In this Action Capt. <hi>George Aylmer</hi> of the
<hi>Portland,</hi> with 1 Lieutenant, and 9 Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were Killed, and about 250 Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
