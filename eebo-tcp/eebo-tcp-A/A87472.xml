      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is preſented to you a Brief, Learned, and a very ſeaſonable Treatiſe for the Age we live in: It was many years ſince Penned by King <hi>James</hi> of happy and bleſſed Memory, Entituled, <hi>A Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaſt to Tobacco;</hi> It it here <hi>verbatim,</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully tranſcribed out of the large and learned Volume of His other Works in <hi>Folio,</hi> which are rare and ſcarce to be had for money, and of too great a price for the common ſort of Tobacco-ſmokers to purchaſe: It is granted, the thing may be good, and Phyſical, and healthful, being moderately and but ſeldom taken; but for men to take ten or twenty Pipes in a day in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, Morning, Noon and Night, before and preſently after Meals; this is a ſtrange way of taking Phyſick. Now the King underſtanding the evil Cuſtom of taking To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, or, as we now call it, ſmoking a Pipe, was grown to a great head, he ſeems to be very much inſenſed at it, and diſcovers how it firſt came into <hi>England,</hi> and its firſt Original; and how that it was uſed much amongſt the ſavage <hi>Indians,</hi> to cure <hi>Lewes Venerea,</hi> a Diſeaſe among them: His Majeſty wiſely fore-ſeeing the evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that would follow, by ſuch immoderate ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the foul ſmoke of this <hi>Indian</hi> Weed, and He being the Phyſician of the Body Politick, doth by many ſtrong and excellent Arguments, diſſwade his Subjects
<pb facs="tcp:150099:3"/>from imitating the practiſe of the Heathen <hi>Indians,</hi> in drinking this noxious fume. It was in his Time but a Novelty, and practiſed but a little, except amongſt the Nobility, Gentry, or great Ones: But now what is more frequently uſed in every Ale-houſe and Coffee-houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides great Inns and Taverns in <hi>London,</hi> and all the Three Kingdoms over. Whereas if men were ſo wiſe for their own good, both in Body, Soul, and Eſtate, as to handle a good Book, either of Divinity, or of Morality, half ſo often as they do the Pipe of ſmoke, it would be better for them in all reſpects, more precious time and money would be ſaved. I ſhall detain you no longer from a more learned Epiſtle and Treatiſe of the matter in hand: And as King <hi>Solomon,</hi> who was the wiſeſt of Kings, ſaith in his Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, That where the word of a King is, there is power;</hi> ſo I ſay, If what our famous King <hi>James</hi> hath written, be not of Power ſufficient to divert all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> men, &amp;c. from this evil and hurtful Cuſtom; It is here ſeconded, and backed home, by the words and advice of an able and learned Doctor of Phyſick now living; it being ſo ſutable to the purpoſe, was thought fit to be added to this <hi>Counterblast.</hi> And that it may not be ſaid (as the common Proverb is) <hi>To be only one Doctors opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> I have thought fit to add another, Collected out of a Treatiſe <hi>Of the Bloud,</hi> written by that learned Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Dr. <hi>George Thompſon,</hi> who agreeth with the former againſt ſmoking <hi>Tobacco,</hi> as dangerous. I apprehend, that what hath been ſpoken againſt drinking <hi>Tobacco,</hi> may much more be ſaid againſt immoderate drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Wine, Ale, Beer, or any ſtrong Liquors, and Diſhes of Coffee, &amp;c. Thus hoping thou wilt make a good uſe of what is here gathered together, and offered for thy good, I reſt.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S every humane body (dear Country-men) how wholſome ſoever, is notwithſtanding ſubject, or at leaſt naturally inclined to ſome ſorts of Diſeaſes or Infirmities: So is here no <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> or Body-Politick, how well governed or peaceable ſoever it be, that lacks their own popular Errors, and naturally inclined Corruptions; And therefore it is no wonder, although this our Country and Common-wealth, though peaceable, though wealthy, though long flouriſhing in both, be amongst the reſt, ſubject to their own natural Infirmities. We are of all Nations the people most Loving, and moſt reverently Obedient to our Prince; yet we are (as time hath often born witneſs) too eaſie to be ſeduced to make <hi>Rebellion</hi> upon very ſlight grounds. Our fortunate and oft-proved Valour in Wars abroad, our hearty and reverent Obedience to our Princes at home, hath given us a long, and thrice-happy Peace; our Peace hath bred wealth: And Peace and Wealth hath brough forth a general ſluggiſhneſs, which makes us wallow in all ſorts of idle Delights, and ſoft De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies, the firſt ſeeds of the ſubverſion of all great Monarchies. Our Clergy are become negligent and laſie, our Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try prodigal, and ſold to their private Delights; Our Lawyers covetous, our common People prodigal and curious; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all ſorts of People more careful for their private ends, then for their Mother the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For remedy whereof, It is the <hi>King's</hi> part (as the proper Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of his Politick Body) to purge it of all thoſe Diſeaſes, by <hi>Medicines</hi> meet for the ſame; as by a certain mild, and yet juſt form of Government, to maintain the Publick quietneſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all occaſions of Commotion; by the example of his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Court, to make us all aſhamed of our ſluggiſh Delicacy, and to ſtir us up to the practice again of all honest Exerciſes, and martial ſhadows of War; as likewiſe by His, and His Courts moderateneſs in Apparel, to make us aſhamed of our Prodigality:
<pb facs="tcp:150099:4"/>By his quick Admonitions, and careful over-ſeeing of the Clergy, to waken them up again, to be more diligent in their Offices: By the ſharp Tryal, and ſevere Puniſhment of the partial, covetous, and bribing Lawyers, to reform their Corruptions: And gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by the example of His own Perſon, and by the due executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good Laws, to reform and aboliſh piece and piece, theſe old and evil-grounded Abuſes: For this will not be <hi>Opus unius Diei,</hi> but as every one of theſe Diſeaſes, must from the King receive the one Cure proper for it; ſo are there ſome ſorts of Abuſes in <hi>Common-wealths,</hi> that though they be of ſo baſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible a condition, as they are too low for the Law to look on, and too mean for a King to interpoſe his Authority, or bend his Eye upon; yet are they Corruptions, as well as the greatest of them.

But for theſe baſe ſorts of Corruption in <hi>Common-wealths;</hi> not only the King, or any inferiour Magiſtrate, but <hi>Quilibet ê populo</hi> may ſerve to be a Phyſician, by diſcovering and impugning the error, and by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading reformation thereof.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely in my Opinion, there cannot be a more baſe, and yet hurtful Corruption in a Country, then is the vile uſe (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abuſe) of taking <hi>Tobacco</hi> in this Kingdome, which hath moved me ſhortly to diſcover the abuſes in this following little Pamphlet.</p>
                  <p>If any think it a light Argument, ſo it is but a Toy that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon it. And ſince the Subject is but of Smoke, I think the ſume of an idle Brain, may ſerve for a ſufficient battery againſt ſo fumous a feblean Enemy. If my grounds be found true, it is all I look for; but if they carry the force of perſwaſion with them, it is all I can wiſh, and more then I can expect. My only care is, my dear Country-men may rightly conceive even by this ſmalleſt trifle, of the ſincerity of my meaning in greater matters, never to ſpare any pains, that may tend to the procuring of your Weale and Proſperity.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat the manifold abuſes of this vile cuſtome of Tobacco-taking, may the better be eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; It is fit, That firſt you enter into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration both of the firſt Original thereof, and likewiſe of the Reaſons of the firſt entry thereof into this Countrey; for certainly as ſuch Cuſtoms that have their firſt Inſtitution, either from a godly; neceſſary, or honourable ground, and are firſt brought in by the means of ſome worthy, vertuous, and great Perſonage; are ever, and moſt juſtly holden in great and reverent eſtimation and account by all wiſe, vertuous and temperate Spirits: So ſhould it by the contrary, juſtly bring a great Diſgrace into that ſort of Cuſtoms, which having their Original from baſe Corruption and Barbarity, do, in like ſort, make their firſt entry into a Country, by an inconſiderate and childiſh affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Novelty, as is the true caſe of the firſt Invention of Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co-taking, and of the firſt entry thereof amongſt us. For Tobacco being a common Herb, which (though under divers Names) grows
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150099:5"/>almoſt every where, was firſt found out by ſome of the Barbarous <hi>Indians</hi> to be a Preſervative, or Antidote againſt the Pox, a filthy Diſeaſe, whereunto theſe Barbarous People are (as all men know) very much ſubject, what through the uncleanly and aduſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Bodies, and what through the intemperate heat of their Climate. So that as from them, was firſt brought into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, that moſt deteſtable Diſeaſe: So from the likewiſe was brought this uſe of Tobacco, as a ſtinking and unſavory Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, for ſo corrupted and execrable a Malady; the ſtinking ſuffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migation whereof they yet uſe againſt that Diſeaſe, making ſo one Canker or Vermine to eat out another.</p>
                  <p>And now, good Country-men, let us (I pray you) conſider what Honour or Policy can move us to imitate the barbarous and beaſtly Manners of the wild, godleſs and ſlaviſh <hi>Indians,</hi> eſpecially in ſo vile and ſtinking a Cuſtome. Shall we that diſdain to imitate the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of our Neighbour <hi>France,</hi> (having the ſtile of the great Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Kingdome) and that cannot endure the Spirit of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (their King being now comparable in largeneſs of Dominions, to the greateſt Emperour of <hi>Turky;</hi>) Shall we, I ſay, that have been ſo long civil and wealthy in Peace, famous and invincible in War, fortunate in both; We that have been ever able to Aid any of our Neighbours (but never deafed any of their Ears with any of our Supplications for aſſiſtance;) Shall we, I ſay, without bluſhing, abaſe our ſelves ſo far, as to imitate theſe beaſtly <hi>Indians,</hi> Slaves to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> Refuſe to the World, and as yet Aliens from the holy Covenant of God? Why do we not as well imitate them in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naked, as they do, in preferring Glaſſes, Feathers, and ſuch toys, to Gold and precious Stones, as they do? Yea, why do we not deny God, and adore the Devil, as they do.</p>
                  <p>Now to the corrupted baſeneſs of the firſt uſe of this Tobacco, doth very well agree the fooliſh and groundleſs firſt Entry thereof into this Kingdom: It is not long ſince the firſt entry of this abuſe amongſt us here, as this preſent Age cannot yet very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, both the firſt Author, and the form of the firſt Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it againſt us. It was neither brought in by King, great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, nor learned Doctor of Phyſick.</p>
                  <p>With the Report of a great Diſcovery for a Conqueſt, ſome two or three Savage men were brought in, together with this Savage Cuſtome: But the pity is, the poor, wild, barbarous men died; but that vile barbarous Cuſtome is yet alive, yea in freſh vigour, ſo as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150099:5"/>it ſeems a miracle to me, how a Cuſtome ſpringing from ſo vile a Ground, and brought in by a Father ſo generally hated, ſhould be welcomed upon ſo ſlender a warrant: For if they that firſt put it in practice here, had remembred for what reſpect it was uſed by them from whence it came; I am ſure they would have been loath to have taken ſo far the Imputation of that Diſeaſe upon them as they did, by uſing the Cure thereof; for <hi>Sanis non eſt opus medice,</hi> and Counter-Poyſons are never uſed, but where Poyſon is thought to proceed.</p>
                  <p>But ſince it is true, that divers Cuſtoms ſlightly grounded, and with no better warrant entred in a Common-wealth, may yet in the uſe of them thereafter, prove both neceſſary and profitable; it is therefore next to be examined, if there be not a ful ſympathy and true proportion between the baſe ground and fooliſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the loathſome and hurtful uſe of this ſtinking Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote.</p>
                  <p>I am now therefore heartily to pray you to conſider, firſt upon what falſe and erroneous grounds you have firſt built the general good liking thereof; and next, what Sins towards God, and fooliſh Vanities before the World, you commit in the deteſtable uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe deceitful grounds, that have ſpecially moved you to take a good and great conceit thereof: I ſhall content my ſelf to examine here onely four of the Principals of them, two founded upon the Theorick of a deceivable appearance of Reaſon, and two of them upon the miſtaken practick of general Experience.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is thought by you a ſure Aphoriſme in the Phyſick; That the brains of all men being naturally cold and wet, all dry and hot things ſhould be good for them, of which nature this ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuffumigation is, and therefore of good uſe to them. Of this Argument both the Propoſition and Aſſumption are falſe, and ſo the Concluſion cannot but be void of it ſelf: For as to the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, That becauſe the Brains are cold and moiſt, therefore things that are hot and dry are beſt for them; it is an inept Conſequence: For man being compounded of the four Complexions (whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are the four Elements) although there be a mixture of them all, in all the parts of his body, yet muſt the divers parts of our Microcoſme, or little World within our ſelves, be diverſly more inclined, ſome to one, ſome to another Complexion, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diverſity of their uſes; that of theſe Diſcords a perfect
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150099:6"/>Harmony may be made up for the maintenance of the whole Body.</p>
                  <p>The application then of a thing of a contrary nature to any of theſe parts, is to interrupt them of their due function, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence hurtful to the health of the whole Body; as if a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Liver is as the fountain of Bloud, and, as it were, an Oven to the Stomach, would therefore apply and wear cloſe upon his Liver and Stomach a Cake of Lead, he might within a very ſhort time (I hope) be ſuſtained very good cheap at an Ordinary, beſides the clearing of his Conſcience from that deadly fin of Gluttony: And as if becauſe the Heart is full of vital Spirits, and in perpetual motion; a man would therefore lay a heavy pound ſtone on his Breaſt, for ſtaying and holding down that wanton Palpitation; I doubt not but his Breaſt would be more bruiſed with the weight thereof, then the Heart would be comforted with ſuch a diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and contrarious Cure. And even ſo is it with the Brains; for if a man becauſe the Brains are cold and humide, would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſe inwardly by ſmells, or outwardly by application, things of hot and dry quality; all the gain that he could make thereof, would onely be to put himſelf in great forwardneſs for running mad, by over-watching himſelf; the coldneſs and moiſture of our Brains being the onely ordinary means that procure our Sleep and Reſt. Indeed, I do not deny, that when it falls out that any of theſe, or any part of our Body, grows to be diſtempered, and to tend to an extremity beyond the compaſs of Natures temperate mixture, that in that caſe Cures of contrary qualities to the Intemperate inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that part being wiſely prepared, and diſcreetly miniſtred, may be both neceſſary and helpful for ſtrengthening and aſſiſting Nature in the expulſion of her Enemies; for this is the true defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all profitable Phyſick.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, Theſe Cures ought not to be uſed, but where there is need of them; the contrary whereof is daily practiced in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral uſe of Tobacco, by all ſorts and Complexions of people.</p>
                  <p>And next, I deny the <hi>minor</hi> of this Argument, as I have already ſaid, in regard that this Tobacco is not ſimply of a dry and hot quality, but rather hath a certain venomous faculty joyned with the heat thereof, which makes it have an Antipathy againſt Nature, as by the hateful ſmell thereof doth well appear; for the Noſe being the proper Organ and Convoy of the ſence of ſmelling to the Brains, which are the onely fountain of that ſence, doth ever ſerve
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150099:6"/>us for an infallible witneſs, whether that Odour which we ſmell be healthful or hurtful to the Brain, (except when it falls out that the ſence it ſelf is corrupted and abuſed, through ſome infirmity and diſtemper in the Brain:) And that the ſuffumigation thereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have a drying quality, it needs no further probation, then that it is a ſmoke, all ſmoke and vapour being of it ſelf Humide, as draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to the nature of the Air, and eaſie to be reſolved again into water, whereof there needs no other proof but the meteors, which being bred of nothing elſe but of the vapors and exhalations ſucked up by the Sun out of the Earth, the Sea and Waters; yet are the ſame ſmoky vapors turned and transformed into Rains, Snows, Dews, Hoar-Froſts, and ſuch like watry meteors; as by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the rainy Clouds are often transformed and evaporated in bluſtering Winds.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Argument grounded on a ſhew of Reaſon, is, That this filthy Smoke, as well through the heat and ſtrength thereof, as by a natural force and quality, is able and fit to purge both the Head and Stomach of Rheumes and Diſtillations, as experience teacheth by the ſpitting, and avoiding Flegm, immediately after the taking of it. But the fallacy of this Argument may eaſily appear, by my late proceeding Deſcription of the meteors; for even as the ſmoky vapours ſucked by the Sun, and ſtayed in the loweſt and cold Region of the Air, are there contracted into Clouds, and turned into Rain, and ſuch other watry meteors; So this ſtinking Smoke being ſucked up by the Noſe; and impriſoned in the cold and moiſt Brains, is by their cold and wet faculty turned and caſt forth again in watry Diſtillations, and ſo are you made free, and purged of nothing, but that wherewith you wilfully burdened your ſelves; and therefore are you no wiſer in taking Tobacco for purging you of Diſtillations, then if for preventing the Cholick, you would take all kind of windy Meats and Drinks; and for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of the Stone, you would take all kind of Meats and Drinks that would breed gravel in the Kidneys; and then when you were forced to avoid much wind out of your Stomach, and much gravel in your Urine, that you ſhould attribute the thank thereof to ſuch nouriſhments as breed thoſe within you, that behoved either to be expelled by the force of Nature, or you to have burſt at the broad ſide, as the Proverb is.</p>
                  <p>As for the other two Reaſons founded upon Experience; The firſt of which is, That the whole people would not have taken ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150099:7"/>general a good liking thereof, if they had not by experience found it very ſoveraign and good for them: For anſwer thereunto, How eaſily the minds of any people, wherewith God hath repleniſhed this World, may be drawn to the fooliſh affectation of any Novelty, I leave it to the diſcreet Judgment of any man that is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>Do we not daily ſee, that a man can no ſooner bring over from beyond the Seas any new form of Apparel, but that he cannot be thought a man of Spirit, that would not preſently imitate the ſame; and ſo from hand to hand it ſpreads, till it be practiſed by all; not for any commodity that is in it, but only becauſe it is come to be the Faſhion; for ſuch is the force of that natural ſelf-love in every one of us, and ſuch is the corruption of envy bred in the Breaſt of every one, as we cannot be content, unleſs we imitate every thing that our Fellows do, and ſo prove our ſelves capable of every thing whereof they are capable, like Apes, counterfeiting the Manners of others to our own deſtruction. For let one or two of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Maſters of Mathematicks in any of the two famous Univerſities, but conſtantly affirm any clear day, that they ſee ſome ſtrange Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition in the Skies; They will, I warrant you, be ſeconded by the greateſt part of the Students in that Profeſſion; So loath will they be, to be thought inferiour to their Fellows either in depth of Knowledge or ſharpneſs of Sight: and therefore the general good liking, and embracing of this fooliſh Cuſtome, doth but onely proceed from that affectation of Novelty and popular Error, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have already ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>And the other Argument drawn from a miſtaken experience, is but the more particular probation of this general, becauſe it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be found true by proof, That by the taking of Tobacco, divers, and very many, do find themſelves cured of divers Diſeaſes, as on the other part no man ever received harm thereby. In this Argument, there is firſt a great miſtaking, and next a monſtrous ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity; for is not a very great miſtaking, to take <hi>non cauſam pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eauſa;</hi> as they ſay in the Logicks; becauſe peradventure when a ſick man hath had his Diſeaſe at the heighth, he hath at that inſtant taken Tabacco, and afterward his Diſeaſe taking the natural courſe of Declining, and conſequently the Patient of recovering his health, O then the Tobacco forſooth was the worker of that Miracle! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that, it is a thing well known to all Phyſicians, That the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and conceit of the Patient hath by wakening and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150099:7"/>uniting the vital Spirits, and ſo ſtrengthening Nature, a great power and vertue to cure divers Diſeaſes: For an evident Proof of miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the like caſe, I pray what fooliſh Boy, what ſilly Wench, what old doting Wife, or ignorant Country Clown, is not Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian for the Tooth-ach, for the Cholick, and divers ſuch common Diſeaſes; yea, will not every man you meet withall teach you a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Cure for the fame, and ſwear by that mean, either himſelf, or ſome of his neareſt Kindſmen and Friends was cured; and yet, I hope, no man is ſo fooliſh as to believe them: And all theſe toys do onely proceed from the miſtaking <hi>non cauſam pro cauſa,</hi> as I have already ſaid; and ſo if a man chance to recover one of any Diſeaſe after he hath taken Tobacco, that muſt have the thanks of all: But by the contrary, if a man ſmoke himſelf to death with it (as many have done) O then ſome other Diſeaſe muſt bear the blame for that fault! So do old Harlots thank their Harlotry for their many years, that Cuſtom being healthful (ſay they) <hi>ad purgandos renes,</hi> but never have mind how many die of the Pox in the flower of their Youth: And ſo do old Drunkards think they prolong their days by their Swine-like Diet, but never remember how many die drowned in Drink before they be half old.</p>
                  <p>And what greater abſurdity can there be then to ſay, that one Cure ſhall ſerve for divers, nay contrarious ſorts of Diſeaſes. It is an undoubted ground among all Phyſicians, That there is almoſt no ſort, either of Nouriſhment or Medicine, that hath not ſome thing in it diſagreeable to ſome part of mans body, becauſe, as I have already ſaid, the nature of the temperature of every part is ſo different from another, that according to the old Proverb, That which is good for the Head is evil for the Neck and the Shoulders: For even as a ſtrong Enemy that invades a Town or Fortreſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in his Siege thereof he do belay and compaſs it round about, yet he makes his Breach and Entry at ſome one or few ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial parts thereof, which he hath tryed and found to be weakeſt and leaſt able to reſiſt: So ſickneſs doth make her particular aſſault upon ſuch part or parts of our Body as are weakeſt and eaſieſt to be overcome by that ſort of Diſeaſe which then doth aſſail us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all the reſt of the Body, by ſympathy, feel it ſelf to be as it were belaid and beſieged by the affliction of that ſpecial part, the grief and ſmart thereof being by the ſence of feeling diſperſed through all the reſt of the members; and therefore the skilful Phyſician preſſes by ſuch Cures to purge and ſtrengthen that part
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150099:8"/>which is afflicted, as are onely fit for that ſort of Diſeaſe, and do beſt agree with the nature of that infirm part; which being abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a Diſeaſe of another nature, would prove as hurtful to the one, as helpful for the other; yea, not onely will a skilful and wary Phyſician be careful to uſe no Cure, but that which is fit for that ſort of Diſeaſe; but he will alſo conſider all other circumſtances, and make the Remedies ſutable thereunto, as the temperature of the Clime, where the Patient is, the Conſtitution of the Planets, the time of the Moon, the ſeaſon of the Year, the Age and Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Patient, the preſent ſtate of his Body in ſtrength or weakneſs: For one Cure muſt not ever be uſed for the ſelf ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe but according to the varying of any of the aforeſaid Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that ſort of Remedy muſt be uſed which is fitteſt for the ſame: where by the contrary in this caſe, ſuch is the miraculous Omnipotency of our ſtrong-taſted Tobacco, as it cures all ſorts of Diſeaſes (which never any Drug could do before) in all Perſons, and at all times. It cures all manner of Diſtillations, either in Head or Stomach (if you believe their Axioms) although in very deed is do both corrupt the Brain, and, by cauſing over quick digeſtion, fill the Stomach full of Crudities. It cures the Gout in the Feet, and (which is miraculous) in that very inſtant when the ſmoke thereof, as light, flyes up into the Head, the vertue thereof, as heavy, runs down to the little Toe: It helps all ſorts of Agues; it makes a man ſober, that was Drunk; it refreſhes a weary man, and yet makes a man hungry; being taken when they go to Bed, it makes one ſleep ſoundly; and yet being taken when a man is ſleepy and drowſie, it will, as they ſay, awaken his Brain, and quicken his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; As for curing of the Pox, it ſerves for that uſe, but among the Pocky <hi>Indian</hi> Slaves. Here in <hi>England</hi> it is refined, and will not deign to cure here any other then cleanly and gentlemanly Diſeaſes. O omnipotent power of Tobacco! And if it could by the ſmoke thereof chaſe out Devils, as he ſmoke of <hi>Tobias Fiſh</hi> did (which, I am ſure, could ſmell no ſtronger) it would ſerve for a precious Relict, both for the ſuperſtitious Prieſts, and the inſolent Puritans, to caſt out Devils withall.</p>
                  <p>Admitting then, and not confeſſing, that the uſe thereof were healthful for ſome ſorts of Diſeaſes, ſhould it be uſed for all Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? ſhould it be uſed by all men? ſhould it be uſed at all times? yea, ſhould it be uſed by able, young, ſtrong, healthful men? Medicine hath that vertue, that it never leaves a man in that ſtate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150099:8"/>wherein it finds him; it makes a ſick man whole, but a whole man ſick: And as Medicine helps Nature, being taken at time of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; ſo being ever and continually uſed, it doth but weaken, weary, and wear Nature. What ſpeak I of Medicine? Nay, let a man every hour of the day, or as oft as many in this Country uſe to take Tobacco; let a man, I ſay, but take as oft the beſt ſorts of Nouriſhments, in Meat and Drink, that can be deviſed, he ſhall, with the continual uſe thereof, weaken both his Head and his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, all his members ſhall become feeble, his Spirits dull, and in the end, as a drowſie, laſie Belly-god, he ſhall <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vaniſh in a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy.</p>
                  <p>And from this weakneſs it preceeds, that many in this Kingdom have had ſuch a continual uſe of taking this unſavory Smoke, as now they are not able to forbear the ſame, no more then an old Drunkard can abide to be long ſober, without falling into an incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Weakneſs, and evil Conſtitution; for their continual cuſtom hath made to them <hi>habitum, alteram naturam:</hi> So to thoſe that, from their Birth, have been continually nouriſhed upon Poyſon, and things venemous, wholeſome Meats are onely poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>Thus having, as I truſt, ſufficiently anſwered the moſt principal Arguments that are uſed in defence of this vile cuſtome. It reſts onely to inform you, what Sins and Vanities you commit in the filthy abuſe thereof: Firſt, Are you not guilty of ſinful and ſhameful luſt, (for luſt may be as well in any of the Sences as in feeling) that although you be troubled with no Diſeaſe, but in perfect health, yet can you neither be merry at an Ordinary, nor laſcivious in the Stews, if you lack Tobacco to provoke your Apetite to any of thoſe ſorts of Recreation; luſting after it as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did in the Wilderneſs after <hi>Quails.</hi> Secondly, It is as you uſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abuſe it, a branch of the ſin of Drunkenneſs, which is the root of all Sins; for as the onely delight that Drunkards take in Wine, is in the ſtrength of the taſt, and the force of the ſome thereof that mounts up to the Brain; for no Drunkards love any weak or ſweet Drink; So are not thoſe (I mean the ſtrong heat and fume) the only qualities that make Tobacco ſo delectable to all the Lovers of it? And as no man likes ſtrong heady Drink the firſt day (becauſe <hi>nemo repente fit turpiſſimus</hi>) but by cuſtom is piece and piece allured, while, in the end, a Drunkard will have as great a thriſt to be drunk, as a ſober man to quench his thirſt with a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:150099:9"/>draught, when he hath need of it. So is not this the very caſe of all the great takers of Tobacco, which therefore they themſelves do attribute to a bewitching quality in it? Thirdly, Is it not the greateſt ſin of all, that you, the people of all ſorts of this Kingdom, who are created and ordained by God, to beſtow both your Perſons and Goods for the maintainance both of the honour and ſafety of your King and Common-wealth, ſhould diſable your ſelves in both? In your Perſons, having by this continual vile Cuſtom brought your ſelves to this ſhameful imbecillity, that you are not able to ride or walk the Journey of a <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath, but you muſt have reeky coal brought you from the next poor Houſe to kindle your Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co with; whereas he cannot be thought able for any Service in the Wars, that cannot endure oftentimes the want of Meat, Drink and Sleep, much more then muſt he endure the want of Tobacco: In the times of the many glorious and victorious Battles fought by this Nation, there was no word of Tobacco; but now if it were time of Wars, and that you were to make ſome ſudden <hi>Cavalcado</hi> upon your Enemies; if any of you ſhould ſeek leiſure to ſtay behind his Fellow for taking of Tobacco, for my part, I ſhould never be ſorry for any evil chance that might befall him: To take a Cuſtome in any thing that cannot be left again, is moſt harmful to the people of any Land. <hi>Mollities</hi> and delicacy were the rack and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, firſt of the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and next of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. And this very cuſtom of taking Tobacco (whereof our preſent purpoſe is) is even at this day accompted ſo effeminate among the <hi>Indians</hi> themſelves, as in the Market they will offer no price for a Slave to be ſold, whom they find to be a great Tobacco-taker.</p>
                  <p>Now how you are by this Cuſtome diſabed in your Goods, let the Gentry of this Land bear witneſs, ſome of them beſtowing three, ſome four hundred pounds a year upon this precious Stink, which, I am ſure, might be beſtowed upon many far better Uſes.

                  <p>And for the Vanities committed in this filthy Cuſtome, is it not both great Vanity and Uncleanneſs, that at the Table, a place of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150099:9"/>Reſpect, of Cleanlineſs, of Modeſty, men ſhould not be aſhamed to ſit toſſing of Tobacco-Pipes, and puffing of the ſmoke of Tobacco one to another, making the filthy ſmoke and ſtink thereof to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale athwart the Diſhes, and infect the Air, when very often men that abhor it are at their Repaſt: Surely ſmoke becomes a Kitchin far better then a Dining-Chamber, and yet it makes a Kitchin alſo oftentimes in the inward parts of men, ſoyling and infecting them with an unctious and oylie kind of ſoot, as hath been found in ſome great Tobacco-Takers, that after their Death were opened: And not onely meat-time, but no other time nor action is exempted from the publique uſe of this uncivil trick; ſo as if the Wives of <hi>Diep</hi> liſt to conteſt with this Nation for good Manners, their worſt Manners would in all reaſon be found at leaſt not ſo diſhoneſt (as ours are) in this point, the publick uſe whereof at all times, and in all places, hath now ſo far prevailed, as divers men very ſound both in Judgment and Complexion, have been at laſt forced to take it alſo, without deſire, partly becauſe they were aſhamed to ſeem ſingular, (like the two Philoſophers that were forced to duck themſelves in that Rain-water, and ſo became Fools as well as the reſt of the people) and partly to be as one that was content to eat Garlick (which he did not love) that he might not be troubled with the ſmell of it in the breath of his Fellows. And is it not a great vanity that a man cannot heartily welcome his Friend now, but ſtraight they muſt be in hand with Tobacco: No, it is become in place of a Cure, a point of good Fellowſhip; and he that will refuſe to take a Pipe of Tobacco among his Fellows (though by his own election he would rather ſmell the ſavor of a ſink) is accompted peeviſh, and no good company; even as they do with tipling in the cold Eaſtern-Countries, yea the Miſtriſs cannot in a more mannerly kind entertain her Servant, then by giving him out of her fair hand a pipe of Tobacco; but herein is not only a great vanity, but a great contempt of God's good Gifts, that the ſweetneſs of mans breath being a good gift of God, ſhould be wilfully corrupted by this ſtinking ſmoke, wherein I muſt confeſs it hath too ſtrong of vertue, and ſo that which is an Ornament of Nature, and can neither by any artifice be at the firſt acquired, nor once loſt be recovered again, ſhall be filthily corrupted with an incurable ſtink, which vile quality is as directly contrary to that wrong Opinion which is holden of the wholeſomeneſs thereof, as the venome of putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is contrary to the vertue preſervative.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>ANother grand procuring and promoting cauſe of the Scurvy is, Tobacco; not taken notice of by any I meet with in print. And here we may charge much of the frequency, and the unwonted <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> or ſymptomatical appearance of this Diſeaſe, upon the late cuſtome of taking Tobacco. Many wonder that the Scurvy ſhould ſo much abound now in moſt places, and become ſo common and obvious now to every Eye, that was ſo rarely taken notice of in former times, notwithſtanding ſome of its procuring cauſes were very <hi>Antique.</hi> But we need not wonder ſo much, if we conſider the manner of living in former Ages, compared with our own; new Cuſtomes and Diets beget new Diſeaſes, or modifie the old ſo, as they ſeem to be new, in their unwonted manner, or frequency of appearance.</p>
                     <p>The Scurvy being altered and differenced now from what it was in ancient times; that the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> or ſymptomes of the Diſeaſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150099:10"/>in the Syndrome and Concurrence, is not exact alike with the deſcription of the Ancients; which hath cauſed a doubt, and it is held by ſome Phyſicians, That the Scurvy is a new Diſeaſe: But it is the old Scurvy dreſſed in a new garb, which by new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cauſes, and additional complications, is become more depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, more frequent, and more enlarged: few perſons but harbour this unwelcome Gueſt.</p>
                     <p>As an additional procurer of the Scurvy, Tobacco comes now to be examined, ſince whoſe general uſe the Scurvy hath much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and is become the moſt Epidemical. That this Plant is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious and deſtructive to Nature, and conſequently an introducer of the Scurvy will appear, if we conſider the effects that ſupervene and follow the taking of it. The Conſequents or Effects may be divided into two ſorts; Firſt, Such as accompany or ſupervene the firſt uſe of it. Secondly, Such as follow the long and conſtant uſe of it.</p>
                     <p>Symptoms ariſing upon the firſt and unaccuſtomed uſe of ſmok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, are Vomiting, Giddineſs, Fainting, Drunkenneſs Sleepineſs, depravation of the Sences, and ſuch like as follow upon the taking of ſome kind of Poyſons.</p>
                     <p>Effects upon the accuſtomed familiar uſe of it, are, Salivation, drawing a Flux of moiſture to the mouth, and drayning the Body; heat, dryneſs, laſſitude and wearineſs of the Spirits, a dulneſs and indiſpoſition of mind after; apt to ſleep, a filthy unſavory taſt in the mouth, a check to to the Stomach or Appetite.</p>
                     <p>The latent and more ſecret Effects wrought in the Body by the conſtant ſmoking of Tobacco, are; the inducing a Scorbutick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and promoting it where it is already radicated. And this is procured theſe wayes: Firſt, By depreſſing the Spirits, and ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enating them from their genuine propriety and purity. Secondly, By vitiating the Stomach, and depraving the Palate. Thirdly, By exhauſting the dulcid good juyce of the Body, leaving behind and procuring the remainder more viſcous, acrid and ſharpe. Fourthly, By prejudicing and weakening the Lungs and vital Parts.</p>
                     <p>That it hath a property to depreſs and clog the Spirits, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent by its narcotick vertue, cauſing a dulneſs, heavineſs, laſſitude, and diſpoſing to ſleep after the uſe of it. That it alienates the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is concluded from its virulent nature, and diſcord with our nature, and that is argued from the ſymptoms that attend the firſt uſe.</p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:150099:11"/>
                     <p>That it is noxious to the Stomach (the firſt grand Laboratory of the Body) is rational to aſſert; For as Tobacco affects the mouth with an ill ſtinking taſt, ſo the Stomach alſo goes not free, but is tainted with it, which is communicated to the Food received. Now conſidering the nature of Tobacco, as it is hot and dry, acrid, ſalt, biting, Purgative, or rather virulent, altogether medicinal, and not alimental; and this conſtantly to impregnate and tincture our nutimental ſucceſs with theſe properties and qualities, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe expect by length of time and daily uſe, but that it will ſhew its power and vertue to change and alter our Bodies; ſince it is not nutritive, but medicinal, eſtranged, and at a great diſtance from the nature of our Bodies, not fit to nouriſh, but to alter and produce ſome notable effects.</p>
                     <p>So great a ſympathy there is between the Stomach and Mouth, that the one is not affected, but the other is drawn into conſent; if the Stomach be foul, the Mouth hath an ill reliſh; and if the Mouth diſtaſts any thing, the Stomach nauſeates at it. Now this great Harmony and conſent between theſe two, ariſeth upon this accompt; the Mouth is appointed by nature the Stomachs taſter, to judge and diſcern what is fit and agreeable for the Stomach to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; and therefore the ſame membrane which inveſts the Mouth, and is the inſtrument of taſting, does alſo line the Stomach, ſo that hereby what is pleaſant and acceptable in the Mouth, is gratefully received into the Stomach; now by this affinity and ſympathy, you may rationally conclude, that vitiating of the taſt by Tobacco and tainting the Mouth with its ſtinking ſcent, muſt of neceſſity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the ſame to the Stomach, which takes Phyſick every time you take Tobacco, does mix with and infect the chile of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and is conveyed with it into all parts of the Body; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo great a medicinal power, muſt needs alter and change the Body, according to the properties it is endowed with, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſe, and daily reception of it.</p>
                     <p>Now Tobacco being of an accrimonious, hot, dry, &amp;c. nature, does pervert and change the Balſamick juyces of the Body into a more ſharpe and fiery temper, and alienate them, whereby they are not ſo amicable and fit for nutrition, as many ſcorbutick Tobacco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts do evidence upon examination, and their conſtitution changed by the evil uſe of this Plant; and it is very reaſonable to expect it, and impute ſuch alterations to the uſe thereof, ſince they are the proper effects of ſuch a Cauſe; the more remarkable diſcovery,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150099:11"/>and frequency of the Scurvy, may well and juſtly be imputed to Tobacco, ſince of latter years that Tobacco hath been in uſe, and in thoſe Countries where Tobacco is much taken, it doth abound moſt.</p>
                     <p>Although I diſcommend the uſe of Tobacco by ſmoking it, as an injurious Cuſtome, yet I highly applaud it, as very medicinal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly uſed. I remember about fifteen years ſince, a Patient of mine in <hi>Derby-ſhire</hi> fell into a great <hi>Paroxyſm</hi> of an <hi>Aſthma,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to ſuffocation, I exhibited a Doſe of the Sirrup of Tobacco, which gave him preſent help, and within a few hours was relieved, that he could draw his Breath with much eaſe and freedome: And about a year after, at <hi>Maxfield</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> I cured a Gentlewoman of an Ulcer in <hi>Ano</hi> of ſeven years ſtanding, chiefly with the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tobacco; and although other things were uſed, yet I aſcribe moſt of the Cure to that Unguent. And in many other caſes Tobacco is of good uſe, which I have experienced; but ſmok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it I find to be hurtful, if it be cuſtomary. I ſhall not be ſo ſtrict and ſevere againſt the uſe of it, as to forbid all perſons the ſmoking it upon any ſcore whatever; for that which may be uſed at certain times as medicinal, upon juſt occaſions requiring in ſome perſons, may prove very bad and pernicious upon the conſtant and general uſe; and this is the caſe of Tobacco.</p>
                     <p>Tobacconiſts, whom cuſtome hath enſnared, and brought them to delight in it, are willing to be perſwaded and deluded, that it is good and wholeſome, at leaſt harmleſs; the pretences which they urge in defence of it, are ſuch as theſe: Some plead for it, and uſe it after Meat, as a help to Digeſtion, and therefore take it as a good remedy againſt a bad Stomach and weak Digeſtion.</p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer, They are much miſtaken herein, not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between digeſtion, and precipitation of meat out of the Stomach; digeſtion is not performed but in due time, by retexture, alteration, fermentation, and volatization of Meat, and till then, is not fit to paſs out of the Digeſtive-Office, which requires ſome hours more or leſs, according to the nature of the Food received, of facil or difficil digeſtion; now that which provokes the Stomach to a diſtribution of ſemi-digeſted Chyle, and unloading it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore digeſtion be finiſhed and perfected, offers great injury to the Body; and this is the caſe of Tobacco (by its lavative ſtimulating properties) which error committed in the firſt Digeſtive-Office is not corrected, nor the damage recompenced by the accuteneſs and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150099:12"/>ſtrong elaborations of the ſubſequent digeſtions;<note place="margin">Aphoriſm.</note> and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in part, the Scurvy is procured hereby. Some take Tobacco for refreſhment after labour, and divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſerious thoughts, being tired with buſineſs, ſtudy and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. True it is, Tobacco puts a ſuſpenſion upon ſerious thoughts, and gives a relaxation for a time in ſome perſons; others contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, and run over their buſineſs with more delight, by the help and during the taking of a Pipe: But both theſe perſons though ſeemingly delighted and refreſhed for a ſhort time, yet afterwards the Spirits are laſſated and tired, and are more flat, dull and ſomno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, when the Pipe is out; this was but a cheat, the Spirits were not truly refreſhed, invigorated and reinforced; as Wine does enliven and make brisk the Spirits, by affording and communicating an additional ſupply; but by the fume of Tobacco the Spirits are a little inebriated and agitated by an other motion then their own, which is a ſeeming refreſhment, and ſhort, not real, ſubſtantial and laſting.</p>
                     <p>Others plead for Tobacco, and take it as a Remedy againſt Rheume, becauſe a great dryer and exhauſter of ſuperfluous Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. To evince the Error of this Opinion, conſider what is the cauſe whereby Rheumes and crude moiſture in the Body do abound; and then you will plainly ſee, whether ſmoking Tobacco be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or likely Remedy to prevent or oppoſe it. Phlegm and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moiſture does ariſe and abound in the Body, from a deficiency and debility of the Digeſtions, as alſo impediment or impotency of the expulſive faculty, that the remainders after digeſtion be not tranſmitted by the common ductures. Now this fume of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco gives no Roboration, adds no ſtrength to the digeſtive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, having no ſymbolical qualities to comply with, and aſſiſt them, is very plain. Alſo that ſeparation and expulſion of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous moiſture by this fume, is not promoted and tranſmitted through the more commodious ductures and paſſages appointed by nature for emiſſion; onely a ſalivation by the mouth is procured, which brings no advantage, but detriment; for this Flux of moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture doth not ariſe as critical, from the impulſion of Nature, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and protruding; but from a promiſcuous attraction of fluid moiſture, (by vertue of its acrimonious heat) as well the landable, util ſuccus, as the degenerated and ſuperfluous; ſo that conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draining the Body of this dulcid ſeroſity, muſt cauſe many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies through the want of it, in as much as it is very
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150099:12"/>ſerviceable to the Body, in the integrity of its nature, but being alienated, is then reduced or vented by better means, nature concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the medicine: But admit this did attract only excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious moiſture (which it does not) yet conſidering it Vitiates the Stomach, and Impregnates the Chyle, with its evil properties, 'tis much better to forbear then to uſe it; that benefit would not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence this injury. And further, that which is a preventing or curative remedy of ſuperfluous Moiſture, Rheume, or Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique matter, applies <hi>à Priori</hi> to the Digeſtions, the Springs from whence ſuch Effects do ariſe; not <hi>à Poſteriori</hi> to the producted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which this fume ſeems to pump out, but does not ſtop the Leak, is therefore no radical Medicine; and they that ſmoke To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco upon this accompt as a great dryer, and exhauſter of ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moiſture, are much deceived in the expected benefit; it onely brings a current of moiſture, which ought to be expended other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but it abates nothing in the Fountain or Springs; rather augments, and makes an overflow, (for the Reaſons aforeſaid) as Tobacconiſts do evidence by their much ſpitting.</p>

The Scurvy does not require all the procuring cauſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in its production, but ſometimes one, and ſometimes another is able to do it; and although you take no Tobacco, yet perhaps your Parents did, or theirs; and it is ſufficient to make you fare the worſe; bad cuſtomes and abuſive living extends farther then the perſon ſo offending: it is tranſmitted to their Off-ſpring, as in another Work I have noted in theſe words.<note place="margin">Tutela ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis.</note> But yet the Crime were leſs, if onely to themſelves the prejudice did extend, but alſo to Poſterity their Diſeaſes are propagated; the Children having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon them, and radicated in the principals of their nature, the ſeminal power and productive vertue of inordinate and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate living of their Genitors and Progenitors, that the Children may bear witneſs to the following Age, the vice and folly of their Parents and Predeceſſors, recorded and characteriſed in them, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Hereby you may underſtand, that evil cuſtomes (as of ſmoking Tobacco) do not injure onely the perſon doing ſo, but the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration after them are prejudiced: And, here by the way, we may
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150099:13"/>take notice of the many Rickity Children in this latter Age, ſince the uſe of Tobacco, which Diſeaſe was not known, before the frequent uſe of it. Tobacco does enervate and debilitate the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that we may rationally expect the Children from this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to be Scorbutick, Rickity, and more feeble then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>

                        <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, put forth his Edict againgſt the ſmoking of Tobacco, and made it a Capital Crime for any that ſhould ſo uſe it; the Reaſon of this ſevere Prohibition was, that it did render his People infertile: I ſhall not urge the inconvenience of. Tobacco ſo far, but this I may aſſext, that it cauſeth an infirm Generation, by debilitating the Parents, and rendering them Scorbutick, which Impreſſions are carried <hi>in ſemine</hi> to their Children, and makes a diſeaſed Iſſue. And I obſerved in <hi>Virginia,</hi> being ſome time in that Colony, that the Planters who had lived long there, being great Smokers, were of a withered decayed Countenance, and very Scorbutick, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by this imoderate fume; nor are they long-lived, but do ſhorten their dayes by the intemperate uſe of Tobacco and Brandy.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>James,</hi> that learned Philoſophical Prince of this Nation, wiſely conſidering the nature of this Plant, and having a good Stoxaſtick Head to foreſee the inconveniencies that would ariſe to his People, by the ill cuſtome of ſmoking it, he being the great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcian of the Body Politick, does excellently dehort his Subjects (being tender of their future welfare) from this noxious fume,<note place="margin">His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter blaſt to Tobacco.</note> and writes an Invective againſt it; whoſe Oratory and ſolid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were enough to have broken the neck of this Cuſtome, had they any regard to his kindneſs, or ſenſe of their own good, and of their Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>I might have enlarged my ſelf upon this Subject, and run over moſt Scorbutick ſymptomes, ſhewing how they are either firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured or aggravated by this fume: But from what hath been ſaid already, it plainly appears, that Tobacco is a great procurer and promoter of the Scurvy, in as much as many Scorbutick ſymptomes are the proper effects of ſmoking Tobacco, as laſſitude, dulneſs, ſomnolency, ſpitting, ill taſt in the mouth, &amp;c. And although ſome few perſons either by the ſtrength of nature, do ſtrongly reſiſt the bad impreſſions it ſets upon ſeveral parts of the Body, or by the peculiarity of nature is leſs offenſive and hurtful to ſome, or brings
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150099:13"/>ſome particular benefit (amongſt its many ill properties) that makes it ſeemingly good; yet inſenſibly and by time it damageth all; and thoſe few good effects in ſome few perſons are not of validity to give it a general approbation and uſe, and free it from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a great procurer of the Scurvy, but may be juſtly reckoned in that Catalogue.</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Though I do not hold it the principal Agent in digeſtion, yet it does excite, is auxiliary, and a neceſſary concomitant of a good digeſtion, <hi>ut ſignum &amp; cauſa.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Omne frigus per ſe, &amp; proviribus deſtruit;</hi> Cold in its own nature, and according to the graduation of its power, extinguiſheth natural heat, and is deſtructive; but <hi>per accidens,</hi> and as it is in <hi>gradu remiſſo,</hi> it may contemperate, allay, and refreſh, where heat abounds, and is exalted.</p>
                     <p>Therefore as there is <hi>variety</hi> of Palates and Stomachs liking and agreeing beſt with ſuch kind of Meats and Drinks, which to others are utterly diſguſtful, diſagreeing and injurious, though good in themſelves: ſo is it in Drink <hi>warmed</hi> or <hi>cold;</hi> what one finds a benefit in, the other receives a <hi>prejudice;</hi> at leaſt does not find that ſatisfaction and refreſhment, under ſuch a qualification; becauſe of the various natures, particular appetitions, and <hi>idioſyncratical</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of ſeveral bodies, one thing will not agree with all: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that cannot drink <hi>warm,</hi> let him take it <hi>cold,</hi> and it is well to him; but he that drinks it <hi>warm,</hi> does better. And this is to be underſtood in Winter, when the extremity of cold hath <hi>congelated</hi> and <hi>fixed</hi> the ſpirits of the Liquor in a <hi>torpid</hi> inactivity; which by a gentle warmth are <hi>unfettered,</hi>

                     <p>There are three ſorts of <hi>Drinkers:</hi> one drinks to ſatisfie <hi>Nature,</hi> and to ſupport his <hi>body;</hi> without which he cannot well ſubſiſt, and requires it as receſſary to his Being. Another drinks a <hi>degree</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this man, and takes a larger <hi>doſe,</hi> with this intention, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilarate and chear his <hi>mind,</hi> to baniſh <hi>cares</hi> and <hi>trouble,</hi> and help him to <hi>ſleep</hi> the better; and theſe two are lawful Drinkers. A third drinks neither for the good of the <hi>body,</hi> or the mind, but to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:150099:14"/>ſtupifie and drown both; by exceeding the former bounds, and running into exceſs, fruſtrating thoſe <hi>ends</hi> for which drink was appointed by Nature; converting this <hi>ſupport</hi> of life and health, making it a <hi>procurer</hi> of ſickneſs and untimely death.</p>
                     <p>Many ſuch there are, who drink not to <hi>ſatifie</hi> Nature, but force it down many times <hi>contrary</hi> to natural inclination; and when there is a reluctancy againſt it: as <hi>Drunkards,</hi> that pour in Liquor, not for love of the <hi>drink,</hi> or that Nature requires it by <hi>thirſt,</hi> but onely to maintain the <hi>mad frollick,</hi> and keep the Company from breaking up. Some to excuſe this intemperance, hold it as good <hi>Phyſick</hi> to be drunk once a moneth, and plead for that liberty as a wholſome cuſtome, and quote the authority of a famous <hi>Phyſician</hi> for it. Whether this Opinion be allowable, and to be admitted in the due <hi>Regiment</hi> for preſervation of Health, is fit to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>

                        <hi>That every thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding its juſt bounds, and golden mediocrity, is hurtful to Nature.</hi> The beſt of things are not excepted in this general rule; but are reſtrained and limited here to a due proportion.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> is no longer ſuſtenance, but a load and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, if they exceed the <hi>quantum</hi> due to each particular perſon; and then they are not, what they are properly in themſelves, and by the appointment of Nature, the <hi>preſervatives</hi> of life and health; but the <hi>cauſes</hi> of ſickneſs, and conſequently of death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Drink</hi> was not appointed man, to diſcompoſe and diſorder him in all his faculties, but to <hi>ſupply, nouriſh,</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> them. Drink exceeding its meaſure, is no longer a refreſhment, to <hi>irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> and water the thirſty body, but makes an inundation to drown and ſuffocate the <hi>vital powers.</hi> It puts a man out of the ſtate of health, and repreſents him in ſuch a degenerate condition both in reſpect of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>mind,</hi> that we may look upon the man, as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the World, becauſe he is already gone out of himſelf, and ſtrangely <hi>metamorphoſed</hi> from what he was.</p>
                     <p>I never knew <hi>ſickneſs</hi> or a <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> to be good preventing Phyſick; and to be drunk, is no other then an unſound ſtate, and the whole body out of frame by this great change. What difference is there between <hi>ſickneſs</hi> and <hi>drunkenneſs?</hi> Truly I cannot diſtinguiſh them otherwiſe then as <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>ſpecies:</hi> Drunkenneſs being a raging
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:150099:15"/>Diſeaſe, denominated and diſtinguiſhed from other ſickneſſes, by its <hi>procatarctick</hi> or <hi>procuring</hi> cauſe, <hi>Drink.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That Drunkenneſs is a Diſeaſe or ſickneſs, will appear in that it hath all the requiſites to <hi>conſtitute</hi> a <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> and is far diſtant from a <hi>ſtate</hi> of health: for as health is the free and regular diſcharge of all the <hi>functions</hi> of the body and mind; and ſickneſs, when the <hi>functions</hi> are not performed, or weakly and depravedly: then <hi>Ebrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> may properly be ſaid to be a Diſeaſe or ſickneſs, becauſe it hath the <hi>ſymptoms</hi> and <hi>diagnoſtick</hi> ſigns, of an <hi>acute</hi> and great Diſeaſe: for, during the time of <hi>drunkenneſs,</hi> and ſome time after, few of the faculties perform rightly, but very depravedly and <hi>preternatually:</hi> if we examine the <hi>intellectual faculties,</hi> we ſhall find the <hi>reaſon</hi> gone, the <hi>memory</hi> loſt or much abated, and the <hi>will</hi> ſtrangely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: if we look into the <hi>ſenſitive</hi> faculties, they are diſordered, and their <hi>functions</hi> impedited, or performed very deficiently: the <hi>eyes</hi> do not ſee well, nor the <hi>ears</hi> hear well, nor the <hi>palate</hi> reMifh, &amp;c. The <hi>ſpeech</hi> faulters and is imperfect; the <hi>ſtomach</hi> perhaps vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits or nauſeates; his <hi>legs</hi> fail: Indeed if we look through the whole man, we ſhall ſee all the faculties depraved, and their functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons either not executed, or very diſorderly and with much defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.</p>
                     <p>Now according to theſe <hi>ſymptoms</hi> in other <hi>ſickneſſes,</hi> we judge a man not likely to live long; and that it is very hard he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; the danger is ſo great from the many threatning <hi>ſymptoms</hi> that attend this ſickneſs, and <hi>prognoſticate</hi> a bad event: here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appears <hi>ſalutary;</hi> but from head to foot, the Diſeaſe is preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in every part; which being collated, the <hi>ſyndrom</hi> is <hi>lethal,</hi> and judgment to be given ſo.</p>
                     <p>Surely then Drunkenneſs is a very great Diſeaſe for the time, but becauſe it is not uſually <hi>mortal,</hi> nor laſts long; therefore it it ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and look't upon as a trivial matter that will cure it ſelf. But now the queſtion may be asked; Why is not <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> uſually <hi>mortal?</hi> ſince the ſame ſigns in other Diſeaſes are accounted <hi>mortal,</hi> and the event proves if ſo. To which I anſwer; All the hopes we have that a man <hi>drunk</hi> ſhould live, is; firſt, From common <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> that it is not deadly: Secondly, From the nature of the <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> or <hi>procuring</hi> Cauſe, ſtrong Drink or Wine; which although it rage, and ſtrangely diſcompoſe the man for a time, yet it laſts not long, nor is <hi>mortal.</hi> The <hi>inebriating</hi> ſpirits of the liquor, flowing in ſo faſt, and joyning with the ſpirits of mans body, make ſo <hi>high</hi>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:150099:15"/>a <hi>tide,</hi> that overflows all the banks and bounds of order: For, the ſpirits of mans body, thoſe <hi>agents</hi> in each faculty, act ſmoothly, regularly and conſtantly, with a moderate ſupply; but being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and forced out of their natural courſe, and exerciſe of their duty, by the large addition of <hi>furious ſpirits;</hi> ſpurs the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into ſtrange diſorders, as if nature were conflicting with death and diſſolution; but yet it proves not <hi>mortal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this, firſt, becauſe theſe <hi>adventitious ſpirits</hi> are amicable and friendly to our bodies in their own nature, and therefore not ſo <hi>deadly injurious,</hi> as that which is not ſo familiar or noxious.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Becauſe they are very <hi>volatile, light,</hi> and <hi>active;</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture therefore does much ſooner recover her ſelf, <hi>tranſpires</hi> and ſends forth the <hi>overplus</hi> received; then if the <hi>morbifick</hi> matter were more ponderous and fixed; the <hi>gravamen</hi> from thence would be much worſe and longer in removing: as an over-charge of <hi>Meat, Bread, Fruit,</hi> or ſuch like ſubſtances not ſpirituous; but dull and heavy <hi>(comparativè)</hi> is of more difficult digeſtion, and layes a greater and more dangerous load upon the faculties, having not ſuch <hi>volatile brisk</hi> ſpirits to aſſiſt Nature, nor of ſo liquid a fine ſubſtance, of quicker and eaſier digeſtion: So that the <hi>ſymptoms</hi> from thence are much more dangerous, then thoſe <hi>peracute</hi> diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ariſing from Liquors. So likewiſe thoſe bad <hi>ſymptoms</hi> in other Diſeaſes are more to be feared and accounted <hi>mortal</hi> (then the like ariſing from <hi>drunkenneſs</hi>) becauſe thoſe perhaps depend upon <hi>malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant cauſes;</hi> or ſuch as by time are <hi>radicated</hi> in the body; or from the defection of ſome <hi>principal part:</hi> but the ſtorm and diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ariſing from <hi>drunkenneſs,</hi> as it is ſuddenly raiſed, ſo common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it ſoon falls, depending upon <hi>benign cauſes,</hi> and a ſpiritucus mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that layes not ſo great an oppreſſion; but <hi>inebriates</hi> the ſpirits, that they act very diſorderly and unwontedly; or by the <hi>ſoporife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> vertue, <hi>ſtupefies</hi> them for a time, untill they recover their <hi>agility</hi> again.</p>
                     <p>But all this while, I do not ſee, <hi>that to be drunk once a moneth,</hi> ſhould prove good Phyſick: all I think that can be ſaid in this behalf, is; that by overcharging the Stomach, <hi>vomiting is procured;</hi> and ſo carries off ſomething that was lodged there, which might breed Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>This is a <hi>bad excuſe</hi> for good Fellows, and a <hi>poor plea</hi> for <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs:</hi> for the gaining of one ſuppoſed benefit (which might be obtained otherwiſe) you introduce twenty <hi>inconveniences</hi> by it. I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150099:16"/>do not like the preventing of one Diſeaſe that <hi>may be,</hi> by procuring of one at the <hi>preſent certainly,</hi> and many hereafter moſt probably: and if the Diſeaſe feared, or <hi>may be,</hi> could be prevented no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but by this <hi>drunken means;</hi> then that might tollerate and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it: but there are other wayes better and ſafer to cleanſe the body either <hi>upwards</hi> or <hi>downwards,</hi> then by overcharging with ſtrong drink, and making the man to <hi>unman</hi> himſelf; the evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of which are many, the benefit hoped for, but <hi>pretended;</hi> or if any, but very <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>inconſiderable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And although, as I ſaid before, the <hi>drunken fit</hi> is not <hi>mortal,</hi> and the danger perhaps not great for the preſent; yet thoſe <hi>drunken bouts</hi> being repeated; the <hi>relicts</hi> do accumulate, debilitate Nature, and lay the foundation of many <hi>chronick Diſeaſes.</hi> Nor can it be expected otherwiſe; but you may juſtly conclude from the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt irregular actions which appear to us <hi>externally,</hi> that the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within alſo, and their motions are ſtrangely diſordered: for, the <hi>outward madneſs</hi> and unwonted actions, proceed from the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal impulſes,</hi> and diſordered motions of the faculties: which general diſturbance and diſcompoſure (being frequent) muſt needs <hi>ſubvert</hi> the <hi>oeconomy</hi> and government of humance Nature; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ruine the Fabrick of mans body.</p>
                     <p>The ill effects, and more eminent products of ebriety, are; firſt, <hi>A changing of the natural tone of the Stomach, and alienating the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive faculty;</hi> That inſtead of a good tranſmutation of food, a degenerate Chyle is produced. Common experience tells, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <hi>drunken debauch,</hi> the ſtomach loſeth its appetite, and acuteneſs of digeſtion; as <hi>belching, thirſt, diſreliſh, nauſeating,</hi> do certainly teſtifie: yet to ſupport nature, and continue the cuſtom of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome-food is received; but we cannot expect from ſuch a <hi>Stomach</hi> that a <hi>good digeſtion</hi> ſhould follow: and it is ſome dayes before the Stomach recover its <hi>eucraſy,</hi> and perform its office well: and if theſe miſcarriages happen but <hi>ſeldom,</hi> the injury is the leſs, and ſooner recompenced; but by the <hi>frequent repetition</hi> of theſe rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous practices, the Stomach is overthrown and alienated from its integrity.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>An unwholſome corpulency and cachectick plenitude of body does follow: or a degenerate macilency, and a decayed conſumptive conſtitution.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>A</hi> Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophy, <hi>or</hi> Atrophy.</note> Great Drinkers that continue it long, few of them eſcape, but fall into one of theſe <hi>conditions</hi> and <hi>habit</hi> of body: for, if the Stomach diſcharge not its office aright; the <hi>ſubſequent
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150099:16"/>digeſtions</hi> will alſo be defective. So great a conſent and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance is there upon the <hi>Stomach;</hi> that other parts cannot perform their duty, if this leading <hi>principal Part</hi> be perverted and debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: nor can it be expected otherwiſe; for, from this <hi>Laboratory</hi> and <hi>prime office</hi> of digeſtion, all the parts muſt receive their ſupply; which being not ſuteable, but depraved, are drawn into <hi>debauchery</hi> alſo, and a <hi>degenerate</hi> ſtate; and the whole Body fed with a vitious <hi>alimentary ſuccus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that different <hi>products</hi> or <hi>habits</hi> of body ſhould ariſe from the ſame kind of debauchery, happens upon this ſcore. As there are different <hi>properties</hi> and <hi>conditions</hi> of bodies;<note place="margin">Quicquid recipitur, recipitur per modum recipientis. <hi>Ax.</hi>
                        </note> ſo the reſult from the ſame procuring cauſes ſhall be much different and various: one puffs up, fills, and grows <hi>hydropical;</hi> another pines away, and falls <hi>Conſumptive,</hi> from <hi>exceſs</hi> in <hi>drinking;</hi> and this proceeds from the different <hi>diſpoſition</hi> of parts: for, in ſome perſons, although the <hi>ſtomach</hi> be vitiated, yet the ſtrength of the <hi>ſubſequent digeſtions</hi> is ſo great, from the integrity and vigor of thoſe parts deſtinated to ſuch offices; that they act <hi>ſtrenuouſly,</hi> though their <hi>object matter</hi> be tranſmitted to them imperfect and degenerate; and therefore do keep the body <hi>plump</hi> and <hi>full,</hi> although the juyces be <hi>foul,</hi> and of a <hi>depraved</hi> nature. Others <hi>è contra,</hi> whoſe parts are not ſo firm and vigorous; that will not act upon any ſcore, but with their <hi>proper object;</hi> does not endeavour a tranſmutation of ſuch <hi>aliene matter,</hi> but receiving it with a <hi>nice reluctance,</hi> tranſmits it to be evacuated and ſent forth by the next convenient ducture, or emunctory: and from hence the body is fruſtrated of nutrition, and falls away: So that the pouring in of much liquor (although it be good <hi>in ſua na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura</hi>) does not beget <hi>much aliment,</hi> but waſheth through the body, and is not aſſimilated.</p>
                     <p>But here ſome may object and think; <hi>That waſhing of the body through with good Liquor, ſhould cleanſe the body, and make it fit for nouriſhment, and be like good Phyſick for a foul body.</hi> But the effect proves the contrary; and it is but reaſon it ſhould be ſo: for, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Liquor (whether Wine, or other) be pure and good; yet when the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is drawn off from it, the <hi>remainder</hi> is but <hi>dead, flat, thick,</hi> and a <hi>muddy flegm.</hi> As we find in the deſtillation of Wine, or other Liquors; ſo it is in mans body: the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is drawn off <hi>firſt,</hi> and all the parts of mans body are ready <hi>Receivers,</hi> and do <hi>imbibe</hi> that <hi>limpid congenerous</hi> enlivener, freely and readily: but the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,</hi> of greateſt proportion; that heavy, dull, <hi>phlegmy part,</hi>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:150099:17"/>and of a <hi>narcotick quality;</hi> lies long fluctuating upon the digeſtions, and paſſeth but ſlowly; turns ſowr, and vitiates the <hi>Craſes</hi> of the parts: So that this great <hi>inundation,</hi> and ſuppoſed waſhing of the body, does but drown the Faculties, <hi>ſtupefie</hi> or <hi>choak</hi> the Spirits, and defile all the Parts; not <hi>purifie</hi> and <hi>cleanſe.</hi> And although the more <hi>ſubtile</hi> and <hi>thinner</hi> portion, paſſeth away in ſome perſons pretty freely by <hi>

                     <head>That it may not be ſaid to be onely one Doctors Opinion, here is added another Collection againſt Tobacco-ſmoking, written by the learned Doctor <hi>George Thompſon,</hi> in his Book <hi>Of Preſervation of the Bloud.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>A Bove all, I much condemn the common abuſe of Tobacco; out of which, no other ſymptomes, than a ſcorbutical Venome is accidentally ſucked. Agreeable to which Judgment of mine, is that of the Legitimate Artiſt Doctor <hi>Maynwaring,</hi> who marks where Tobacco is much taken, the Scurvy doth moſt abound: I wiſh thoſe who are too forward to condemn Chymical Preparations, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by true Philoſophers, would reflect upon themſelves and others, as yet ignorant of <hi>Pyrotomy,</hi> how that they are too forward in ruſhing into this Science; Indirectly making uſe of a Retort with a receiver, I mean a Pipe, and the mouth for the reduction of this Plant into Salt and Sulphur, proving not a little injurious to them. If they were conſcious how ſubtil an enemy it is, how hardly to be dealt withall, in a moderate ſenſe; how inſinuating, tempting, deluding; how diſagreeing to nature, as is manifeſt at firſt taking it, pretending an evacuation onely of a ſuperfluous moiſture, when
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150099:17"/>it alſo generates the ſame; how it wrongs the Ventricle; by reaſon of a continuity of its membrane, with that of the mouth; how it taints the nutricious Juyce; how it dozes the Brain, impairing its Faculties, eſpecially the memory: They would quickly commit this Herb to the hand of thoſe that know what belongs to the right management and improvement thereof.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs it hath a Dowry beſtowed upon it, which may make it very acceptable to all ingenious Artiſts, for inward and outward uſes; yet as the matter is handled indiſcreetly, I know nothing introduced into this Nation hath diſcovered it ſelf more apparently hurtful, in aggravating and graduating this ſcorbutical evil among us then Tobacco.</p>
                     <p>I am not ignorant what ſome Object, That there are thoſe who taking an extraordinary quantity of Tobacco, have lived a to great age, as Sixty or Seventy Years. 2. That multitudes not taking this fume, are yet notwithſtanding over run with the Scurvy. 3. That ſome have proteſted, they have received certain benefit by this Plant, when other Remedies preſcribed by able Phyſitians have been invalid to relieve them. 4. That there are places where Man, Woman and Child, take in this Smoke, none of theſe ſad effects appearing.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. I condemn not medicinal appropriation and application of this Drug, for I knòw it to be of excellent Vertue: There is great difference, <hi>Inter dictum ſecundum quid &amp; dictum ſimpliciter,</hi> between the cenſure of any thing as abſolutely evil, and the indirect practiſe of it: Moreover, what is one man's Meat, may be anothers Poyſon.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The generality of ſmoking it in ſome places, without thoſe ill effects we find, doth not at all fruſtrate my aſſertion: For I have obſerved a more moderate courſe of life in Diet, the goodneſs of the Air, with an hereditary Cuſtome, hath in great meaſure bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced the nocument or inconveniences, which otherwiſe they would have contracted by exceſs thereof; neither are theſe nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tobacconiſts acquitted from this evil, as it appears by thoſe frequent eruptions in the skin, whereby a greater miſchief is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented within, they being only effloreſcences of a ſcorbutical pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
                     <p>There are, as I apprehend, two principal Reaſons to be given, why this Weed hath captivated ſo many Thouſands in ſuch ſort, that they become meer Slaves to it.</p>
                     <p>One is, the ſeeming delight it affords in the preſent taking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, inducing a pleaſing bewitching melancholy, exceedingly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Fancies, ſo that they could wiſh with him in the Poet, <hi>Hic furor, ô ſuperi, ſit mihi perpetuus,</hi> O that I might alwayes thus melancholize; not conſidering though the Prologue be chearful, the Epilogue is often ſad; though the Spirits are as it were titilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and charmed into a ſweet complacency for a ſhort ſpace; yet afterward a dulneſs, gloomineſs, ſeizes upon them; indeed, how can it be otherwiſe, ſeeing they are but forcibly lulled into this ſecure placid Condition, by that which is as far remote from the Vitals, as the Beams of the Sun are from a black Cloud.</p>
                     <p>I find in this Smoke, a ſtinking, retunding, condenſing Opiate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Sulphur, and an acrid Salt, profligating, extimulating, ſo that by the bridling much of the one, and the exceſſive ſpurring of the other; the ſpirits, like a free metalſome Horſe, are quite tired out at laſt: It is impoſſible that the frequent inſinuations of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til fume, making ſhew of affinity, but quite of another tribe with the animals, ſhould not at length (let a body be never ſo ſtrong, and cuſtom how ever prevalent) either pervert or ſubvert his well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted frame.</p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:150099:18"/>
                     <p>Another Reaſon (obſervable only by thoſe that are true Gnoſticks of themſelves) why Tobacco is ſo highly ſet by, and hath ſo many Followers; is its meretricious kiſſes, given to thoſe that embrace it: oftentimes ſecretly wounding them mortally, yet are they not throughly ſenſible who gave them the ſtroke. I have taken notice of very temperate Perſons in other things, who, for diverſion, have indulged their genious, <hi>ad Hilaritatem,</hi> continuing for urbanity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake in Company they liked, longer then ordinary, have ſo cloſely purſued this pernicious Art of ſucking in the ſmoke of this Herb, that never any Chymiſt was more ſolicitous, in greater haſt to fetch his matters over the Helm by Diſtillation: Behold what the event was! the next morning I have heard complaints come from them, that their Brains were ſomething ſtupid, dozed, their Stomach nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous, being thirſty, alſo feaveriſh: All this they attribute to their tranſgreſſing limits of Sobriety in drinking, or to the ſophiſticated adulterated Liquors, not finding the leaſt fault with the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant uſe of Tobacco, which above all did them the moſt hurt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately: Something I can ſpeak experimentally to this purpoſe, for having been wedded to it many years paſt, ſuppoſing I had got an Antidote againſt Hypochondriack melancholy with an Apophleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm, to diſcharge crude matter; I applauded it in all Company, without advertency at that time, how falſe and treacherous it was, which afterward perceiving, I withdrew my ſelf from the uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by degrees, at length was altogether divorced from it.</p>

When wit's out of the head and ſtrength out of the body, it thruſts even Cowards and Daſtards, unfenced and unarmed, into needleſs Frayes and Combats. And then to whom are Wounds, broken Heads, blue Eyes, maimed Limbs?

                  <p>All Interpreters agree, That he means ſome moſt virulent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, whoſe Poyſon is preſent and deadly. All the woes he hath mentioned before, were but as the ſting of ſome Emmet, Waſpe, or Nettle, in compariſon of this Cockatrice which is even unto death; death ſpeedy, death painful, and woful death, and that as naturally and inevitably, as <hi>Opium</hi> procureth ſleep, as <hi>Hellebore</hi> purgeth, or any Poyſon killeth.</p>
                  <p>Three forked is this ſting, and three fold is the death it procureth to all that are ſtrung therewith. The firſt is, the death of Grace; The ſecond is, of the Body: The third is, of Soul and Body eternal. All ſin is the poyſon wherewithall the old Serpent and red Dragon envenomes the ſoul of Man, but no ſin (except it be that which is unto death) ſo mortal as this, which though not ever unpardonably, yet for the moſt part is alſo irrecoverably and inevitably unto death. Seeſt thou one bitten with any other Snake, there is hope and help: as the Father ſaid of his Son, when he had information of his Gaming, of his Prodigality, yea, of his Whoring: But when he heard that he was poyſoned with Drunkenneſs, he gave him for dead, his caſe for deſperate and forlorn. Age and experience often cures the other; but this encreaſeth with years, and parteth not till death. Whoring is a deep Ditch, yet ſome few ſhall a man ſee return and lay hold on the wayes of life, one of a thouſand, but ſcarce one Drunkard of ten thouſand. One <hi>Ambroſe</hi> mentions, and one have I known; and but one of all that ever I knew or heard of. Often have I been asked, and often have I enquired, but never could meet with an inſtance, ſave one or two at the moſt. I ſpeak of Drunkards, not of one drunken; of ſuch who rarely and caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have <hi>Noah</hi>-like been ſurpriſed, over-taken at unawares: But if once a Cuſtome, ever Neceſſity. Wine takes away the Heart, and ſpoils the Brain, overthrows the Faculties and Organs of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Reſolution. And is it not juſt with God, that he who will put out his natural light, ſhould have his ſpiritual extinguiſhed? He that will deprive himſelf of Reaſon, ſhould loſe alſo the Guide and Pilot of Reaſon, God's Spirit and Grace: He that will wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and willingly make himſelf an Habitation of Unclean Spirits, ſhould not diſpoſſeſs them at his own pleaſure? Moſt aptly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it tranſlated by <hi>Tremelius Hamorrbois,</hi> which <hi>Geſner</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds with the <hi>Dipſas,</hi> or thirſty Serpent, whoſe poyſon breedeth ſuch thirſt, drought, and inflamation; like that of Ratsbane, that they never leave drinking, till they burſt and die withall. Would
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:150099:21"/>it not grieve and pitty and Chriſtian-ſoul, to ſee a towardly hopeful young man, well natured, well nurtured, ſtung with this Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice, bewailing his own caſe, crying out againſt the baſeneſs of the ſin, inveighing againſt-Company, melting under the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Friends; yea, proteſting againſt all enticements, vow, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſeriouſly indent with himſelf and his Friends for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhing of it: And yet if he meet with a Companion that holds but up his Finger, he follows him as a Fool to the Stocks, and as an Oxe to the Slaughter-houſe, having no Power to withſtand the Temptation; but in he goes with him to the Tipling-houſe, not conſidering that the Chambers are the Chambers of Death, and the Gueſts, the Gueſts of Death; and there he continues as one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, or conjured in a Spell; out of which he returns not, till he hath emptied his Purſe of Money, his Head of Reaſon, and his Heart of all his former ſeeming Grace. There his Eyes behold the ſtrange Woman, his Heart ſpeaketh perverſe things, becoming heartleſs, as one (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) in the heart of the Sea, reſolving to continue, and return to his Vomit, whatſoever it coſt him, to make it his daily work. <hi>I was ſick, and knew it not: I was ſtruck, and felt it not; when I awake, I will ſeek it ſtill.</hi> And why indeed (without a Miracle) ſhould any expect that one ſtung with this Viper ſhould ſhake it off, and ever recover of it again. Yea, ſo far are they from recovering themſelves, that they infect and become contagious and peſtilent to all they come near. The Dragon infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Venome, and aſſimulating his Elſes to himſelf in no ſin ſo much as in this, that it becomes as good as Meat and Drink to them, to ſpend their Wit and Money to compaſs Ale-houſe after Ale-houſe; yea, Town after Town, to transform others with their Circean-Cups, till they have made them Bruits and Swine, worſe then themſelves. The Adulterer and Uſurer deſire to enjoy their Sin alone; but the chiefeſt paſtime of a Drunkard is to heat and overcome others with Wine, that he may diſcover their nakedneſs and glory in their foyl and folly. In a word, exceſs of Wine, and the ſpirit of Grace are oppoſites; the former expels the latter out of the Heart, as ſmoke doth Bees out of the Hive: and makes the man a meer Slave and Prey to Satan and his ſnares; when, by this Poyſon, he hath put out his Eyes, and ſpoyled him of his ſtrength, he uſeth him as the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> did <hi>Sampſon,</hi> leads him in a ſtring whither he pleaſeth, like a very drudge, ſcorn, and make-ſport to himſelf and his Imps; makes him grind in the Mill of all kind of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150099:22"/>Sins and Vices. And that I take to be the reaſon why Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not ſpecially prohibited in any one of the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe it is not the ſingle breach of any one, but in effect the violation of all and every one: It is no one ſin, but all ſins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the In-let and Sluce to all other Sins. The Devil having moiſtened, and ſteeped him in his Liquor; ſhapes him like ſoft Clay, into what mould he pleaſeth: having ſhaken off his Rudder and Pilot, daſhes his Soul upon what Rocks, Sands, and Syrts he liſteth, and that with as much eaſe as a man may puſh down his Body with the leaſt thruſt of his Hand or Finger. He that in his right wits, and ſober mood, ſeems religious, modeſt, chaſt, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſecret; in his drunken fits, ſwears, blaſphemes, rages, ſtrikes, talks filthily, blabs all ſecrets, commits folly, knows no difference of Perſons or Sexes, becomes wholly at Satans command, as a dead Organ, to be enacted at his will and pleaſure. Oh that God would be pleaſed to open the Eyes of ſome Drunkard, to ſee what a Dunghill and Carrion his Soul becomes, and how loathſome effects follow upon thy ſpiritual death, and ſting of this Cockatrice, which is the Fountain of the other two following, temporal and eternal death!</p>
                  <p>And well may it be, that ſome ſuch as are altogether fearleſs and careleſs of the former death, will yet tremble, and be moved with that which I ſhall in the ſecond place tell them. Among all other ſins that are, none brings forth bodily death ſo frequently as this, none ſo ordinarily ſlays in the act of ſin as this. And what can be more horrible then to die in the act of a Sin, without the act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? I pronounce no definitive Sentence of Damnation upon any particular ſo dying, but what door of hope or comfort is left to their Friends behind of their Salvation? The Whore-Maſter he hopes to have a ſpace and time to repent in age, though ſometimes it pleaſeth God that death ſtrikes <hi>Cozbi</hi> and <hi>Zimri</hi> napping, as the Devil is ſaid to ſlay one of the Popes in the inſtant of his Adultery, and carry him quick to Hell. The Swearer and Blaſphemer hath commonly ſpace, though ſeldom Grace, to repent and amend: and ſome rare examples ſtories afford, of ſome taken with Oaths and Blaſphemies in their mouths. The Thief and Oppoſſor may live, and repent, and make reſtitution, as <hi>Zacheus:</hi> though I have ſeen one ſlain right-out with the Timber he ſtole half an hour before; and heard of one that having ſtoln a Sheep, and laying it down upon a ſtone to reſt him, was grin'd and hang'd with the ſtrugling
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150099:22"/>of it about his Neck. But theſe are extraordinary and rare caſes: God ſometimes practiſing Marſhal-Law, and doing preſent execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, left Fools ſhall ſay in their Hearts, There were no God, or Judgment: but conniving and deferring the moſt, that men might expect a Judge coming, and a ſolemn day of Judgment to come. But this ſin of Drunkenneſs is ſo odious to him, that he makes it ſelf Juſtice, Judge and Executioner, ſlaying the ungodly with miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, bringing them to untimely ſhameful ends, in brutiſh and beaſtial manner, often in their own vomit and ordure; ſending them ſottiſh, ſleeping, and ſenſeleſs to Hell, not leaving them either time, or reaſon, or grace to repent, and cry ſo much as <hi>Lord have mercy upon us.</hi> Were there (as in ſome Cities of <hi>Italy</hi>) an Office kept, or a Record and Regiſter by every Coroner in Shires and Counties, of ſuch diſmal events which God hath avenged this ſin withall, what a Volume would it have made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few years in this our Nation? How terrible a Threater of God's Judgments againſt Drunkards, ſuch as might make their Hearts to bleed and relent, if not their Ears to tingle, to hear of a taſte of ſome few ſuch noted and remarkable Examples of God's Juſtice, as have come within the compaſs of mine own notice, and certain knowledge; I think I ſhould offend to conceal them from the World, whom they may happily keep from being the like to others, themſelves.</p>
                  <p>An Ale-wife in <hi>Keſgrave,</hi> near to <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> who would needs force three Serving-men (that had been drinking in her Houſe, and were taking their leaves) to ſtay and drink the three Outs firſt, that is, Wit out of the Head, Money out of the Purſe, Ale out of the Pot; as ſhe was coming towards them with the Pot in her hand, was ſuddenly taken ſpeechleſs and ſick, her Tongue ſwoln in her mouth, never recovered ſpeech, the third day after died. This Sir <hi>Anthony Felton,</hi> the next Gentleman and Juſtice, with divers others Eve-witneſſes of her in Sickneſs related to me; whereupon I went to the Houſe with two or three Witneſſes, and inquired the truth of it.</p>
                  <p>Two Servants of a Brewer in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> drinking for a rumpe of a Turkie, ſtrugling in their drink for it, fell into a ſcading Caldron backwards: whereof the one died preſently, the other lingringly and painfully ſince my coming to <hi>Ipſwich.</hi>

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1619. A Miller in <hi>Bromeſwell,</hi> coming home drunk from <hi>Woodbridge</hi> (as he oft did) would needs go and ſwim in the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150099:23"/>his Wife and Servants knowing he could not ſwim, diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, once by intreaty got him out of the water, but in he would needs go again, and there was drowned: I was at the houſe to inquire of this, and found it to be true.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Barnewell,</hi> near to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> one at the Sign of the <hi>Plough,</hi> a luſty young man, with two of his Neighbours, and one Woman in their Company, agreed to drink a Barrel of ſtrong Beer; they drank up the Veſſel, three of them dyed within twenty four hours, the fourth hardly eſcaped after great ſickneſs. This I have under a Juſtice of Peace his Hand near dwelling, beſides the common ſame.</p>
                  <p>A Butcher in <hi>Haſtingfield</hi> hearing the Miniſter inveigh againſt Drunkenneſs, being at his Cups in the Ale-houſe, fell a jeſting and ſcoffing at the Miniſter and his Sermons: And as he was drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Drink, or ſomething in the Cup, quackled him, ſtuck ſo in his Throat, that he could get it neither up nor down, but ſtrangled him preſently.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Tillingham</hi> in <hi>Dengy</hi> Hundred in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> three young men meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to drink <hi>Strong waters,</hi> fell by degrees to half pints: One fell dead in the Room, and the other prevented by Company coming in, eſcaped not without much ſickneſs.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Bungey</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> three coming out of an Ale-houſe in a very dark Evening, ſwore, they thought it was not darker in Hell it ſelf: One of them fell off the Bridge into the water, and was drowned; the ſecond fell off his Horſe, the third ſleeping on the Ground by the Rivers-ſide, was frozen to death: This have I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heard, but have no certain ground for the truth of it it.</p>
                  <p>A Bayliff of <hi>Hadly,</hi> upon the Lords-day, being drunk at <hi>Melford,</hi> would needs get upon his Mare, to ride through the Street, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as the Report goes) That his Mare would carry him to the Devil; His Mare caſts him off, and broke his Neck inſtantly.

                  <p>A Glaſier in <hi>Chancery-Lane</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> noted formerly for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, fell to a common courſe of drinking, whereof being oft by his Wife and many Chriſtian friends admoniſhed, yet preſuming much of God's mercy to himſelf, continued therein, till, upon a time, having ſurcharged his Stomach with drink, he fell a vomiting, broke a Vein, lay two days in extreme pain of Body, and diſtreſs of Mind, till in the end recovering a little comfort, he died: Both theſe Examples related to me by a Gentleman of worth upon his own knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Four ſundry inſtances of Drunkards wallowing and tumbling in their drink, ſlain by Carts; I forbear to mention, becauſe ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are ſo common and ordinary.</p>

                  <p>A Knight notoriouſly given to Drunkenneſs, carrying ſometime Payls of drink into the open Field, to make people drunk withall; being upon a time drinking with Company, a woman comes in, delivering him a Ring with this Poſie, <hi>Drink and die;</hi> ſaying to him, <hi>This is for you;</hi> which he took and wore, and within a week after came to his end by drinking: Reported by ſundry, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a Miniſter dwelling within a mile of the place.</p>
                  <p>Two Examples have I known of Children that murthered their own Mothers in drink; and one notorious Drunkard that attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to kill his Father; of which being hindred, he fired his Barn, and was afterward executed: one of theſe formerly in Print.</p>
                  <p>At a Tavern in <hi>Breadſtreet</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> certain Gentlemen drinking Healths to their Lords, on whom they had dependance; one deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Wretch ſteps to the Tables end, lays hold on a pottle-pot full of Canary-ſack, ſwears a deep Oath; What will none here drink a health to my noble Lord and Maſter? and ſo ſetting the pottle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot to his mouth, drinks it off to the bottom; was not able to riſe up, or to ſpeak when he had done, but fell into a deep ſnoaring ſleep, and being removed, laid aſide, and covered by one of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150099:24"/>Servants of the Houſe, attending the time of the drinking, was within the ſpace of two hours irrecoverably dead: Witneſſed at the time of the Printing hereof by the ſame Servant that ſtood by him in the Act, and helpt to remove him.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Dengy</hi> Hundred, near <hi>Mauldon,</hi> about the beginning of his Majeſties Reign, there fell out an extraordinary Judgment upon five or ſix that plotted a ſolemn drinking at one of their Houſes, laid in Beer for the once, drunk healths in a ſtrange manner, and died thereof within a few weeks, ſome ſooner, and ſome later: witneſſed to me by one that was with one of them on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, to demand a Debt, and often ſpoken of by Maſter <hi>Heydon,</hi> late Preacher of <hi>Mauldon,</hi> in the hearing of many: The particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances were exceeding remarkable, but having not ſufficient proof for the particulars, I will not report them.</p>
                  <p>One of <hi>Ayleſham</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> a notorious Drunkard, drowned in a ſhallow Brook of water, with his Horſe by him.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt this was at the Preſſe, a man Eighty five years old, or thereabout, in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> overtaken with Wine, (though never in all his life before, as he himſelf ſaid a little before his fall, ſeeming to bewail his preſent condition, and others that knew him ſo ſay of him) yet going down a pair of ſtairs (againſt the perſwaſion of a woman ſitting by him in his Chamber) fell, and was ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly hurt, as he died ſoon after, not being able to ſpeak from the time of his fall to his death.</p>
                  <p>The Names of the Parties thus puniſhed, I forbear for the Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds ſake yet living.</p>
                  <p>If conſcionable Miniſters of all places of the Land would give notice of ſuch Judgments, as come within the compaſs of their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge, it might be a great means to ſuppreſs this Sin, which reigns every where to the ſcandal of our Nation, and high diſpleaſure of Almighty God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe may ſuffice for a taſt of God's Judgments: Eaſie were it to abound in ſundry particular Caſualties, and fearful Examples of this nature. Drunkard, that which hath befaln any one of theſe, may befal thee, if thou wilt dally with this <hi>Cockatrice;</hi> what ever leagues thou makeſt with Death, and diſpenſations thou giveſt thy ſelf from the like. Some of theſe were young, ſome were rich, ſome thought themſelves as wiſe thou; none of them ever looked for ſuch ignominious ends, more then thou, who ever thou art: if thou hateſt ſuch ends, God give thee Grace to decline ſuch courſes.</p>

                  <p>If thou beeft yet inſenſate with Wine, void of Wit and Fear, I know not what further to mind thee of, but of that third, and worſt ſting of all the reſt, which will ever be gnawing, and never dying: which if thou wilt not fear here; ſure thou art to feel there, when the Red Dragon hath gotten thee into his Den, and ſhalt fill thy Soul with the gall of Scorpions, where thou ſhalt yell and howl for a drop of water to cool thy Tongue withall, and ſhalt be denied ſo ſmall a refreſhing, and have no other liquor to allay thy thirſt, but that which the lake of Brimſtone ſhall afford thee. And that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, for that thou wouldeſt incur the wrath of the Lamb for ſo baſe and ſordid a ſin as Drunkenneſs, of which thou mayeſt think as venially and ſlightly as thou wilt.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.10.</note> But <hi>Paul</hi> that knew the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of it, gives thee fair warning, and bids thee not deceive thy ſelf, expreſly and by name mentioning it among the mortal ſins, excluding from the Kingdom of Heaven.<note place="margin">Eſay 5.14.</note> And the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> tells thee, That for it <hi>Hell</hi> hath enlarged it ſelf, opened its mouth wide, and without meaſure; and therefore ſhall the multitude and their pomp, and the jollyeſt among them deſcend into it. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, you that are ſtrong to pour in drink, that love to drink ſorrow and care away: And be you well aſſured, that there you ſhall drink enough for all, having for every drop of your former Bouſings, Vials, yea, whole Seas of God's Wrath, never to be exhauſt.</p>
                  <p>Now then I appeal from your ſelves in drink, to your ſelves in your ſober fits. Reaſon a little the caſe, and tell me calmly, would you for your own, or any mans pleaſure, to gratifie Friend or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, if you knew there had been a Toad in the wine-pot (as twice I have known happened to the death of Drinkers) or did you think that ſome <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> or <hi>Braſutus</hi> had tempered the Cup; or did you ſee but a Spider in the Glaſs, would you, or durſt you carouſe it off? And are you ſo ſimple to fear the Poyſon that can kill the Body, and not that which killeth the Soul and Body ever; yea, for ever and ever, and if it were poſſible for more then for ever, for evermore? Oh thou vain Fellow, what telleſt thou me of friendſhip, or good fellowſhip, wilt thou account him thy Friend, or good Fellow, that draws thee into his company, that he may poyſon thee? and never thinks he hath given thee right en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, or ſhewed thee kindneſs enough, till he hath killed thy Soul with his kindneſs, and with Beer made thy Body a Carkaſs fit for the Biere, a laughing and loathing-ſtock, not to Boys and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:150099:25"/>Girls alone, but to Men and Angels. Why rather ſayeſt thou not to ſuch, What have I to do with you, ye Sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> ye poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Generation of Vipers, that hunt for the precious life of a man? Oh but there are few good Wits, or great Spirits now a-days, but will Pot it a little for company. What hear I? Oh baſe and low-ſpirited times, if that were true! If we were faln into ſuch Lees of Time foretold of by <hi>Seneca,</hi> in which all were ſo drowned in the dregs of Vices, that it ſhould be vertue and honour to bear moſt drink. But thanks be to God, who hath reſerved many thouſands of men, and without all compariſon more witty and valorous then ſuch Pot-wits, and Spirits of the Buttery, who never bared their knees to drink health, nor ever needed to whet their Wits with Wine; or arm their courage with Pot-harneſs. And if it were ſo, yet if no ſuch Wits or Spirits ſhall ever enter into Heaven without Repentance, let my Spirit never come and enter into their Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; ever abhor to partake of their bruitiſh pleaſures, leſt I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their endleſs woes. If young <hi>Cyrus</hi> could refuſe to drink Wine, and tell <hi>Aftyages,</hi> He thought it to be Poyſon; for he ſaw it metamorphoſe men into Beaſts and Carcaſes: what would he have ſaid, if he had known that which we may know, that the wine of Drunkards is the wine of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 32.32.</note> their grapes, the grapes of gall; their cluſters, the cluſters of bitterneſs, the Juyce of Dragons, and the venome of Aſps. In which words, <hi>Moſes</hi> is a full Commentary upon <hi>Solomon,</hi> largely expreſſing that he ſpeaks here more briefly, <hi>It ſtings like the Serpent, and bites like the Cockatrice:</hi> To the which I may not unfitly add that of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and think I ought to write of ſuch with more paſſion and compaſſion, then he did of the Chriſtians in his time, which ſure were not ſuch Monſters as ours in the ſhapes of Chriſtians, <hi>Whoſe God is their Belly,</hi> (whom they ſerve with Drink-Offerings) <hi>whoſe glory is their ſhame, and whoſe end is damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What then, take we pleaſure in thundering out Hell againſt Drunkards? is there nothing but death and damnation to Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards? Nothing elſe to them, ſo continuing, ſo dying. But what is there no help nor hope, no Amulet, Antidote or Triacle, are there no Presidents found of Recovery? <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> I temember, tells of one, that having been a ſpectacle of Drunkenneſs, proved after his Converſion a pattern of ſobriety. And I my ſelf muſt confeſs, that one have I known yet living, who having drunk out his bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eyes, had his ſpiritual Eyes opened, proved diligent in hearing

Though the Pit be deep, miry and narrow, like that Dungeon into which <hi>Jeremy</hi> was put; yet if it pleaſe God to let down the cords of his Divine mercy, and cauſe the Party to lay hold thereon, it is poſſible they may eſcape the ſnares of death. There is even for the moſt debauched Drunkard that ever was, a ſoveraign Medicine, a rich Triacle, of force enough to cure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Diſeaſe, to obtain his Pardon, and to furniſh him with ſtrength to overcome this deadly Poyſon, fatal to the moſt: And though we may well ſay of it, as men out of experience do of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane Agues, that it is the diſgrace of all moral Phyſick, of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, Counſels and Admonitions; yet is there a Salve for this Sore; there came one from Heaven that trode the Winepreſs of his Fathers fierceneſs, drunk of a Cup tempered with the bitterneſs of God's Wrath, and the Devils Malice, that he might heal even ſuch as have drunk deepeſt of the ſweet Cup of Sin. And let all ſuch know, that in all the former diſcovery of this Poyſon, I have only aimed to cauſe them feel their ſting, and that they might with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Eyes behold the Braſen Serpent, and ſeriouſly repair to him for Mercy and Grace, who is perfectly able to eject even this kind, which ſo rarely and hardly is thrown out where once he gets poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This Seed of the Woman is able to bruiſe this Serpents head. Oh that they would liſten to the gracious offers of Chriſt! if once there be wrought in thy Soul a ſpiritual thirſt after mercy, as the thirſty Land hath after rain, a longing appetite after the water that comes out of the Rock, after the Blood that was ſhed for thee; then let him that is athirſt come, let him drink of the water of life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any money; of which if thou haſt took but one true and thorow draught, thou wilt never long after thy old puddle waters of Sin any more. Eaſie will it be for thee after thou haſt taſted of the Bread and Wine in thy Father's Houſe, ever to loath the Husks and Swill thou wert wont to follow after with greedineſs. The Lord Chriſt will bring thee into his Mothers Houſe, cauſe thee to drink of his ſpiced Wine, of the new Wine of the Pomegranate: Yea, he will bring thee into his Cellar, ſpread his Banner of Love over thee, ſtay thee with flagons, fill thee with his love, till thou beeſt ſick and overcome with the ſweetneſs of his Conſolations. In other Drink there is exceſs, but here can be no danger. The Devil hath his invitation, <hi>Come, let us drink;</hi> and Chriſt hath his <hi>inebriamini, Beye filled with the Spirit.</hi> Here is a Fountain ſet open, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation made. And if it were poſſible for the bruitiſheſt Drunkard
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:150099:26"/>in the World to know who it is that offereth, and what kind of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he offereth; he would ask, and God would give it frankly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money; he ſhould drink liberally, be ſatisfied, and out of his Belly ſhould ſally Springs of the water of Life, quenching and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing all his inordinate longings ofter ſtoln water of Sin and Death.</p>
                  <p>All this while, little hope have I to work upon many Drunkards, eſpecially by a Sermon read (of leſs life and force in God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and in its own nature, then preached,) my firſt drift is, to ſtir up the Spirits of Parents and Maſters, who in all Places com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of this evil, robbing them of good Servants, and dutiful Children, by all care and induſtry to prevent it in their Domeſtical Education, by carrying a watchful and reſtraining hand over them. Parents, if you love either Soul or Body, thrift or piety, look to keep them from this Infection. Lay all the bars of your authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cautions, threats and charges for the avoyding of this epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Peſtilence. If any of them be bitten of this Cockatrice, ſleep not, reſt not, till you have cured them of it; if you love their Health, Husbandry, Grace, their preſent or future lives. Dead are they while they live, if they live in this Sin. Mothers, lay about you as <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> with all entreaties, What my Son, my Son of my loves and delights, Wine is not for you, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>My next hope is, to arouſe and awaken the vigilancy of all faithful Paſtors and Teachers. I ſpeak not to ſuch Stars as this Dragon hath ſwept down from Heaven with its tayl: for of ſuch the Prophets, the Fathers of the Primitive, yea, all Ages complain of. I hate and abhor to mention this abomination: to alter the Proverb, <hi>As drunk as a Beggar,</hi> to a Gentleman is odious; but to a Man of God, to an Angel, how harſh and helliſh a ſound it is in a Chriſtians ears? I ſpeak therefore to ſober Watchmen, <hi>Watch, and be ſober,</hi> and labour to keep your Charges ſober and watchful, that they may be ſo found of him, that comes like a Thief in the night. Two means have you of great vertue for the quelling of this Serpent, zealous Preaching and Praying againſt it. It's an old received Antidote, that mans ſpittle, eſpecially faſting ſpittle, is mortal to Serpents. Saint <hi>Donatus</hi> is famous in ſtory for ſpitting upon a Dragon, that kept an High-way, and devoured many Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. This have I made good Obſervation of, That where God hath raiſed up zealous Preachers, in ſuch Towns this Serpent hath no neſtling, no ſtabling or denning. If this will not do, <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:150099:26"/>enforceth another, which I conceive God's and Man's Laws allow us upon the reaſon he gives: If <hi>Paul</hi> (ſaith he) forbid to eat with ſuch our common Bread, in our own private Houſes, how much more the Lord's Body in Church-Aſſemblies: If in our Times, this were ſtrictly obſerved, the Serpent would ſoon languiſh and vaniſh. In the time of an Epidemical Diſeaſe, ſuch as the Sweating or Neezing Sickneſs, a wiſe Phyſician would leave the ſtudy of all other Diſeaſes, to find out the Cure of the preſent raging Evil. If <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> were now alive, the bent of all his Homilies, or at leaſt one part of them, ſhould be ſpent to cry drown Drunkenneſs, as he did ſwearing in <hi>Antioch:</hi> never deſiſting to reprove it, till (if not the fear of God, yet) his imporunity made them weary of the fin.</p>
                  <p>Such <hi>Anakims</hi> and <hi>Zanzummims,</hi> as the ſpiritual Sword will not work upon, I turn them over to the Secular Arm, with a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the dangerous and contagious ſpreading of this poyſon in the Veins and Bowels of the Common-wealth. In the Church and Chriſt his name alſo, intreating them to carry a more vigilant Eye over the Dens and Burrows of this Cockatrice, ſuperfluous, blind, and Clandeſtiné Ale-houſes I mean, the very Peſt-houſes of the Nation? which I could wiſh had all for their fign, a picture of ſome hideous Serpent, or a pair of them, as the beſt Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick of the genius of the place, to warn Paſſengers to ſhun and avoid the danger of them. Who ſees and knows not, that ſome one needleſs Ale-houſe in a Countrey-Town, un does all the reſt of the Houſes in it, eating up the thrift and fruit of their Labours; the ill manner of ſundry places, being there to meet in ſome one Night of the Week, and ſpend what they they have gathered and ſpared all the days of the ſame before, to the prejudice of their poor Wives and Children at home; and upon the Lords day (after Evening Prayers) there to quench and drown all the good Leſſons they have heard that day at Church. If this go on, what ſhall become of us in time? If woe be to single Drunkards, is not a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional woe to be feared and expected of a Nation over-run with Drunkenneſs? Had we no other Sin reigning but this (which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reign alone) will not God juſtly ſpue us out of his mouth for this alone? We read of whole Countreys waſted, diſpeopled by Serpents. <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us of the <hi>Amyclae, Lycophron</hi> of <hi>Salamis; Herodotus</hi> of the <hi>Neuri,</hi> utterly depopulate and made unhabitable by them. Verily, if theſe Cockatrices multiply and get head amongſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:150099:27"/>us a while longer, as they have of late begun, where ſnall the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſober Servants to till their Lands, or Children to hold and enjoy them. They ſpeak of drayning Fens; but if this Evil be not ſtopped, we ſhall all ſhortly be drowned with it. I wiſh the Magiſtracy, Gentry, and Yeomanry, would take it to ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, how to deal with this Serpent, before he grow too ſtrong and fierce for them. It is paſt the egge already, and much at that paſs, of which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> complains of in his time, that he ſcarce knew what remedy to adviſe, but thought it required the meeting of a general Council. The beſt courſe I think of, is, if the great Perſons would firſt begin through Reformation in their own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, baniſh the ſpirits of their Butteries, abandon that fooliſh and vitious Cuſtom, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> calls it, of drinking Healths, and making that a Sacrifice to God for the health of others, which is rather a Sacrifice to the Devil, and a bane of their own. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member well <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperor's grave Anſwer, wherein there concurred excellent Wiſdom and Wit (ſeldom meeting in one ſaying) which he gave before the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> to ſuch as propoſed a Reformation of the Church to begin with the <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eans</hi> and <hi>Minorites.</hi> You will never do any good (ſaith he) unleſs you begin with the <hi>Majorites</hi> firſt. Sure, till it be out of faſhion and grace in Gentlemens Tables, Butteries and Cellars, hardly ſhall you perſwade the Countrey-man to lay it down, who, as in Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo in Vices, will ever be the Ape of the Gentry.</p>
                  <p>If this help not, I ſhall then conclude it to be ſuch an Evil as is only by Soveraign Power, and the King's Hand curable. And verily next under the word of God, which is Omnipotent, how potent and wonder-working is the Word of a King? when both meet as the Sun, and ſome good Star in a benigne Conjunction; what Enemy ſhall ſtand before the Sword of God and <hi>Gideon?</hi> what Vice ſo predominant which theſe ſubdue not? If the Lion roar, what Beaſt of the Foreſt ſhall not tremble and hide their head? have we not a noble experiment hereof yet freſh in our memory, and worthy never to die, in the timely and ſpeedy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of that impudent abomination of Womens manniſh habit, threatning the confuſion of Sexes, and ruine of Modeſty? The ſame Royal Hand, and care the Church and Common-wealth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores for the vanquiſhing of this Poyſon, no leſs pernicious, more ſpreading and prevailing. Take us theſe little Foxes was wont to be the ſuit of the Church, for they gnabble our Grapes, and hurt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:150099:27"/>our tender Branches: but now it is become more ſerious. Take us theſe Serpents, leſt they deſtroy our Vines, Vine-Dreſſers, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards and all: This hath ever been Royal Game. How famous in the ſtory of <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> is the Royal munificence of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> for proviſion of Nets, and maintenance of Huntſmen, for the taking and deſtroying of Serpents, noxious and noiſome to his Countrey. The like of <hi>Philip</hi> in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and of <hi>Attilius Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Gulus</hi> in <hi>Aulus Gellius.</hi> The Embleme mentioned at large by <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> engraven on <hi>Hercules</hi> Shield; what is it but a Symbol of the Divine honor due to Princes following their <hi>Herculean</hi> labours, in ſubduing the like <hi>Hidraes,</hi> too mighty for any inferior perſon to take in hand? It is their honor to tread upon <hi>Baſilisks,</hi> and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Dragons</hi> under their Feet, <hi>Solomon</hi> thinks it not unworthy his Pen to diſcourſe their danger.</p>
                  <p>A royal and eloquent Oration is happily and worthily preſerved in the large Volume of ancient Writings, with this Title, <hi>Oratio magnifici &amp; pacifici</hi> Edgari <hi>Regis habita ad Dunſtanum Archiep. Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copos, &amp;c.</hi> The main ſcope whereof is, to excite the Clergies care and devotion for the ſuppreſſing of this Vice, for the common good. Undertakers of difficult Plots promiſe themſelves ſpeed and effect, if once they intereſt the King, and make him Party. And what more generally beneficial can be deviſed or propoſed then this, with more Honour and leſs Charge to be effected, if it ſhall pleaſe his Majeſty but to make trial of the ſtrength of his Temporal and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Arms? For the effecting of it, if this help not, what have we elſe remaining, but wiſhes and prayers to caſt out this kind withall. God help us. To him I commend the ſucceſs of theſe Labors, and the vanquiſhing of this <hi>Cockatrice.</hi>

                  </argument>
                  <p>YOung men eſpecially muſt take great care how they ſuck in this ſmoke, for the cuſtome and too much uſe of it, brings their brains out of order, and makes them to be over-hot, ſo that they loſe their good temper, and are beyond the bounds of their health, and that ſacred anchor is loſt irrecoverably. For the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of young men requires a gentle moiſture, to ſtrengthen them, and to make their bodies grow to their juſt perfection. Eſpecially for thoſe that are cholerick, whoſe brains cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure exceſs of heat, for the native heat would be oppreſſed by the accidental heat. See <hi>Gallen</hi> his Comment, <hi>in lib. de vict. ſalub.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo this ſmoke doth vehemently move the Stomach to nauſeat, and to vomit, (as daily experience teacheth us) namely, by clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the inward parts, and ſo offending the peculiar juyces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Stomach, and the Meſentary; it deſtroys their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary operations. For in thruſting forth the matter from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach it cannot be, but alſo ſomething muſt be caſt out, wherein the force of nature reſides; and alſo, becauſe when nature is doing her office, ſhe ſends the nouriſhment into the habit of the body, as to the circumference, but all diſturbing and purgative things draw the juyces &amp; ſpirits to the center. Wherefore nature is wonderfully tired with theſe contrary motions, for ſhe can endure nothing leſs
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150099:35"/>then two contrary motions at the ſame time. Wherefore it is a moſt bitter enemy to the Stomachs of very many men, eſpecially if they uſe to take it preſently after Supper or Dinner. And in this reſpect it is miſchievous to the bodies of all ſound men, according to <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> his Rule. 2. <hi>Aphoriſ. 37. It is troubleſome to purge thoſe that are in good health.</hi> For frequent uſe of purging Medicaments will ſoon make a man old; for the ſorces are broken by the reſolving of the ſolid parts, by an <hi>Hypercatharſis</hi> of all nutrimental juyce.</p>
                  <p>By theſe things mentioned, it is eaſie to collect, that the ſmoke of Tobacco ſhortneth mens days. For being that our native heat is like to a flame, which continually feeds upon natural moiſture, as a Lamp lighted, drinks up the Oyl by its heat; it follows neceſſarily, that for want of food, life muſt needs fly away quickly, when the proper ſubject of life is diſſipated and conſumed: for with that moiſture, the imbred heat fails alſo, and death ſucceeds.</p>
                  <p>You underſtand therefore (that are Tobacconiſts) that the ſooty fumes of Tobacco, wherein you are wallowing (as it were) in the deepeſt mire, are of great force to ſhorten your days. <hi>Galen</hi> ſpeaking of opening Medicaments, aſſerts, that by the frequent uſe of them, the ſolid parts of the body are dried, and that the blood grows groſs and clotted, which being burned in the Reins, breed the ſtone. The ſame thing may be truly maintained concerning Tobacco, which many uſe too frequently, and more then any do uſe thoſe kind of opening Medicaments; for this is more hot and dry then they are, and therefore is more forcible to hurt ſound and well-tempered bodies. Take warning therefore you that love Tobacco, that you do not exceed in uſing too much of it, and enſlave your ſelves to this fuliginous ſmoke, by hunting after it, and making a god of it. The goods of the body, are beauty, ſtrength, and ſound health. The moſt grave Author <hi>Plutarch,</hi> commending the laſt as the beſt of all, affirmed moſt gravely and learnedly, That <hi>health is the moſt divine, and the moſt excellent property of the body, and a moſt precious thing.</hi> There is nothing in this World better; nothing more to be deſired, and nothing can be found to be more pleaſant. <hi>Without this</hi> (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> faith) <hi>there is no pleaſure or fruit of any other things.</hi> This is it, which in this life fills all perfection: Without this no man could ever be ſaid to be happy: This far exceeds the greateſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Treaſures, and Riches.</p>

                  </p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His intended Porch being ſo Impoliſhed, and ſo rude a Draught, I have judged it more fit to make a Back-Door, then a Fore: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther durſt I preſume to ſet it in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, for I count it but as an over-plus Sheet; however it may ſerve for waſt Paper to wrap up the learned <hi>Collections,</hi> or elſe to light a Pipe of Tobacco, and will make as good Smoke: It lies at thy mercy, to uſe or to abuſe as thou pleaſeſt.</p>
                  <p>For my part, I pretend to no great Learning, yet am a Lover of it, and a well-wiſher to it: Neither am I worthy to carry the Books after theſe learned Authors, out of whoſe Works I have
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:150099:37"/>made this <hi>Collection;</hi> therefore I make this humble Apologetical <hi>Poſtſcript.</hi> I know for my labour of reviving this noble <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaſt, &amp;c.</hi> I can expect no better, but to be counterblaſted by the black and foul mouths of many <hi>Tobacconiſts,</hi> and common Tobacco-Smokers; for endeavoring to pull down their great <hi>Diana,</hi> which they labour <hi>Demetrius</hi> like to cry up, becauſe of the much gain it brings them. If I meet with Reproaches and Scorns, it is no more then I expected from them, and I value it not: Neither is it any news or wonder; for we live in the laſt dayes, and as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> fore-told many hundred years ſince, in 2 <hi>Pet. 3.3. That in the laſt dayes ſhould come Scoffers, walking after their own luſts.</hi> To ſuch King <hi>Solomon</hi> propounds a, queſtion, which they can hardly be able to anſwer, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. <hi>How long ye ſimple Ones will ye love ſumplicity? and ye Scorners delight in ſcorning, and Fools hate Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi> There have been many ſuch in all Age, of the World, as it may eaſily be inſtanced.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude, I thought it not amiſs, or improper, to ſay ſomething briefly againſt exceſſive drinking of Healths, and Drunkenneſs, which calls to remembrance, amongſt other, of His Majeſties noble and gracious Acts, ſince his Reſtuaration, wherein he hath had merciful Reſpect to the Lives, Eſtates, Souls and Bodies of his good Subjects, and therein gone beyond his Predeceſſors. I ſhall but name to his perpetual Honour theſe three, <hi>viz.</hi> In the firſt place, His <hi>Act of Oblivion,</hi> paſſing by all that was done againſt Him or his Father, excepting only thoſe that were his Royal Fathers Judges. In the next place, He was pleaſed to publiſh a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all His loving Subjects, againſt that ſinful Cuſtom of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Health, His Majeſty wiſely conſidering how apt many would be to fall into that evil extreme, doth in that Proclamation, rebuke ſuch as can expreſs their Love him in no better way, then drinking His Health. In the next place, I cannot but take notice, and mention, to His Majeſties Renown, His late gracious Declaration, <hi>For Liberty and Indulgence to tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> that could not in all things conform to the Ceremonies and Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by Law eſtabliſhed: This by the way. But now to ſpeak a little more againſt drinking Healths, which is to our purpoſe in hand.</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:150099:37"/>
                  <p>There was many years ſince a Book Publiſhed, by Mr. <hi>William Prynne,</hi> againſt drinking of Healths, Entituled, <hi>Healths Sickneſs,</hi> but not now to be had, or ſeldom thought of; he ſhews the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Sin, and the dangerous conſequence of it both to the Souls and Bodies of Men. There is another large Treatiſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Mr. <hi>Robert Younge,</hi> Entituled, <hi>The Drunkard</hi>'s <hi>Character:</hi> Alſo a Sermon preached long ſince by Doctor <hi>Robert Harris,</hi> called <hi>The Drunkard</hi>'s <hi>Cup,</hi> out of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5. from the 11. to the 18. <hi>verſe.</hi> And a Sermon publiſhed many years ſince, Preached at <hi>Pauls Croſs,</hi> by Doctor <hi>Abraham Gibſon,</hi> Entituled, <hi>The Lands mourning for vain Swearing;</hi> out of theſe words, <hi>Becauſe of Oaths the Land mourns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now the Land may mourn, not only for vain Swearing, but for vain Drinking of Healths and Drunkenneſs.</p>
                  <p>After His Majeſties Reſtauration, there was, I remember, a great Feaſt, at which time there was a Health drank for His Majeſty, and when it came to the turn of an able learned grave Miniſter there preſent, he utterly diſliked and refuſed it: Anſwering, That he would pray for His Majeſties Heath. And if all that are Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſhers to his Majeſties Health, would obey his Proclamation againſt that Vice, in leaving off drinking, either of the Kings Health, or any others, &amp; leave of ſwearing and prophaning the Sabbath; and would conſtantly, earneſtly, and heartily pray for His Majeſties Health, according as the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.3. <hi>That Supplication and Prayer be made for Kings, and all that are in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi> I ſay, then we ſhould be in hopes to ſee better Times, and better Trading: The generality cry out of their want of Trading, and of the Sins of the Rulers; but our chief Work and Duty is to look more narrowly at home, and to find out the Plague of our own Hearts. Who ſmites upon his Thigh? who ſaith, what have I done? We are apt to forget the late dreadful Judgments of God; as that of the Deſtroying-Sword, the ſad deſtroying Peſtilence, when from the 20th of <hi>December,</hi> 1664, to the 15th of <hi>December,</hi> 1665. there died of all Diſeaſes 97396, and of the Plague 68596; and in one week, which I find to be the greateſt of all, was in <hi>September 19.</hi> 1665, there died of the Plague in <hi>London</hi> and Liberties 7165, of all Diſeaſes 8297 that one week. Can <hi>London</hi> ever forget thoſe ſad and lamentable conſuming Flames, that brake
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150099:38"/>forth the Second of <hi>September, 1666?</hi> The ruinous heaps on 373 Acres within, and 63 Acres without the old Line, the ghaſtly walls of 89 Pariſh-Churches, and ſtately Houſes and Halls, with the Royal <hi>Exchange,</hi> and as it was computed Thirteen thouſand and two hundred Houſes, with a vaſt deal of Goods, Houſhold-ſtuff, and rich Commodities; and, I think, <hi>Book-ſellers</hi> may eaſily remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the many Ware-houſes of good Books of all ſorts, then turned to Aſhes, at St. <hi>Faiths</hi> Church, and in other places about the City.</p>
                  <p>There was a Book publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Thomas Brooks,</hi> Dedicated to Sir <hi>William Turner</hi> Lord Mayor (who deſerved much Love and Honour, for being ſo great a Furtherer of building the City and Royal <hi>Exchange,</hi> that lay long in Ruins) Entituled, <hi>London</hi>'s <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> being a ſerious Diſcourſe of the late fiery Diſpenſation, that turned our Renowned City into a ruinous Heap. In the ſecond part, or application of that Book, <hi>Page 36.</hi> is ſhewed, That the burning of <hi>London</hi> was a National Judgment, and that God in ſmiting <hi>London,</hi> did ſmite <hi>England</hi> round: And what Sins bring deſolating Judgments upon Perſons and Places? Intemperance and Drunkenneſs is one Sin, and that we are to ſee the hand of the Lord in that dreadful Fire, and to take heed of thoſe Sins that bring the fiery Rod, with the ſeveral Leſſons and Duties we are to learn by it.</p>
                  <p>We may eaſily ſee that the Lord will not ſuffer us to be forgetful of his great Judgments, by the ſeveral freſh Remembrances he hath given us, by ſad Fires in divers places ſince, in and near the City. Not long after the dreadful Fire, there was a Merchants great houſe, almoſt finiſhed, in <hi>Mincing Lane,</hi> burned and quite defaced; after that, two great Fires brake forth in <hi>Southwark</hi> at ſeveral times and places: Another at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> which did much harm; Another at the corner of St. <hi>Bartholomew Lane,</hi> a <hi>Herald Painter</hi>'s Houſe, Mr. <hi>Francis Nowers</hi> himſelf, his Child and Nurſe was burned. Another in <hi>White-Chappel,</hi> and ſeveral perſons burned there. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſad Fire was in or near <hi>Thames ſtreet,</hi> which burned to the ground a great <hi>Sugar-Baker</hi>'s Houſe, with many thouſand pounds worth of Sugar, belonging to ſeveral Partners; it began <hi>September</hi> the Second, the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> 1671. And now laſt <hi>Whit-Sunday</hi> morning, at St. <hi>Katherines</hi> near <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> brake forth a very grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous lamentable Fire, which, as it is Reported, conſumed above one hundred Dwelling-houſes, and divers Ships, and ſome people were burned and killed by it. After that, another great Fire that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed about a dozen Houſes, and part of Sir <hi>Paul Pindar</hi>'s houſe,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150099:38"/>without <hi>Biſhopſgate,</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> 1672. A few dayys after brake forth another Fire, which burned ſeveral Houſes in <hi>Crutched Friers.</hi> One at <hi>Camomile-ſtreet:</hi> At the <hi>Swan</hi> at <hi>Holborn-Bridge:</hi> A Brick houſe in <hi>Grub-ſtreet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may do well to take that Counſel of our Saviour to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent man that he had cured, and had been at the Pool of <hi>Both<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida,</hi> who had an Infirmity thirty eight years, <hi>John</hi> 5.14. Chriſt bid him go and ſin no more, leaſt a worſe thing befal him; it was old Mr. <hi>Wheatlyes</hi> Text of <hi>Banbury,</hi> after it was burned: Read the 26. of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> how greatly the Lord threatned the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if they were Diſobedient to him; He threatens great Judgments, and to make their Cities waſt, and the Land deſolate; and in the <hi>verſes</hi> 18, 21, 24, 28. it is four times threatned, That he will puniſh them ſeven times more for their Iniquities. God hath ſhot Three Arrows againſt us, and how eaſily can he ſhoot a Fourth ſore Arrow, that of the Famine, unleſs we turn from our Sins by true Repentance. It is to be feared, that after all that hath or can be ſaid to reclaim men from their evil Courſes, and exceſſes in Drinking, that they will be ſwayed by Cuſtome, which is a ſecond Nature; and it will be found as difficult for them to be temperate in Smoking, and Drinking, and Feaſting, as it is for the <hi>Blackmore</hi> to change his Skin, or the <hi>Leopard</hi> his Spots. So that they will rather ſay, as he that being adviſed by his Phyſician to leave of his evil Courſes, or elſe he would looſe his Sight, anſwered, <hi>Tum valeat lumen amicum,</hi> Then farewel ſweet Light. To ſuch it may be ſaid, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rejoyce O young man in thy Youth, walk in the ſight of thine Eyes, and let thy Heart chear thee; but remember that for all theſe things God will bring thee to Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We all know, That Sin is the fore-runner of all Plagues and Calamities, that ever came upon any People or Nation under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; it is the Plague of Plagues: What provoked God to drown the old World, but Sin? What cauſed God to rain down Fire and Brimſtone on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> but their Sins of Pride, Idleneſs, and fulneſs of Bread? And whilſt <hi>Abraham</hi> interceded for <hi>Sodom,</hi> had there been but Ten righteous perſons found amongſt them, God would have ſpared them for their ſakes. Thus I have ſpoken againſt Sin in general, as that which draws down Judgments upon our Heads: I will only lay a few Scriptures before you, touching the Lord's anger againſt Sin, which he cannot indure to behold without great indignation: For it is only Sin that makes a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:150099:39"/>between God and our Souls; and I deſire the Reader to turn to them at his leiſure, and to make the beſt uſe and application of them, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 22.12, 13, 14. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 24.7, 8, 9. <hi>Geneſis</hi> 12.10. <hi>Chap</hi> 26.1.42.5.43.1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.30.36.50.56. 57. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.26.29.</p>
                  <p>That Sea-man that being ingaged in a Ship, and ſees it in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſink or to be caſt away; is but an ill and unworthy Sea-man that will not put to his helping hand to ſave her. And are not all Engliſh-men engaged in the Ship of the Kingdom, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>England?</hi> and is it not in a Storm, compaſſed with Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without, and within moleſted and aſſaulted with the moſt dangerous Enemies of all; over-laden with our grand Enemies, Sins of all ſorts? Is it not the part of an honeſt true Engliſh-man to help to ſave this Ship, by lightening its burden, and caſting theſe bad Commodities over-board? I mean its Sins, that by ſo doing, we may engage God, the Lord of Hoſts on our ſide, and then, <hi>ſi Deus nobiſcum cuis contranos:</hi> Did but <hi>England</hi>'s Sins weigh lighter then her Enemies Sins, then we were more likely to be Victorious and Conquerors over all our Forreign Enemies.</p>
                  <p>Doth not <hi>England</hi> match any of her Enemies in Sins and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, namely Drunkenneſs? Doth it come behind the <hi>Dutch, Dane,</hi> or <hi>Swede,</hi> which are counted the higheſt Drinkers in the World, of the higheſt form, and ſo for ſwearing moſt horrible Oaths, and ſcoffing at Religion and Piety.</p>
                  <p>Within ten days ſince I began this <hi>Collection</hi> or <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> I was an Eye and Ear-witneſs, That a ſwaggering Blade rapt out this Oath, <hi>God damn me,</hi> about a trifle in a ſcoffing Frolick, ſaying, <hi>He had got a Presbyterian Band on he thought.</hi> Another man on <hi>Whitſon-Eve</hi> I ſaw ſo ſadly drunk, he could neither go nor ſtand, but ſate down on a Door-ſtone, I asked him, <hi>Where he had been?</hi> He would give no other Anſwer but this, <hi>That he was troubled with the Megromes.</hi> So I and others about him left him, and know not what became of him: Theſe two were in the heart of the City, near the <hi>Exchange.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After I had ſeen King <hi>James</hi> his <hi>Counterblaſt againſt Tobacco,</hi> and taken a liking to it: I did at the firſt intend only to get that printed alone, but afterwards meeting with theſe pertinent, ſutable, and profitable Directions, for the preſervation of long, Life, both againſt <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and intemperate drinking; Publiſhed in the Works of that learned Phyſician Doctor <hi>Maynwaring,</hi> now living: I thought it not amiſs to joyn them together, and likewiſe to add
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150099:39"/>a good old Sermon at the latter end, Preached, in or near the time of King <hi>James,</hi> by a famous Learned Divine, Mr. <hi>Samuel Ward</hi> then Preacher of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> printed 1627. It is but brief, and the beſt I know of in print againſt the Sin of Drunkenneſs and Health-drinking, wherein are diſcovered divers ſad Examples of many that have been notorious Drinkers or Drunkards, called <hi>Woe to Drunkards,</hi> that have kill'd themſelves by drinking immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place I ſhall but commend to the Reader a few good uſeful Books, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr <hi>Thomas Brook</hi>'s <hi>Londons Lamentations,</hi> alſo his Book called <hi>Precious Remedies againſt Satan</hi>'s <hi>Devices,</hi> and his <hi>Twenty two Sermons on</hi> Epheſ. 3.8. <hi>Of the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt,</hi> His <hi>Cabinet of Jewels,</hi> His <hi>Cloſet Prayer,</hi> and a profitable and very delightſome Book of good Counſel for all young Perſons, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>His Apples of Gold for young Men and Women &amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Watſon</hi>'s new Treatiſe, Entituled, <hi>The miſchief of Sin, it brings a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon low,</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.43.

Theſe Books do ſet forth Sin in its own proper colours; it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in Scripture <hi>to filthy Rags,</hi> and to <hi>a menſtruous Cloth;</hi> and I think it cannot be called by ſo bad a name as it is.
