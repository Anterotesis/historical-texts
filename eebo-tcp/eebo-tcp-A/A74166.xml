            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ure you were in one of your Drunken Fits, the Pot flew high when you writ your Sottiſh and Clowniſh Paper to me, that relliſhes of nothing but a Tippl'd Fool, and a Bragging Coward; and the latter in ſo poor and mean a manner, that I am aſhamed it ſhould come from one that bears the Name, though not the Nature of a Gentleman: Your owne fearful, guilty Soul knows that my late Letter, as well as a former to your ſelf, together with all Paſſages between us, were almoſt as ſoon communicated to your Father and Mother, as to yourſelf, and after to ſome of your neareſt Relations; Nay, many of the Servants of both your Families were privy thereunto, and knew as much as your ſelf, and ſo did divers others in ſeveral places: All this I can prove by perſons well reputed; and for the Letters, I dare ſwear, they were not kept very ſecret, for I have heard of divers paſſages in them, which I am ſure came to no body by <hi>Revelation,</hi> and yet you have the frontleſs impudence to lay this aſperſion upon me; I have fought before now, and I hope never came off with loſs of honour; and muſt I now be afraid of ſuch a Shadow, ſuch a Half-man as you are? and 'tis well if you be ſo much: You remember I challenged you twice in one Week, and you poorly and baſely refuſed both, pretending you would give me full ſatisfaction; you came indeed, but full ſore againſt your will (and contrary to the Huffs you gave out in the Countrey in your Drink) and promiſed as much as I could expect, but afterwards perform'd nothing: And now be your owne Judge, whether it is poſſible for any one to believe, that I that knew you had poorly refuſed twice, ſhould avoyd the Meeting you now: If you needs muſt lie, follow my advice, and hereafter lie Colourably, for theſe are ſuch groſs ones, that they are palpable, like the <hi>AEgyptian</hi> Darkneſs. I muſt needs ſay, it much troubles and afflicts me, to be compell'd by your barbarous and unmanly provocations, to uſe ſuch ſpeeches, contrary to my nature and diſpoſition; but you began, and I do no more than retaliate, and the the law of Retaliation is juſt and equal: But (I believe) you'l bear it quietly, were it more; for you abound in Paſſive fortitude, though you have not in you one jot of the Active. If this any white galls, you know the way to <hi>London</hi> (no other place for the preſent being poſſible to be choſen without moſt apparent and evident ſuſpition) There will be the moſt privacy, and who plays the Pultroon, will be moſt eaſily diſcover'd. But what do I talk of <hi>London</hi> to you, who will as ſoon come on your Head as on Horſeback or in Coach, to meet me with a Sword in your hand: But, was it a Bottle, none would be more forward; and with ſuch a weapon you may venture upon a <hi>Dutch-man:</hi> But if there be a ſpark of Fire in ſo dull a Flint, I will ſtrike it. From the beginning to the end of your Letter you falſly lie, and if you dare appear, I will cram it down your Throat with my Sword; if there need any more, I ſay and reſay, you are a baſe Coward. If you muſt have another Puſh, I will divulge it to the world in print what a Coward you are, and make publick all the paſſages between us; Your fooliſh bragging Letter ſhall not be omitted, which will ſpeak you more than I have done, and this ſhall follow after it; then 'twill to all appear what a Captain <hi>Puff</hi> you are, fit for nothing but a Cudgel. For ſhame leave the Petticoat off, and put on Breeches; uſe my Argument againſt my ſelf; if I was ſo mean to diſcover this, you may infalliblie conclude I will do ſo again; but you'l uſe none of this way of Argumentation, <hi>you</hi> too well know <hi>my</hi> innocence therein; if <hi>I</hi> may ſee a Miracle, that is, <hi>you</hi> with a Sword in <hi>your</hi> hand, <hi>I</hi> will before our <hi>Seconds,</hi> and <hi>your ſelf,</hi> beſeech God that what I wiſh'd in <hi>my Letter</hi> to <hi>your Second,</hi> may fall upon me, [viz.] <hi>That if in the leaſt, directly or indirectly, I be guilty of this diſcovery, or any Circumſtance that can but tend thereunto:</hi> Nay, I will go farther, <hi>If I did not my utmoſt to avoyd all ſuſpicion, may I fall by your Sword, to my eternal ſhame and ruine.</hi> This, upon my Honor, I will declare upon our Meeting, in manner as <hi>I</hi> have ſaid, which I am ſure you dare not reſpectively do for your ſelf; Your guiltie trembling Conſcience will hold <hi>you</hi> off when <hi>you</hi> are ſo neer danger.</p>
