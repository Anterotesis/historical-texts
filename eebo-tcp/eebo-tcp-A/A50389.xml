            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>HAving perused this ensuing Treatise of the</hi> Gout, <hi>(which fell but lately into my hands) I found it not only so</hi> Ingenious, <hi>but so</hi> Solid <hi>and</hi> Useful a Work, <hi>that I thought it much pitty, it should remain lock'd up from the knowledge of those worthy persons of our own Nation, which languish under the affliction of this tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:33853:3"/>
Disease; <hi>and therefore I have taken the pains to present you with it in our Native Language: I was the more encouraged to do this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause both the</hi> Principles <hi>and</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod <hi>which this worthy Author makes use of, are not only very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, but consonant for the most part with those of my</hi> own, <hi>which I had assumed many years before I had a sight of this Book; the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of which</hi> Method <hi>and</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>(though not in all particulars the same with my own, especially the Medicines; yet having the same tendency) I can recommend by way of Analogy from my own practice, which hath been employ'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Persons of divers of eminent Worth, Learning, and Dignity in this Kingdom; not only by way of giving ease in, and shortning the</hi> Paroxysm, <hi>or</hi> Fits <hi>of the</hi> Gout, <hi>but by returning the Parts to their</hi> Tone, Strength, <hi>and</hi> Vigour, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:33853:3"/>
               <hi>the</hi> Fits <hi>are past, and also by preventing the otherwise too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent returns and assaults of this Disease: All which I do assert (whatever the opinion of some others may be to the contrary) not only may probably be done, but that I have actually done it to</hi> Regular <hi>and</hi> Judicious Persons, <hi>with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and laudable success. And all this not (as some erroniously suppose) by hindering Nature from discharging the</hi> Gouty humor <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the</hi> joynts, <hi>which indeed was a dangerous way, but by actually and really removing the</hi> Diseasie-Product, <hi>and carrying on the</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending matter <hi>by rationally-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, safe, and easie Medicines; by this means hindering the</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease <hi>from recruiting it self, &amp; get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting head; &amp; by this</hi> Method, <hi>I have preserved some, divers years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in a</hi> Vigorous <hi>and healthy state of</hi> Body. <hi>Wherefore (I say)</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:33853:4"/>
               <hi>finding this worthy Author so nearly concurring with my own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I thought it would be an Obliging Service to the</hi> Sick, <hi>if I exposed this</hi> Tract <hi>to the publick view of the</hi> English <hi>Reader; and that for these Reasons:</hi> First, <hi>To comfort such as groan under this Distemper, and to remove the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice which some men have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to implant in them; as if there were no remedy in this Disease but</hi> Patience, <hi>and nothing to be done, but to Groan.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>To satisfie the desires of many, which I know thirst after the Works of this dead</hi> Hero <hi>in</hi> Physick, <hi>Sir</hi> Theodor Mayerne, <hi>(whose</hi> Fame <hi>nevertheless can never die,) and yet none of them hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to come to light, though, as I have been credibly informed, before his death he had fitted a large</hi> Volum <hi>for the</hi> Press, <hi>with which we have not been blessed, by reason of the</hi>

            <head>A TREATISE OF THE GOUT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst those Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Diseases which molest Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main bodies, and portend their early dissolution, and Exit, before the fatal and determinate time, the <hi>Gout</hi> above all others deserves our Compassion; for this cause, that it is reckoned by many men (though very erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33853:6"/>
amongst those Diseases that are absolutely incurable: So that the Sick person is left with a <hi>Prognostick:</hi> And the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of <hi>Physitians</hi> in this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, is only imployed about the mitigation of pain, by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Topical</hi> or outward Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to the grieved part; they striving rather to please their Patients desires, than to perform their own office and duty: for most <hi>Physitians</hi> are more desirous by compliance to gain themselves Credit, than to procure the Health of the Patients, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their care, they being only intent upon pacifying their cryes; the possibility of restoring their Patients to their perfect Health, doth not so much as once come in their thoughts.</p>
            <p>And if this Disease be narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examind, without doubt it will hardly seem to deserve a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33853:6"/>
slighter censure; for its Cause proceeds with so slow and <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toise-</hi>like a pace, that it gains ground, and is augmented by degrees, not produceing its full effect, untill it hath first wrought the parts into a depraved <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or distemperature by means of the included humors, and then by often errors in Diet, and an intemperate Life, it getteth to so vast a height, that the Sick seems to be placed (as it were) upon the brink of a Precipice, where beholding the magnitude of the accumilated matter, and the length of the way which must of necessity be gone back before there can be a return to former health; they are frighted, and cast away all hope, and take up an aversion and loathing to all sorts of Remedies. Add to this, that the <hi>Gout</hi> seeks out Rich and Great mens Houses, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33853:7"/>
there it fixeth its chief Fortress, (or Garison) to whose commands (the Fates so pleasing) all such yield obedience, in so much that you cannot extort an assent from such men, to those precepts which are requisite for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their healths.</p>
            <p>But it is not at all true, that God hath Created Nature a Step-mother, and destitute of help, or that there is any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease (whose <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Essence, doth not consist in a mere priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) which doth not admit of a Cure: But if the singular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Disease, or its cause doth withstand a Cure, we may indeavour to give help, even to such (though they refuse to be govern'd by the Precepts of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians,) either by metigating the fierceness of their pain, or by preventing the frequent returns of their <hi>Paroxsysm's,</hi> or <unclear>Fits</unclear>; and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33853:7"/>
at last, by taking care lest the parts by omitting their usual Offices, and by long Idleness, grow torped, and become unfit for the imployments they are designed for: And that these scopes or intentions may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Art, in any subject whatsoever, is most certain; if the Patient be yet capable of receiving the benefit of those Medicines which are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and is not already come to the ut-most and last extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>That we may with the more clearness, manifest the nature and quality of the <hi>Gout,</hi> we are not to regard the division of the humors into four parts; for though they appear distinct when they are voided from a humain body, we are to look deeper into the thing, and to consider that all the Excrements of the body do
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33853:8"/>
admit into themselves, &amp; contain in their Composition, <hi>Salt.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially the Liquid humors, as Urine, and Sweat, whose thinner parts being discuss'd into Vapors, there will remain a <hi>saline Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> From hence we may infer that <hi>Salt;</hi> as long as it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth within the bounds and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions allotted it by Nature, is inoffencive; but when it exceeds that, and abounds, whether it be Liquid, and mixed with its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvent, or separated from it, and be <hi>coagulate,</hi> or become solid, it cannot be accumulated together in the body without hurt. For, as in the <hi>Macrocosme,</hi> or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter World, there are divers sorts of Salts, of which some are sweet as <hi>Sugars;</hi> others sower as <hi>Vitriolet Salts;</hi> some are bitter as the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Soot;</hi> others truly Salt, as <hi>Sea Salt,</hi> and <hi>Salt-Gemme;</hi> others Volatile, as <hi>Sal-Armoniack;</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:33853:8"/>
others insipid, of which sort are those which are contained in <hi>Pibbles, Gravel,</hi> and other stones: So likewise in the <hi>Microcosme,</hi> or body of Man, there are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated <hi>Tartarous Salts,</hi> which according to their native propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, and disposition, produce distempers, which from thence are called <hi>Tartarous Diseases,</hi> which in respect of their mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial cause, and peculiar dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are divided into two sorts; the one taking its origin from the <hi>solution,</hi> the other from the <hi>coagulation</hi> or concretion of these <hi>Tartarous Salts;</hi> which disposition is nourished, and furthered much by the distemperature of the parts, upon which the native heat acts according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of their proper <hi>
                  <unclear>Essence</unclear>,</hi> and <hi>essential mixtion;</hi> and so either dissolves these <hi>Salts,</hi> as it doth in the Livers of those which are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33853:9"/>
               <hi>Hydropical;</hi> or it doth cause a Concretion, as it happens in the <hi>Kidnies,</hi> and <hi>Bladder,</hi> of those which are Obnoxious to the Stone.</p>
            <p>The four first Elements, (or the four humors) being dismissed, let us pass over to the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <hi>Succedana</hi>'s, or those principles constituted in their place, which by the <hi>Spagirists</hi> or Chymists, (who resolve subluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bodys into their principles by the help of their fires,) are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted to be three: They calling whatsoever is watery, and vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, <hi>Mercury;</hi> and styling all that is fat and devourable by fire, <hi>Sulphur;</hi> and giving the name of <hi>Salt</hi> to all the fix'd and dry parts, separated from the impure and dead Earth.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Salt</hi> is of the nature of <hi>Balsom,</hi> which the body being deprived of, it certainly becomes

putred. Wherefore, since there is a constant dissolution, and dissipation of this triple sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, these principles require to be restor'd and repair'd; <hi>for we are nourished by the same things of which we are constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> But the Elementary substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which we receive to sustain our selves, are various, both in their composition and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and in every sort of ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, one of the aforesaid prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples doth always abound above the rest, wherefore it is a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry consequence then, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever useth such Meat, in which <hi>Salt</hi> doth radically abound, he shall experience in himself the increase of the same <hi>Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here we may admire Divine Providence that hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the <hi>serous humor</hi> (an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement of the first Concoction) to be Liquid; in which, when
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33853:10"/>
the Aliment is dissolv'd into the form of <hi>Chyle,</hi> there is made a separation of the (aforesaid) three substances, and the <hi>Salt</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all dissolved by that <hi>Icho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Liquor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> which being mixed with the <hi>blood,</hi> it becomes a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicule to it; and thus being trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with it to the smallest parts of the body, it serves them instead of a <hi>Balsom;</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpluss of it, constituting the Lixiviate body of the Urine, floweth out at the place destina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for its Excression; and if there be any unuseful and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous parts of it left behind, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the third Concoction is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, they are sent off by Sweat; or else seeking an Exit by insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible transpiration at the Pores, it degenerates into thick <hi>scurfe</hi> and foulness, sticking to the skin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:33853:10"/>
And this happens in those bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which are well constituted, whose faculties are vigorous, and their functions perform'd without defect; but if by default of the parts, or through ill Diet, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be oppress'd, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions and Expulsions of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements be slowly perform'd, then of necessity this Salt will accumulate and gather it self to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon the parts, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in quantity, whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it preserved them like a Balsom from Putrefaction: Now on the contrary, wheresoever it is convey'd, and remains, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be dissolved, and of a liquid form, like <hi>Brine)</hi> yet it inflames the parts, and villicates and gnaws them, exciting pain.</p>
            <p>Moreover, since the natural proportion betwixt the <hi>dissolvant,</hi> and the thing to be <hi>dissolved</hi> is such, that the most subtle Liquor,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33853:11"/>
will hardly receive into it self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the fourth part (of any thing) in proportion to its self; if the <hi>Salt</hi> exceed in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said watery <hi>Latex,</hi> or Liquor, then of necessity it will be stopt in its passages and Vessels, in which it will grow together, and be coagulated into different sort of Stones, according to the nature of the predominant <hi>Salt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here we may consider the various Concretions which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the bowels of the Earth; as also those which are made by Art: For <hi>Allom,</hi> when it coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, hath one form, <hi>Salt-Peter</hi> another, <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> another, and <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> another, different from all these: Nay, he that shall remove his contemplations from the Coagulations of <hi>Salts,</hi> to those which happen to <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Marcasits,</hi> (or Minerals), he shall find several of them so ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borately

form'd according to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometrical Rules, that he will be forced to acknowledge that <hi>Art</hi> is out-done by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Upon this subject, read what the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator of this Treatise hath writ in his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say of Putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; Printed <hi>Anno,</hi> 1672.</note>
            </p>
            <p>From what hath been said, we may infer, that Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Diseases are the off-spring of a certain Native, (or <hi>Seedy)</hi> disposition of generating their like; or rather (as I may say) a powerful separating and assimulating of that Salt which we call <hi>Tartar</hi> from the Aliments, (which is contained in them) or if you will, the viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and evil disposition of the aforesaid Aliments (indiscreetly taken into the body) overcome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Tone</hi> of the <hi>Faculties,</hi> and depraving the <hi>Functions,</hi> which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:33853:12"/>
at length, through the frequent concourse of these <hi>Procatartick,</hi> or procuring causes, must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be oppressed and over-whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Wherefore these sort of Diseases, are either Hereditary, and transmitted by Parents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the same Infirmities, to their Children, or accidenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ingendred in us by our own default.</p>
            <p>According to the Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Axiome, received opinion, or <hi>Dogma,</hi> the definition of the <hi>Gout</hi> is thus stated. That it is a painful solution of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuety of the <hi>Ligaments</hi> and <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts</hi> (which are very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) incompassing all the <hi>joynts,</hi> introduced upon them by the sharpe and biteing quality of a certain <hi>Tartarous</hi> matter, or <hi>Salt,</hi> separated from the mass of Blood, and transmitted to those parts (as being most weak and aptest to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:33853:12"/>
receive it,) together with its proper Vehicule the serous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; that being unuseful to nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and unfit to coagulate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to flesh.</p>
            <p>This definition of the <hi>Gout</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth but one cause of it, and shews the devision of it into a hot and cold <hi>Gout,</hi> to be <hi>futile</hi> or vain. Yet doth not this hinder, but that the <hi>Arthretick</hi> (or <hi>Gout)</hi> pains may be mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the application of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of a contrary nature: But then it is to be considered, that the Spirits, together with that humor which predominates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the rest, and is generated by the <hi>Temperament</hi> of the body, doth flow to the part grieved with pain, (in aid thereof.) And so in a <hi>Phlegmatick temperament</hi> the pained parts are whitish, and swell without inflamation; and in the <hi>Sanguine</hi> and <hi>Cholerick,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:33853:13"/>
their pains are cruel and great, and require sudden relief: But in whatsoever sort of <hi>Gout</hi> it be, the pains do never cease (I spake not of the use of <hi>Narcotticks,</hi> or stupifying Medicines here) until the <hi>Salt</hi> the Parent and cause of the pain be diluted by some gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Liquor (a good Diet being instituted, as the forbearing of Wine, and using to drink Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impregnated with the virtue of such things as are usually given in Fits of the <hi>Gout)</hi> or else a diversion of those humors be made, which impetuously rush upon the parts; and then that <hi>Salt,</hi> if it be <hi>Volatile,</hi> will be discussed into the habit of the body, or outward parts; or at length it will be temper'd and mitigated by internal Medicines, such as are <hi>Sugar</hi> of <hi>Lead,</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:33853:13"/>
I omit the opinion of those, who derive the Original of the <hi>Gout</hi> from the <hi>Liver,</hi> or <hi>Brain:</hi> For in my judgment, the first fountain of its material cause, is in the <hi>Stomack;</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is from thence deriv'd, and by all the <hi>Genus venosum,</hi> (or Veines) poured out upon, (and render'd habitual to,) those parts afflicted. (Either by hereditary right, or ill Diet:) which parts attract the acrimony of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, which insinuates it self into them, as being very weak, and therefore prone to receive, and suffer, and less apt to resist its power.</p>
            <p>For every <hi>pain</hi> of the <hi>Ioynts,</hi> is not to be called the <hi>Gout,</hi> but that only which proceeds from the aforesaid <hi>Tartarous matter,</hi> and brings forth this effect; leaving upon the parts a great debility after the pain is gone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:33853:14"/>
There is a sort of wandring <hi>Gout,</hi> called by the <hi>English, Nin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> it is Erratick, and shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth place, sparing no joynt, but invading all of them successively, and often-times possessing several of them at once; whose set-time, (the inflamation being finished) is determined by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to be forty days. This ariseth from a general <hi>Cataclysme,</hi> or flood of humors, which happeneth in <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorick,</hi> or full bodys, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with such serous watery hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors; which falling into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veties of the Joynts, prove af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive to the adjacent parts, more upon the account of their filling, and stretching them, than from their being accrimonius. This depraved <hi>Diathesis</hi> falls not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this disquisition here; since it is easily taken away, either by frequent <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> (or bleeding) or else by large Evacuations with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33853:14"/>
               <hi>Hydragogol,</hi> or water-purging Medicines; which means make a revultion and subduction of the peccant and offencive humors.</p>
            <p>But dismissing this Distemper, let us remove our discourse to that trucculent and rebellious Disease, particularly call'd <hi>Poda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra,</hi> which <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> according to certain conditions, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth either curable or incurable, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Praedict.</hi> (says he) <hi>De Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagra haec dico, quicunque aut se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes sunt, aut circa articulos calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los tophaceos Concretos habent; aut aerumnose viunt, aut siccam habent Alvum, hi Omnes sani hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana arte fieri non possunt, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm ego novi: Sanant quidem hos Optime Dysenteriae si successerint, sed etiam aliae eliquationes valde prosunt, quae ad internos locos re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punt: Qui vero juvenis est, &amp; circa articulos nondum tophaceos callos habet, concretos, &amp; accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:33853:15"/>
               <hi>vivit, &amp; laboris amans esti &amp; Alvum bonam habet, ad obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum pro studiorum ratione, hic sani Medicum intelligentiam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentem nactus, sanus fieri poterit.</hi> 
               <q>(That is), concerning the <hi>Gout,</hi> I say, That those which are old, and have soft stones gathered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Joynts, or live De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchly, or are bound in their Bellies, all these cannot be cured by humain Art, as far as I know. But such are best cured by a <hi>Bloody Flux;</hi> also other sorts of Purgations, which carry the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors inwards, are very advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to them: But he that is young, and hath not yet any Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Concretions about his joynts, and liveth a very regular life, and is a lover of labour, and hath a loose Belly, and ready to obey directions; these certainly may be cured by a careful and understanding <hi>Physitian.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:33853:15"/>
I trusting to the Oracle of this great Man, do believe the <hi>Gout</hi> may be prevented and hindred, even in those which have it He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditarily, though not in every individual person: But in such, in whom it is in its first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and before it hath left, and deposited any stony sediment in the Caveties of the Joynts; and by its native efficacy, hath har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened the glutinous liquor of those parts into a stone. These I say, I believe are capable of a cure: This seems to be rashly spoken, yet it is most true; if Gouty persons would but observe the first Aphorisme of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> which teaches that the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian</hi> ought not only to do his duty, but the <hi>Patient,</hi> and those which are about them, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them, should do theirs also. For outward causes must also conspire towards this Cure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:33853:16"/>
As to the prevention of this Disease, <hi>Galen</hi> handles it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functorily, and slightly, supposing it sufficient to use <hi>Purging</hi> and <hi>Blood-letting</hi> in the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Fall;</hi> adding to these a regular course of Diet: And this he thinks is not only sufficient to prevent it in those who have not yet been seized with it, but also for those who have already been afflicted with it: But we add, that the concurrence of many other things is requisite; of which sort, <hi>Diet</hi> justly challengeth the first place, for such nourishments ought to be chose which are <hi>Euchymick</hi> and <hi>Eupeptick,</hi> that is, of <hi>good juyce</hi> and <hi>easie digestion;</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Patient to forbear all sorts of Foods that are <hi>Glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous, Tartarous,</hi> or impregnated with <hi>Salt,</hi> and such as are easily <hi>Coagulated.</hi> The kinds of which are to be learned out of such
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:33853:16"/>
Books which treat of usefull or noxious Diet. <hi>Drink</hi> is of great moment in this affair, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it serves to dilute the meat, it therefore affords the principle matter to the <hi>Ichorous Excrement,</hi> (of which we have discoursed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.) If this participate much of the aforesaid <hi>Tartarous matter,</hi> without doubt it attracts to it self (from its similitude of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance), the like matter contain'd in the <hi>Aliments,</hi> and therefore promotes the increase of the <hi>Gout.</hi> For <hi>Viscous</hi> and thick drinks, of which sort are <hi>Beer</hi> and <hi>Ale</hi> (which have not work'd well) are very apt to coagulate, and do easily produce the <hi>Stone:</hi> As on the other side, simple drinks, and uncompounded, and such as have little of Salt matter in them, are less prone to generate these kind of Diseases: From hence those which drink water, so it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:33853:17"/>
be unmix'd, are less subject to the <hi>Gout;</hi> chiefly Rich men, who out of curiosity cast clean <hi>Flints</hi> and <hi>Pibbles</hi> into the <hi>Wells</hi> and <hi>Fountains,</hi> from whence they draw their <hi>Waters;</hi> for these stones cover themselves with the Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and Slime, which the water by running through the Earth, had contracted and brought along with it; and these being removed, they cast in others: or they make use of Rain-water receiv'd in Cisterns filled with Gravel. <hi>Mead,</hi> made with Rain-water, well pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifi'd, and throughly wrought, till it become clear, and leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the bottom, is of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent use; and this may be made Medicinal by adding of <hi>Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, Neurotic,</hi> and <hi>Arthretick</hi> Herbs; (that is) such as are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to the Head, Nerves, and Joynts; of which sort are <hi>Bettony, Ground Pine, Cowslips, Primroses,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:33853:17"/>
               <hi>Wine</hi> taken in to large quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, turbid, and not sufficiently freed from its <hi>Tartar,</hi> is very hurtful; both because from the constant, and too much use of it, the native heat is dissipated, the Concoction of the <hi>Stomack</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded, (chiefly of flesh-meats, which in this liquor grow hard;) as also the <hi>Liver</hi> is offended, and accride, and serous blood gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, the <hi>Brain</hi> rendr'd weak, and the strength of the <hi>Nerves</hi> impar'd, <hi>Cathars</hi> and Defluxions provoked, whose matter being condenc'd in that Region, falls perpendicularly upon those parts of the body that are under it, and destroys all that it meets with, chiefly those parts which are weak.</p>
            <p>Amongst Wines, some are of that nature, that, although they seem watery, yet they prick the Tongue and Pallate; such abound
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33853:18"/>
with a <hi>Vitriolin Tartor,</hi> sharp, pontick, and pricking: Others are of a more generous kind, and abound with more plenty of spirits, whose strength is quickly abated by mixing them with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and these chiefly infest the <hi>Brain,</hi> as the other do the <hi>Ioynts:</hi> But there is an Artificial way found out, to take away the hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vapours of such Wine, and this is perform'd by transcolating or straining it by a double glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>instrument, call'd by the French <hi>Montevin;</hi> and with this Engin, it is deprived of its superfluous Tartar, pouring into it any liquor indow'd with a precipitating fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; of which sort is Oyl of <hi>Tartar,</hi> (by the help of which, Wine inclining to be soure, is sweetned) also the solution of <hi>Litharige,</hi> or <hi>Sugar</hi> of <hi>Lead,</hi> made with Vinegar: The solution of <hi>Crystals,</hi> made by often repeated
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33853:18"/>
               <hi>reverberations,</hi> and extinctions in Nettle-water, and dissolv'd with the Accid Spirit of <hi>Turpentine,</hi> according to Art.</p>
            <p>But it is hard, and tedious, to use medicated meats and drinks at our Meals: Those therefore which cannot refrain from Wine, let them elect those which are less hurtful and <hi>Oligo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorick;</hi> diluting them well with water, not taking more than is needful, and abstaining also from too plentiful feeding. Let this be the first, or prime rule of health, not to satiate themselves with Food, nor over-burthen the strength of the Stomack with a superfluous <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or fulness, by which means the native heat will act upon the subjects commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to its charge without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and this is healthful. Nor ought there more new Food to be taken in, till the former be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33853:19"/>
Also let their Diet be simple, and the chief Sawce to it, hunger; exciting an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, if it be wanting, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate exercise at convenient hours (that is, before, not after meat,) by which the drowsie heat will be excited, even as fire cover'd with ashes, is, by stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up.</p>
            <p>But since we have mention'd <hi>Exercise,</hi> whose <hi>Essence</hi> consists in <hi>motion,</hi> we may bring in under this head, <hi>Frixtions,</hi> or Rubbings, as well of the whole <hi>Body,</hi> as of the <hi>Ioynts:</hi> These open the <hi>Pores,</hi> draw out the superfluous matter which (is suppress'd,) and call back the natural heat to the parts; which is the chief instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and <hi>Master workman</hi> of the Faculties: Wherefore, because there is no nourishment which doth not contain some impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys in it, which turns to Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33853:19"/>
we must take care that these superfluities be Evacuated by the natural passages, (or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctiorys) in convenient <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tityes,</hi> and at <hi>fitting times;</hi> which if Nature perform not, Art must supply that defect, carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding that the <hi>Belly</hi> be kept loose. And that the <hi>Stomack</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abound with impurities or filth: So that the first concoctions may not be as it were a <hi>Ferment</hi> to the rest, which would give a Salt accrimony to the succeeding Aliementary juice.</p>
            <p>To perform these intentions, certain familiar Medicines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much; such as are <hi>Pilulae Mastichinae, Macri, Aloes</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with divers juices; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Stomachical, Epatick,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gentle Medicines, which we call <hi>Eccoprotick:</hi> 'Tis of great concern to examin well, if the <hi>Urine</hi> answer in proportion to the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:33853:20"/>
               <hi>Drink</hi> that is drank; for if it do not, 'tis very requisite to take <hi>Potions,</hi> and other forms of <hi>Diuretick</hi> Medicines, at conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times; that is, betwixt Meals. Of which sort is the Vinous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, which is made with fully ripe <hi>Iuniper Berries</hi> bruis'd and boyl'd in water, adding a little <hi>Yeast</hi> or <hi>Mustard</hi> to it, to promote the Fermentation. Or there may be taken a little of the red liquor made according to Art, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> upon <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To provoke Sweat is also won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful beneficial; whether it be procur'd by exercise, or by going once or twice in a month into a <hi>Hot-House;</hi> some times also taking Glysters when the Stomack is empty.</p>
            <p>Let them avoyd all extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Weather, chiefly <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moist</hi> Air, carefully defending

their <hi>Ioynts</hi> from it. Let both their <hi>Sleep</hi> and <hi>Watchings</hi> be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate; for the excess of either is hurtfull. The same judgment is to be given of <hi>Venery,</hi> which is extreamly offensive to Gouty People; for experience doth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that the Salt and Nitrious humors, with which those which have the <hi>Gout</hi> do abound, are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten stirr'd up by these kind of conflicts: Concerning which, a certain person being asked which was the most convenient time to perform them in; he presently answer'd, <hi>Whensoever any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to make himself weak.</hi> Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if a moderation be to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in all those things which concern the <hi>Body,</hi> much more ought it to be so in those things which relate to the <hi>Mind;</hi> for the assaults of it will destroy the <hi>Organs</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> unless they be govern'd by the motions of reason.</p>

               </gap>, or description, of the principle Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of <hi>Diet,</hi> to be observed by those which have the <hi>Gout;</hi> as also of such things which ought to be avoyded by the <hi>Gouty.</hi> By way of prevention from this evil, we will subjoyn some reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, (chiefly such as are <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive)</hi> by which this evil, happily whilst it is in its first <hi>beginnings,</hi> (and as they say, in the <hi>Herb)</hi> may be taken away, or avoyded, by drawing off its cause before it break out into <hi>act,</hi> and fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those parts, in which, it useth to exercise its <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vomits</hi> are the most precious <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylacticks,</hi> or preventer of the <hi>Gout</hi> which may be largely provoked by the help of <hi>Emetticks,</hi> where the joynts are yet lax and limber, and the Disease is at the door, and ready to fall upon them. And
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33853:21"/>
this may be done both to those <hi>Gouty</hi> persons, which have had former fits, and to those which have not yet sustained any; and govern themselves; not submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the advice of <hi>Physitians,</hi> but indulge their own <hi>genius,</hi> (most commonly) to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of their health.</p>
            <p>Amongst the Classes of <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,</hi> this is the most try'd, and never given without success, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>infusion</hi> of <hi>Crocus Mettalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> made into a fine <hi>Powder,</hi> well washed, and steep'd in two, or three Ounces of <hi>White-wine,</hi> for the space of 24. hours, giving the straining of it, with an ounce of <hi>simple Oxymel;</hi> in a morning, upon an empty Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, taking a little fat broth after every provocation to Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. But this kind of Medicine performs it's Operations with some violence, and therefore is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:33853:22"/>
not equally convenient for all Constitutions, but only for such as are fitted by nature for it: But it takes away the Disease by the Roots, neither is it ever given in vain; and although it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with some trouble, and molestation, yet is it inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and harmless, so it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred in a seasonable, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time.</p>
            <p>Clean <hi>white Vitriol</hi> given to the quantity of a <hi>Dragme,</hi> dissolv'd in <hi>Barley-water,</hi> or else given in any Conserve; and drinking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, a great draught of the same water, in which a large quantity of <hi>Liquorish</hi> hath been boyl'd, doth wash, and also strengthen the Stomack, in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and easie bodies: And in such cases, in which the humors are not to be drawn from the farthest, or remote parts of the body. The <hi>Emultion</hi> also of 25.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33853:22"/>
or thirty grains of <hi>Cataputia,</hi> or Spurge (the greater sort) being made with the Broath of a <hi>Chicken</hi> strain'd, or else with <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-water,</hi> sweeten'd with Sugar, adding two or three <hi>Almonds,</hi> is very good in this case.</p>
            <p>There is another sort of <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits;</hi> very useful, and less diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult: And that you may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the reason of this the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we are to remember what was said before, That the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive matter of the <hi>Gout,</hi> is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the <hi>Stomack.</hi> 'Tis the Opinion of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> that it is convenient to be <hi>Drunk</hi> once in a <hi>month:</hi> And this would not be so much amiss, if it left us the use of <hi>Reason,</hi> and did not turn us into the nature of <hi>Swine.</hi> But this advice will agree well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with <hi>Debauchee</hi>'s, and Glutonous persons, who devour all things without distinction:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:33853:23"/>
Let these once, or twice in a month, stuff their Stomacks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove measure, with variety of Meats, chiefly such as is fat; drinking upon it more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of what sort of Liquor they please; so loaded, let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main quiet for one hour; after which, let them walk half an hour gently: at last, putting their <hi>Fingers</hi> into their <hi>Throats,</hi> let them provoke themselves to <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi> and to throw up, not only the meat they have eaten, but also the formerly collected <hi>Slime</hi> sticking to the sides of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,</hi> and which (after eating almost to Vomiting) doth mix it self with the <hi>Aliment,</hi> and is diluted by the Liquors, and drink which is drank: For Nature en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors every single concoction, to collect what she finds in the hollow of the Stomack, that she may convert it into the form and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:33853:23"/>
substance of <hi>Chyle,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards change it into <hi>Blood:</hi> In some there is requir'd a longer time to perform this in, (almost two hours) according as the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack doth more slowly obey the act of <hi>Chylification.</hi> As to the <hi>Motion</hi> which was requir'd as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary before the act of Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that is sufficiently made out by <hi>Navigation;</hi> which as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> notes, (and common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience confirms) doth help to provoke these kind of Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Besides Vomiting, 'tis neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to <hi>Purge</hi> the body, having premised before a preparation of it, with brisk and spirituous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

or otherwise: Also the <hi>Cream, Salt,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> prepare the matter for Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Purges</hi> which are peculiar for the <hi>Gouty</hi> humors, are truly <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragogol,</hi> or purgers of <hi>water,</hi> of which there are a vast number. <hi>Syrup de Rhamno,</hi> that is, Syrup of <hi>Bucks-horn,</hi> is esteem'd a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick</hi> against this Disease, and is to be taken immediately before Meat; the <hi>Dose</hi> of it is two or three <hi>Ounces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cream</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> is a most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Medicine; if you add to it 10, 12, or 15, grains of the <hi>Extract,</hi> or Rosin of <hi>Scamony</hi> (precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in <hi>Rose-water,)</hi> dissolving them together in <hi>White wine,</hi> or taking them in <hi>Broath,</hi> with a drop of the distill'd <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> also <hi>Cydonium Laxativum,</hi> or the purging Quinces of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> is of the same effect.

               <hi>Iallop</hi> root taken to the quantity of a <hi>Dragme;</hi> or four <hi>scruples</hi> in <hi>White-wine,</hi> is a pleasant and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful remedy: nor of less virtue are the <hi>Berries</hi> of <hi>Dwarfe-Elder,</hi> and the <hi>Oyl</hi> made of them by boyling and pressing. <hi>Electuarium Caryocostinum</hi> is singularly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: But the most powerful of all remedies is <hi>Mercurius-dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> which may be happily given to the quantity of a <hi>scruple,</hi> adding by way of Stimulation, and that it may not make too long a stay in the body, 23. or 25. grains of <hi>Pilulae Cochiarum Minorum,</hi> faithfully made up; adding for correction, a few leaves of <hi>Gold,</hi> and a few drops of the distill'd Oyl of <hi>Rosemary, Anniseeds,</hi> or <hi>Cynamon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let not very generous Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines be used too often, but only in the beginning of the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Fall:</hi> But <hi>Vomits</hi> only ought

to be frequently used, as was said before; and also the Pills called <hi>Pilulae Usualium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Niter, or <hi>Salt Peter,</hi> doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Classis</hi> of Evacuators, for it sends forth the Tartarous substance by the way of the <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> and <hi>Bladder,</hi> which matter doth easily Coagulate into Stones, in such as are inclin'd to the <hi>Gout.</hi> Let it be taken in the wain of the <hi>Moon,</hi> to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of a <hi>Dragme,</hi> or two, in Sugar'd <hi>Barly-water:</hi> Also <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium Diaphoreticum fixum,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd <hi>Crollius</hi> his way, is good to provoke Sweat, when given with <hi>Rob,</hi> or the thicken'd juice of <hi>Elder-Berries,</hi> once or twice in a month, according as the party is full-body'd, or irregular in his Diet, going into a <hi>Hot-House,</hi> or being in <hi>Bed</hi> when it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>

As to the rest do as it is in the <hi>Adage, Take care to keep your Head and Feet warm; &amp; in other things, live as the Bruits do;</hi> (that is) <hi>eat at convenient hours, and avoyd plentitude or fulness.</hi> He that observeth the aforesaid rules, though he be naturally inclined to the <hi>Gout,</hi> shall hardly be seized with it, so that these things be perform'd carefully, and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>Now it is time to afford help to those which are actually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the <hi>Gout:</hi> And that these may receive manifest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and help, I have found, (and am confirm'd in it,) by often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated experiments; either by prohibiting the fits, or hindering their often, or frequent returns, cutting off the length of them, or mitigating the fierceness of the pain, or by sooner restoring strength to the joynts and other
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33853:26"/>
parts, made weak by the length of the disease.</p>
            <p>To the defence of such, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those general and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Indications: 1. Of Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Tartarom matter,</hi> draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it away from its original Fountain, the Stomack, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. 2dly. Preparing the same by all temperate means. And 3dly. Excluding the matter so prepar'd, by <hi>Purgation.</hi> And 4thly. Of drawing off the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of it, by the way, and Vessels design'd for the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Urine.</hi> But 5thly. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the superfluous matter is to be dissipated by <hi>Exiccating</hi> and <hi>Obsorbiant</hi> things. 6thly. By procuring (by the way of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,) a Consumption of that part of the matter which hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped the power of other Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. 7. Blunting the accrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Salt</hi> in the parts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:33853:26"/>
8thly. Dissolving it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vapours, whilst it yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth under a liquid form. 9thly. If necessity require it, to fix and condence the same in the place from whence it flows. 10thly. Pain sharply urging to it, to lay it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep by <hi>Narcottick</hi> Medicines, which perhaps may seem a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox to some men. 11thly. By strengthening the joynts betwixt the fits, by which they will not be so subject to Defluxions for the future; and this is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by applying of strong <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boraters</hi> betwixt the fits. 12thly, and lastly, (if it may be done) dissolving the aforesaid <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> before it be throughly harden'd in the Joynts; and if possible, let this be performed at the beginning of its Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For to Cure the <hi>knotted Gout,</hi> there are no less remedies requisite than the <hi>Philosophers-Stone,</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:33853:27"/>
or <hi>Medea</hi>'s <hi>Bath,</hi> in which <hi>Iason</hi> put off his old <hi>Age,</hi> and became young.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Vomits</hi> ought to precede all these things, as being the most necessary of them all; of which we have discours'd before: but whether they are to be made use of seldom or often, necessity, and the orderly, or erregular manner of Diet will teach. But this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radicating Vomit of <hi>Crocus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellorum,</hi> or of <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> is conveninent of it self, and may be used at any time. When the other fore-mentioned things are only to prevent this Disease in those which have never yet been afflicted with it. It is also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient often-times to provoke Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting after Supper, the Stomack being filled with Meat; the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of which is recompenc'd to the Sick, and amended by the Rest of the following Night. Let this kind
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33853:27"/>
of Evacuation be made use of, at least once in a <hi>month,</hi> as being a most efficacious help, chiefly in the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Fall;</hi> or if neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity require it, at the beginning of every Season.</p>
            <p>This is worthy our Remark, That the <hi>Salts</hi> commonly called <hi>Alkalys</hi> (which are made of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables</hi> by <hi>Calcination)</hi> do dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the most Corrosive and pungent <hi>Spirits;</hi> amongst which sort of Salts, or <hi>Alkallys,</hi> Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> is the most powerful. The same thing doth happen in our <hi>Bodies,</hi> in which the <hi>Salts</hi> are acuated by their spirituous sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances: but if their poynts be broke and blunted by <hi>Alkalys,</hi> then they become weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offensive. Neither can the use of <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> be hurtful to any body, taken in <hi>Broath,</hi> or else in some <hi>Conserve</hi> of <hi>Bettony,</hi> of <hi>Ground-Pine,</hi> or of <hi>Cichory:</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:33853:28"/>
for let it be taken under what form soever, it is highly beneficial to those which have the <hi>Gout;</hi> not only because it tempers the salt matter, but because, it also brings forth the <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Tartarous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> (the cause of this distemper) by <hi>Urine.</hi> The Salt of <hi>Ground-Pine, Bettony, Wormwood, Dwarf-Elder,</hi> &amp;c. produce the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. <hi>Sugar</hi> of <hi>Lead</hi> may be safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken inwardly, with appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate Conserves, and it doth actually mitigate and sweeten (the humors) as its tast doth witness: but it taketh off, and abateth Venerial desires (perhaps much to the advantage of the <hi>Gouty</hi> Patient.) These sort of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines ought to be exhibited in the <hi>Wain</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> having before made use of the gentler kind of <hi>Eccoprotick,</hi> or easie purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:33853:28"/>
We have discours'd above of the Purging Medicines that are most convenient in the <hi>Gout;</hi> to which we will add this Specifick; to wit, our <hi>Arthretick Powder,</hi> which ought to be used once in a month, from the quantity of a <hi>Dragme</hi> to four <hi>Scruples,</hi> about the full of the <hi>Moon,</hi> when the humors most abound, and are turgent; and this according to the Magnitude of the Disease, having a respect to the strength of the Patient. Those which are <hi>Plethorick,</hi> or full body'd, and greatly afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Gout,</hi> such may use to take it at suspicious times, (when they expect a fit) one, or two days before the <hi>New</hi> of the <hi>Moon;</hi> taking it either in the <hi>fat Broath</hi> of a <hi>Capon, Cream</hi> of <hi>Barley, White-wine,</hi> or <hi>Whey;</hi> to drink a draught of which, after the taking of the Medicine, is Convenient.</p>

Mix them and rub them in a Morter to a fine Powder. <hi>Bairus,</hi> an Italian Physitian, doth highly extol <hi>Cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocostinum,</hi> whose Ingredients, since they are very hot, and its Operation a little too vehement, I think it scarce safe for <hi>dry bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys,</hi> but only for very <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moist</hi> ones; so that my before described Powder, may supply the place of this, and all other Purges, excepting <hi>Mercury,</hi> whose energy and power exceeds all others: We have spoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the manner of exhibiting it, that it ought to be joyned with such things as will cause it to work quickly, such as are <hi>Pilulae Cochiae Minores,</hi> and the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33853:29"/>
like Purgers, which have <hi>Colocyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thidy, Scamony,</hi> and black <hi>Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> in them; out of which, if you please, you may prepare an extract of the consistance of Pills to be mixed with <hi>Mercury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any one be already seized with a fit of the <hi>Gout,</hi> then is it very desirable that he be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from it, or at least that he be less (or mildlier) afflicted with it. Such after universal purging of the three <hi>Regions</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> and having used a <hi>Sudorifick Diet,</hi> let such (I say) use for the space of a years time together, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pills; which although they cause no sensible Evacuation, yet by the long and uninterrupted use of them, they send forth the <hi>Tartarous matter</hi> by <hi>Urine,</hi> (of the usefulness, or conveniency of which hath been treated before) by a faculty altogether <hi>Specifick;</hi> upon which thing the <hi>Physitian</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:33853:30"/>
ought always to be intent, let his method be what it will: It also strengthens the <hi>joynts.</hi>

Nature to her own work, with whom the Medicine will conspire.

               <hi>Obsorbients</hi> are indowed with a manifest quality, and power of <hi>drying;</hi> to which, if <hi>Specificks</hi> be added, their effects will be more brisk, lasting, and noble: This <hi>faculty</hi> is in all sorts of <hi>Bones,</hi> whether they are <hi>Calcin'd</hi> or not, but humain bones of the same kind with those parts which are afflicted, are more efficatious, by reason of their similitude.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Issues</hi> made (by burning) in the <hi>Arms</hi> or <hi>Leggs,</hi> do intercept those humors which flow to the <hi>joynts,</hi> and bring them forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way, and are a great comfort and relief, both as to the preservation from, and Cure of the <hi>Gout,</hi> especially if the sick

party do not observe a good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; in which case they must of necessity admit of them.</p>

To the inquiring after which, the <hi>Physitians</hi> industry is forced, by reason of the impatience of the <hi>Sick,</hi> and the vehemency of their <hi>pain.</hi> Let there be called to mind then what was formerly said, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Agile,</hi> moveable, and <hi>Acid,</hi> or soure particles of <hi>saline</hi> matter, being mixed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves, do mutually temper each other; and by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, they take off the pains of the <hi>Gout.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Lixiviums,</hi> or Leys made with the <hi>Ashes</hi> of <hi>Coleworts, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches, Pot-ashes, Tartar,</hi> and the like <hi>Alkallisate Salts,</hi> do all of them agree in the faculty of mitigating of pain; chiefly if they be mixed with <hi>Vitriolin</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:33853:32"/>
in which is hid an <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine Sulphur,</hi> and a <hi>Salt</hi> indow'd with a powerful discussive vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. <hi>White Vitriol</hi> dissolv'd in distilled water of <hi>Coleworts;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Lead</hi> (by its native sweetness) take off the <hi>Mordacety</hi> and biting of the <hi>Gouty Salt,</hi> being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly apply'd with the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Colewort-water:</hi> as also doth <hi>Fern,</hi> in whose <hi>Ashes</hi> lurks a <hi>Salt</hi> of excellent virtue: The <hi>Phlegme</hi> of <hi>White Vitriol,</hi> and the <hi>water</hi> of <hi>Froggs Spawn,</hi> and the like Liquors, (to which often-times <hi>Narcotticks</hi> are added) are useful upon a double account, both because they take off the sence of pain (of which beneath you shall hear farther) and also by means of their <hi>sulphurous</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with which they temper the humors.</p>
            <p>The greatest part of those which endeavour to give help in
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:33853:32"/>
the <hi>Gout,</hi> do very improperly make use of Medicines in the form of <hi>Cataplasmes,</hi> or Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesses; from whence there is more hurt then advantage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; because they shut up the <hi>Pores,</hi> which ought rather to be opened: and this we should labour to do, that so the <hi>Lixivium</hi> may draw forth the matter whilst it is yet in a liquid form. To the obtaining of which end, <hi>Apoplecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal waters</hi> are to be apply'd, (which are so much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Authors) and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the fore-mentioned <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Vitriols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oxoronia Swingeri;</hi> also the water of <hi>Urine,</hi> and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> long macerated, putrifi'd, and digested together, these are highly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial. <hi>Camphor</hi> is also of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent use in easing of pain, for it <hi>opens, penetrates, attinuates, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests,</hi> and promotes <hi>insensible</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:33853:33"/>
               <hi>transpiration,</hi> upon the account of its subtile <hi>Particles;</hi> it is use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully apply'd with the aforesaid waters, and that in the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and extream pain.</p>
            <p>I have seen some dissolve <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> digest, and afterward distill it, and apply these sort of <hi>mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> with much advantage to the <hi>joynts,</hi> even in the extremest hight of pain; the efficacy of this is advanced by the addition of <hi>Camphor:</hi> In this particular these recited helps are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, although others no less ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous may be produced and prescribed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sleep</hi> puts a stop to all Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations but <hi>Sweat:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where the <hi>Defluxion</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, and the pain intence, there is nothing more grateful and beneficial than to procure it: Nor can any thing come in competition with <hi>Laudanum,</hi> of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33853:33"/>
which there may be exhibited <hi>two, three,</hi> or <hi>four grains</hi> at the hour of sleep, nay many nights successively; for by rest and quiet, the humors will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted, Nature recovers her strength, and ariseth to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her Enemies. There are other somniforous Remedies <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedanous</hi> to <hi>Laudanum,</hi> but that excels them all.</p>
            <p>The greatest part of <hi>Physitians</hi> rise up against, and oppose the use of <hi>Narcotticks,</hi> and stupify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines; pretending there are other helps more safe to take off the vehemence of pain; and in their Opinion, it is better not to abate the pains at all, or to stop the Complaints, and Crys of the Sick, then to render them <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>feeble,</hi> by these sort of Medicines: This is certainly a very pleasant thing, and ought to be taken for a plausible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33853:34"/>
as if by the use of these Medicines, so great an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility and weakness could be brought upon the <hi>Sick person</hi> and his <hi>joynts.</hi> 'Tis true, <hi>Narcotticks</hi> taken inwardly, if they be not aptly and carefully used, are not without danger; because unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably given, they do (as I may say) cause a kind of <hi>Conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> in the <hi>Brain,</hi> and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce upon the Spirits, an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or stedfastness, not by reason of refrigiration, but by a fixing quality, which is the issue of the Luxurient <hi>Sulphur</hi> contain'd in these Medicines; from whence there is induced an immobility upon the <hi>animal Spirits,</hi> hindring their influx; and from thence, <hi>Death</hi> by suffocation follows; but where there is extream pain, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this need to be feared: For 'tis certain, that one day of extream pain doth inflict more
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33853:34"/>
weakness upon the <hi>Nerves,</hi> then the application of <hi>Topical Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,</hi> (though they be <hi>Narcot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks)</hi> can procure in six days time.</p>
            <p>But let us suppose that by these means some sort of <hi>stupor,</hi> or numbness, doth remain upon the parts, there are thousands of Remedies, able and powerful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to remove, and wash off that fault; as <hi>Baths, Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Plaisters, Hot houses,</hi> and others, which perform this in a short time; add to this that <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotticks</hi> outwardly apply'd, being joyn'd with their <hi>Antidotes,</hi> and <hi>Correctors,</hi> are harmless and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offencive.</p>
            <p>Almost all Authors make use of <hi>Henbain</hi> in vehement pains of the <hi>Gout:</hi> And some assend to the use of <hi>Opium:</hi> If the <hi>Spleen</hi> be grown very hard, we apply <hi>Hemlock</hi> to it, without the least
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33853:35"/>
danger; which is also very usefully laid upon the <hi>Eyes,</hi> although they are so near the <hi>Brain:</hi> I for my part do not fear (happy success having always approved of it) to make use of both these <hi>Plants,</hi> in the form of a <hi>Poultis,</hi> joyning to them <hi>Cassia, Camphor, Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, Sperma-Celi,</hi> and humain <hi>Fat,</hi> which is a most excellent <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> in this case.</p>
            <p>The pain being pacifi'd, we are to come to the use of <hi>Robo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating</hi> and strengthning means; amongst which, <hi>Wine</hi> is the best, which as outwardly applyed, it is very beneficial and friendly to the <hi>Nervous parts;</hi> so inwardly taken, it is highly injurious and offensive to all the <hi>propagations</hi> of the <hi>Brain;</hi> as the <hi>Membrains, Merves, Marrow,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Those that would be inabled to resist the <hi>Assaults</hi> of the <hi>Gout,</hi> must of necessity make use of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:33853:35"/>
such Medicines as have a faculty to, dry, and strengthen the <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts,</hi> whose <hi>Tone</hi> and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Temper,</hi> require to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by their like. <hi>Paulus Aegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta,</hi> an Antient and Learned <hi>Physitian,</hi> adviseth to rub the <hi>joynts</hi> of <hi>Gouty</hi> people, with a <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement</hi> made of <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Oyl,</hi> which Medicine is very useful, the pains being first abated; but its chief excellency consists in preventing the <hi>Gout.</hi> This <hi>Oyl</hi> is prepared with yellow <hi>Violets,</hi> (they usually call it <hi>Cherinum)</hi> by the repeated <hi>infusion</hi> of fresh <hi>Flowers</hi> in it, by which it becomes most excellent, especially if there be added to it the Flowers of <hi>Mullin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>℞. of the said <hi>Oyl,</hi> 
               <abbr>lb</abbr>. j. <hi>decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petated,</hi> (that is <hi>Calcined) Sea Salt,</hi> ground upon a <hi>Pouphiry</hi> to a most subtile powder, of <hi>white-Venis-Sope,</hi> of each four Ounces; mix them, and make an <hi>Oyntment,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:33853:36"/>
like <hi>Nutritum:</hi> With this, in the Evening anoynt all the <hi>joynts,</hi> chiefly the <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>feet,</hi> which are more Obnoxtious to these pains than the other parts: Then afterwards, going to bed, put on <hi>Socks</hi> and <hi>Gloves.</hi> I knew a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Learned <hi>Physitian,</hi> who had been afflicted with the <hi>Gout thirty years,</hi> (this was <hi>Monsieur Quartier,</hi> Physitian to the Duke of <hi>Bollion:)</hi> he lived as many years more, and the residue of his life, (for he was above a hundred years old when he died) by the benefit of the above-described <hi>Linement:</hi> And ten years before his Death, he was seen to walk as firmly, as if he had never been afflicted with this Disease of the <hi>Gout.</hi> Perhaps many will think the <hi>method</hi> of Cure by a strict Diet, a tedious way, because thus their pains and care are never at an end. And it is superfluous (say they) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33853:36"/>
such a course to <hi>Country people</hi> that use much exercise, and live soberly. And for the <hi>Rich,</hi> they hate to take pains, and trouble themselves, and have all things done for them by the help of their Servants, and <hi>debauch</hi> when they please, yet will not regard these <hi>Rules,</hi> or indure any <hi>method</hi> that is tedious.</p>
            <p>The Fit being over, 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com to use <hi>Emplastrum Diachal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeos,</hi> which truly is innocent, but of little advantage. There are better Medicines commonly to be had, as the <hi>Plaister</hi> of <hi>Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctyls,</hi> the <hi>Majesterial Plaister</hi> of <hi>Red-lead,</hi> (call'd <hi>Emplastrum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis.) Gum Caranna,</hi> dissolv'd with <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine;</hi> and <hi>Taca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahacca</hi> are of singular use and virtue: <hi>Emplastrum</hi> of <hi>Bettony,</hi> with <hi>Mastich, Storax,</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoin,</hi> dissolv'd with <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> are very good: <hi>Balsom</hi> of <hi>Dwarf-Elder</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:33853:37"/>
made with <hi>Earth-worms, Sucking-puppies,</hi> and a little <hi>Salt,</hi> is most excellent. <hi>Baths</hi> and <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations</hi> made with <hi>Neurotick</hi> herbs, (that is such as strengthen the <hi>Nerves</hi> and <hi>Brain)</hi> boyled in a ley of <hi>Steel'd-water</hi> &amp; <hi>Red-Wine,</hi> with <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Allom,</hi> do wonderfully Corroborate: <hi>Milk</hi> of <hi>Allom</hi> is singularly good, and is thus prepar'd.</p>
            <p>℞ <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> (or <hi>Brandy)</hi> 
               <abbr>lb</abbr>. j. The <hi>Whites</hi> of six new-lay'd <hi>Eggs,</hi> shake them along-time together, with three or four big lumps of <hi>Alom,</hi> in a well-glaz'd <hi>Earthen-Pot;</hi> (it is sufficient to agitate and stir it about:) The Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine will be more Efficatious if there be first infused <hi>Nervous herbs</hi> in the <hi>Brandy,</hi> such as <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jarom, Sage, Rosemary;</hi> but if this be warm'd with the <hi>White</hi> of the <hi>Eggs</hi> in it, they will grow hard, and it will separate into
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33853:37"/>
               <hi>Curds;</hi> it is therefore better to warm them single, both that, and the <hi>red Wine,</hi> (that is the best <hi>Aligant,</hi> if you can procure it;) and the Vessels being took off from the fire, to add a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or treble proportion of the other, though <hi>Allom Milk;</hi> and to dip Linnen-cleaths in this, and apply them warm to the parts; but what need any more, since the aforesaid things are sufficient.</p>
            <p>They do but make themselves ridiculous, who undertake to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the <hi>knots</hi> of the <hi>Gout;</hi> for if they be once throughly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd, to attempt this, is to wash the <hi>Blackamore:</hi> But whilst the matter is yet <hi>Viscous</hi> and Slimy, I think the thing not altogether impossible, if we can attain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that will enter into it, and doth agree with the matter in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of substance; and such an one is <hi>Sal-Armoniack,</hi> both
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:33853:38"/>
that which is Natural, and that which is Arteficial, and compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of <hi>Soot</hi> and <hi>Urine;</hi> but the volatile <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Urine,</hi> made pure by often <hi>subliming,</hi> exceeds it in efficacy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pores</hi> of the parts being sufficiently open'd, by the help of a <hi>Bath,</hi> a <hi>Hot house,</hi> or a <hi>Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium,</hi> or Ley made with the <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> or yellow dross of the <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lur</hi> of <hi>Antimony;</hi> (whose <hi>Sulphur</hi> is a powerful <hi>attractor,</hi> and hath a great dissolving faculty.) Let there be taken <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Urine,</hi> mixing it with the best <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> and foment the joynts with this mixture. <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Arsenick</hi> doth digest this slimy matter, and draw it to the superficies of the skin; neither is there any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine can equal it upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, if a little of it be mixed with <hi>May Butter,</hi> or some other <hi>Fat,</hi> and the joynts be lightly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33853:38"/>
with this, it sometimes dissipates these <hi>Tumors,</hi> and causeth a certain <hi>viscous matter</hi> to sweat forth at the <hi>Pores,</hi> which looks like <hi>Fat;</hi> and many times there will arise <hi>Pustels,</hi> which poure out drops of <hi>water,</hi> not unlike Eggs exposed to the fire.</p>
            <p>But the main point about the use of this remedy, consists in this, <hi>That you make not too much hast:</hi> For to effect this, there is most commonly requir'd the space of <hi>twelve</hi> or <hi>fifteen days</hi> time. Some as <hi>Dariolus</hi> attempt the opening the parts about the joynts with a <hi>Cautory.</hi> And before the matter is harden'd, they usefully apply <hi>Blistering-Plaisters:</hi> But I am of opinion, that the former advice is unnecessary, and that such as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the antecedent cause of the Disease with inward remedies, may well forbear the use of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ones; or at least may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:33853:39"/>
from these painful ones, for it is cruel to add affliction to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I will say somewhat to <hi>Blood-</hi>letting, which ought to be performed by way of prevention in full Bodies, and such as live highly and plentifully: Open a <hi>vein</hi> in the <hi>Arm,</hi> of such in the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Fall.</hi> In <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly Constitutions,</hi> open the <hi>Haemorrhod Veins;</hi> and in <hi>Women,</hi> procure their <hi>Courses</hi> if they be stop'd. <hi>Galen</hi> undauntedly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that it is a present remedy in the highest <hi>Pains,</hi> most violent <hi>Defluxions,</hi> and great <hi>Inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> These three many times meet together in the first assaults of the <hi>Gout.</hi> And in such a case, according to the urgent necessity, who will deny but that it is often to be ordered? And since this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is of that high usefulness, I beseech you, what can there be of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33853:39"/>
more hope, of greater certainty, and of less hazard? But whether this, or <hi>Purging,</hi> is to be preferr'd in urgent pains, is a question? al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Barius</hi> asserteth of himself, that being extreamly afflicted with the <hi>Gout,</hi> by taking in the height of his pains, of his <hi>Electuary Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryocostinum,</hi> he always was restor'd to the liberty of his <hi>feet,</hi> in so much, that of himself, without any body to support him, he was able to go from his <hi>Close stoole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I faithfully give Credit to what he says; for he was a Learned, Antient, and Experienc'd <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian:</hi> But yet it certainly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that <hi>Gouty persons</hi> either should not be purged in the height of of their pains; or that this should be done <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by carrying the mass, and heap of humors, that increase this Disease another way. This danger may be prevented, if the same day the Purge is given,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:33853:40"/>
there be exhibited at Night a Dose of <hi>Laudanum,</hi> as hath been said before; by which the <hi>Orgas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> or oppressive swelling of the humors is stayed, the <hi>Spirits</hi> fixed, and at length the cause being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished, the Disease doth abate, and Nature is restored to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer liberty.</p>
            <p>These Rules being laid down, it will not be difficult to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to use, more particular Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, besides the aforesaid <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks;</hi> but the great number of them would frighten the Sick, and cause Confusion, both in the mind of the <hi>Physitian,</hi> and those that assist the Sick: And though I have mentioned a great many Medicines, yet it is none of my intention that all of them should be used to the same party: (or upon the same Subject,) for it is the part of the <hi>Physitian</hi> to Elect those which he judgeth most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33853:40"/>
for him that is Sick: For Medicinal Advices ought to be directed by the <hi>Masters</hi> of that <hi>Art,</hi> who will give advice for the right and most opportune use of them; and from this the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness (and advantage of the Sick) ariseth; otherwise a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is as a Sword in the hand of a Mad man; and if any one, who is ignorant of this Art, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to imploy and make use of them, they will find themselves deceived by their ill mannaging of them: Let such learn to know, that the whole quality of the Cure is chiefly profited in the Election of a fitting time, which is a thing not obvious to every body, but only to those which have acquir'd gray-hairs in the Operations of this Art; and this knowledge is not gain'd in a day, nor a year.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:33853:41"/>
Before I conclude, I think fit to give you notice, that this Tract was Extorted from me by a Friend, and was written by me in favour and respect to him, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his Curiosity rather than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.
