            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Spirit of Prophecie, hauing so plainely fore-prophesied of our times, and false-spirites, what are we, that we should be negligent in trying the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whether they be of God? And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that these spirituall Wolues, shall for their outwarde cariage and life, seeme to be Christes Sheepe and poore innocent Lambes (and <hi>for that,</hi> many times be more worthy reuerence, then some of the truest Teachers) it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth people therefore vpon, not to be caryed with a few painted flimflams, but by the speare of Discretion, to gage the side of the <hi>Grecians</hi> wooden

Horse, for trying out, whether the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes be not planted with engines of death. <hi>Latet anguis in herba</hi>; the fairest face hath not alwayes the truest heart. <hi>Satan</hi> in policie, would haue his <hi>Seminaries,</hi> in th'outwarde appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to excell <hi>Christes</hi> Ministers; that so, as them selues be deceiued, they may likewise deceiue others. As for the true Ministers of <hi>Christ, Satan</hi> must needs labour to spot them outwardly, seeing he cannot keepe backe the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinall sappe of Gods spirit; which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling from the lippes of the Teacher, is to beget and feed many.</p>
            <p>Herevpon it is, that true Doctrine is often reiected, because of some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall want in the Teacher. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, because of some excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable outward things (in a <hi>Duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frier,</hi> or a smooth <hi>Pharise,</hi>) any doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is easily swallowed, be it schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall, hereticall, or trayterous: A plaine signe, that such people are yet
<pb facs="tcp:19244:4"/>
destitute of that spirit, whereby they should be able to try Doctrine, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Spirits. And not onely that, but also full of giddy passions, and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong affections; as wil appeare in the ensuing Dialogues: where the very naturall character of such spirits, is by mee set downe; not without sundrie yeares experience had of them all: as also with no small expences.</p>
            <p>If thine heart be vn-hardned, it will easily ioyne with mee: If other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, yet herein I shall be comforted, that in this worke I haue serued God and his Church truly, though weakely. If something in the Conferrours seeme too light, consider first, it is but the naturall character of that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and secondly, that it is but as a feeling of that spirites pulse, without any commoration or dwelling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it.</p>
            <p>As I could, I haue done. If it please, it is that I pray for: if it displease any,
<pb facs="tcp:19244:5"/>
I shall (through Gods grace) not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peaceably passe by it; but also, with patience awayte the change of their iudgement and affection. Farewell.</p>

not when. The Prophet</hi> Daniel <hi>had not this subtiltie, when (though he did well) he would not be thought of any, to do euill, as omitting duetie of prayer to God.</hi> Hananiah, Azariah, <hi>and</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shael, <hi>could (by your Religion) haue bowed before the Idoll, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing haue sayd, that their heartes were against it: and one of them could haue borne witnesse of anothers good meaning. But they had learned, that both body and soule were bought with a price (euen with the blood of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Lambe) and therefore they must glorifie God in both. Trueth is naked, and seekes none of these corners. But tell me, I pray you: If the King should giue all his Subiects leaue, to forsake all communion with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused people, leitourgie and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of England, would you not for sake them all, and betake you presently to that Church whereof I am a member?</hi>

               <p>English-man, the Comparison is not alike. They of <hi>Israel</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to circumcise; but no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Antichrist is commaunded to Baptize. The <hi>Israelites</hi> were a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that had been a true constituted Church; but as your selues say, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was neuer constituted <hi>of,</hi> or <hi>to</hi> the Lord. Thirdly, any <hi>Israelite</hi> might circumcise his Childe: but in your opinion, a Preacher of the word may onely doe that. Till therefore, you can prooue, that the <hi>English</hi> Minister, did but the commaundement of God in Baptising, as the <hi>Israelite</hi> did it in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising, you may goe with the Beastes marke in your forehead, as old and young in your Church carry

               <p>The men that began the frame of the Church of <hi>Israel,</hi> were <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> The men that began the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testaments Church, were the Apostles.

Now Father, who were the first layers of your Churches foundation? They must bring Myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles

As is the first fruite, so be the branches. New Baptisme there can not be, till there come new Apostles. New Apostles there can not be, who are not endued (from aboue) with myracles.
