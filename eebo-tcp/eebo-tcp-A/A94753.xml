            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">
               <hi>THere is a Divine Relation between Perſons teaching, and People taught; wherein conſiſts the
entity or being of a Church: the making known that Relation, contains the viſibility of that
Church.</hi>
               <lb/>
               <hi>Know therefore, that we Miniſters and People deſire to walk together in the unity of the Spirit,
and bond of peace, under theſe manifeſtations.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſt manifeſt to us it is, That the glory of God in Chriſt Jeſus, is the firſt thing whereunto all our
Chriſtian Faith, Duties, Worſhip, and even the ſalvation of our Souls appertaineth; And that
the Holy Spirit by the ſacred Scriptures makes known unto us, how the Lord hath, and will be
glorified in all thoſe that draw neer unto him.</p>
            <p>We therefore manifeſt and delare our Deſires, to receive and believe all things contained in the ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures;
and by the knowledge of the Letter, to attain the ſpiritual ſenſe: and that alſo, not ſo much
in the ſingle diſcoveries appropriate to ſome peculiar matter, as in the entire and more comprehenſive evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences;
comparing Scripture with Scripture, thereby to come neereſt unto the minde of the Lord therein
revealed.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſt unto us, That there muſt be a time and place for the holding forth theſe Scriptures: we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
therefore, to receive the Lord's day as the neceſſary time, and the Temple as the neceſſary place for our
convening and meeting together; That then, or there, none of us be negligently or willingly abſent from
the Duties of Prayer and Praiſes, and hearing the Word read and taught; nor from the Sacraments of Baptiſm
and the Lord's Supper, when they are celebrated. That in all theſe Duties the Lord may be worſhiped by us
in Spirit, (for the inward man;) and for ſo much of the outward man as muſt needs attend, that it be in truth,
putting no confidence therein, as to our ſelves; nor giving offence thereby, as to others.</p>
            <p>We manifeſt our deſires to put a difference between matters eſſential to ſalvation, and ſuch as are but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
thereunto.</p>
            <p>Concerning eſſential matters, either of Faith of Manners; if any of us do offend therein by Opinion or
Practice, our deſire is, that firſt a private and gentle admonition be adminiſtred by them to whom the offence
is firſt made known; that a Chriſtian ſatisfaction may be either given or received: But if not attained,
then the matter may be made known to our Miniſter, that he, with ſuch others as he pleaſe to take with him,
may repair to the offendant, and with the like favourable admonition, labour to reduce him: which ſecond
endeavour, if it become ineffectual, then (as the laſt remedy) the matter be made known to the Church:
and in caſe of continued obſtinacy, the name of the offendant may be expunged from this fellowſhip; that
others be not partakers with his ſin.</p>
            <p>But concerning accidental matters, which a Chriſtian may receive or reject without peril of ſalvation,
wherein the Scriptures appear not clear unto us; we deſire not to uſurp the Tribunal of Chriſt, but that
every one walk humbly and inoffenſively therein; that matter of this nature alſo may be done by us in decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and in order.</p>
