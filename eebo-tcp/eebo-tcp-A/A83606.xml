            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas by an Ordinance of this preſent Parliament bearing date the fourteenth day of July 1643. It was Granted, Ordained, and Declared, That all thoſe who ſhould advance one full fourth part of their former Adventures for Lands in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or that ſhould <hi>de novo,</hi> become Adventurers by advancing any ſumme or ſummes of Money, ſhould have a double proportion of Land; that is, twice ſo much as was granted by any of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Acts or Ordinances of Parliament to Adventurers in that behalfe. Now for as much as the ſaid Ordinance being without limitation of time for ſuch Advances to be made, may much diſadvange the State, The Lords and Commons in Parliament aſſembled taking the ſame into conſideration, and to the end that thirty thouſand pounds, and no more money, may be advanced by paying in one full fourth part upon the ſaid Ordinance, to have a double proportion of Land, as is therein expreſſed, Do Ordaine, and it is Ordained by the ſaid Lords and Commons, That the time limited for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Subſcription and payment of any ſum of money for a full fourth part of any the former Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for Lands in <hi>Ireland,</hi> or otherwiſe upon the ſaid Ordinance of 14. July 1643. ſhall be within twenty dayes next after the paſſing and printing of this preſent Ordinance by all ſuch perſons, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, or Bodies politique as are in <hi>London,</hi> or within ten miles thereof; and the time limited ſhall be within forty dayes after the paſſing and printing of this Ordinance for the comming in Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and payment of any Money for a full fourth part, as aforeſaid, by all other perſons, Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Bodies politique of the firſt Adventurers for Land in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that will advance and pay one full fourth part thereupon or otherwaies. And it is further Ordained by the Authority aforeſaid, That in caſe the ſaid thirty thouſand pounds ſhall not be advanced and paid within the ſaid forty dayes, as is before declared, That then it ſhall and may be lawfull for any perſon or perſons whatſoever, within ſeven dayes next after the expiration of the ſaid forty dayes to advance and pay the full fourth part of any the ſaid firſt Adventures whereunto the ſaid fourth part is, or ſhall not be then added, and upon payment thereof ſhall have and take that advantage to himſelfe which the ſaid firſt Adventurer ſhould or might have had by payment of the ſaid full fourth part by vertue of the ſaid Ordinance of Parliament of the fourteenth of July 1643. before mentioned. And whereas many of the firſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers intended to have paid in their whole Money according to their Subſcription within the times limited for payment, but were hindred by reaſon of the then great troubles, and of the Warre in this Kingdome; It is therefore Ordained and Declared by the ſaid Lords and Commons in Parliament aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, That all ſuch Adventurers ſhall be admitted to make payment of their full Adventure and Subſcription of Money, and to adde a full fourth part thereunto of their ſaid full Adventure and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, according to the ſaid Ordinance of the 14 July 1643. and upon payment thereof, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſeverall and reſpective limitation of Lives before mentioned, and not otherwiſe, ſhall have and take the like benefit of the ſaid Ordinance of the 14. July 1643. for a double proportion of Land in <hi>Ireland</hi> as is therein declared, any Act or Ordinance of Parliament to the contrary in any wiſe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
