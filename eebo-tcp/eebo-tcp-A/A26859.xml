            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Readers,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>1. IF you would be truly informed of the Caſe of the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
and the meaning of this Defence, you muſt know
1. That the meer Nonconformiſts of this age take not up their
Judgment in truſt from any party of men, and therefore take not
themſelves obliged to be <hi>for</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> any thing, becauſe men
were ſo that were called Nonconformiſt sheretofore: As the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is their Rule and objective Religion, ſo they reverence the
judgment of the Primitive Church above the judgment of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
And indeed are ſo far againſt <hi>Sects</hi> and <hi>Parties</hi> as ſuch,
as that their judgment is that the Church will never be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
to deſireable Concord, till our Vnion be Catholick, upon the
terms that Chriſt appointed and which all good Chriſtians have
agreed in, and may agree in.</p>
            <p>2. That what the meer Nonconformiſts of this age deſired for
Concord and Reformation, as to the old Liturgy and Conformity,
is beſt known by their common Propoſals 1660, all the Miniſters
of <hi>London</hi> being by Mr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi> and Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi>
invited to <hi>Sion-Colledg</hi> freely to give their judgments: who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
nothing for Church-Government but Biſhop <hi>Uſher'</hi>s Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
form, and nothing for Worſhip but the Reforming of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
and the free uſe of additional formes: Their exceptions
againſt paſſages in the Liturgy being not thought abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to Communion. And it muſt be remembred that they offered
then, 1. A Defence of thoſe Exceptions, 2. A Reformed Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
or Additions, 3. A Petition for Peace and preventing Schiſm,
to the Biſhops, which they never anſwered to this day, that we
know of.</p>
            <p>3. You muſt know that the Change of the Liturgy on pretenſe
<pb facs="tcp:60845:3"/>
of eaſing us, and the Act of Vniformity, have made Conformity
now quite another thing than it was before, and to us far more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable;
I am paſt doubt that <hi>Ri. Hooker,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> Bi-<hi>Uſher</hi>
and ſuch others were they now alive would be Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts;
yea, I can prove it, as well as I can prove that they were
honeſt men, and would hold to what they wrote.</p>
            <p>4. You muſt know that we had never leave to give our Reaſons
againſt the New Conformity; nor allowed to be once heard ſpeak
for our ſelves, before about two thouſand Miniſters were ſilenced;
when our Judicatures will hear a ſingle Malefactor. We have
been ſilent about eighteen years, while men have call'd to us
[<hi>What is it that you would have?</hi>] while they would not give
us leave to tell them.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>And when the Preſs was ſomewhat open, they ſpread it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
that</hi> [our ſilence now plainly ſhewed that we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſay, but kept up a Schiſm againſt our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.]</p>
            <p>6. At laſt, though my Friends had long told me that our <hi>Lives</hi>
muſt be our beſt <hi>Defence,</hi> and that our <hi>Accuſers</hi> would but be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
by an Apology, and could not endure to hear our Reaſons, I
durſt forbear no longer, but yet ventured no farther than to write
a bare Narrative of the <hi>Matter of our Nonconformity,</hi> leſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
ſhould exaſperate: But that very naming of the things which
we deny, hath much diſpleaſed them that differ from us, ſuppoſing
that it implyeth an accuſation of them, which I renounced.</p>
            <p>7. The Reader then that will underſtand our Caſe, muſt not
look to find it here, but be at the labour to read what is already
written of it, which we muſt not repeat as oft as any will write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us; that is, 1. In the ſaid unanſwered writings of 1661.
2. In the Kings eclaration concerning Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, for
which the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters ſubſcribed and printed a Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
3. In my firſt Plea for Peace, deſcribing our Nonconformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
4. In the efence of it againſt Mr. <hi>Cheyny'</hi>s Anſwer. 5. In
my ſecond Plea for Peace, deſcribing our Judgment of Government
and obedience, and what our Nonconformity is not, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
points. 6. In my <hi>True and only way of Univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60845:3"/>
on which the Churches muſt agree, if ever. 7. In my <hi>Moral
Prognoſtication.</hi> 8. In my Abridgment of Church-Hiſtory of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Councils, ſhewing what hath divided the Churches here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</p>
            <p>8. You muſt know that I write not to juſtifie every man that is
called a Nonconformiſt, but to give an Anſwer to the publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
of my ſelf, and a Reaſon of the Preaching of the meer
Nonconformiſts.</p>
            <p>9. But that the fuller Juſtification of our Preaching is intended
in another Treatiſe, called <hi>Their Apology, or Third Plea for
Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. And as to the proſecution of the debate with this Reverend
Doctor, it is not likely that I ſhall trouble him with any Rejoinder
if he Reply, unleſs he will take another courſe, and firſt explain our
terms, and ſtate the queſtion to be diſputed. Much leſs ſhall I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with any ſubſtitute who ſhall avoid the way of Love and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which from the Doctor I may expect.</p>
            <p>There is one ſort of Diſputants that are <hi>too ſtrong</hi> for me,
<hi>Thoſe that have a better Cauſe;</hi> Truth will overcome: Light
will appear through narrow cranies. Of theſe I ſhall be glad to be
overcome: I proteſt, that to my knowledg, I never managed a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
in which I truſted not to the Goodneſs of my Cauſe, more
than to wit or words or humane advantage.</p>
            <p>But there are above twenty ſorts of other Diſputants, too hard
for me to overcome.</p>
            <p>1. Thoſe that will Diſpute before they agree of the ſenſe of their
terms or ſtate the queſtion, and then quarrel for not being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
            <p>2. Thoſe that will not read or anſwer our fulleſt Defence alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
written, but look I ſhould ſtill begin anew.</p>
            <p>3. Vniverſalliſts, that can prove me to be an Aſs, becauſe
I am an Animal.</p>
            <p>4. Equivocaters, that can prove me a <hi>Separatiſt</hi> becauſe I ſit not
at their feet, or read not in their Book or with their Spectacles.</p>
            <p>5. A Pope that taketh it for a Hereſie or Crime to queſtion his
word, or ſuppoſe him fallible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60845:4"/>
6. A proud meer Grammarian, who can confute <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and
the School-men with a ſcorn, and taketh it for a diſgrace to have
any more Logick than ſimple terms; or taketh Rhetorick for the
pureſt fruit of Reaſon.</p>
            <p>7. A Nominal, who contracteth all his Syllogiſms into ſimple
terms of art, and can confute any Adverſary, by calling him a
Fool, or a Rogue, or a Heretick, or a Schiſmatick.</p>
            <p>8. One that ſtandeth ſo high that he thinks men below him to
be little things like walking Crows.</p>
            <p>9. A one-eyed man that can ſee nothing but on his own ſide.</p>
            <p>10. A galled perſon that ſmarteth if the wind blow on him:
And a melancholly man that thinketh that all that you think and
ſay is againſt him, and would kill him.</p>
            <p>11. I cannot diſpute againſt Canons and Organs, that ſpeak
ſo loud that none can be heard but themſelves. Nor againſt ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bells, that have loud tongues and no ears: and go on, on, on,
and take no heed to what is anſwered.</p>
            <p>12. Nor againſt ſuch as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 4. Iron is too ſtiff for me to
bow, and I can make no impreſſion upon braſs.</p>
            <p>13. Nor can I deal with ſuch as are deſcribed, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7. 4, 6,
7. Such an Oven hath too wide a mouth and too hot a breath for
me to contend with.</p>
            <p>14. Nor ſuch as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59. 7. and 55. 21. that ſpeak <hi>ſwords,</hi>
or diſpute with hands and not with tongues: and fetch their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
from the Priſon, or the Lyons, and ſpeak not to the
ear, but to the fleſh and bones. Nor ſuch as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 6. <hi>Iſa.</hi>
27. 4. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 4. Thorns and Bryers ſpeak too feelingly. If I muſt
diſpute with ſtings, I had rather it were with Bees that will re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>compence
me, than with Waſps or Hornets.</p>
            <p>15. I am too weak for men over valiant, that can venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any thing, and eaſily prove that the Snow is black.</p>
            <p>16. And my voice is too low for the dead and deaf and ſleepy
and drunken, that when I have ſpoken know not what I ſaid.</p>
            <p>17. I am loath to enter the Liſts with thoſe women that never
want time, or heat, or words, and ſeldom foul ones, [<hi>Nam ſi
cum ſtercore certo, vinco ſeu vincor, ſemper ego maculor.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60845:4"/>
18. Nor am I able to deal with a Crowd or Multitude, where
they follow the Leader, and cry, <hi>Away with him,</hi> when few
know whom or what they are againſt.</p>
            <p>19. Nor yet with Lads that are too quick for me, and value
<hi>Mercury</hi> above Gold, that have quick Trade but little ſtock, and
think age and experience to be the Characters of dull declining
Wits.</p>
            <p>20. And I am too weak to diſpute a man out of Love with his
Life, or his Pleaſure, Wealth or Honour. All Church-Hiſtory
tells me how rarely any ever ſcrupled the Lawfulneſs of being
made Pope or Patriarch, or hath been argued out of a Biſhoprick
or Dominion. I am not ſtrong enough to anſwer an hundred
pound a year, much leſs a thouſand (though Grace and Conſcience
is.)</p>
            <p>21. But though all this be not the Caſe of the Reverend Doctor,
yet one advantage (though uncertain) he hath: He is liketo
<hi>over-live me,</hi> and ſo may have the <hi>laſt word;</hi> And that is a
certain Victory with the ſequacious multitude. But yet Truth
will triumph, and fraud will vaniſh, and ſecret things ſhall be
brought to light, and that which is crookned by the Judgment of
men ſhall be ſet ſtrait by the infallible final judgment.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS you have told the Magiſtrates and the World what you think
of me as guilty of ſinful ſeparation, I have reaſon to hope that
you will not deny me your help for my own conviction: For it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
no man ſo nearly to know my ſin as my ſelf: and being ſo
near my day of Judgment, I were a moſt inexcuſable wretch if I were
unwilling to know it. You knew their capacity it's like, for whom
you Preacht and wrote; but I, that beſt know my own, finding it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to underſtand you and your accuſation without further help,
preſume to intreat your ſpeedy Anſwer to theſe Queſtions which are
the ſtop of my Conviction.</p>
            <p>I. Q. I entreat you to tell me more plainly, <hi>which is the conſtitutive
Regent part of a National Church?</hi> Whether the King, or a Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Head? For that you know, that a Church as well as a Kingdom, is
eſſentiated by a <hi>pars regens,</hi> and <hi>pars ſubdita,</hi> I long ago found in your
<hi>Irenicon.</hi> I have opened the ſtate of the Queſtion in my firſt <hi>Plea, Page</hi>
251, 252, &amp;c. Of which I crave your Solution: For to hear of [<hi>One
Head,</hi>] and not know who it is, is no ſatisfaction to me.</p>
            <p>II. Q. I intreat you to tell me wore plainly what the [<hi>One Rule</hi>]
meant in your Text was, which was then extant, and all that had
attained to be true Chriſtians were then and are now to agree in and
walk by. For I perceive you truly judge that it was ſomewhat then
known to them; and yet in your application one would think you
meant ſome late humane Laws.</p>
            <p>Was it a Divine Rule or a Humane? If Humane, how to know it.</p>
            <p>III. Q. I beſeech you tell me plainly, what is the <hi>definition</hi> or <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
reaſon</hi> of that ſinful <hi>ſeparation</hi> which you mention as mine. For
I cannot perceive it by your Book: unleſs you take <hi>preaching without
the Magiſtrates Leave,</hi> and Worſhiping in a manner different from
that appointed by Law, and forbidden, to be it. But I ſuppoſe you
take not all Diſobedience to be Separation, nor all different Modes
of Worſhip. I would fain know what you mean.</p>
            <p>IV. Q. I intreat you tell me plainly, what you would have the many
ſcore thouſands do on the Lords days, who cannot hear in the Pariſh
Churches? For the matter of fact is paſt diſpute, that in your Pariſh
of St. <hi>Andrews, Sepulchres, Giles Cripplegate, Giles in the Fields, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60845:5"/>
               <hi>Clements,</hi> and many others, there are in ſome 10000, in ſome
20000, in ſome 30000, in ſome the Pariſhoners ſay, 60000 Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
more than can come into the Church and hear the Miniſters
Voice; which ſeldom can be heard by more than 3000 or 4000. How
would you have all theſe ſcore thouſands ſpend the Lords day?</p>
            <p>V. <hi>Q.</hi> Are you not conſcious that the true paſtoral Office is not
performed in your own Pariſh to the third part of the people accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their need, and <hi>Pauls</hi> example <hi>Act.</hi> 20. by reaſon of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them? Prudent peaceable men of your Pariſh tell me, that not
one of five of their neighbours ever uſe to go to any Church: And
out of the Church never hear a word from the Paſtor, unleſs at the
Baptizing of a Child; but live like Heathens without any publick
Worſhip of God: And the worſt men that moſt need help leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it, and therefore eaſilieſt take the excuſe that at the Pariſh Church
there is no room, and if they go to others they are called Separatiſts;
but not if they play, work or drink at home.</p>
            <p>VI. <hi>Q.</hi> I am confident you know the need of many Curates in your
own Pariſh; (for my part, I profeſs, I am ſo far from thinking my
ſelf capable of a Biſhops work, that I would not take many 1000 <hi>l.</hi> a
Year to take the Paſtoral Charge of your Pariſh without many aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants)
ſeeing then you and I (as I ſee by your Treat of Satisfaction
and other Doctrinal Books) do Preach the ſame Doctrine, and I
perform but the part of a Curate or Aſſiſtant to you for nothing.
Why think you that it is worſe than that ſo many be untaught?</p>
            <p>VII. <hi>Q.</hi> Do you not think that culpably to alienate an Ordained
Miniſter, Vowed to the Sacred Office, is far worſe ſacriledge than
to ſteal Church-plate or Moneys? And that it muſt needs be ſo cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
either in our ſelves for not Conforming, or for ceaſing our
works, or elſe in thoſe that hinder us.</p>
            <p>VIII. <hi>Q.</hi> What then is it that you would have us do, when after
our beſt endeavours we are no more able to ſee the Lawfulneſs of
Conforming or forſaking our Calling, than of many great notorious
ſins?</p>
            <p>IX. <hi>Q.</hi> Do you think that for qualification and number there are
ſo many better than the ſilenced Miniſters in the Land, as may ſo far
ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pply the Peoples wants, as that 2000 ſuch as we may better be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
than employed, unleſs we can Conform?</p>
            <p>X. <hi>Q.</hi> Are none of our Hearers more competent Judges than their
Accuſers, what profiteth their own Souls? And if the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, what is
the great harm that ſuch as I do, that weighs down the Peoples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit;
while all your power is for edification, and all your Churches
that I come in are full?</p>
            <p>XI. <hi>Q.</hi> What is it in us that warranteth a humble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60845:6"/>
think, that his Miniſterial duty is ſo much better than ours, that in
compariſon of his Miniſtry, ours is unneceſſary and we unſufferable in
the Land: Is it our <hi>ignorance</hi> or our <hi>wickedneſs</hi> that makes the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
ſo great? I have ſtudied many years longer than you, though
perhaps with leſs advantage: We know nothing in the world that we
prefer before the pleaſing of God, and edifying his Church? Though
you excel us, do all others ſo? My meaning is, would you have none
tolerated in <hi>England</hi> that are as <hi>ignorant</hi> and as <hi>bad as I, Conſideratis
conſiderandis.</hi> Doth bare Conforming make all this difference?</p>
            <p>XII. <hi>Q.</hi> And as I ask all theſe Queſtions for my ſelf (and earneſtly
intreat your Anſwer) pardon me while in true love to you, <hi>I</hi> put this
Queſtion to you for your ſelf; Whether do you think, if you lived in
the pain, and as near the Grave as <hi>I</hi> do, and by the ſentence of death
had the lively apprehenſions of your account, ſhould you not tremble
to think of becoming a Preacher againſt our Preaching, and juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or owning the ſilencing and ruining of ſo many hundred devoted
Miniſters of Chriſt, who are no worſe, and for no worſe Cauſe? Such
as truly deſire to ſerve God as faithfully and diligently as your ſelf,
and with as little reſpect to preferment, riches, applauſe, or any
worldly end? And whether you will never wiſh that you had never
put your hand to ſuch a work, as to argue with the Magiſtrate and
harden others, againſt the enduring of ſuch mens labours, even on the
hard terms that we willingly perform them.</p>
            <p>Sir, Many importune me to publiſh an Anſwer to your Sermon:
1. As to my ſelf, <hi>I</hi> am more concerned to crave your help for my
conviction, if <hi>I</hi> live in ſin at ſo dear a rate, even to my ſleſh: 2. And
as to you, you have deſerved ſo well of this Land, eſpecially for ſo
ſtoutly oppoſing Popery at ſuch a time, and are ſo much loved and
valued by us all, that <hi>I</hi> would take tho-leaſt provoking way; us know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what contention and exaſperatiou tendeth to, and how glad the
Papiſts will be to turn your Pen from themſelves, and leave you and

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Lately received a Letter from you,<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> wherein you complain of my expoſing

whereas I never mentioned your name, when I Preached, and when I
Printed the Sermon, I have quoted it ſeveral times againſt Separation.<note place="margin">§. 2.</note>
But if your meaning he, that you think your ſelf concerned in thoſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes

many of which do very little relate to the matter in debate between us. What
you mean by knowing their capacity for whom I preached and wrote, I

            <p>

of the ejected Miniſters, and comparing their Gifts with Ours.</p>
            <p>But what is all this to the buſineſs of Separation? unleſs you ſuppoſe that
the Goſpel is not preached by Vs; or whether it be or not, that you are bound
to preach it ſtill, and ſo much ſeems to be implied in your 7<hi>th</hi> Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi>
That it is a ſacriledge culpably to alienate an Ordained Miniſter vowed to
the ſacred Office. And becauſe this comes neareſt to the matter in hand,
and ſeems very much to ſtick with you, I ſhall deſire you to reſolve theſe
Queries.</p>
            <p>1. Whether it be not in the power of thoſe who give Orders in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Church to limit and ſuſpend the Exerciſe of the Miniſterial Function
without Sacriledge? If not, how could the Chriſtian Church in its beſt and
pureſt times, pretend to reduce Biſhops and Presbyters to a Lay-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
of which you may read ſo often in St. <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Epiſtles. Nay what
Church is there to be named, that doth not aſſume this power to it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt ſuſpition of Sacriledge? And it would be very ſtrange, that this
Notion of Sacriledge ſhould never be underſtood before.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 13.</note> 2. Whether Chriſtian Magiſtrates may not juſtly reſtrain thoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
from Preaching, who after the experience of former Troubles, do refuſe
to renounce thoſe Principles which they judge do naturally tend to involve
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> again in the like Troubles?</p>
            <p>3. To what purpoſe any ſuch Authority is either in Church or State, if
thoſe who are legally ſilenced may go on to preach publickly in oppoſition to
the eſtabliſhed Laws; only in ſuppoſition that they were wrongfully ejected?
This I am certain is contrary to the Doctrine of all the Non-conformiſts of
former times,<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> as you may ſee in the Book publiſhed in their name by Mr.
<hi>Rathband,</hi> A. D. 1644. p. 41. (beſides what you may find in my Sermon,
p. 51. only the Teſtimony of Dr. <hi>Gouge</hi> ought to be corrected th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, p. 513,
514.) Their words are, <hi>if a guiltleſs Perſon put out of his charge by
the Churches Authority, may yet continue in it, what proceedings can
there be againſt guilty perſons who in their own conceit are always
guiltleſs or will at leaſt pretend ſo to be; ſeeing they alſo will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ready to object againſt the Churches judgment, that they are
called of God, and may not therefore give over the execution of
their Miniſtry at the will of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">§. 25.</note> 4. Whether there be the ſame obligation now lying upon Miniſters to
preach the Goſpel, in a Nation where the Goſpel is confeſſed to be truly
preached, when they are forbidden to do it by the Laws of the Land; as
there was upon the Apoſtles to preach it firſt to the World, notwithſtanding
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he prohibitions of men?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60845:7"/>
The diſparity ſeems ſo obvious to me, that I could hardly believe men of
underſtanding would alledge the Apoſtles words to juſtifie their preſent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes,
had I not ſo often ſeen it done. But that the old Non-conformiſts did
truly underſtand the diſparity of the caſe, you may ſee it in 3 inſtances in
the former Book, which I ſhall refer you to.<note place="margin">§. 16.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But you ask one matterial Queſtion in behalf of the People, <hi>viz.</hi> Are none
of our hearers more competent judges than their Accuſers what profiteth
their own ſouls? And is this in your judgment, a tolerable Plea for Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
then there can be no ſuch thing as an unjuſtifiable or ſinful ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſince the people are left to be their own judges. For where was any ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
made but upon ſuch a pretence? And upon this ground the people may
leave you to morrow, and go to Doctor O. and leave him next week and go
to the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and from them to the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and ſtill plead that
they are more competent judges than their Accuſers, what profiteth their
own ſouls.<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> No one would think by ſuch Queſtions as theſe, that ever you had
written ſo much againſt Separation, and ſpoken ſo freely of the miſchief of it,
Thus I have pickt out thoſe Queries, which come neareſt to the matter of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
and given a ſuffieient Anſwer to them. But as to the other remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
concerning the conſtituent regent part of a National Church; the One
Rule mentioned by the Apoſtle; and whether you or I have ſtudied longer or
to better purpoſe, I have in civility paſſed them over, as no more relating to
our buſineſs,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> than determining the Principle of Individuation, is, to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſixth Commandment. And I am reſolved in debate of this nature
not to be drawn off by any by-Queries from the main thing in Controverſie.
I do not preſs you to any ſpeedy Anſwer, but I deſire you rather to weigh and
conſider things impartially, than to give too haſty a Reply. I am neither
fond of Controverſie, nor can I deſert ſo juſt and clear a Cauſe as I take this
againſt Separation to be; from which I ſhall not be moved by the noiſe and
cenſures of weak and injudicious people, who I find (as you formerly obſerved)
can leaſt endure to be touched in this matter. If you pleaſe at your leiſure

you; muſt I trouble the Reader by gathering all the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
where you expreſly ſpeak to me, <hi>viz.</hi> As <hi>One of them;</hi> and as
going <hi>beyond the Independants,</hi> and preaching <hi>unlawfully</hi> to them that
<hi>unlawfully</hi> hear. and as deeling <hi>more diſingeniouſly</hi> and <hi>leſs fairly</hi> than
the old Separatiſts, and ſo almoſt from end to end.</p>
            <p>§. 3. <hi>Seeing you</hi> ſhould have been very glad to have found an anſwer
to your Sermon, <hi>an Anſwer you ſhall have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 4. Seeing you will no further explain your great word [<hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>]
I will anſwer it where I find it in your Sermon: And if the
Caſe muſt be no more intelligibly ſtated, I muſt take it as you will
do it.</p>
            <p>§. 5. To ſum up all, as far as I am able to underſtand you, your
Sermon containeth, 1. The grounds ſuppoſed on which you build.
2. Your Accuſation of us on thoſe grounds: 3. The <hi>penalties</hi> which
you juſtifie, 4. And the cure which you deſire.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>As far as you are intelligible to me, your ſuppoſed grounds are,
that</hi> [God hath authorized the Magiſtrate, 1. To chooſe what perſons every
man in his dominions ſhall entruſt his ſoul to, as the Paſtor, whoſe Conduct
he is bound in Conſcience to obey: 2. <hi>And alſo to</hi> chooſe and command, in
what words only every Paſtor ſhall publickly pray to God; <hi>and what</hi> Books
and words of men he ſhall profeſs aſſent and conſent to; <hi>and what</hi> dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſymbols of Chriſtianity he ſhall uſe as engaging in the Chriſtian Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<hi>and to</hi> command Ceremonies and Modes, for diſſent wherein he ſhall
deny Baptiſm, and Church-Communion to all diſſenters, though the things
be taken to be indifferent by the Magiſtrate, and great ſins by the diſſenters.
3. <hi>And that all that obey not in all theſe, but preach when forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
or uſe other accidents or modes, and chooſe other Paſtors to

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60845:8"/>
II. On theſe grounds you judg me and ſuch others ſinful Separatiſts</p>
            <p>III. You juſtifie the executing of the Laws upon us, and would
have us ſilenced, and ſuch diſſenters not endured</p>
            <p>It is our (Conformity, or our) ceaſing to preach which you plead
for as the Cure.</p>
            <p>§. 6. I. As to your ſuppoſed ground, 1. You know, it's like that
in my firſt <hi>plea for peace,</hi> I largely confuted it: And could you think
that without any reply your bare ſaying over the thing confuted,
could be any ſatisfaction, to one of any ſenſe or conſcience.</p>
            <p>2. You cannot but know that the judgment and practice of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niyerſal
Church in <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> hath been againſt you, not only for
the firſt 300 years, but for many hundred after. Father <hi>Paul Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi</hi>
after cited, in his Hiſtory of Church Revenues truly teſtifieth it:
<hi>I</hi> have proved it by many Canons and Hiſtories in my Church Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
that he was to be taken as no Biſhop that was choſen by Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
Prelates or any, without the <hi>Clergies election,</hi> and the <hi>Peoples
election</hi> or <hi>conſent:</hi> Chriſtians then took not this to be any part of the
Princes truſt: but only to countenance the things that furthered
Learning and Godlineſs, and encourage the Clergy and People to
chooſe the beſt, and to protect and encourage and govern them by
the ſword when they were choſen. This being paſt doubt, were the
Univerſal Church Separatiſts? Is <hi>our Concent</hi> with the Univerſal
Church, or <hi>your ſingularity</hi> from it, liker to Schiſm or Separation?</p>
            <p>3. <hi>I</hi> know that there are inconveniences in the Peoples conſenting
power, and ſo there are in all humane affairs; but not to be cured
by pernicious miſchiefs. You will not tell me, becauſe you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell me, how we ſhall know what Magiſtrates they be that have
this truſt? Whether Heathens, Infidels, Mahometans, Socinians,
Arians, Macedonians, Eutkchians, Monothelites, Image-worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Papiſts, Anabaptiſts, or who? and who muſt judge of their
qualifications? Yea, were we ſure that the Prince were Orthodox,
If he were but wicked, debauched, an enemy to ſerious practical
piety, as all wicked men naturally are inclined to be, will not all
ſuch chooſe Biſhops and Paſtors like themſelves? what more natural
than to propagate our like? And will not wicked Biſhops make wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Prieſts; And you know the Patron hath the choice with us and
it's a ſlender qualification which the Biſhop hath power to require,
without a <hi>quare impedit:</hi> An Atheiſt, a Fornicator, a <hi>drunkard,</hi> a
<hi>hater</hi> of <hi>holineſs, hath nevertheleſs</hi> the choice of a Prieſt for the Pariſh,
to whom all the People muſt entruſt their Souls. What a ſad Caſe
were the Chriſtian World in, if we may lawfully have no other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
than Gentlemen and Princes chooſe for us? When Chriſt tells
us how hard it is for the Rich to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60845:9"/>
and how few of the Noble are called, and [<hi>in uno annulo,</hi> &amp;c.] is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Proverb. What a Caſe were <hi>Hungary, Poland, France, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
and the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches in, if this were true?</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Perſonal power</hi> in man is the firſt: <hi>Family power is the next:</hi> City
and Kingdom <hi>power</hi> ſuppoſeth theſe and cannot deſtroy them: Hence
ſubjects that are not meer ſlaves, ſtand up to plead for their <hi>Perſonal</hi>
and <hi>Domeſtick property, liberty and power.</hi> If my Money, and Limbs
and Life be not at the Patrons or the Princes will, much leſs my Soul.
He is truſted with my Eſtate and Life; but I am firſt and more truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them. He may keep out ill Phyſitians from the Land, and
encourage the good; but he hath no power to tie me to an ill Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
nor to an ill Diet, nor to ill Servants, &amp;c. The choice of theſe
belongeth to my ſelf. Much leſs can he on pretence of Pariſh-order tie
me to an ignorant, drunken, Malignant, or an unexperienced ſapleſs
Teacher, that is to my Soul as a ſilly Emperick to my health. Scripture
and the Worlds experience tell how much God m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rrally giveth his
light and grace, according to the aptitude of means: <hi>Habitus infuſi
ſe habent ad modum acquiſitorum,</hi> is common in the <hi>Schools.</hi> Twenty
ſinners are uſually ſooner brought to repentance under skilful fit
Teachers, than under one unskilful or ungodly men. And no man hath
power from God, to damn my Soul; or forbid me the needful means
of my ſalvation. No man is ſo much concerned as my ſelf what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
of me for ever: and I will not believe that the Patron loveth
me and all the Pariſh better than we love our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> hath been bleſt with better Rulers than other Lands: But
one Rule muſt in this be held to by all the Churches. And if you
would even here appeal to experience, I will not here ſtay to tell you
the names of 8 or 9 or 10 ignorant Readers, moſt Drunkards, ſome
rarely, half never preaching, that I was bred under, nor what a
ſtock of ſuch our Country had, and how very thin pious tolerable
preachers were: nor what worthy men <hi>Aldermanbury, Black-fryers,</hi>
the <hi>Inns-of-Courts,</hi> and moſt places have had where the people choſe.</p>
            <p>But reaſon ſignifieth little with moſt, who are on his ſide that talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to them with the beſt advantage: I inſiſt on this, You go againſt
all the ancient Farthers and Churches for many hundred Years, and
are ſo far a Separatiſt from more than one Pariſh-Prieſt.</p>
            <p>II. And therefore your Accuſation of us thus grounded is Shiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
and unjuſt, and recoileth on your ſelf, who inſtead of <hi>Gods Rule</hi>
that <hi>all ſhould walk by,</hi> accuſe them that walk not by your novel crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Rules, which may make as many Modiſh Religions as there are
Princes.</p>
            <p>III. And your deſire of our <hi>ſilencing</hi> and not being <hi>tolerated,</hi> I will
only here lament, and after ſpeak to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60845:9"/>
IV. And as your Cure by our <hi>Conformity</hi> is impoſſible; ſo that by <hi>ſilen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cing</hi>
will be none, but increaſe the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>§. 7. Is it not a very uncharitable thing of you, that when it's I whom
you have called to account, you flatly deny or ſhun to give me an Anſwer
to my Caſe, and to the Caſe of all others that preach only in Pariſhes, where
few of the People can hear in the Church. Why ask you [<hi>To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſhould you reſolve thoſe Queries?</hi>] I Anſwer, to ſhew me whether my
preaching be my Sin, or Duty: And whether you juſtly or unjuſtly accuſed
me, and all ſuch others; was it not to this purpoſe that I craved your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer?</p>
            <p>2. And do you not know, that in the Bills of Mortality it appeareth
that the Pariſhes within the Walls are but about the ſeventh part of the
whole; and the outer Pariſhes, which are thus great, are about ſix parts:
And in theſe Pariſhes it is not the tenth part in ſome and the ſixth in
moſt that can come within the Church to hear. And it is pity that one
half, or two or three parts of ſuch a City as <hi>London</hi> ſhould be left like the
<hi>Indians</hi> without any publick Teaching and Worſhip, and ſuch as you ſay
ſo much for it.</p>
            <p>§. 8. You ſay, <hi>The Separate Meetings are kept in the City,</hi> Hackney, New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. What's that to me, and all ſuch other? 2. I can tell that ſome
City Churches are yet unbuilt, and the Tabernacles will not hold the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(as Chriſt-Church, and others.) 3. And divers keep Meetings <hi>within
the Walls,</hi> where they found moſt peace, for the <hi>reception of thoſe without
the Walls,</hi> that cannot come into their own Churches. 4. What's done
at <hi>Newington</hi> I know not; But at <hi>Hackney</hi> I know of two Meetings, where
the Miniſters ſo preach out of the time of Publick Worſhip, that none
may be hindred from going to it, and deny not Communion with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Churches:
And they tell me, that as the Incumbent Officiateth by
another, ſo the Pariſh is ſo great, and the Preachers Voice ſo low, that
a great part cannot hear him.</p>
            <p>5. Why do you ſay <hi>they are ſeparate Meetings,</hi> when you know that
you have caſt them out: The Preachers had rather Preach in your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and they cannot be ſuffered: Preachers and <hi>People</hi> that are profeſſed
Nonconformiſts but in Opinion, are by the Canon <hi>ipſo facto Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 9. As to what you ſay of the Reaſon of their Meetings; I Anſwer,
1. I think (as far as I can Judge) the moſt of my Hearers, (I think ten or
twenty to one) do alſo hear in the Pariſh Churches: So that your Charge
of Separation againſt them is but for <hi>hearing both:</hi> And I believe it is ſo
with many others. 2. Every one that preferreth better, doth not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from all the reſt: Your Church alloweth any free Man to forſake
and change his Biſhop and Pariſh Prieſt as oft as he will; ſo he will but

            <p>

8. I believe, that a Father muſt be honoured, and having care of his
Childrens Life and Soul, he muſt command them neceſſary Food and Means
for Body and Soul, and they muſt obey him, if the Law forbad it.</p>
            <p>9. I believe that murdering Souls privatively or poſitively is a ſin, as well
as murdering Bodies, as many undertaking and not performing Paſtors will
find.</p>
            <p>10. I believe that he that obeyeth not a Law which was made againſt
Gods Law, or without Authority given by him, ſinneth not againſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>11. I think in ſuch caſes, he that ſubmitteth to the Penalty of a Penal
Law, doth enough.</p>
            <p>12. <hi>I conjecture, that the multitude of Caſuiſts, Politick Writers, and
Lawyers, who ſay that</hi> Becauſe the Common Good is the End of Government,
and all Power is for Edification, no Law obligeth which is againſt the Common
Good, or at leaſt that is deſtructive of it,] <hi>are like to be near as knowing in
ſuch matter, as the</hi> meaneſt <hi>of the Doctors</hi> Hearers <hi>and</hi> Readers.</p>
            <p>13. And I am paſt doubt, that he that denieth theſe Principles, will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have no cauſe to glory of his Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>And O what cauſe have we that are Teachers, in ſtead of proving thoſe
intollerable that differ from us in ſuch matters as our Conformity, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that an Errour in us, eſpecially ſo Practical and momentous, is far more
dangerous than in the People. If all my Neighbours miſtake my Diſeaſe and
the Remedy, it may not hurt me; but if my Phyſician miſtake it, it may
be my death. Biſhop <hi>Vſher</hi> and many Proteſtants do except a Learned Papiſt
much more than the unlearned from the hopes of Salvation.</p>
            <p>§. 12. I will readily Anſwer your Queries, though you refuſe to Anſwer
mine.</p>
            <p>To your firſt, Thoſe who rightfully give Orders, muſt give ſuch Orders
as God hath inſtituted, and may not limit or ſuſpend contrary to his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
or Laws. As he that marrieth Perſons may not except the Husbands
Power of Government, nor may unmarry them againe, ſave for Adultery.
None may ſilence Miniſters that forfeit not their Office. On juſt cauſe to
pull down Churches, and alienate the Church Goods, (as ſome Biſhops of
old did for the Poor) is no Sacriledge: nor to ſilence an intollerable Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher:
But to ſilence Miniſters unjuſtly, is another matter.</p>
            <p>If men will cant over ſtill, <hi>Who ſhall be Judge?</hi> We ſtill repeat, 1. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is Judge, he hath no Power to caſt out faithful Miniſters: and if he
miſ-judge them, it juſtifieth not his act. And every man is the <hi>diſcerning
Judge of his own Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 13. To your ſecond Querie, Chriſtian Magiſtrates may juſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the publick Peace by all juſt means, and may repreſs all rebellious
Practices and Principles: but if they ſhould <hi>miſ judge</hi> any principles to be
ſuch that are not, and for not renouncing thoſe ſhould ſilence Miniſters, if
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60845:10"/>
they have <hi>fitter means</hi> than <hi>ſilencing</hi> to <hi>correct them, ſilencing them,</hi> when their
<hi>Miniſtry</hi> is <hi>needful,</hi> is a <hi>ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſeeing <hi>theſe words</hi> are ſignificant of <hi>your mind for ſilencing us,</hi> and the
<hi>Reaſons</hi> of it, why would <hi>you</hi> not tell <hi>me, what thoſe Principles are which we
refuſe to renounce,</hi> and ſo <hi>deſerve ſilencing.</hi> Either you lay the ſtreſs on
the <hi>guiltineſs of our Principles,</hi> or on the <hi>Magiſtrates judging them ſo.</hi> You
cannot think, that if he <hi>miſ judge,</hi> it will juſtifie his <hi>ſilencing men:</hi> Elſe
<hi>Valens, Hunnierichus,</hi> that <hi>cut out</hi> the <hi>Preachers Tongues,</hi> thoſe that <hi>ſilenced</hi>
the <hi>Preachers</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> on <hi>one ſide</hi> for not ſwearing for <hi>the Pope,</hi> and on
<hi>the other</hi> for not ſwearing for <hi>the Emperour, &amp;c.</hi> all <hi>did well.</hi> Seeing then
you ſpeak as an <hi>Accuſer of us, as guilty of refuſing to renounce ſuch Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
and ſubſcribe <hi>your implied conſent</hi> to <hi>our ſilencing for it;</hi> O that you
would be <hi>ſo charitable</hi> as to <hi>help our Converſion,</hi> and tell us <hi>what thoſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are.</hi> I have told the World at large <hi>my own</hi> and <hi>many other Principles
of Government and Obedience,</hi> in my <hi>ſecond Plea for Peace:</hi> I crave <hi>your

            </p>

If it be <hi>neceſſary,</hi> we muſt <hi>obey God,</hi> and <hi>diſobey man</hi> (as <hi>Groſthead</hi>

            <p>§. 15. And whereas you ſay, <hi>This I am certain is contrary to the Doctrine

change his dwelling: And in <hi>London,</hi> Lodgers may change frequently. If I
know thoſe called Puritans better than you, I muſt profeſs that I believe of
the two it is more the <hi>Preacher</hi> and his <hi>Preaching</hi> which maketh the difference
with them than the <hi>Liturgie.</hi> For my part I ſeldom hear any but very good
well ſtudied Sermons in the Pariſh Churches in <hi>London</hi> where I have been:
But moſt of them are more ſitted to well bred Schollars, or judicious hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
than to ſuch as need more Practical Subjects, and a more plain
familiar eaſie mode: And it is not your Reaſoning that will bring all Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
to the ſame Food; nor make the ſame Books ſerve every form.
I have always found that ſuch conformable Preachers, as were Mr. <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Fenner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whately,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Vſher,</hi> &amp;c. Were flockt after by
thoſe called <hi>Puritans,</hi> as much as the Non-conformiſts. But when they
find all together, 1. That the worſhip and the preaching is more ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their good, 2. And that their Souls have need of much other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral
help than publick. 3. And doubt of the calling of obtruded men,
no wonder if they prefer the other.</p>
            <p>§. 10. <hi>But you lay the ſtreſs on the</hi> Prohibition of the Law, which the
greatneſs or ſmallneſs of the Pariſh doth not make more or leſs Lawful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> God hath commanded all Chriſtians ordinarily to Learn and
Worſhip him under the Conduct of his Inſtitution, all Chriſtians grant
this. No man hath Power to forbid this: All Law that forbiddeth it is
of no Obligation. In a Pariſh where 10000, 20000, 40000, cannot
come within the Church to hear; if they have no other place to go to, they
muſt forbear all publick Learning and Worſhip: So that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of
your Words is, that if the Law forbid the moſt of the People all Publick
Learning and worſhip of God, it is there as unlawful for any to Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
againſt that Law as where there is no ſuch need. But 1. I again tell
you, Councils, Doctors and the Univerſal Church thought otherwiſe,
and abhor'd this Doctrine. 2. Why will you not give us one word of proof
but your naked Authority to prove ſuch Authority in the Magiſtrate, and
to ſatifie us what Rulers have it, and how far it reacheth: Hath the
King enabled Juſtices to depoſe him, or caſt down his Honour or Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative?
Hath God given Magiſtrates Authority to damn as many Souls
as they will; by keeping them from the means of knowledge, Faith and
Holineſs; and to forbid his Subjects to Worſhip God? Did <hi>Robert Groſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>
of <hi>Lincoln</hi> take this to be the greateſt Sin ſave Antichriſts, and do
you take it for an Act Authoriz'd? Is it unlawful to preach when forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
or worſhip God when forbidden, at <hi>Japon, Indoſtan, China, Turkie,
France,</hi> &amp;c. or only in <hi>England?</hi> and where?</p>
            <p>§. 11. Yet do you conclude [<q>I wonder a perſon of your ſagacity
ſhould think to ſatisfie your ſelf or others, by ſuch ſlight evaſions as theſe,
which ſcarce any of my Auditors, or Readers how mean ſo ever their
Capacities were, but could diſcern the weakneſs of them.</q>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. O pity then the frailty of human underſtanding! I get no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by it if I err but my great labour and the hazard of my Salvation
by Sin! It muſt needs be then againſt my will; and is none of my ſize to
be endured? How few Congregations are ſo happy as yours, if all your
Auditors are ſo much wiſer? but, 1. Be the thouſands of your Pariſh as
wiſe that <hi>hear you not?</hi> 2. How come ſome that I thought the wiſeſt that
I know of your Auditors, to ſay as I ſay, and lament your Caſe?</p>
            <p>Reader, you ſee here that it muſt be ſomewhat better than the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Teachers, that muſt guide and ſecure the peoples Faith. This
Reverend Man you ſee is moſt confident of the ſtrength of his Reaſons
and the ſlightneſs of mine: And I am ſo far paſt doubt on the other ſide,
as that I think he overthroweth all Religion, and ſeteth up Man in open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
againſt God: He may as well wonder that I take any thing to be of
Divine command: If all Publick Worſhip is ſinful, when forbidden, all
Private may be ſo too. <hi>Daniel</hi> may go to the Lyons: The Martyrs, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Councils, the Univerſal Church are all fooliſher than the meaneſt
of his Auditors. It's ſtrange that he can be ſure Gods Word is true; and
yet be ſo ſure that Mens Laws are above it, and may ſuſpend it; when yet
Mens Laws have no more ſtrength than Gods Laws give them.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>I believe that the ſpirit of God hath ſaid,</hi> Forſake not the aſſembling
of your <hi>ſelves together; know them that labour</hi> among you, and are over
you in the Lord, and admoniſh you, and eſteem them very highly in Love for
their work ſake, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 12. 13. <hi>That</hi> have ſpoken to you the word of God,
that watch for your Souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17, 24. <hi>How ſhall they hear without a
Preacher, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 10.</p>
            <p>2. I believe that where the Goſpel is hid, it is hid to them that are loſt:
And without knowledge the Heart is not good, and without Faith there
is no Salvation; and that it is Life Eternal to know God in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore they that forbid Men to hear and worſhip God Publickly,
forbid what God commandeth; and what is ordinarily needful to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>4. I believe that God is Almighty, the higheſt Univerſal King, and we
are all his Subjects; and the Scripture is his Law.</p>
            <p>5. I believe that there is no Power but from him, and that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
none againſt him, or his Laws, nor above him; and that Man is not
God; and that we muſt obey God rather than Man, when they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict.</p>
            <p>6. I believe that we muſt Love, Fear, and Serve God above all, and
Worſhip him according to his Word, and Honour his Name, and keep
holy his day, whoever forbid it: And that we muſt Love our Neighbour
as our ſelves, and help to ſave him as we may.</p>
            <p>7. I believe that I muſt love my ſelf, and ſeek the ſaving of my Soul,
though the Law forbad me.

in matter of right. I have told you what Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> ſaith of the
old Nonconformiſts forming Churches and Diſcipline: The Canon againſt
Conventicles, thence occaſioned, confuteth you: I have heard old Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
preach conſtantly publickly and privately againſt Law: I was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
with many of them: I never knew one of the mind you mention.
Moſt of them did preach themſelves that ever I heard of. If Mr. <hi>Rathband</hi>
had denied this, it had been no Proof. Mr. <hi>Aſh</hi> that is one of them there,
and Mr. <hi>Slator,</hi> both Preached at <hi>Bremicham</hi> long, Mr. <hi>Pateman</hi> at <hi>Moſeley,
&amp;c.</hi> Multitudes I could name. And yet a man that knew them not [<hi>is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that all the Nonconformiſts of former times had contrary Doctrine].</hi> I was
in 1638. and 1639. accounted one of them, though I uſed the Liturgie, which
moſt of them did not. I knew them better than you did. I have named ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in my firſt Plea, whoſe Practice proveth your great Error in that Hiſtory
where you ſay you are certain.</p>
            <p>§. 16. <hi>To your fourth Queſtion, An Obligation may be called</hi> [the
ſame], 1. Quoad terminum. 2. Quoad gradum. 3. Quoad modum obligandi.
4. Quoad realitatem.</p>
            <p>1. The Apoſtles had an obligation to aſſert <hi>Chriſts Reſurrection, as eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſes,</hi>
and to <hi>record his Doctrine and Laws infallibly in Scripture,</hi> and to
many things proper to them, which we have not; But we are obliged to the
work of our proper Office.</p>
            <p>2. The Apoſtles had greater obligations then we, by more immediate
Call, and ſpecial gift of the Spirit, and ſpecial Commiſſion and Command;
when ours are lower, but firmly binding us.</p>
            <p>3. The Apoſtles were obliged by <hi>Chriſts immediate miſſion,</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion,</hi>
and we but by his <hi>ordinary inſtituted means.</hi> But we are as <hi>truly</hi> bound to our
Duty, as they to theirs.</p>
            <p>2. And our Duty is to preach the Goſpel to thoſe without, and thoſe
within, according to our Power and opportunity, and to do the reſt of our
Office when we can. And though we are called to this without ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Inſpiration, Viſion, or Miracle, <hi>being called,</hi> we are as truly obliged, as
Parents, Husbands, Princes are to their Duties. It is not lawful to look
back when we have put our hands to <hi>Chriſts</hi> Plow, nor perfidiouſly to break
our Ordination Vow, nor to be negligent or treacherous Non-reſidents,
Pluraliſts, or ſlothful, nor to obey men more than God, though we were not
called immediately, or by Miracle.</p>
            <p>3. If the Magiſtrate appoint 20000 or 1000, or one half a Pariſh to be
excluded for want of Room and Teachers, it's ill ſuppoſed that the <hi>Goſpel</hi>
is <hi>truly and ſufficiently preached to them,</hi> to whom it is not preached at all.
And that it is Preached to <hi>others,</hi> proveth it not unneceſſary to <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. He that only <hi>readeth the Goſpel truly preacheth it:</hi> But Souls have need
of more Paſtoral help than bare <hi>true preaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 Ignorant wicked men in <hi>England</hi> can no more be ſaved than Heathens,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60845:13"/>
and have need of convincing, skilful, ſerious Preaching, as well as they.</p>
            <p>Your wondring at our allegation of the Apoſtle's words, and great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in ſo ſad a Cauſe, ſets me almoſt above wondring at any thing that
you ſay. <hi>Timothy</hi> was not called immediately by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who had that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Charge to preach <hi>in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon.</hi> The Univerſal Church long
judged otherwiſe of this caſe than you do: And not only Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> but
I think almoſt all Chriſtian Writers, Proteſtants and Papiſts, herein fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the ancient Church againſt you. The Nonconformiſts and others eaſily
grant what I ſaid before, That no <hi>one Apoſtle might be ſilenced</hi> by man; but
<hi>deſerving Miniſters, that do more hurt than good by their Miniſtry,</hi> may be
ſilenced by Chriſtian Magiſtrates: But not the Churches Edification op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned,
and 2000 faithful men ſilenced for not ſinning on pretence of a
power to judge or execute.</p>
            <p>§. 17. My Queſtion implieth, 1. That every man is moſt concerned for
his own Soul, and hath a <hi>prior</hi> obligation to ſecure it, which the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſpenſe with. 2. And, That every man hath nearer helps to know what
is good or hurtful to his Soul in doubtful Caſes, than the King that never
ſaw him hath. 3. And every man is like to love himſelf more than the King
loveth him. 4. And, That the King can no more bind him to hurt, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,
or endanger his Soul than his Health in Diet.</p>
            <p>But the King muſt give men all the helps that he can, and ſet up and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſufficient publick Teachers, and drive the ignorant and profane to hear
and learn, and promote Order and Concord, and hinder Unpeaceableneſs
and Diſorder by juſt means. But I have ſo fully declared the Magiſtrate's
Work in my Book of Concord, that I will not repeat it on this ſlight occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Separations muſt be prevented by right means. I had no Separatiſts in
a great Congregation for fourteen years, though many Sects ſtrongly and
often tempted them; no not one Separate Meeting all that time, and this
without force. What harm will it do me, or them, if my Hearers go from
me (as you ſay) to Dr. <hi>O?</hi> Our whole Country where I lived almoſt kept
Concord, and kept out Separation without the Magiſtrates conſtraint: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
is not eaſily confuted. Why then do you tell me of <hi>what I have
written againſt Separation?</hi> when you may ſee that I contradict none of this;
and when that <hi>writing,</hi> with my other Endeavours, ſerved without the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
Sword. I had three Juſtic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> always at hand that would have done for
me what they could at any time: I never deſired one act of force from
them. I allowed Quakers and Anabaptiſts publick Diſputes half a day
together: They never won one Man or Woman by it. Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his
great Parts, and Intereſt with his Flock and Kindred, could get but about
twenty four or leſs than thirty Anabaptiſts at <hi>Bewdeley:</hi> Almoſt all the reſt of
the Country was free, ſave a few inconſiderable Quakers at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and a
ſmall Village or two. The like was then done without force in many other
Counties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:60845:14"/>
§. 18. I told you how <hi>neceſſary</hi> the reſolving of the <hi>Queſtions</hi> which I
ſent you was to my <hi>Conviction:</hi> And I will <hi>not</hi> provoke you, by giving
that Name to <hi>your denyal of an Anſwer to them,</hi> which I think <hi>impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
will give it.</p>
            <p>I. Will other men believe that he doth well to <hi>deny</hi> me the <hi>definition</hi> of
that <hi>National Church</hi> which he writeth of, or to tell me <hi>whether he ſpeak of
a Lay or a Clergie Government,</hi> who writes his <hi>wonder</hi> that I ſhould ſay, <hi>I know
not what they mean by the National Church?</hi> How can I know whom to <hi>obey,</hi>
or when I <hi>ſeparate</hi> from the <hi>Form of Government,</hi> if I <hi>know</hi> not what it is?
Is this <hi>nothing</hi> to our Caſe? I take my ſelf to be more <hi>bound</hi> to obey the
<hi>King,</hi> than ſome <hi>Biſhops.</hi> You knew that you are here divided as for two
Church-Forms <hi>among</hi> your ſelves.</p>
            <p>II. Would any man that ever <hi>knew</hi> you have <hi>believed</hi> that ever <hi>you, even
you,</hi> ſhould have ſo <hi>preached</hi> and <hi>written</hi> for <hi>walking by the ſame Rule,</hi> and

<hi>ſwarving</hi> from <hi>that Rule;</hi> and when you have done, will by <hi>no intreaty</hi> be
prevailed with ſo much as to tell me <hi>what that Rule is, Divine</hi> or <hi>Humane,</hi>
the <hi>Statutes</hi> or the <hi>Canons,</hi> or what? yea, and <hi>think</hi> this <hi>impertinent</hi> to the

            <p>III. Was it not almoſt <hi>incredible,</hi> that when all this was <hi>ſaid</hi> and <hi>written</hi>

you make it not to be the ſame with <hi>[Diſobedience],</hi> contrary to the

            <p>IV. Is it not hard to have been <hi>believed,</hi> that when I and others are ſo

his printing it, add to my Obligation.</head>
            <p>§. 1. SIR, I apprehend much reaſon for my rendring you this following
Account, and ſome againſt it: And it was not eaſy to me quickly
to reſolve which did preponderate. It is eaſy to foreſee, that the Papiſts
will be glad that your Pen be turned from them, againſt thoſe whom they
are moſt againſt, and will laugh to ſee you diverted by ſuch a Scuffle. And
Satan, knowing our frailty, will hope to perſuade you, that all that is ſaid
againſt the weakneſs and error of your Writings, is againſt your <hi>Intereſt</hi> and
<hi>You,</hi> and ſo to ſtir up in you Paſſions and Thoughts directly contrary to Love
and Concord, and your own and the Publick Good: For with ſome he hath
unhappily ſucceeded to carry them from one Error to another, till he hath
brought them to the bitter hatred of their Confuters. And though I am not
ſo conſiderable as you, the Tempter diſdaineth not ſo low a Game, as to try
whether he can make your erroneous oppoſition a ſnare to me. When I ſaw
that you had begun this contentious way, it was eaſy to foreſee that Satan's
Cauſe was like to gain by it, and therefore I fear that he was much the cauſe.</p>
            <p>§. 2. And I remembred <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 14. <hi>The beginning of Strife is as when one
letteth out Water; therefore leave off Contention before it be meddled with.</hi> And
if you could not forbear beginning, you will hardly forbear when a neceſſary
Confutation ſeemeth to diſhonour you. <hi>Intereſt,</hi> you tell me, <hi>is ſtrong;</hi> and
it is eaſier to ſpeak againſt ſelfiſh Partiality than to overcome it. I never
perſonally provoked you, unleſs it was by confuting your Opinion, <hi>[That
no Form of Church-Government is of Divine Inſtitution]</hi> in my <hi>Chriſtian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory:</hi>
But as I named you not unleſs with honour, ſo your own accuſing of
that <hi>Irenicon</hi> of yours, (otherwiſe a very laudable Book) doth ſeem to juſtify
what I ſaid.</p>
            <p>§. 3. And I truly fear, leſt the opening of your Miſdoings ſhould rejoyce
the Papiſts, and encourage them to ſay, <hi>This is the Champion againſt the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:60845:15"/>
For I ſpeak from my heart in my uſual ſaying to them that mention
you, That this Kingdom is greatly beholden to you, for your ſeaſonable
and open defence of the Proteſtant Cauſe, at a time when—
And I am glad that you blame them that accuſe the Conformable Clergy of
yeildingneſs to <hi>Popery;</hi> which implieth, that no Bribe ſhall tempt you, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
or indirectly to ſerve that Cauſe, how ſtrongly ſoever it ſhall ſeem ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the Arm of Fleſh.</p>
            <p>§. 4. But yet in ſo publick a Cauſe, to be by your Accuſations ſo loudly
called to be accountable for my Doctrine and Practice, and that to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
and to an End eaſily diſcernable; and to refuſe to tender you or the
Magiſtrate any juſt ſatisfaction, when refuſing may make me and thouſands
more taken for <hi>Guilty,</hi> as by our (ſilent) Confeſſion, and conſequently the
Magiſtrate and you to incur a far greater Guilt, if you ſhould miſtake, this
ſeemeth to me a Crime not to be ventured on. When you have made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
neceſſary, I muſt anſwer: Elſe I ſhould have imitated <hi>Melancthon,</hi>
who oft boaſteth how much he had profited in Philoſophy, ſo that he could
ſilently let <hi>Illiricus, Oſiander,</hi> and ſuch others write and talk againſt him. If
poſſible, and as much as in us lieth, we ſhould live peaceably with all Men;
but when that which Men make impoſſible to us is no Duty, nor the want
of it a Sin, though an Affliction, the Aggreſſor doth make Defence a Duty.
And indeed I muſt be guilty of Scandal againſt you and others, if I deny you
ſatisfaction. Either I or you live in no ſmall Sin: Though Mr. <hi>Cheney</hi> think
otherwiſe, your words, and many ſuch others, ſhew, that you take our Courſe
to be a Sin intolerable. And if it ſhould prove that the Sin is yours, it could
not be ſmall, not only to do what we fear would be ſo bad in us, but alſo
to accuſe us ſo publickly to Magiſtrates, for not forbearing to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
when we were ſolemnly devoted to it; and pleading againſt the tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of it, when Non-toleration muſt be by Impriſonment, Baniſhment,
or Death, or ſuch Diſablement, againſt ſuch as believe they are bound to
preach while they are able.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Yet you can tell that they are <hi>ill Men</hi> that <hi>reported you ſtir up Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
to Perſecution.</hi> If that much will prove it, it's like they will be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened
to call you <hi>[an ill Man]</hi> too; for ſuch faults are ſo common, that
we may ſay as <hi>Seneca, [Quid ulcus leviter tangam omnes mali ſumus.]</hi> Indeed
they do not well that uſe that word, <hi>Perſecution;</hi> when your words are but
againſt <hi>Toleration,</hi> and the <hi>Church of</hi> England'<hi>s endeavour after Vniformity;</hi>
which are publickly known.</p>
            <p>§. 6. And no wonder if they are <hi>ill Men;</hi> when you are but <hi>finding out a
certain Foundation for a laſting Vnion, which is impoſſib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to be attained, till Men
are convinced of the evil and danger of the preſent Separation,</hi> &amp;c. That is,
you are but proving our Union impoſſible; for I have elſewhere proved,
that the Conviction which you ſpeak of is morally impoſſible, to become
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60845:15"/>
the terms of a common Union. It is impoſſible that we ſhould all be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that none of the Particulars impoſed are ſinful, which I have named
in my firſt Plea. And ſecondly, 'tis as impoſſible that we ſhould all be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that it is any more lawful for us to forſake our Miniſtry, to which we
were vowed in our Ordination, than to break our Oath of Allegiance, and
deny our Duty to the King. So that you do no worſe, than for Union, to
prove our Union impoſſible: and who is it that makes it ſo?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>§. 7. And this Impoſſibility you infer from this Principle,</hi> [That it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to ſeparate on a pretence of greater Purity, where there is an agreement in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and the ſubſtantial parts of Worſhip.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Was there not this Agreement in the caſe of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the
Council, who perſuaded the People to ſeparate from <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Baſilides?</hi>
And is not Union poſſible with ſuch as <hi>Cyprian</hi> and the <hi>Carthage</hi> Biſhops?</p>
            <p>2. We that are accuſed by you do not ſay that <hi>[we differ not from you in
Doctrine abſolutely:] viz.</hi> in the Doctrine about <hi>Dioceſan Church-Forms,</hi> or
their <hi>impoſing Power,</hi> we never denied this difference. But we ſay, <hi>[in the
Doctrine of the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles,]</hi> as diſtinct from the Form of Government, and
impoſed Abuſes, we agree. And ſuppoſe that we agreed in ſuch Doctrine
and Worſhip with a Church, that yet held, only that the <hi>Pope is</hi> jure divino
<hi>the Conſtitutive Vicarious Head of the Vniverſal Church,</hi> and would take none
that confeſs it not, for Chriſtians, were it a Sin to ſeparate from that
Church?</p>
            <p>3. Suppoſe that Uſurpers ſhould thruſt out the Biſhops and you, and make
themſelves our Paſtors againſt our wills, is it unlawful to ſeparate from
them, though they agree with us in Doctrine and Worſhip? And if the
Churches and Councils have been in the right, which for 700 yea 1000
years held that the calling of a Biſhop was null that had not the Clergies
Election, and the Peoples Election or Conſent. I need not tell you how
far this will reach.</p>
            <p>4. What if a Church that you agree with in Doctrine and Worſhip will
not receive you, unleſs you will deliberately profeſs or ſubſcribe an Untruth,
or covenant againſt ſome Duty, or commit a known Sin; is it intolerable
for you rather to ſeparate from them than to ſin? And muſt we have no
Union till we can in all things think as you do?</p>
            <p>§. 8. I think you need not expect the Cenſures of the chief <hi>makers of our
Diviſions:</hi>
And as to the <hi>inferiour Sectaries,</hi> if you are a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> it will be an
<hi>unbloody</hi> one. You well admoniſh us in the end, not to complain too much
when we are ſilenc'd, impoveriſhed, and impriſoned: The counſel is good,
But for the Dean of <hi>Pauls, &amp;c.</hi> that is deſervedly loved and honoured by us
all whom you thus deal with, and by thoſe great Men whoſe eſteem he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
more valueth, while he liveth in this Plenty and Honour, to call
himſelf <hi>[a Sacrifice]</hi> if a few poor Men ſay, <hi>He wrongeth them,</hi> when he plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60845:16"/>
againſt the Magiſtrates enduring them, or againſt their Judgment that
think they ſhould be endured, Doth not this ſeem to another greater tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
than for me only to ſay <hi>de facto, I was laid in the Common Gaol, and fain
to make away my Goods and Library to ſave them from Diſtreſs?</hi>] But ſo much
to your Epiſtle: The Sermon followeth.</p>
            <p>§. 9. And what could a Man have deſired more to end the main differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
among us, than the ſerious conſideration of your Text in its very
plain import and drift.</p>
            <p>1. That the Text ſpeaketh for Unity and Concord is paſt queſtion.
2. And that it ſpeaketh both to the Paſtors and the Flocks. 3. And that
it ſpeaketh to <hi>all Chriſtians,</hi> though of various degrees of Attainment:
And therefore requireth all to live in Concord that are Chriſtians; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
other differences. 4. All the doubt is, what is meant by the
ſame <hi>Canon or Rule?</hi> And there are theſe ſeveral Expoſitions pleaded
for.</p>
            <p>1. That by <hi>the ſame Rule</hi> is meant only the General Concord, <hi>idem velle &amp;
nolle;</hi> to agree, and live in <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>to mind the ſame things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That by the <hi>ſame Rule</hi> is meant the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity received
by all Chriſtians; which they ſhould have concordantly practiſed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
other differences.</p>
            <p>3. That by the <hi>ſame Rule</hi> is meant the Doctrine which the Apoſtles had
concordantly delivered to all the Churches.</p>
            <p>4. That it was the Churches Creed which is ſuppoſed then to be in uſe,
as the Symbol of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>5. That it is the Canonical Scriptures, in the times that they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and delivered to the Churches.</p>
            <p>6. That it is the Example of S. <hi>Paul</hi> before deſcribed, or the matter
of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that is, to hold faſt what he had attained, and preſs forwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the heavenly perfection, by deſire, hope, diligence, and patience.</p>
            <p>7. Some take the [<hi>one Rule</hi>] to be [<hi>the end</hi> as it is to be attained by the
<hi>means;</hi>] that is, the <hi>common good</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and furtherance of the
Goſpel and our Salvation: <hi>Let all be done to edification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. Some ſay that it is the great Duty of Love which is made the Rule for
our undetermined actions; or, that the fundamental duties are made a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
to the Superſtructures, as it ſeemeth to be meant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15, 16. And
by Chriſt, <hi>Go learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy and not Sacrifice.</hi> To
tell you <hi>which</hi> and <hi>how many</hi> of theſe I take to be meant in the Text, and <hi>why,</hi>
is none of the work which you call me to; but to tell you, that which-ever
of theſe it is, or if all theſe, we fully conſent: All theſe Canons we muſt
all walk by.</p>
            <p>9. But ſome ſay, that by the <hi>ſame Rule</hi> is meant the <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom</hi>
of the <hi>Vniverſal Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:60845:16"/>
10. And ſome, that it is the Canons of the Biſhops in General Councils;
and under them, in National or Provincial Councils.</p>
            <p>11. And ſome tell us, that the Rule of Chriſtian concord is [<hi>Obedience to
the Biſhops of all the World</hi> (or Univerſal Church) <hi>who are a College Governing</hi>
(not only <hi>diviſim &amp; per partes,</hi> in their ſeveral Precincts, but) unitedly as
<hi>One</hi> Regent College, ordinarily <hi>per literas formas,</hi> and by General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
when they ſit.</p>
            <p>12. And ſome tell us, that it is the Law or Will of the Civil Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
which is this Rule.</p>
            <p>As to theſe four laſt Rules we muſt put in our Exceptions. As to the
9<hi>th,</hi> the Traditions and Cuſtoms then in uſe were Apoſtolical Inſtitutions,
and ſo are coincident with ſome of the former: But other Traditions and
Cuſtoms we take not for this Rule.</p>
            <p>And as to the tenth, we give Councils, though wrongfully called <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
their due honour; as we do to inferiour Councils, and every particular
Paſtor in his place: but take not this for the Rule here mentioned.</p>
            <p>And as to the 11th, we know of no ſuch Government in being.</p>
            <p>And as to the 12th, it was not then exiſtent, and therefore could not be
that meant in the Text: But we take our ſelves bound to obey Magiſtrates,
as we have elſewhere at large explained and profeſſed.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, either you think it is a <hi>Divine</hi> or a <hi>Humane Rule</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> which is
here meant, or both: If a <hi>Divine,</hi> we ſhall not differ from you of any thing,
unleſs it be of the meaning of it. If a <hi>Humane,</hi> either it is an act of true
Power received from God, or not: If not, you will grant us that it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
us not as this Rule in queſtion: If yea, then we agree that we are to
obey it: So that all that will be uſeful to our Conviction will be, 1. That
you prove the Perſons authorized to their Office (and of our Magiſtrates
there is no doubt) 2. And that they have authority to make all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
and Laws, which you call the Rule. And without this your labour is
all loſt to us.</p>
            <p>§. 10. But which of all theſe it is that you take for the Rule meant in your
Text, we muſt conjecture: 1. You well ſay, <hi>p.</hi> 11. [<hi>It was ſuch a Rule which
they very well knew, which they had given them before.</hi>] Therefore it was none
that was not then in being, but to be made by Biſhops afterward. And,
<hi>p.</hi> 14. you ſeem to include the Canon made <hi>Acts</hi> 15. whatever the ſenſe of
this Text is, we willingly alſo ſtand to that; and to the Holy Ghoſts deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that nothing be impoſed but <hi>neceſſary things:</hi> And, <hi>p.</hi> 15. I find you
ſay [<hi>that the preſerving the Peace of the Church, and preventing Separation, was
the great meaſure according to which the Apoſtle gave his directions.</hi>] And this
is all that I can find of your determination <hi>what is that Rule.</hi> And if <hi>Peace</hi>
be the Rule, we all agree with you in declaiming againſt the violation of it.
But is there no more in your Application?</p>
            <p>§. 11. I remember it is ſaid in the Life of <hi>Joh. Bugenhagius Pomeranus</hi> (the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60845:17"/>
Paſtor of the Church in <hi>Wittenberge,</hi> and the Presbyter that ordained the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops

But I had rather ſtretch my Obedience to the utmoſt conſiſtent with Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

            <p>§. 12. It is certain, that by [<hi>the ſame Rule</hi>] is not meant, 1. Any Rule
that tied Chriſtians to ſubſcribe or declare that there is nothing in our three
Books, (Liturgy, Ordination, and Articles) contrary to the Word of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
For none of them were then extant, nor are they 200 years old. 2. Nor any
Rule that tied them to any one humane Liturgy which all the Churches i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

that impoſed on them any dubious unneceſſary Opinions, Covenants, or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices;
nor, in a word, our <hi>Conformity,</hi> or any like it.</p>
            <p>This is eaſily proved: 1. Becauſe the Rule which they were all to wall

for Separation. 2. Nor Commnion under diſtinct Presbyters or Biſhops. 3. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſuppoſe neither under diſtinct Princes, or Ariſtocracies in Cities, as ſuch.
4. Nor under diſtinct Laws (meerly as ſuch) of the ſame Prince. 5. Nor diſtinct
in allowed or indifferent accidents. Why any of theſe ſhould be called <hi>Separation</hi> I
know not, unleſs as the word doth ſignifie but Diverſity or Diſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Do you take Separation here in the ſame ſence as before and after; or
Equivocally? If Equivocally, why did you not tell us what you here meant; beſides
the difference of Subjects: If univocally, then</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 4. Is not the Separation of whole Churches much worſe than of ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
from one Church, when it is upon unwarrantable cauſe or reaſons? If one
Church unjuſtly renounce Communion with another whole Church, as no true Church,
or as Heretical; I think that it is done by a <hi>whole Church</hi> againſt a <hi>whole
Church,</hi> makes it worſe.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you mean, that for two National Churches to have two Kings
is not unlawful. No doubt of that: But to what purpoſe is it? Or is it
that two National Churches may have different Accidents of Worſhip or
Diſcipline? And ſo may two <hi>Dioceſan</hi> or Pariſh-Churches in our Nation,
if the King pleaſe at leaſt.</p>
            <p>§. 15. <hi>You add:</hi> Which according to the Scripture, Antiquity, and Reaſon,
have a juſt Right and Power to govern and reform themſelves. Anſ. <hi>Have not all</hi>
Dioceſan <hi>Churches power to govern and reform themſelves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Government is of various ſpecies: Only the King, or <hi>ſumma Poteſtas Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilis,</hi>
hath Power to govern and reform by his <hi>Species</hi> of Government:
But every Biſhop may govern and reform his Church, as a Biſhop; as every
Maſter may his Family as a Maſter, and every Man himſelf as a Man. It's
a ſtrange Man, Family, or Church, that hath not power to govern and
reform it ſelf, though not Regal Power. Though Kings have Power, they
have not God's Power; and all Power that is <hi>Humane,</hi> is not <hi>Regal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 16. <hi>Serm.</hi> [By whole Churches I mean the Churches of ſuch Nations,
which upon the decay of the Roman Empire reſumed their Right of Government to
themſelves, and upon their owning Chriſtianity, incorporated into one Chriſtian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
under the ſame common Ties and Rules of Order and Government.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. And had not thoſe as good right that were not under the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire? (as <hi>Abaſia, &amp;c.</hi>) 2. Did the Churches under the <hi>Roman</hi> Power
exerciſe their great diverſity in Liturgies and other accidents of Worſhip
without right? Had not they a right to govern and reform themſelves va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
as they did? 3. <hi>Chriſtian Societies</hi> are of divers <hi>ſpecies:</hi> Do you mean
Chriſtian Civil Societies, Kingdoms, free Cities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Churches? Or do
you take a Chriſtian Kingdom and a Chriſtian Church for the ſame, as the
<hi>Eraſtians</hi> do? If ſo, I ſuppoſe half the Conformiſts will be againſt you, as
well as I. At leaſt you muſt confeſs, that if <hi>de nomine</hi> a Chriſtian Kingdom
<hi>quaſi tale</hi> may be called a Church, it is equivocally; and that there is a ſort of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60845:18"/>
               <hi>Chriſtian Churches</hi> which are of another Conſtitution. Far were the Chriſtian
Biſhops for 1300 years from believing that a Prince or Civil Power was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
to a Chriſtian Church, or that a Church in the common ſence was
not conſtituted of another ſort of Regent part, that had the Power of the
Keyes. Two <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Governours make two <hi>ſpecies</hi> of the Societies, if they
are not ſubordinate, but prime conſtitutive Parts: But the Prince and the
Paſtor are two <hi>ſpecies,</hi> well opened among many by Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
And verily if you Conformiſts be divided among your ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the very Conſtitutive Rector of a Chriſtian Church, you differ more
from each other than we do from the generality of you. 4. And what be
the <hi>common Tyes</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Order</hi> which you mean? Are theſe notifying
Terms for a Definition? 1. There are divine unalterable Rules of Order
and Government, and there are humane Rules about alterable Accidents.
2. There are Rules made by Contract (ſuch as <hi>Grotius</hi> thinks Canons are),
and Rules made by Governours, which are binding Commands or Laws.
3. There are Rules made by Civil Governours to be enforced by the
Sword, and Rules made only by Eccleſiaſtical Paſtors to be executed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the Power of the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Keys.</hi> Do you mean all theſe? Or which
of them?</p>
            <p>1. All Chriſtian Churches are tied by the common Divine Rule; and
is not conſent to that enough to make a Church? 2. Churches of various
Nations may be under one Humane Rule of Agreement or Contract.
3. The ſame Princes may give divers Rules about Accidents to the
Churches of one Kingdom, and alſo the ſame Rule for ſome Accidents
to divers Churches under them, who differ in other great things:
And doth agreement in thoſe Accidents do more to make them <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Church,</hi> than their difference in Integrals to make them many? 4. Princes
may do as the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours long did; leave the Biſhops in Councils
to make their own Rules by conſent, and make no common Imperial Rule
for them: Are they ever the leſs One Church? 5. The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire
and Councils both left the ſeveral Biſhops to make Rules for Liturgies and
other Accidents for their ſeveral Churches: Were they therefore the leſs one
National Church?</p>

Church,</hi> and a <hi>whole Pariſh Church,</hi> as well as a <hi>whole National Church:</hi>
And what the Power is, and what the Rule of Order muſt be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Laws of Princes or Prelates, and whether about Eſſential, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrals,
or Accidents, and what Accidents, whether all; or many,
or few, and which, that muſt make a Church to be <hi>One whole Church,</hi> you
never tell us. An Infidel Prince or a Heretick Prince may give the ſame
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60845:18"/>
Rule of Order to his Chriſtian Subjects in a whole Kingdom; Is he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the conſtitutive Church-Head? Or will you ſay, as your Mr. <hi>Rich. Hooker</hi>
doth, <hi>That if he be the Head of a Chriſtian Church, it is neceſſary that he be a
Chriſtian?</hi> To tell us of [<hi>Common Ties and Rules of Order</hi>] and never
tell us what thoſe Ties and Rules are, may ſerve your Ends, but not my
Edification.</p>
            <p>§. 17. But I remember your <hi>Irenicum</hi> learnedly maintaineth, that
God hath inſtituted no one Form of Church-Government as neceſſary:
And if ſo, then not a National Church-Form. And is it not a <hi>whole
Church, if it be without a Form,</hi> which not God but Man is the Author
of? Then God made or inſtituted no ſuch thing as a <hi>whole Church.</hi>
Then it is a humane Creature. Then why may not Man make yet more
Forms; and multiply, and make and unmake, as he ſeeth cauſe; and
ſeveral Countries have ſeveral Forms. And, <hi>forma dat nomen &amp; eſſe:</hi> And
if God made not any <hi>whole Church,</hi> we ſhould be acquainted who they
be (that were not a Church) that had Power to make the firſt Church-Form?
and who hath the Power ever ſince? and how it is proved? and
how it cometh to be any great matter to ſeparate from a Church-Form
which God never made? and whether humane Church-Forms be
not eſſential and conſtitutive Cauſes of the Churches; and whether every
commanded Oath, Subſcription, Declaration, Office or Ceremony, be
an eſſential part of this Church-Form? And there be as many Church-Forms
and Species, as there be Orders, Liturgies and Ceremonies. And
all theſe Differences in the ſame Kingdom conſtitute ſo many Schiſms and
Separations.</p>
            <p>§. 18. Do you take all the Chriſtians in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire to be
one National Church, or not? If not, then one Head or Humane Law is
not neceſſary to the being or Government of a Church, nor is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that it be National. And do you think that the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches
have not Power to govern and reform themſelves, though they be not
a National Church? Why did <hi>Paul</hi> write to <hi>Corinth</hi> (as <hi>Clemens</hi> alſo
did) and to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the other ſix,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2, <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. to reform themſelves, if they had not Power to do it? But
if all the Chriſtians under the <hi>Turk</hi> be one National Church; then it is
either becauſe they have one Civil Head, or one Eccleſiaſtical Head.
Not the latter, for they have none ſuch; though the Biſhops of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
have ſome <hi>Primacy</hi> by their old Canons and Cuſtoms. Not the
former, for an Infidel cannot be an eſſential part of a Chriſtian Church (as
a conſtitutive Head is)</p>

§. 19. And the Churches in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire before <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> were
true Churches of Chriſt's Inſtitution, and they had power to govern and
reform themſelves; and yet they had no humane Conſtitutive Head, Regal
or Sacerdotal, though they had a Civil Heathen Governour, which was an
extrinſick accidental Head.</p>
            <p>It is ſo contrary to all Sence and Religion, that either a Man as a Man, or
a Family, or a Church as ſuch, ſhould have no power to govern and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it ſelf, that I muſt needs judg that while you ſpeak confuſedly, you
meant only a Regal or Supreme Civil Power, which yet is <hi>totâ ſpecie</hi> diſtinct

No doubt but a Church is ſo equivocal a word that many ſort of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
or Societies may be ſo called. I have told you of divers Sences, in
which we are called a <hi>Church National,</hi> firſt <hi>Plea, pag.</hi> 251, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Either a
<hi>Chriſtian Kingdom,</hi> or elſe the Churches of a Heathen or a Chriſtian King,
as aſſociated by agreement, may be called a <hi>National Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What if they be united in one Kingdom, of a Heathen, <hi>Mahometan,</hi>
or <hi>Arrian</hi> King, and governed by his Regal Authority, under the <hi>ſame
Rules</hi> which he ſets them? Is this it that you mean in your Deſcription?
A King as ſuch is not an Eccleſiaſtick Perſon, and therefore is not an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
part of a Church, unleſs as it is equivocally ſo called. And is it
his Civil Laws for Church-Government that you mean, or the Clergies
Canons, or God's Laws? The <hi>Greeks</hi> under the <hi>Turk</hi> are under one Prince,
and governed by the ſame Civil Authority and Laws, and alſo are under
one Patriarch, and by the Princes toleration are governed by the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick
Authority and Laws, of another Species: If you confound theſe
two Species, or tell us not which you mean in your Definition, it tendeth
not to Edification.</p>
            <p>3. And what if they be under divers Kings (as the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> and
<hi>Greeks</hi> were,) and yet ruled by one Eccleſiaſtick Authority and Law? why
may not they alſo be called <hi>One Church,</hi> as the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> are now called part
of the <hi>Greek Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. And why might it not be called the <hi>Lydian</hi> Church while it was a
part of the Empire, as the <hi>African</hi> and other Countries were? But what is
all this <hi>de nomine</hi> to the Controverſy? All grant that the Civil Power muſt
be obeyed in their place, and the Church-power in theirs.</p>

            <p>7. But Sir, do you not confeſs, even in your <hi>Iroenicon,</hi> where you main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that no Form of Church-Government is of Divine command: 1. That
God hath commanded that there be <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> ordinarily uſed for his
VVorſhip. 2dly. And that Paſtors are to be the Guides and chief Managers
of this VVorſhip. 3dly, And that they ſhould be alſo their Teachers.
4thly, And that they govern them by their Keys. And if all this be true,
then ſuch <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> are of Divine Inſtitution; not ſuch as are aſſociated
only for VVorſhip, but for <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip, and holy Living,</hi> under the
Teaching and Conduct of their Paſtors. If you deny that ſuch <hi>Churches</hi>
as we call <hi>Particular</hi> are of Divine Inſtitution, we have often proved it,
though few Chriſtians deny it, or need any proof.</p>
            <p>And it is ſo oft repeated in the Books which you cite, that I muſt
ſuppoſe you know it, though you ſeem to diſſemble it, that the Definition
which I give of ſuch a Church doth make the <hi>Terminus</hi> to be (not the
whole Church meeting at one time and place, but) <hi>perſonal, preſential
Communion</hi> in Doctrine, VVorſhip, and Holy Converſation, as diſtinct from
abſent Communion by Delegates or Letters only. Your Pariſh is aſſociated
for ſuch <hi>perſonal preſential Communion,</hi> and yet they meet not all at once,
but ſome one day, and ſome another, and ſome not at all, which is a fault
<hi>in exercitio,</hi> but overthroweth not the being of the <hi>Church,</hi> while it is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
preſent Communion</hi> which they aſſociate for and profeſs, and that ſtates
the <hi>Church-relation.</hi> And they meet not all in one place, but ſome in the

to have <hi>per vices</hi> ſometime <hi>perſonal Communion</hi> in the Pariſh-Church.</p>
            <p>If you would have told us plainly, that Pariſh-Churches are no Churches,
or that God never ordained ſuch ſingle Churches, as are aſſociated for <hi>perſonal
Communion</hi> in Preſence, in Doctrine, VVorſhip, and Converſation, which
have their proper Paſtors, we ſhould have known what to ſay to you. But
if you deny not ſuch, (which we undertake fully to prove) plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
their <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> VVorth, and Privileges, and we ſhall readily next

            <p>If you ſay that you mean the Laws of <hi>Lawful</hi> Governours. I anſwer,
1. The Papiſts take the Pope for their lawful Governour: 2. If a Uſurper get
Poſſeſſion (as K. <hi>Stephen</hi> and many others,) is the National Church then
dead or null? 3. There is no mention of <hi>lawful</hi> in your Definitions.</p>
            <p>4. But though you will not tell us whether you mean <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Humane</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:60845:22"/>
               <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rules,</hi> yet I may confidently conjecture that it is <hi>Humane</hi> you mean:
for elſe, 1. I am of the ſame National Church that you are; yea if I prove
that I am more conformable to God's Laws than you, and ſuch as you, I ſhall
prove that it will be a harder queſtion whether you are of the Church of <hi>Eng.</hi>
than whether I am. 2. And you might know that ſuch a Church we no more
deny than you do (at leaſt) 3. But then it can be but <hi>ſincere</hi> (not perfect)
Obedience to God's Laws and Rules, which muſt prove one to be of this
Church; or elſe no Man is of it. And then you muſt ſhew us whether a
miſtake in as ſmall a matter as Meat and Drink, or a Ceremony, or Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
Form, or Dioceſan order, do cut one off from that Church. If
yea, than how much more would ſuch Conformity to ſin do it? which we
fear.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing that you mean <hi>Humane Laws.</hi> 5. Why may not <hi>Divine</hi>
Laws make a Church? If Humane Laws were neceſſary <hi>ad bene eſſe,</hi> the
Chriſtians that I have read and converſt with, think that they are not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the <hi>Being</hi> of a Church <hi>in ſenſu famoſiore;</hi> why then ſhould they be in
the Definition, and only they?</p>
            <p>6. But the difficulty recurreth as to <hi>Humane Laws,</hi> which of them are
neceſſary to the <hi>Being</hi> of the Church: For your Definition diſtinguiſhed not:
The King hath great and excellent Laws which we all conform to: Doth
not our Conformity to theſe ſeem to prove us of the National Church,
though we conform not to your Formalities and Oaths and Ceremonies? Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Obedience ſerveth to continue men Subjects to the King: It is not
every Drunkeneſs, or Oath, or Fornication, much leſs the miſs of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
or Ceremony, that makes a Man a Rebel or an Outlaw: Why
then ſhould the refuſal of a Prelates Subſcription or Formality unchurch a
ſound and honeſt Chriſtian?</p>
            <p>7. And if the humane Laws and Rules which you mention (what ever
you mean by them) be ſubordinate to God's Laws, and ſo be honeſt, good and
obligatory, why ſhould they cut off thoſe from the Church which Chriſt's
<hi>Laws</hi> cut not off; yea, which Chriſt receiveth and commandeth us to receive?
<hi>Receive him, for God receiveth him:</hi> and, <hi>receive him as Chriſt receiveth us,</hi>
(notwithſtanding our Infirmities) were good reaſonings in St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which I prefer before any Biſhops that I know.</p>
            <p>8. And a Man of leſs Acquaintance or Wit than you, cannot be ignorant,
what abundance of Differences there are among your ſelves. I have named
you no ſmall number in my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d. Plea: ſome of you are hot againſt that which
is called <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and ſome hot for it: ſome are for Biſhops and
Presbyters being of one Order, and ſome of divers: all are not of the
mind of the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford</hi> that wrote <hi>Naked Truth:</hi> ſome (even Biſhops)
think that the damnatory part of <hi>Athanaſius'</hi>s Creed is not approved by
Conformity: others, think that it is all to be approved: A multitude ſuch
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60845:23"/>
differences there are among your ſelves: And why ſhould not this as much
unchurch ſome of you, if it be [<hi>being under the ſame Laws</hi>] that maketh
you one Church, as the forbearing of a Declaration of Aſſent and Conſent,
or of a Surplice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. Eſpecially tell us, whether the Conformiſt's difference about the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive
Regent Part</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſome being for <hi>one ſpecies,</hi> and
ſome for <hi>another,</hi> do not plainly make them to be of <hi>two diſtinct Churches</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> and further different from each other than we are from any part. We
juſtly ſay the Papiſts, who are for <hi>two ſpecies</hi> of Soveraigns, ſome for the
<hi>Pope,</hi> and ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r a general Council, are plainly of two Churches: for the
regent part is eſſential. And I am ſure that one part of the moſt Eminent
Diſputers for the Church of <hi>England</hi> and Conformity, ſay that the King is
the <hi>Extraneous</hi> Civil Governour, but the Biſhops are the <hi>Conſtitutive Eſſential
Internal Governours</hi> of the Church as a Church; and that if the Biſhops
command the uſe of one Tranſlation, Verſion, Metre, Liturgie, and the King
another, we are to obey the Biſhops, and not the King: And that the efficient
cauſe of a National Church, is the Biſhops Agreement among themſelves
to aſſociate into ſuch a Church. And others ſay, that it is the King and
his Laws, that are the efficient of ſuch a Church, and are to be obeyed in
matter of the Circumſtances of Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before the Biſhops. Can you
prove that this difference between the Conformiſts, about the very Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive
Regent Power, is not greater than Mens differences about a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
or Form? and doth not more to make them to be of two Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches?</p>
            <p>10. If all this confuſed ſtir be but about <hi>a Chriſtian Kingdom,</hi> be it known
to you that we take ſuch to be of <hi>Divine Command:</hi> And if you know it not,
or diſſemble it, after I have ſaid ſo much of it, in the firſt Plea, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
I cannot help that, <hi>viz.</hi> if you will talk publickly againſt what you
know, or know not when told, becauſe you will not know. But I have
there largly told you, what the Power of Princes about Church matters is,
which if you will not read, I will not repeat.</p>
            <p>11. Your Words [<hi>Laws and Rules</hi>] would induce one to think that
you joyned the <hi>Kings Laws</hi> and the <hi>Biſhop's Canons</hi> together in your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as the bond of U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ity. If ſo, is it two ſorts of Governours, (by the
Swo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and by the Word, Magiſtrates and Paſtors) which you take for
the conſtitutive regent parts of the Church? If ſo, then either in Coo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

two Species in Coalition ſhould make one Head, unleſs both were in
the Kings as <hi>Perſona Mixta.</hi> both Lay and Clergie, as ſome affirm him to
be like <hi>Melchiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>deck:</hi> But this both King and Clergie diſown. Nor can the
ſecond be, becauſe a ſubordinate Power is not eſſential to the whole body
politick, but only the ſupreme. And the Magiſtracy &amp; Miniſtry are coordinate
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60845:23"/>
Species, both depending immediately on God, and Subordinate
Mutually only <hi>Secundum quid:</hi> Nor is the Legiſlative Power in
<hi>England</hi> any other than one, which is in the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi>
conjunct. The Biſhops Canons are not Laws <hi>Ejuſdem
Speciei;</hi> till the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> make them ſuch. If this
be your Judgment, there are I think but few <hi>Conformiſts</hi> of
your mind.</p>
            <p>12. I muſt Conjecture therefore by your words, That the
<hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> which you define the Church by, are the <hi>Laws</hi>
of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament;</hi> and that it is the Civil Chriſtian Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
that you take for the Conſtitutive Head of that National
Church which you plead for; or elſe I know not what to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.
And if this be your Meaning, I add to what is ſaid:
1. <hi>Eraſtians</hi> have hitherto been diſtaſted by the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and I
doubt they will by this take you for ſomewhat worſe.</p>
            <p>2. What doth your <hi>National Church</hi> differ from a <hi>Chriſtian
Kingdom,</hi> which we deny not?</p>
            <p>3. Do you think there is no other Species of a <hi>Church,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that which is Conſtituted by the Chriſtian Magiſtrate as
Head?</p>
            <p>1. All the Chriſtian World, as far as I can learn by Hiſtory
(no conſiderable part excepted) have been in all Ages, and to
this Day are of another mind. And who then is the great
<hi>Nonconformiſt</hi> and <hi>Separatiſt,</hi> You or I; if this be your mind?</p>
            <p>2. The Magiſtracy, and Paſtoral Office are of different Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
Therefore the Churches Conſtituted by their Regency
are of different Species.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Conſtantines</hi> words have hitherto been commonly received,
That He (and ſo Chriſtian <hi>Kings</hi>) was <hi>Biſhop</hi> without the
<hi>Church,</hi> and the proper <hi>Biſhop</hi> within: that is, That he was the
Governour of the Church, by the Sword, as the <hi>King</hi> is of
all Scholars, Phyſitians, Families, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not the Governour
by the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Keys;</hi> as the <hi>King</hi> is not a School-Maſter,
Phyſitian, or the formal Specifying Governour of School, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
Family, as ſuch. Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> of <hi>Subjection,</hi> moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
openeth the difference, and I think Chriſtians commonly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to it; between the Office of Governing by the <hi>Sword;</hi>
and by the <hi>Word;</hi> even about the Church it ſelf.</p>
            <p>4. Chriſt ſettled immediately the Paſtoral Office, and did not
leave it to Princes to make it: And He ſettled Churches under
the Paſtors, when there were no Chriſtian Princes; And when
the <hi>Emperours</hi> became Chriſtians, they never took themſelves
to be the intrinſick Conſtitutive Rectors of the Churches, but
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60845:24"/>
Accidental Heads, as is aforeſaid. And all the Councils, and
their Canons fully ſhew, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> were ſtill of this mind.
And our greateſt Defenders of the Power of Princes, <hi>Bilſon,
Andrews, Buck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ridge, Spalatenſis,</hi> &amp;c. were of the ſame mind,
and aſcribe to them no more.</p>
            <p>5. Elſe Heathen, and Infidel Princes might be Eſſential to
the Church in the Goſpel-Notion: For they are the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of it by the Sword, and may poſſibly by the Counſel
of Chriſtians, make them as good Laws as many Chriſtian
Princes do. <hi>Julian</hi> made no great Change of the Church-Laws.</p>
            <p>But I Labour in vain, in proving that there is a <hi>Sacerdotal</hi>
or <hi>Clergy-Church-Form</hi> or <hi>Species;</hi> for I ſuppoſe you cannot
deny it; and if you do, few others will. I ſuppoſe it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>National Form,</hi> which you take to be Conſtituted by a
Lay-Head. But few Chriſtians will deny, That the Sacerdotal
or Clergy-Form of a particular Church, is of Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that Men have not power to deſtroy that Form; or
change the Office there, Inſtituted by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Though
the Forms of <hi>Aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Patriarchal,</hi> are judged by very many, to be of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Invention: And what Man may make, Man on good
Reaſon may unmake or alter. But if you Grant us the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Form before mentioned; I ſhall Grant you that a <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Church</hi> is alſo of Divine Command; if you mean but a
Chriſtian Kingdom. But when one Form is Denominated from
the <hi>Paſtoral Office</hi> related to the Flock, and the other from the
<hi>Magiſtrates Office:</hi> What hath a Man that can underſtand the
State of the Controverſy, to do here; but to ſhew what is
the <hi>Paſtoral Office</hi> towards the Church, and what is the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates?</hi>
For ſure they are not the ſame. And yet becauſe that
it is the <hi>Paſtoral Form,</hi> which the word [<hi>Church</hi>] denoteth in
the ſtrict and uſual Chriſtian Senſe; Our Sovereignes in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to avoid the <hi>Papiſts</hi> Exceptions, have forſaken the Title
of [<hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>] leſt they ſhould ſeem to claim a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive

(as you ſeem) you <hi>Eſſentiate</hi> your <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> by a
<hi>Lay-Ruler,</hi> and his Laws, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and the Laws made
by him for Religious Government; the People that you accuſe
are no Separatiſts, though they Separate from the <hi>Dioceſanes;</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:60845:25"/>
becauſe they hold this <hi>Lay-Communion;</hi> that is, though they
are not perfectly Obedient, they are Subjects of the <hi>Lay-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,</hi>
and ſo Members of the Kingdom, which is the <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal-Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. And as to your <hi>Lay-Communion</hi> here ſpoken of, <hi>So far as
it is Lawful,</hi> where you have Preach'd or Written for it once,
I think, I have done it many times: I ſhall be far from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
you in that.</p>
            <p>§. 30. <hi>Sermon p.</hi> 20. [I will not ſay, there hath been a great
deal of Art uſed to confound theſe two (and it is eaſy to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to what purpoſe it is.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I have not Art enough well to reconcile your <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi>
and your <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> which intimateth an Affirmation:
If you will not ſay ſuch Art <hi>was uſed;</hi> how can you intimate
[<hi>to what purpoſe it's uſed.</hi>] Can you tell ſo eaſily <hi>why</hi> it <hi>was
done,</hi> and not tell that indeed it <hi>was done</hi> at all? But perhaps
you <hi>can tell,</hi> though you <hi>will not.</hi> I would fain know why:
No Man that Reads your Words, can well believe that it is
through the redundancy of your kindneſs.</p>
            <p>2. Forgive this Truth: Of all Men that have Written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Nonconformity,</hi> I remember few that may, worſe than
you ſpeak againſt <hi>CONFOVNDING;</hi> as I ſhall further
prove.</p>
            <p>3. If I be one of thoſe that you ſpeak of, <hi>Confounding</hi> is not
the greateſt fault of your words; while it is viſible that in my
firſt <hi>Plea</hi> I diſtinctly enumerated the Caſe of the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the Laity and the Clergy. And I ſpake by conſent for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of my acquaintance. And I am likeſt to be meant by you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
divers others, that go farther from you, take Lay-conformity
to be unlawful, and largely give their reaſons for it. How then did
you expect to be believed when our Books are in ſo many hands?</p>
            <p>4. None are fitter Judges of Arts, than the moſt exerciſed Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers:
If you are skill'd and exerciſed in ſuch <hi>Arts</hi> your ſelf, you
may the eaſiler diſcerne both the, Art and purpoſe. And yet
we are ſo neer our ſelves that I cannot eaſily believe that you
know my Arts or purpoſes ſo well as I do my ſelf.</p>
            <p>§ 31. <hi>Serm.</hi> [<q>I dare ſay the People'<hi>s</hi> not underſtanding the
difference of theſe two Caſes, hath been a great occaſion of the preſent
ſeparation.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> No doubt but there is a great difference between the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
Caſe of Conformity, and the Peoples, which makes ſome
of them think much worſe of a Conforming Miniſter, than of a
Conforming Lay-man: which ſheweth that the difference is not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60845:25"/>
wholly unknown to them. But I think I have done more to
acquaint them with the difference, than you or any of your tribe
have done.</p>
            <p>§ 32. <hi>Serm.</hi> [<q>For in the Judgment of the moſt impartial men
of the Diſſenters at this day, though they think the Caſe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
very hard on the account of Subſcriptions and Declarations
required of them, yet they confeſs, very little is to be ſaid on the
behalf of the People, from whom none of thoſe things are required.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. This is but ſuch Confuſion as conſtituteth this Sermon.
We think that nothing of truth can be ſaid for any of the People's
errors; no more than for the [<hi>very hard</hi>] and ſinful caſe of our
ſelves if we ſhould Conform: If any go one ſtep too far from
you, they are unjuſtifiable therein: But we have ſhewed thoſe
that will ſee, that much may be ſaid on the People's behalf for
much of their Nonconformity, and alſo for ſuch aſſembling as you
call ſeparation.</p>
            <p>2. And ſurely if you had the due ſenſe of your <hi>Brethrens Caſe,</hi>
of your <hi>Own Caſe,</hi> and of the <hi>Kingdoms Caſe,</hi> you would perceive
how neceſſary the forbearing of the impoſition of thoſe <hi>very hard</hi>
things is to the healing of that which doth offend you; and to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ends than that.</p>
            <p>§ 33. <hi>Serm.</hi> [So that the People are condemned in their ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by their own teachers; But how they can preach lawfully to a
People who commit a fault in hearing them, I do not underſtand.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The People that are guilty of any ſinful ſeparation are
reproved by us; but not thoſe that ſeparate no further than is
their duty. In my firſt <hi>Plea</hi> I deſcribed no leſs than 30 Caſes in
which ſeparation is a ſin; and neer 40 Inſtances in which ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
is a duty or no ſin: And of all this you here take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
and toſs the bare confounding name of <hi>Separation,</hi> as if the
Sound ought to affright men from all that you are againſt; ſure you
could never think that we had Brains or Conſciences, if ſuch dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ſhould paſs for ſatisfactory with us: Can any man tell by
this bare <hi>Name,</hi> or any thing in your Book, what that Separation
is which you condemn. The word <hi>Hereſie</hi> with a Papiſt, and the
word [<hi>Separation</hi>] and [<hi>Schiſm</hi>] with ſome Conformiſts, ſeem
to be terms of Art: But what Art is it? Sure it is not the Carte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian
nor the Epicurean Philoſophy, which layeth ſo much on
<hi>Atomes and Motion:</hi> I cannot Imagine what Contexture of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
ſhould cauſe the Sound of the word [<hi>Separation</hi>] or
[<hi>Schiſm</hi>] to make ſuch a motion as ſhould drive men out of their
Religion and Wits. I am not ſo happy as to be an Academical
Graduate; but I have long ago read <hi>Lullius</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd many of his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60845:26"/>
Commentators; and I find no Philoſophy more likely, to lay
much on the Power of words; except that which we call Magick
or Charming. For my part, I was born with a diſeaſe (if it be
ſuch) that hateth Confuſion and Deceit, and inclineth me to bring
things into light, and to diſcern between things that differ. And if
you Doctors have learned the Art of Reduceing a <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> into
a <hi>Simple terme</hi> or <hi>Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> it is quite above my kind of Learning: I
ſuppoſe it is ſuch a Logical contracted Syllogiſm that you intend:
But as <hi>ſhort writing</hi> called <hi>Characters,</hi> though expeditious, is hard
to be read by others; ſo your contracted Syllogiſm, in the name
[<hi>Separation</hi>] and [<hi>Schiſm</hi>] will be more uſeful to you and yours,
than to ſtrangers that never ſaw your heart. If <hi>Vſefulneſs</hi> and
<hi>Vſedneſs,</hi> even by ſome of the Reverend, may afford us a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſtick,
I may conjecture that even Lying (and other neceſſary
arts) are aſcending in hope to be placed among the Cardinal vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and thoſe that ſcruple it, may be numbered with Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
Separatiſts and Rogues.</p>
            <p>§ 34. If I would here again tell you what Separation I take to
be lawful, and what unlawful, and deſire you to define that which
you accuſe me of, I may expect that in your Reply you will diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it; But I will trie you with a few inſtances of one ſort, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you to tell me which it is that you mean.</p>
            <p>I. Do you think that he is a <hi>Separatiſt</hi> that meeteth not in the
ſame Pariſh Church with you? No ſure: For then you are one to
others, and other Pariſhes ſuch to you.</p>
            <p>II. Is he a Separatiſt that liveth in your Pariſh, and ordinarily
meeteth not in your Temple, but another allowed place? If ſo, the
Biſhop of <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> is a Separatiſt in your Pariſh, that keepeth a
Meeting in his Chappel when you preach. If not ſo, when we
had the Kings Licenſe at leaſt, the <hi>place</hi> made Us not Separatiſts.</p>
            <p>III. Is every one a Separatiſt that differeth from you in Doctrine,
in publick Preaching? If ſo, are you not Separatiſts one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when one Preacheth for that wich is called, Abſolute Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Reprobation, Univerſal Redemption, Free-will, Falling from
juſtification, the morality of the Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and others againſt
theſe? If not; Is not difference in ſuch Doctrines as great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
as uſing and not uſeing ſome of your Liturgick Forms and
Ceremonies?</p>
            <p>IV. Are all different modes of Worſhip enough to make our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Separatiſts?</hi> Then the French and Dutch Churches are Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,
and either the Cathedrals or the Pariſh-Churches, as to their
Veſtments, Organs, Chore, mode of Singing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
private Baptiſmes and Communion with the ſick, are Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:60845:26"/>
V. Doth every diſobedience to the King, and Laws, and Canons
in matters of Religion, Government and Worſhip, make men Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts?
If ſo, then when ever a Conformiſt diſobediently ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his Common-Prayer, or leaveth off his Surplice, or giveth
the Sacrament to one that kneeleth not, or receiveth one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Pariſh to Communion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he is a ſeparatiſt. Yea no man
then is not a Separatiſt ſometimes.</p>
            <p>VI. If the Dioceſane be the loweſt political Church, and a Pariſh
but a part of a Church, as they hold that take a Biſhop to be a
Conſtitutive part; how is he ſaid to ſeparate from the Church
that owneth his Dioceſane and the Dioceſs, what ever place in
that Dioceſs he meet in, ſeeing he ſeparateth not from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
that ſtayeth in it and owneth the King, though in ſome acts
he diſobey? Nor doth every Boy that is faulty ſeparate from the
School.</p>
            <p>VII. Is he a greater Separatiſt that confeſſeth you to be a true
Church, and your communion lawful, but preferreth another as
fitter for him; or he that denieth Communion with true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſſemblies as unlawful to be Communicated with, when it is not
ſo. If the former, then Condemning you as no Church is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
or no aggravation of ſeparation, and the Local preſence
of an Infidel or a Scorner would be a leſs ſeparate ſtate, than the
abſence of your friends. If the latter (which is certain) then if
I can prove the Aſſemblies lawful which you condemne, you are
the true Separatiſts that condemn them, and deny Communion
with them, and declare ſuch Communion to be unlawful. I
Communicate with your Aſſemblies, and you utterly ſhun, refuſe
and condemn Communion with ours; which then is the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,
if I prove ours to be as good as yours?</p>
            <p>VIII. Many Engliſh Doctors ſay, <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church, as a
Knave or Thief is a true man, and we ſeparated not from It, but
they caſt Us out for doing our duty, and not ſinning as they do. I ſay
not as they (for as the Pope claimeth the Headſhip of the Church
Univerſally, that form of Policy is not of God, and we ſeparate
from that eſſencial form of their pretended Church:) But <hi>ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi>
if the Dioceſane alſo be a true Church, and we caſt out
of it for not ſinning, are We ſeparatiſts, or are our Ejectors
ſuch?</p>
            <p>IX. I have ſhewed you that the <hi>Canons</hi> Excommunicate <hi>ipſo
facto</hi> all that ſay the impoſed Conformity is unlawful. If this be
unjuſt, is it <hi>Separation</hi> to be ſo Excommunicated? and who is the
Schiſmatick here? And what ſhall be thought of ſuch Church-men
as will firſt <hi>ipſo facto</hi> Excommunicate us for our duty, and then, as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60845:27"/>
you do, call us Separatiſts. Would you have Excommunicate Men,
Communicate with you? I (and many) do ſo, becauſe you ſhall
be the Executioners of your own ſentence, and not I: But with
what face can men caſt Men out by Canon <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> and then revile
them for not coming in. You can mean no other in common ſenſe,
but that we are Schiſmaticks or ſeparatiſts becauſe we are not of
the Conformiſt's judgment: And that is not in our power: And
you differ more in judgment in greater matters from each other;
and yet call it not Schiſme or Separation. Yea you differ about the
very eſſential form of your National Church, one part taking
it to be the Kings ſupremacy, and another to be the Biſhops or
Clergy's Power: And therefore you cannot be truly of one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church, that are not for one eſſential Form.</p>
            <p>X. If men be wrongfully Excommunicate, are they thereby
abſolved from all publick Worſhipping of God? or do they loſe
their Right to all Church-Communion? I have elſe where cited
you Canons enow that ſay the contrary, and that <hi>Clave Errante</hi>
the excommunication hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>teth none but the Excommunicator:
And I have Cited Biſhop <hi>Tailor'</hi>s Full Conſent. Muſt we not
then Meet and Worſhip as we can, when you wrongfully Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
us?</p>
            <p>XI. Are not the <hi>Laity,</hi> by your Canon, forbidden to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in another Pariſh? or, any other to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, if they dare not Receive it from a Non-Preaching
Miniſter at Home? And if the People judge, that he that is
unable or unwilling to Preach, or that is a <hi>Heretick,</hi> or that liveth
in ſuch heinous Sins, or Preacheth Malignantly, as to do more
Harm than Good, may not lawfully be owned by them for
<hi>Chriſt'</hi>s Miniſters, nor their Souls be Committed to their Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Truſt; Muſt they therefore be without a Paſtors Care, or
all Publick Worſhip and Communion, and be Condemned for
being Wronged?</p>
            <p>XII. Were all thoſe Councils <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> that Decreed, That
none ſhall hear Maſs from a Fornicating Prieſt? And, Were
the Canons called the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi>-Church that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
them, for Separation, that ſaid, [<hi>Epiſcopus ignorantiâ aut
malo animo opplotus, non eſt Epiſcopus, ſed falſus Epiſcopus, non
a Dee, ſed ab hominibus promotus?</hi>] Was <hi>Guildas</hi> a Separatiſt
that told the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Wicked Prieſts, That they were not <hi>Chriſt'</hi>s
Miniſters, but Traitours? and that he was not <hi>Eximius Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus,</hi>
that would call them Prieſts, or Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
Were <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and all the <hi>Carthage-Council,</hi> Separatiſts, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60845:27"/>
wrote the Epiſtle about <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Baſilides,</hi> which I Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and told the People, It was their Duty to Separate from
<hi>Peccatore Praepoſito,</hi> a Scandalous Prelate? and that the Chief
Power was in them, to Chooſe the Worthy, or Refuſe the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy?
and that they were guilty of Sin, if they joyned with
ſuch Sinners? Who made <hi>You</hi> a more Reverend and Credible
Judge of Separation, than <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and this <hi>Council?</hi> At leaſt,
Who will think, that you may Judge them <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> or guilty
of <hi>Schiſm?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XIII. Are not the <hi>Laity,</hi> by your Canon to be denied the
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> if they be not <hi>willing of your Epiſcopal Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
And when <hi>Impoſition of Hands</hi> is made the <hi>Signe</hi> by which
<hi>Confirming</hi> or <hi>Aſſuring Grace</hi> is conveyed, and ſome Biſhops aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
no leſs to it; they fear, leſt it be made a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Be
their Doubts juſt or not, they cannot overcome them. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Muſt they therefore Live without <hi>Sacramental</hi> Communion? By
what Law?</p>
            <p>XIV. Are not the <hi>Laity,</hi> that dare not Receive the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
Kneeling, for the Reaſons elſe-where mentioned, to be
denied the <hi>Sacrament</hi> by your Rule? And though herein they
fear Sin more than they have cauſe, Muſt they that cannot Change
their own Judgments, live all their Dayes without the <hi>Sacrament?</hi>
When as <hi>General Councils</hi> Decreed, That none ſhould adore
Kneeling on any Lord's Day, and the <hi>Church</hi> for a <hi>Thouſand</hi>
Years, practiſed accordingly; Are all <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> that dare not
do that in ſuch an Inſtant, which they judge to be flat Sin;
nor yet did caſt off <hi>Sacramental Communion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XV. When the <hi>Laity</hi> cannot have their Children Baptiſed,
without ſuch Uſe of the Tranſient Dedicating Image of the
Croſs, and ſuch Uſe of Entituling and Covenanting <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od-Fathers;</hi>
which, on the Reaſons largely given by me, they take to be
no ſmall Sin; Is it Separation to joyn with Paſtors, that will
otherwiſe Baptiſe them? Are they bound to Sin againſt their
Conſciences, or to leave their Children Unbaptiſed? or, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſuch paſtors as Refuſe them?</p>
            <p>XVI. Is it Separation for men to Refuſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paſtors that are
Uſurpers, and have no true Power over them? Sure it is not
to Refuſe an uſurper of the Kingly Power? and, Why then of
the Church-Power? Which of the Biſhops thought it any Sin,
in the Dayes of Uſurpation, to forſake their Pariſh-Churches?
And in my <hi>Abridgment of Church-Hiſtory,</hi> I have cited many
Canons, which prove it the Common Judgment of the Church
for <hi>One Thouſand</hi> Years, or near; That he was no Biſhop,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60845:28"/>
that was not Choſen by the Clergy, and the people; or came
in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without the Peoples Conſent. And if you will Read a late
Treatiſe of Father <hi>Paul Servita</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> (a very Venerable
Author) you will ſee this at large Confirmed. And, If this be
true, Is it Schiſm to take ſuch for none of our Paſtors? And
Patrons chooſe Paſtors for the peoples Souls, who too often
care not for their own: Yea, though they believe not that
Man hath an Immortal Soul, their Power of Electing thoſe
that Man muſt take for the Guides of their Souls, is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
for their Infidelity. What Law of God bindeth all Men
to ſtand to their Choice? How many Hundred Congregations
have Incumbents, whom the People never conſented to; but
take them for their Hinderers and Burden?</p>

<hi>Schiſm,</hi> to Obey ſuch Commands? And how great a Number

But bear with needful Truth, as to your ſelf. You here would
diſſwade the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> from their Publick Miniſtry, and
Plead it to be their Sin; By this you own the Silencing and
Alienation of about <hi>Two Thouſand</hi> ſuch Miniſters, till they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
I ask't you formerly, is it not Sacrilege, to Alienate
(unjuſtly) Devoted, Conſecrated Perſons, and worſe than to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate
Lands or Monies? And, is it not a <hi>Hindering of God's
Word?</hi> for which the <hi>Liturgy</hi> diſſwadeth Men from the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
leſt the <hi>Devil enter into them.</hi> I only ſay, <hi>If Men be Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of this,</hi> (which <hi>You</hi> think, the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> are, by not
Conforming; and <hi>They</hi> think, <hi>Others</hi> are.) If you had Robbed
<hi>Thouſand</hi> Churches of the Communion Plate, or the Glebe-Land,
or Conſented to the Doing of it: were it Separation and Schiſm
for your Pariſh to prefer another Paſtor of their own Choice?
And when you Publiſh your Conſent to the Alienating or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing
about <hi>Two Thouſand</hi> ſuch Miniſters, If Men think that
you do much worſe than a <hi>Thouſand</hi> Church-Robbers, though
they ſhould miſtake, Is not their Truſting another Paſtor with
the Conduct of their Souls, a tolerable Thing? Dear <hi>Brother,</hi>
Try to take off the Byaſs of your Judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bear with
neceſſary Truth, though rough. Though your <hi>Logical Faculty</hi>
run lamentably Low in this your Accuſing <hi>Sermon,</hi> I impute it
to the Badneſs of your <hi>Cauſe.</hi> Undoubtedly, you have Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enough, to know that ye muſt Die; and that after <hi>Death,
Judgment</hi> muſt be expected; and that the Time is ſhort; and
the Faſhion of theſe deceiving VVorldly Things, doth paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
And, Can you think, that your Approbation and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to Silence ſo many ſuch Miniſters while your own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
might tell you, That <hi>even You</hi> do need much Help in ſuch
a Charge as you undertake, will be the Matter of a Comfortable
Account? If you think ſo, I muſt ſay, That a little ſober, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
believing Conſideration, will make a Man VViſer, than
the Reading of many Books with an unhumbled, byaſſed Mind.
The Day is coming, when you will ſee, that ye were in a
better, ſafer way, when with peaceable Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> you ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Conſent to the Plat-form of an Act for our Concord and
Reſtoration? which made me tell many Parliament-Men, [<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
our Cauſe to the Councel of Dr.</hi> Tillotſon <hi>and Dr.</hi> Stilling-fleet,
<hi>and we ſhall preſently be healed.</hi>] But, What is Man?
And, VVhat need have we to pray, <hi>Lead us not into Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XIX. If Men know the need of the full Uſe of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral-Office
for their Souls, and cannot ſpare it, and yet live
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60845:29"/>
where they cannot Enjoy one Half or Quarter of it; Is it
Schiſm for them to ſeek to Enjoy the reſt? Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> in
his <hi>Annotations,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t tells us, <hi>That the Office of a Biſhop, was,
To Preach, To Direct Mens Conſciences, To Viſit and Pray with
the Sick, To take Care of all the Poor, and the Moneys gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for them, To be their Guide in Publick Worſhip, To Exerciſe</hi>
Chriſt's <hi>Diſcipline, Admoniſhing, Rejecting the Obſtinate, Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Penitent, Strengthening the Weak, Comforting the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
Reſolving the Doubtful, Convincing Gain-ſayers,</hi> &amp;c.
Some of your moſt Peaceable Conformable Hearers tell me,
[<hi>We have need of a Frequent Help, by the Company and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of a Paſtor.</hi>] But we never ſee him, but in the Pulpit.
And if we ſhould all go to ſeek him in another Pariſh where
he dwells, when ever we need a Paſtor's Councel, were he at
Leiſure and willing, he could not have time to ſpeak to one
of an Hundred, that might (at once) wait to ſpeak with him:
So that, we have none of this neceſſary Paſtoral Help, when we
greatly need it. Yea, not the Sixth, or Tenth Part of the Pariſh
can come to Hear him in the Church. And when We that
moſt deſire it get in, it troubleth us to think, that we thereby
keep out thoſe that leaſt deſire it, but moſt need it; who,
knowing the Difficulty of getting Room, do ſtay at Home, and
never ſeek it: So that, <hi>Five</hi> Parts of <hi>Six</hi> of our Neighbours,
uſe not to go to any Church at all, no more than Infidels.
And if in pity we perſwade them to go to any <hi>Nonconformiſt's</hi>
Meeting, they ſay the Clergy will Damn them as <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi>
The Queſtion now is, Whether <hi>Ten Thouſand, or Twenty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi>
in a Pariſh, are bound to live without all Private Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Help and Councel; yea, and to forbear all Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
of <hi>God,</hi> and Hearing of his <hi>Word?</hi> And, if they ſeek
Relief of <hi>Nonconforming</hi> Miniſters, Publickly and Privately,
Whether it be Sinful Separation? If Men can ſpare the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
Why are they Maintained? If they are needful for
the Safety of Mens Souls, Muſt ſo many <hi>Thouſands</hi> hazard their
Souls for want of needful Help, leſt they be called <hi>Separatiſts?</hi>
If the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> be called the <hi>Parſon of the Pariſh,</hi> and
Preach to others that can Hear him, Will that ſerve the Needs
of all the reſt?</p>
            <p>XX. In <hi>Moſcovie,</hi> where a Chriſtian Prince, and the Laws
forbid all Preaching, and Publick Worſhip, ſave the Reading
of <hi>Homilies</hi> and <hi>Liturgies;</hi> Is it Separation, and Sinful Schiſm,
to Diſobey this, and otherwiſe to Preach and Worſhip <hi>God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXI. Is it Schiſm in <hi>France,</hi> and ſuch other Countries, for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60845:29"/>
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to Meet to Preach and Worſhip <hi>God,</hi> againſt the
Wills of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Biſhops?</hi> It's true, that great Sin is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
thus avoided by <hi>them,</hi> which are not Impoſed upon <hi>us.</hi>
But if it prove, that <hi>any Sin</hi> is made neceſſary to Communion,
the Degree will not much vary the Caſe, as to the Point of
Separation.</p>
            <p>XXII. In divers Countries, the <hi>Prince</hi> is of one Religion,
or Mode of Religion, and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of another: The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is, Who are the Schiſmaticks, the People that in their
Aſſemblies, and Mode of Worſhip, do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ollow the <hi>Prince,</hi> or
they that follow the <hi>Biſhops?</hi> Some great Writers for Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
tell me, That if the <hi>King</hi> Command one <hi>Liturgy, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation,
Verſion, Ceremony,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Biſhop</hi> another, I muſt
obey the <hi>Biſhop</hi> before the <hi>King:</hi> Others ſay, I muſt Obey the
<hi>King</hi> before the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> (of which before.) Biſhop <hi>Goodman</hi>
of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> (a <hi>Papiſt</hi>) complaineth of the <hi>King,</hi> that would
not conſent that Clergy-Men ſhould be Chancellours: And I
ſpeak with no Biſhop, that diſowneth not Lay-Chancellours
Uſe of the Keys. The <hi>Helvetian</hi> Magiſtrates are <hi>Eraſtians,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Clergies Power of Excommunication: Many of the
Paſtors are of the Contrary Judgment. The Duke of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>
is a <hi>Calviniſt:</hi> His Biſhops and Clergy are <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
Which Party are the <hi>Schiſmatick?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXIII. Were all thoſe Separating <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> who, from
the Apoſtles Dayes, did Meet, Preach, and Worſhip <hi>God</hi> againſt
the Will and Laws of <hi>Princes;</hi> ſometimes of <hi>Heathen Princes,</hi>
and ſometimes of <hi>Chriſtians; (Conſtantine, Valens, Theodoſius</hi> the
Second, <hi>Anaſtaſius, Zeno, Juſtinian,</hi> &amp;c.) If ſo, moſt Chriſtian
<hi>Biſhops</hi> have been ſuch <hi>Separatiſts.</hi> I have in my <hi>Firſt Plea,</hi> and
my <hi>Church-Hiſtory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> given Inſtances enough.</p>
            <p>XXIV. Is it <hi>Schiſm,</hi> or Sinful <hi>Separation,</hi> to Diſobey a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
about Religion, which no Man hath true Authority to
Give? <hi>Authority</hi> is the <hi>Objectum Formale</hi> of <hi>Obedience;</hi> and
where there is no <hi>Authority,</hi> there is no <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Senſe, or privative. Moſt <hi>Politicks</hi> ſay, That <hi>Princes</hi> have
no Authority againſt the Common Good: All Power of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
and <hi>Paſtors</hi> is of <hi>God,</hi> and is for Edification, and not for
Deſtruction. <hi>God</hi> giveth no Power againſt Himſelf, or his Laws,
nor the Souls of Men. If the <hi>King</hi> ſhould Command me to
Marry a Wife, whom I know to be intolerably unmeet for me;
or to Feed my ſelf, and Family with Food, which I find to be
againſt our Health; or to uſe a Phyſician, whoſe Ignorance or
Negligence, or Untruſtineſs, would endanger my Life: I am
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60845:30"/>
not bound to Obey him, both becauſe it is a Matter that is
<hi>without</hi> the Verge of his Governing Authority, and becauſe
it is againſt the End of Government. <hi>Regal Power</hi> deſtroyeth
not <hi>Family-Power,</hi> nor <hi>Perſonal Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Self-Government:</hi>
No Man hath Power to Deſtroy or Endanger the Souls of
Men, nor forbid them ſeeking their own Edification and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I Repeat Biſhop <hi>Bilſon'</hi>s Words, <hi>p.</hi> 236. of Subjection:
[<hi>Princes have no Right to Call or Confirm Preachers; but to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſuch as be Sent of</hi> God, <hi>and give them Liberty for their
Preaching, and Security for their Perſons. And if</hi> Princes <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
ſo to do,</hi> God's <hi>Labourers muſt go forward with that which
is Commanded them from Heaven: Not by Diſturbing</hi> Princes
<hi>from their Thrones, nor Invading their Realms, as your Father
doth, and defendeth he may do; but by mildly Submitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Powers on Earth, and meekly Suffering for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Truth, what they ſhall Inflict.</hi>—Pag. 399. <hi>The
Election of Biſhops in thoſe Dayes, belonged to the People, and
not to the</hi> Prince: <hi>And though by plain Force, he placed</hi> Lucius
<hi>there; yet might the People lawfully Reject him as no Biſhop,
and cleave to</hi> Peter, <hi>their Right Paſtor.</hi>] On this, I further
ask,</p>
            <p>XXV. If the Nonconforming People can prove; That (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the times of Civil Uſurpation, and <hi>Biſhops</hi> Removal)
their <hi>Paſtors</hi> had a Lawful Call and title to their Office over them,
and they were truly obliged to them, as in that juſt Relation,
Whether the Magiſtrates or Biſhops Acts, have made thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and Obligations Null? That the Temples and Tythes
are in the Magiſtrates Power, we doubt not: But more than
Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> even many Councils deny it of the <hi>Office,</hi> and
<hi>Paſtoral Relation.</hi> Yea, the Univerſal Church was of the ſame
mind. And if ſo, how prove you, <hi>e. g.</hi> that the Relation of
the Ejected <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, and their Flocks was Diſſolved,
and that the Succeeders were true Paſtors to the Non-conſenting
Flocks?</p>
            <p>XXVI. That there are (Alas) Multitudes of Young, Raw,
Injudicious, beſides Scandalous <hi>Prieſts,</hi> no Man can deny that
knoweth <hi>England,</hi> and hath any Modeſty. If then honeſt
People, that are not willing to be Damned, ſhall ſay: [<hi>We
beſt know what is ſuitable to our Needs, and what Teachers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
us, and what not. And we find that ſome are ſo Ignorant
that they are unmeet as Plowmen, to reſolve the moſt concerning
Caſes of Conſcience; and their Converſation ſavoureth not of any
ſerious belief of Chriſtianity, and the World to come, and they do</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:60845:30"/>
               <hi>but Read a few dry words, like School-Boyes ſaying a Weak Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without Life or Seriouſneſs, and we can but little profit by
them.</hi>] How prove you that it is lawful for ſuch to uſe more
ſuitable helps, though Men forbid it? A Soul is precious: <hi>God</hi>
Worketh by Means, and according to the ſuitableneſs of Means:
That agreeth not to ſome, which others can make ſhift with:
Two or Three words from a <hi>Conformeſt,</hi> that ſaith: [<hi>God can
Bleſs the weakeſt Means to you;</hi> or <hi>the Fault is in your ſelf</hi>]
will not ſerve inſtead of needful Helps. The <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Biſhop</hi>
have not Authority to Tie a Sick Man to Eat that which he
cannot Digeſt, or Hurteth him. Every Man is neerlieſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for his own Soul, and moſt Entruſted with it. Pariſh-Order
it ſelf, is but a humane alterable Circumſtance, which
I am not bound to obſerve at the hazard of my Edification and
Salvation.</p>
            <p>XXVII. What if the Magiſtrate grant a Toleration of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Modes of Worſhip, as the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches
are here Tolerated, and many in <hi>Holland,</hi> and in many other
Countries? Are theſe ſeparating <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> that differ from
each other? If ſo, it is not becauſe they diſobey the Magiſtrate;
for he Tolerateth them all: If not, then meer diverſity of Modes
of Worſhip maketh not <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>XXVIII. If it be no true Political Church (in the ſtrict ſenſe as
an Organized Society, which hath not true Authorized Paſtors,
and if any Pariſh have either <hi>Vncapable Perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or ſuch as were
never Conſented to by the Flocks, and ſo have no <hi>True Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor;</hi>
and if the Biſhops hold, That Pariſhes are not proper Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Churches, but parts of Churches, having no Paſtors that
have the Power of the Keyes, or the whole Eſſence of the
Paſtoral Office; but only Half-Paſtors, that want an Eſſential
Part of the Power. If on any ſuch Account, any Pariſhes are
no true Paſtoral Churches: <hi>Qu.</hi> Whether to Separate from
ſuch a Pariſh, be to Separate from a Church in the ſenſe in queſtion?</p>
            <p>XXIX. The mutual Condemnations in the times of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
Donatiſts, Neſtorians, Evtychians, Monothelites, Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſiaſts,
Image-Patrons,</hi> &amp;c. tell the World how needful, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
forbearance is, to prevent worſe Diviſions and Confuſions:
And the <hi>Papiſts</hi> take themſelves to be all of one Church, though
they differ even in Doctrines of Morality, as dangerouſly as
the <hi>Janſeniſts,</hi> againſt the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have ſhewed; and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Sects and Orders be permitted to Live, and Worſhip <hi>God</hi>
with very great diverſity in their ſeveral ſorts of Monaſteries:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60845:31"/>
Why then ſhould the little differences of our queſtioned Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
be thought to be ſo great as maketh us not to be of one Church.</p>
            <p>XXX. Some good Chriſtians think, That though an undiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined
Church may be Communicated with, occaſionally, yea,
and conſtantly, while there is a hopeful Tryal of its Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet when there is no hope after Patient T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yal, a better
Courſe and Communion ſhould be choſen, where it may be had:
And they think, that Multitudes whom they know to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
<hi>Swearers, Curſers, Drunkards, Fornicators, Haters</hi> of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Piety, Hobbiſts, Infidels, Atheiſts, Sadduces,</hi> &amp;c. are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And they ſay, they ſcarce
ever heard one Man of all theſe Excommunicated; nor one Man
of them all, ever brought to Publick Confeſſion and Repentance.
And they think, Lay Chancellours, having not rightfully the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Keys, there is no ordinary Means of hopeful Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and Exerciſe of Diſcipline; eſpecially, the Largeneſs
of the Dioceſſes making it impoſſible to be uſed to One of an
Hundred, that (according to the Law of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) it ſhould
be uſed on. And they think, That the Church-Diſcipline is
not only <hi>None,</hi> as to the Right Uſe, and made Impoſſible; but
worſe than <hi>None,</hi> while it is uſed moſt to Excommunicate from
<hi>Chriſt'</hi>s Church, the True and Conſcionable Members of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
that dare not Conform; and ſo to lead to their Impriſonment,
and utter Ruin. And they think, That no Man hath true Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
to confine them to ſuch an Undiſciplined, and Illdiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined
Church; and forbid them the Uſe of better, where
<hi>Chriſt'</hi>s Diſcipline may be uſed. Whether theſe Men be in the
Right, or in the Wrong, if the Matter of Fact be true, I
ſhould deſire rather the Reformation of ſuch a Church, than
the Reproach or Afflicting of Men, as <hi>Separatiſts</hi> and <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
that chooſe another ſort of Communion, as to their more
Ordinary Practiſe; not denying this to be a true Diſeaſed
Church.</p>
            <p>And ſo much in theſe <hi>Thirty</hi> Inſtances, about that which I
think deſerveth not the Reproach of any dangerous Separation.
I told you <hi>Thirty</hi> Inſtances alſo of Unlawful Separation, which
I named. And now you may judge, whether you ſpake to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification,
when you ſaid, That the [<hi>People are Condemned by
their own Teachers;</hi>] without telling, whom, and for what;
and how far they Condemn them, and how far not.</p>
            <p>§. 34. And, Did you think the Conſequence good, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we think it <hi>Lawful to Hear you,</hi> yea, and to many a <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:60845:31"/>
therefore we Condemn them, for <hi>Hearing any one elſe,</hi> that
Conformeth not? As if they that have Communion with your
Dioceſan-Church, muſt have Communion with no other? So
far am I from your Opinion, that I take it to be wofully Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
and Schiſmatical: And will never be a Member of a
Particular Church, which will forbid me Communion with all
others that differ from them; yea, that doth not hold its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in Unity with all the True Chriſtian Churches on Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Though a Schiſmatical Diſputer for Prelacy, tells me, <hi>That
though I Communicate with the Church of</hi> England, <hi>I am a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
for Communicating with</hi> Nonconformiſts, <hi>who</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>are Schiſmaticks.</hi> But he that will Communicate with no
Church that hath any Guilt of Schiſm, when the Chriſtian
VVorld is broken into ſo many Sects, I doubt, will be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Schiſmatick; and will Communicate with few on Earth.
And as <hi>Smith</hi> Baptized himſelf, not liking any other Baptiſm,
this Man may become a Church to himſelf.</p>
            <p>And indeed, the word [<hi>Condemn them</hi>] ſounds Harſh; when
it ſignifieth no more, than that we <hi>Judge them to be Miſtaken
and Culpable.</hi> If I <hi>Condemn</hi> every Man, or every Church,
which I judge to be Sinners, I muſt <hi>Condemn</hi> all Mankind. I
uſe not ſo harſh a Phraſe of your Self, as to ſay, <hi>I Condemn
You:</hi> When yet I Judge your Book to be more Schiſmatical,
than the Meetings of moſt that I am acquainted with; which
you Accuſe.</p>
            <p>§. 35. But yet, your Miſtake is Greater than I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mentioned. I know not <hi>many</hi> (if <hi>any</hi>) that uſe to Hear Me,
who Separate from You: Many of them are <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> and for
your <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> I think, moſt of them go to the
Pariſh-Churches; and <hi>few</hi> (if <hi>any</hi>) that I know, do deny it to
be Lawful. How then can you prove it True, that we <hi>Condemn</hi>
them? What is it for? Is it becauſe they neither Separate
from the <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> or <hi>Nonconformiſts?</hi> This is it, that we
Exhort them to. It was an ill Slip, to put our <hi>Condemning
them,</hi> for <hi>Commending them:</hi> But a fair Expoſition will make
it Lawful.</p>
            <p>§. 36. <hi>But you ſay</hi> [How they can preach lawfully to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that commit a fault in hearing them, I do not underſtand.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now you come to your buſineſs: But 1. What if you
by Calumny call my ordinary hearers Separatiſts, and they are
not ſuch? 2. What if we prove it to be their duty to hear both
you and us in ſeaſon, if they need it, or lawful at leaſt; and ſo do
commend them, and not condemn them? may we then lawfully
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60845:32"/>
Preach to them? What if the fault which we blame ſome for, be
their judging it <hi>unlawful to hear ſuch as you?</hi> Will your Logick
prove, that we call it their <hi>fault to hear us;</hi> as if <hi>hearing us,</hi> and
not <hi>hearing you,</hi> were words of the ſame ſignification?</p>
            <p>And is all neceſſary which is <hi>lawful?</hi> Do we condemn men
that do not all that is <hi>lawful</hi> to do? And becauſe you after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
that <hi>if it be lawful, it is a Duty;</hi> I would you had told us,
whether you take this univerſally, that [<hi>What ever is lawful is a
Duty,</hi>] or only in this caſe for ſome ſpecial reaſon, and what that
is. I ſuppoſe it is, becauſe it is commanded: as if every <hi>lawful</hi>
thing commanded were a duty: But we think otherwiſe, unleſs
the Command be an Act which God Authorizeth the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to do. All mens Authority is limited by God: and they
have none but from him. For inſtance, it is lawful to eat brown
Bread, and drink Water, (or Wine;) But if the King or Biſhop
forbid me to eat better, when my health requireth it, I am not
bound to obey them: It is lawful to were Sackcloth, but none
have power to forbid me fitter Clothing: It is lawful to ſet a
Son Apprentice to a <hi>Chimny-ſweeper,</hi> or to an <hi>Ale-ſeller</hi> or <hi>Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi>
but if the Biſhop or any other forbid one to place him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it obligeth not: It is lawful to marry a <hi>Blackmore,</hi> or an
ugly Scold, or Beggar: But the Biſhop or King cannot oblige
men to choſe no better, becauſe it is out of the Verge of their
juriſdiction, and belongeth to perſonal and family power. It is
lawful to put my ſelf into the Hoſpital, and care of an unskilful
Phyſician, till my health require better: But when my health
requireth it, I will uſe a better if I can, whoever forbids
it. For it is uſurpation in them, that ſhall take the neceſſary care
of my health and life out of my own hands. It is lawful to give the
King our eſtates: But Lawyers ſay, we are not bound to do it,
meerly becauſe He or the Biſhop commandeth it.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you think, that men may do more againſt our ſouls
than againſt our bodies; and have more power in Religion than
in civil or bodily things: But we are not bound to think ſo if you
do. It is lawful for men to hear one that only readeth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Liturgy, and never preacheth: But when my needs
requireth more, I will uſe it if I can, whoever forbids me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is
lawful to hear an ignorant raw Lad, that ſaith over a dry Sermon
as a Boy ſaith his leſſon, and hath neither ſpiritual Life nor
Light, nor is fit to take the Charge of Souls: And it is lawful
to hear ſuch a Sermon as yours, or one that peacheth againſt
other mens preaching: Yea, we rejoyce, and will rejoyce, that
Chriſt is preached, though by ſuch as do it in ſtrife and contention
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60845:32"/>
to add affliction to the afflicted, and not ſincerely: But wiſe
men that believe a life to come, and love their ſouls, will chooſe
better if they can, whoever forbiddeth them. Men have no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to hurt our ſouls, nor to deprive us of the help which God
affordeth us, nor to make themſelves the only Judges, what is
profitable or hurtful to our ſouls or bodies, or what is beſt for
our edification.</p>
            <p>§ 37. But [<hi>To commit a fault in hearing us</hi>] is of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſignification. In the manner of hearing, all commit faults; by
ſome defect of attention, faith or application: But that's not it
that you mean: But that <hi>it is their ſin to hear us.</hi> And indeed, if
this were true, is it above your learning to underſtand, that
it is lawful to preach to them that commit a fault in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them.</p>
            <p>1. What if culpably they would hear no other? Is it better
let them hear none at all than that we preach to them? If pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs
or ſickneſs make a Child refuſe the Food or Phyſick which
he ſhould take by his parents command; will you ſay, that it
is better that he famiſh or die, than that you give him any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Men may be ſaved that hear not you: But how can they
believe, unleſs they hear, or hear without a Preacher? The means
is for the End: <hi>I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,</hi> is a Leſſon
which I perceive more than the <hi>Phariſees</hi> are to learn. Order
is for the thing Ordered: Pariſh Order is not ſo needful as Faith
and Salvation. It may be, ſuch a mans Sin, that he will not hear
ſuch as he ſhould hear; and ſo by Conſequence that he heareth
me, and yet alſo Conſequently his Duty to hear me, ſuppoſing
that his fault hath blinded him, to think that he may hear no other,
till his Errour be Cured: Or at leaſt, it is my Duty to take him
as I find him, and Preach to him in his own miſtake.</p>
            <p>2. The Canon forbids going out of our own Pariſhes: ſuppoſe
<hi>twenty or five Hundred</hi> Infidels, or Papiſts of the next Pariſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
we will hear no Proteſtant but Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet;</hi> were it
unlawful for you to Preach to them?</p>
            <p>3. If I ſhould Preach to them all againſt ſeparation, and for
Prelacy, were it unlawful? One of the Doctors at the <hi>Savoy,</hi>
1661. motioned, that he and I might go up and down <hi>England</hi> to
Preach for Conformity: and if any ask us why we do not, we
may tell them, Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> taketh it for unlawful: If it be
a Sin to preach to them, it is a ſin to preach to them againſt
Separation, or for Conformity.</p>
            <p>4. It is ordinary for men of other Pariſhes to hear you, and
Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> and others, ſuch as you eſteem: And I ſuppoſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60845:33"/>
moſt weekly Lectures are Preached moſt to men of other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,
and yet you take it not for ſin to preach to them.</p>

you in the Mode of Worſhip: And yet I never heard it proved,
that it is a ſin for the Preachers thus to preach to them.</p>
            <p>6. What if your Children as Prodigals over-run you, or the
Kings Subjects cauſeleſly fly into another Land: They ought not
to be there. Is it herefore unlawful, for any to teach them there,
or receive them to pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ike Worſhip?</p>
            <p>7. Almoſt all the Chriſtian World, is ſo tainted with ſome
degree of Errour and Partiality, that men will hear none but
thoſe of their own mind, for their Errour ſake. The <hi>Armenians, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſims,
Greeks, Papiſts, Neſtorians, Jacobites, Luth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rans, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,
Calviniſts, Anabaptiſts,</hi> &amp;c. It is unlawful for any of
theſe, to refuſe ſounder Teachers than their own, and to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
themſelves to their own only meerly for their ſingular O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions:
And yet it will be hard for you to prove, that all the
Preachers on Earth, muſt give over Preaching to any ſuch as
theſe. What ſhame, Blood, and odious Schiſines, followed this
Schiſmatical Principle, while in doubtful Diſputations, or tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
differences, each party Condemned and Curſed the other,
<hi>I</hi> have fully manifeſted in my Abridgment of Church Hiſtory.
VVhile by one Emperour and Council all the Orthodox were
Depoſed; and by another, all the <hi>Neſtorians;</hi> and by another,

Uſurpation, and thought to leave the Pariſh Churches tended
Culpably to Diviſion: It followeth not, that it was unlawful
for a Biſhop to preach in private, though when you, under the
Uſurpers, kept the Pariſh Church, he had preacht to ſome of your

            <p>But here you ſhew what your Labour tendeth to, <hi>viz.</hi> To

to give over. If <hi>God</hi> will, I ſhall elſewhere give you an Account
of the Reaſons of our Preaching; and Anſwer what You, and
Others ſay againſt it: And therefore, ſhall ſay but little of it
here. But I am heartily ſorry, that you are come to ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire:
That you had rather ſo many <hi>Hundred</hi> ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

and Ceremonies! That you no more regard the Needs
of the People, that abound in Ignorance, Careleſneſs, and Vice;
nor obſerve no more the Power of Sin, nor the great Want of
Help to ſuch Pariſhes, as your own, and too many in the Land,
that have need on other Accounts.</p>
            <p>O! How dreadful and unſearchable are the Judgments of <hi>God?</hi>
That when ſo many <hi>Hundreds</hi> were Forbidden to Preach the
Goſpel, the Plague muſt firſt give them ſome Degree of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Flames continue it the next Year, and the <hi>King</hi>s
Clemency after, and Horrid <hi>Popiſh</hi> Treaſon next divert their
Proſecutors; while the Laws and Biſhops all the while forbad
them: Even when the Pariſh-Preachers fled from the Plague,
and it was dying Men that the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> Preach't to. And
when the Churches were Burnt down, and the People had no
Prieſt, or Place to go to for their own way of Worſhip; yet
neither Laws nor Biſhops conſented to our Preaching: And
ſuch Men as Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> alſo, come in to engage their Wit,
Reputation, Induſtry, and Conſcience, in the Silencing Deſign.
O! What Cauſe have we all to VVatch and Pray, That <hi>We
enter not into Temptation?</hi> and to dread the Spiritual Judgments
of <hi>God? Remember</hi> Lot'<hi>s Wife,</hi> was a needful Warning. A <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>

If you will plead for ſo much preſumption, profanation
of Gods Name, uſurpation, uncharitableneſs, and Schiſm, I will leave
you to fight againſt the Light, and not labour in vain in a needleſs
confutation. 2. But, Sir, you ſhould have told your Reader the full
truth. 1. That I never denied but largely aſſerted the Magiſtrates
power of the Sword over all perſons and cauſes Eccleſiaſtical; much
leſs <hi>Chriſtian Kingdoms,</hi> or Cities <hi>de re.</hi> 2. And that I maintained that
Magiſtrates make officers to judge of the <hi>Circa ſacra;</hi> or undetermined
accidents of Religion. 3. And if you will equivocally call theſe Churches,
I quarrel not <hi>de nomine.</hi> 4. Nor yet at the thing or name of the Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of many Churches for Concord. 5. But I ſay (in the Page cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by you) that as humane forms ſhould not be pretended falſly to be
Divine, ſo neither have they authority againſt thoſe that are Divine,
to change them and deſtroy their priviledges: Unleſs you will fight
for man againſt God, you muſt reverſe this Accuſation.</p>
            <p>§ 44. As to your caſe, of the extent of the firſt Churches, I have ſo
much to ſay of it elſewhere, if God will, that I ſhall not here ſtay on ſo
ſhort a touch. Only you put me to repeat, <hi>If God make families, and men
make Cities,</hi> do but confeſs the different efficients, and uſurp not a power
to deſtroy the power inſtituted by God, and we ſhall not much differ.</p>
            <p>§ 45. <hi>You greatly ſtrengthen my Cauſe by the teſtimony of ſo well
Read a man [Serm.</hi> p. 27. <q>[Though when the Churches increaſed, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional

one Church, and one Altar, and one Baptiſm, and one Biſhop, with many

Churches planted by the Apoſtles themſelves in ſeveral parts, that none but
a great ſtranger to the Hiſtory of the Church can ever call in queſtion.</q>

that meet at one Altar, and that can know one another, and are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociated
for ſuch perſonal Communion in preſence, and (though I
could wiſh it neither too ſmall nor too great) it is of the <hi>Species</hi>
which I plead for as of God. There is certainly a Specifique difference
between a Church that hath a Conſtitutive formal Governour, who
hath the whole Paſtoral power, and is aſſociated for preſential mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

but a half Paſtor without the power of the Keyes, or that is aſſociat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only for diſtant Communion, and never ſee each other; even for
another ſort of Communion. Conformiſts hold that Biſhops and
Presbyters are diſtinct <hi>orders:</hi> Therefore Churches differing in the
very <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Species</hi> of the Conſtitutive Governours, and in the
Triminus or end, and the nature of the Communions are certainly
of diſtinct Species, and not only of diſtinct degrees in the ſame
Species: But ſuch are our Parochial and <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Churches. Juſt
ſuch a Church as you here deſcribe is it that I would have, and yet if
the Chappels alſo have Altars, and there be more than one to the
Church, as long as they are under the ſame Biſhop and Presbyters,
aſſociate for Communion in preſence, it alters not the Species.</p>

and only pronounced the bleſſing &amp;c. Therefore till the Species
was altered it was like a School, whoſe Schollars lived in City and
Country, but were under a Biſhop that Governed them perſonally
in preſence. But after they were like many ſcore or hundred
Schools that had Teaching Uſhers, and one abſent Governour (to
the moſt). To Govern as a Schoolmaſter in preſence ſpecifically dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
from Governing as Princes or viſitors, by Laws, or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

            <p>2. I pray you forget not that by this meaſure (if you hold to it)
you unchurch all our Pariſh Churches: Every Church then had a
Biſhop, no Pariſh now hath a Biſhop (proper to it ſelf), or at leaſt not
many: Therefore no Pariſh (by this rule) is a Church. <hi>Eccleſia eſt

him: Now we have hundreds of Altars locally ſeparated from
the Biſhop.</p>
            <p>2. But yet if then the Doctrine of faith had been never ſo ſound,
Chriſtians would have ſeparated. 1. From unlawful worſhip
(ſpecially Idolatry), 2. And from wicked Biſhops; as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned

the Joannites ſeparation, and only ſay that after they returned. Its
true: But did they do well or ill before? they returned not till gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs

had, who were not caſt out, but departed, nor had any Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

you been impartial, you had eaſily ſeen this: But as <hi>Cyril</hi> and others
accuſation of the Joannites, as ſeparatiſts and ſchiſmaticks, did not

into one, and making only one Common Father or Maſter of a
families, who ſhould ſend Stewards to every houſe, of his own mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

particular families, more wit or reputation than yours would
not keep his cauſe from ſhame. Or if he pleaded that all the Schools
in a Dioceſs, or many 100 or 1000, ſhould have but one Schoolmaſter
with Uſhers that have no power to take in or put out or uſe the Rod,
and that to retrive this to the Infant State is ſeditious, the reaſon of
mankind would ſhame his reaſoning. And when men know <hi>what Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral
Guidance</hi> is, the caſe here will be as plain.</p>
            <p>3. Our Reaſon for deſiring (not the Primitive paucity of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
but) the Primitive form of Chriſt is. 1. Becauſe Chriſt by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
inſtituted it: (Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> once ſpake well to that). 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we can prove that he was faithful in forming his houſe and
Church, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was in forming that of the Jews. 3. Becauſe we never
heard it proved that man had power to alter what Chriſt by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the Apoſtles founded: neither having their infallibility nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
4. At leaſt we think it is the ſureſt way to hold to that which
we are ſure God ſetled, till we can prove that men have power to
change the very form.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Teach us what to ſay to the Papiſts, when they ſhall according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay to us</hi> 
               <q>[what though there was no Vniverſal Paſtor in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
times? what though many things in diſcipline and worſhip be changed
ſince? why muſt you diſturb the peace of the Church by reducing things to
the infant State? what though there were no Cardinals, nor General
Councils of Prelates to make univerſal Lawes for the Churches, what
though the Sacrament was given in both kinds, and there were no private
Maſſes, or prayers for the dead? muſt the Church be ſtill in infancy? What
though the Apoſtles inſtituted the Lords day for publick worſhip and holy
Communion, may not the Church put that down, and ſet up one day of her
making once a month or year inſtead of it?</q>
            </p>
            <p>But I will not be one of thoſe that will <hi>fight for man</hi> againſt God; for
I know who will overcome. If you can prove that Chriſt gave your
Church authority to pull down the Church Offices and form which he
appointed, and ſet up another, and call it the <hi>Churches growth,</hi> or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
I will obey them.</p>
            <p>But I have elſewhere asked who they were that made your new
Church form. If the firſt Church (of Gods making) it was only the
<hi>univerſal</hi> headed by Chriſt, and particular Churches for perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
if theſe made the new forms, tell us who, when, and by what
power, and why they may not unmake them, if there be cauſe: and
whether the efficient Church be not better then the effected as the
Parent than the Child. If you ſay that Biſhops of Pariſhes did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by
conſent in <hi>Aſia</hi> or elſewhere above a thouſand years ago, how come
we in <hi>England</hi> to be bound by them? If you ſay that Princes were the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60845:38"/>
makers of the new <hi>Church Species.</hi> 1. Heathen Princes did it not. 2. The
Biſhops will give you little thanks, if you grant not that it was <hi>done</hi>
before there were any Chriſtian Princes to do it. 3. One Prince can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make Laws for anothers Country. 4. Prove that ever Chriſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
Princes to change the Conſtitution of the Churches inſtituted
by him, and make new ones above his form; except making officers
for the <hi>Circa Sacra</hi> or variable accidents. 5. And what Princes do,
they have power to undo.</p>
            <p>And it concerneth us to enquire (much more then about ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies)
how far this power of man extendeth. May they make as
many new Church <hi>Species</hi> as they pleaſe. Why then may they not
make as many forms as there are Kingdomes, if not an univerſal Pope
by the conſent of moſt?</p>
            <p>5. But that which the Papiſts take for the Churches growth from
Infancy, the Proteſtants take for its gradual depravation; And have
written many treatiſes to ſhew when and how ſuch corruptions were
introduced: And the forementioned book of <hi>Paulus Sarpi Servita</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tranſlated, tells us by what degrees much of that evil did ſpring up,
which ſome take to be the Churches Man-hood, and the amending of
the defects of Chriſts inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>6. And you that wonder that I know not what you mean by [<hi>the
Church of</hi> England] may next wonder that I know not what it is
that you call [<hi>the Proteſtant Religion</hi>] In my [<hi>full ſatisfaction</hi>] I have
told you that I mean by it, <hi>ſimple Chriſtianity expreſſed in the ſacred
Scriptures as the Recorded rule, with the rejection of all humane additions
which ſuppoſe the Scriptures imperfect as to their regulating uſe:</hi> But if you
ſuppoſe that men may, without any Scripture proof of authority, take
down and change the Church Species, which Chriſt by his Apoſtles
made, and make new ones inſtead, and thus add to Chriſts Laws, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,
yea ſuperior and derogating Laws of their own, this is not that
<hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> which I am of, and therefore I intreat you to define
what it is you ſo call.</p>
            <p>7. When you have as well proved the very eſſential form of the firſt
Churches to have been inſtituted but <hi>pro tempore</hi> as a mutable thing,
as we can prove the like of <hi>waſhing Feet,</hi> and <hi>community</hi> of <hi>Goods,</hi> we
will ſubmit. And ſo we will when you have proved that God that
<hi>made families</hi> made not Cities or Republicks, that is, did not inſtitute
civil Government of many families; or that men who diverſifie the
forms of Republicks, may overthrow families or their proper pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
Yea and that God hath left men as much power to make new
<hi>Species</hi> of Churches, as to diverſifie the Forms of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:60845:38"/>
8. And as to our [<hi>diſturbing your peace</hi>] if you had built your
frame on Chriſts foundation, and laid your peace on the unity of
the Spirit, and the ſeven particulars named <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 45. 6. and had
not built it on uncharitableneſs, on imperious uſurpation, nor that love
of the world, which <hi>Paul Servita</hi> ſaith brought in the Church cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
you would not have been ſo tender, nor your peace like
an aſpen leaf in the wind, as that your Brethren, who, you ſay, agree
in Doctrine and the ſubſtance of worſhip with you cannot quietly
joyn near you in the worſhip of God, without your impoſed
words, and ceremonies, but they become diſturbers of your peace.
Its a ſickly peace that is ſo eaſily diſturbed by ſo ſmall diſſent. As
<hi>Rome</hi> thinketh that all wrong her that do not obey her, and pleadeth
for <hi>Empire</hi> under the name of Communion, ſo do ſome others; and
will enter a ſuite againſt them as <hi>Schiſmatiks,</hi> that will not let them
ride and laſh them without complaint. If you have the humility
and Charity of a Chriſtian, without envy <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What harm doth
it do you that I and ſuch others worſhip God in another room, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
your book, while your Church is as full as it can well hold? Do
you not differ much more among your ſelves; as I before ſhewed?
And the Papiſts yet more among themſelves; and yet are in one
Church, and tollerated. But ſo their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wills</hi> may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed,
ſome men can bear with much more againſt God. Who
heareth ſuch out cries againſt ten thouſand or twenty thouſand in a
Pariſh that come not to any Church at all, as againſt a few Chriſtians
that pray and preach without your book? what Informers, what
indictments, what proſecutions, what invectives are equally againſt
all theſe aforeſaid?</p>

that muſt cure the diſtance which you complain of?</hi> I have fully proved to
you in my book of <hi>Concord that we are utterly unable to remedy</hi> it. If
you will not know, who can make you know. Do you think, that

               </gap>lieving that it is all lawful? or to
make them all do that which they think to be unlawful? I muſt freely
tell you, that he that thinks that his own or any others reaſonings will
ever ſo far change all the truly honeſt Chriſtians in the Land, knoweth
ſo little of matters, men or Conſcience, as that he is unmeet to be a
Biſhop or a Prieſt.</p>
            <p>But is the remedy impoſſible to the <hi>Impoſers?</hi> I am aſhamed to

to bring his action againſt him, for ſaying, <hi>you ſlander me.</hi> But it is
the name or thing that we muſt not deny. We will gratifie you in
the firſt: I do ſeparate from your Church, by half a miles diſtance, and
by going to my own pariſh, and by preaching my ſelf, and ſo do moſt
of the Pariſh Preachers, that will not ſit hearing you when they
ſhould preach. But it is <hi>de re.</hi> And what is it, Firſt I muſt tell the
matter of fact: I never took any paſtoral charge theſe twenty years;
I gathered no Church: I never baptized one perſon: I never admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
the Lords Supper once, in about eighteen or nineteen years;
but of late ſeldom to ſome few, ſince aged weak perſons who were in my
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60845:40"/>
houſe, and near, who gave me ſpecial reaſon for it; and the Liturgy
alloweth it to the ſick and all their friends that joyn with them: while
I lived at <hi>Acton</hi> and <hi>Toteridge</hi> I went twice each Lords day to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, even to the beginning: Here I go when I am able uſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
once a day to hear the Parſon of the Pariſh; and I communicate
with them in the Sacrament: I preach twice a week in another
mans Pulpit (borrowed) moſt to ſtrangers that I have no more to do
with: My gain I thank them, the accuſer put me not to excuſe: I
write and preach againſt Schiſm and all unjuſt ſeparation, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
all to go no further from any than they go from Chriſt, or than
they drive us away, or than we needs muſt, to avoid actual ſin. Well;
now what is the crime of ſeparation?</p>
            <p>1. I <hi>preach</hi> (you ſay) <hi>when and where it is forbidden by Law.</hi>] <hi>Anſ.</hi> Is
this the <hi>formal reaſon of ſeparation?</hi> Then <hi>diſobedience</hi> and <hi>ſeparation</hi>
are all one. I ſuppoſe you mean the Law of the King and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and not the Canons ſave as by them made Laws: when I had
given you ſo many Hiſtorical inſtances of the ancient Biſhops and
Chriſtians, doing the like, and juſtified commonly by the Church: did
you think while you ſilently paſs all that over, and all the reſt that I
ſaid for my juſtification, that two lines of your ſaying was enough
to confute all? Certainly it was not me that you meant to ſatisfie, nor
any impartial man that had read my books. This dealing beſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
not ſo weighty a Cauſe. You ſeem to ſay [<hi>All preaching when
and where it is forbidden by Law, is ſinful ſeparation: But,</hi> &amp;c. I deny the
Major. The Primitive Preachers did ſo for three hundred years:
The Orthodox did ſo afterwards under <hi>Conſtantius, Valens, Theodoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
junior, <hi>Anaſtaſius, Philippicus, Juſtinian</hi> and many more: The <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes,
Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Bohemians</hi> did ſo: The Reformers did ſo: The
Proteſtants when the Interim was impoſed did ſo: <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> juſtifieth
it at large, and the <hi>Arminians</hi> in <hi>Belgia,</hi> did ſo: The Martyrs in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and elſewhere did ſo. The Jeſuits in the <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> did ſo.
But what if the Law forbad you to preach at a certain hour—do
you ſeparate from the Church, if you miſs your hour? They that
Preacht Afternoon Sermons when forbidden were taken for diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
but not for ſeparatiſts. And what if when the Churches here
were burnt the Miniſters had read the Liturgy and preacht in a place
forbidden by the Law: Had that been ſeparation?</p>
            <p>And how cometh [<hi>when</hi>] and [<hi>where</hi>] to be in, When we are
forbidden <hi>every time and in every place,</hi> to preach to more than four.
Is any <hi>time</hi> or <hi>place</hi> allowed us to preach in? You mean [<hi>He is a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſt
who preacheth being forbidden by Law:</hi> But I am ready to give you
a fuller proof than is now to be offered on this occaſion, <hi>that no man</hi>

               <hi>hath authority to forbid a faithful Miniſter of Chriſt, who forfeiteth not

               <hi>that we remain under a Divine obligation to it, which ſuch a Law
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> diſſolve,</hi> As Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> before ſaith [if Princes forbid us, we
<hi>muſt go on with our work:</hi> what if the King had turned againſt Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
and Liturgy, and forbad all the Epiſcopal to preach. Would
you think it ſinful ſeparation to preach. By this you ſhew how eaſily
you would lay down the work you are Vowed to, if the Law did but
forbid you. How much then are Papiſt and Proteſtant Caſuiſts mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
that ſay the Law is null that is againſt the common good, and
that all power is only to edification.</p>
            <p>And what limits do you ſet to this. Till you tell us, how can we
judge of our ſeparation: what if an interdict ſilence all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
in a Kingdome, muſt all obey? What if it be moſt, muſt moſt
obey? What if it be more then can be ſpared without the Churches
wrong? And whoſe Laws be they that ſo binds us: Is it Infidel
Princes or only Chriſtians. Is it Papiſts, Arrians, Eutychians, &amp;c.
or only the Orthodox? And do you ſet the people all to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King be Orthodox, as the rule of their obedience to his Laws.
If I prove not that God bindeth me to preach, call me diſobedient,
but yet that will not prove me a ſeparatiſt.</p>
            <p>By this rule you may be a ſeparatiſt, as oft as the Law changeth, if
you will not change as faſt as it. Yea though you Judge the Laws
impoſitious to be hainous ſins, yet you muſt do them all or give over
your Miniſtry: And ſo God muſt ask leave of the Rulers to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped
as God. If he were a God of their making, they might put
him down.</p>
            <p>And, I think, it will prove confuſion and worſe diſobedience than
our preaching is, to lay all the peoples obedience herein on their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Rulers Orthodoxneſs: no doubt, but the heathen and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
Rulers are Governours even of the Church, though none hath
power for deſtruction or againſt God. The Duke of <hi>Brandenburghs</hi>
Subjects judge him not Orthodox: Are they therefore abſolved from
obeying him in matters of Religion? <hi>Calveniſts</hi> Subjects think <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane</hi>
Princes not Orthodox; and Proteſtants, in <hi>France, Hungary, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
judge their Papiſt Kings not Orthodox: Yea, what if we judge
the Biſhops not Orthodox that made the Cannons or Liturgy, are we
abſolved from obeying them. And what if any Subjects think that
the King is not Orthodox? And Parliaments, who alſo make our
Laws, contain men of many minds: And the Parliament of 1640.
is ſaid by the Biſhops to have been far from Orthodox, even to have
been Presbyterians, and Eraſtians, and even for Rebellion; and yet they
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60845:41"/>
made divers Laws which the King conſented to and ratified: Were
not men obliged by thoſe Laws: And indeed if the Lawmakers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not Orthodox null his Laws about Religion, why not all his other
Laws.</p>
            <p>But it may be you will ſay, that it is not all the people that muſt
judge whether the King and Parliament be Orthodox, but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
for them. <hi>Anſ.</hi> But who ſhall judge whether the Biſhops be
Orthodox? And if all be reſolved into the implicite belief of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
why not of the civil Rulers as well? Or why not as the Papiſts
on Pope and Councils?</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe to avoid all this you will not ſay, that he is a ſeparatiſt
that preacheth when forbidden by any Prince whatſoever, Turk, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
Arrian, Eutychian, Idolater, Papiſt? Where then will you fix
the notifying Character? All men are heterodox in ſome degree?
How ſhall we know the degree which abſolveth us from our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</p>
            <p>And how cometh an Orthodox man to be authorized to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
and forbid the needful preaching of the Goſpel any more than
a heretick? or a Chriſtian more than a heathen? I think he is bound
to do more good then they, and not authorized to do more hurt? God
never made him a judge whether the Goſpel ſhall be preacht or not,
nor whether the people ſhall be ſaved, or left to periſh in their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and ſin.</p>
            <p>Either then all are ſeparatiſts that preach againſt the Laws of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
Hereticks or Papiſts: And ſo the Orthodox Churches have in
many or moſt Ages and places been ſeparatiſts: or elſe we are
caſt upon confounding impoſſibilities to know who the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt
is.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially in <hi>Ariſtocracies</hi> and <hi>Domocracies,</hi> where the Rulers are of
many minds, and the people can never know them all, nor when the
Orthodox, have the Major <hi>Vote.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I would know, whether it be only Rightful Princes or alſo U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers,
whoſe Laws are the bond of the Churches Unity. If of Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
then all the Prelates that conformed not in the times of the late
Uſurpation were Schiſmatical ſeparatiſts by your definition: But to
do them right, few of my acquaintance that could by conformity
ſlay in, did then refuſe conformity: I hear that you were then no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſt.
But Biſhop <hi>Guning,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wild,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hide</hi> and a great many
more, took another courſe; and will not thank you if you ſtigmatize
them with us. But if it be not the Laws of Uſurpers in the Roman
Empire by your meaſure? How few were the Emperours that came
not in by meer conqueſt, or by killing, putting out the eyes or eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60845:42"/>
their predeceſſors, or without any juſtifiable right? And what a
caſe <hi>Rome, Italy, Spain</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> were in after the firſt conqueſts of
the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> and all the Weſtern Empire in the days of the
<hi>Henries, Frederick</hi> and many others, while men were fighting for the
Empire and Popes claimed the making and unmaking of them all;
And even in <hi>France</hi> ever ſince the days of <hi>Chilperic</hi> for many Ages,
eſpecially among the progeny of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, it is not to be hid:
This way you deſtroy or confound the Churches.</p>
            <p>I cannot imagine what you will reply to this? unleſs you ſay that,
[<hi>it is neither the Title, nor the Orthodoxneſs of Princes, which is neceſſary to
make their Lawes the bond of Church unity: but it is the goodneſs of their
Laws: at leaſt that they impoſe no ſin upon us</hi>]. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Then if the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers

               </gap>. Let that be the rule: who ſhall be judge whether it be ſin or not? If
I be a diſcerner for my ſelf, I have told you how much and great ſin I
fear, till you are diſpleaſed with the intimation: And when you have
proved all thoſe particulars named, to be no ſins, you have done more
than yet is done: And if you think you can or do prove it, muſt
none have Chriſtian Communion who think your proof invalid, and
that you do it worſe than Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> that maintained hurtleſs
lying.</p>
            <p>§ 56. <hi>But the other half of the definition of a ſeparatiſt is</hi> [they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
Sacraments by other Rules and after a different manner than what
the Church requireth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Why will you ſo reproach your Church? we do it by no other
rule but the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and doth not the Church require that the Scripture
be a Rule? You know <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> and other Papiſts, ordinarily make
this ſignal difference of Proteſtants and Papiſts, that the Proteſtants make
the Scripture the only Rule of their Religion: On which ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>Francis Peron</hi> formed his act of diſputing againſt them. And
are not the Church of <hi>England</hi> Proteſtants? If you add another rule,
it followeth not that we have another than you have, though you
have another beſides what we have.</p>
            <p>2. You ſay [<hi>we deny the fact which is evident to all perſons</hi>] and you
ſpeak of me: Is this true? What Sacraments do you mean? I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ordained any: I never confirmed any: I have married very few,
if thoſe be Sacraments: I have baptiſed no one theſe twenty years:
I gave the Lords ſupper to none for about eighteen years, and rarely
ſince as I told you. <hi>But, others do? Anſ.</hi> And if they have no better
reaſon to juſtifie the forſaking of their Miniſtry than you give, well
may they go on to do it.</p>
            <p>3. Do you mean here by [<hi>Rulers</hi>] the ſame as before by [<hi>Laws</hi>]
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60845:42"/>
or what mean you? I ſuppoſe it's the Canon and Liturgy that you
mean. And if by the [<hi>Church</hi>] you mean any thing but the <hi>King and
Parliament</hi> you are unintelligible: For the Church hath but two viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
eſſential parts, the Regent and the <hi>Subject</hi> parts. And of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
only the ſupream is eſſential, the reſt being alſo ſubjects, and but
Integrals: And it is a [<hi>Requiring</hi>] Church which you mention. And
ſo it ſeemeth that it is but a <hi>lay Church:</hi> And nothing but a <hi>Chriſtian
Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. I have told you that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches here admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
the Sacraments by another rule than your Liturgy, and yet are
no Schiſmaticks.</p>
            <p>5. And your rule hath many parts: It requireth Preaching, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
reading the Pſalms and two Chapters, and delivering baptiſm
and the Lords Supper in Chriſts words, and repeating the Creed, the
Lords Prayer and the Decalogue. And all that I do when I officiate
for any man (for I have no Church,) and others do it with whom I
converſe. But if it be omitting <hi>any thing</hi> elſe in your rule that mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

7. But I had thought that we had not been like thoſe late cavilling
Papiſts that will not diſtinguiſh <hi>fundamentals</hi> from any little points,

good Law and Rule diſtinguiſh between <hi>Eſſentials, Integrals, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,</hi>
and make more Accidents than are <hi>Integrals, and Integrals,</hi>
than are Eſſentials? And doth your rule do otherwiſe? If not, tell
us what <hi>parts</hi> of your rule are neceſſary to one, and what to the other,
or you ſay nothing to reſolve the caſe. Is every line and Ceremony
Eſſential to the Church, and to each member? If not, how cometh
our omitting a form of Ceremony to cut us off as a ſeparated Church
any more than every breach of Law cuts off a man from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth?</p>
            <p>Yea, if your Church be but a <hi>Chriſtian Kingdom,</hi> do not you cut
off all from that Kingdom too, that refuſe your Forms or Ceremonies
or Subſcriptions?</p>
            <p>8. But Sir, to be ſhort with you, <hi>I will yet believe that Chriſt is
the Inſtitutor of the</hi> Church; and that he hath himſelf made Laws
which are ſufficient to be at leaſt the bond of their unity, yea for
more than <hi>Eſſentials,</hi> even the <hi>Integrals,</hi> and many Accidents; and
hath given Laws to regulate all mens Laws that determine of need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
undetermined accidents: And that no man ſhould be cut off
from the Church or taken as ſeparated that breaketh no Law of
God, yea thoſe that are neceſſary to Church unity and Communion:
And that the grand Schiſmaticks of the world, are the Engineers that
fabricate needleſs, impoſſible dividing terms and conditions of unity
and Communion.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It's a Foul miſtake in matter of Fact, if you think that I
<hi>was that Aſſembly,</hi> yea or <hi>any one</hi> of them; or that what they did, I did:
or thoſe of my acquaintance did it. And it is not much better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that I or they were in all things of their mind: Doth the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
judgment concern me any more than you? Did not you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to them as much as I did?</p>
            <p>2. But what mean you to wrong your Hearers by ſuch groſs confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to joyn in your Application Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> and <hi>me,</hi> (and Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi>
I think) with the Aſſembly, when it is publickly known that in thoſe
matters we were of three ſeveral opinions: (And who are they that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
not in as great matters?)</p>
            <p>(1.) It's known that except ſeven or eight, the Aſſembly men were
all <hi>Conformiſts</hi> when they came thither: And either they were <hi>ſuddenly
changed,</hi> or not: if not, they were <hi>Conformiſts</hi> ſtill, and then no
wonder that they were of your mind.</p>
            <p>And indeed I know that they were not all of one mind: Moſt of
them were moderate <hi>Conformiſts</hi> that thought it lawful, but that were
much better be without it, than make it a ſnare to ſilence Miniſters, and
divide the Church, and therefore were glad that it was laid by: Such
were Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burgeſs,</hi> and, I think, moſt. Some were for Dr.
<hi>Stilling fleet'</hi>s way, that no one form of Church Government was of
Chriſts Command, but all left to prudence as civil Government is: Such
was Dr. <hi>Edward Reignolds</hi> and ſome others; ſome were for the ſole
Government of the Magiſtracy, called <hi>Eraſtians:</hi> Such was Mr. <hi>Thomas
Coleman,</hi> and how many more I know not. Many of the Parliament lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
theſe Men beſt: And theſe were alſo for an indifferency of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
form: And when Mr <hi>Coleman</hi> was choſen to give the Covenant to
the houſe of Lords, they took it on his Expoſition, that it meant not
the Excluſion of the Primitive Epiſcopacy: ſome were more tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of the <hi>Primitive Epiſcopacy,</hi> and about to enter a proteſtation for
it; but that it was declared that <hi>only the</hi> Engliſh <hi>form as deſcribed in the
Concatenation was excluded:</hi> Theſe were Dr. <hi>Cornel. Burges,</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60845:44"/>
               <hi>Thom. Gataker,</hi> and many more; And ſome few were for the
<hi>Divine right of Presbytery</hi> (and after more:) And the five diſſenters and
Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> were Independents. But take them as <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtians,</hi>
and as Indifferents, and judge whether they were not more of
your judgment, then of Dr. <hi>Owen's</hi> or Mine, and it's no diſhonour to
you: for I think I have not read of many Aſſemblies of worthier men
ſince the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> days. But they were but men.</p>
            <p>But if indeed they <hi>were all ſuddenly changed from Conformity to
Presbytery,</hi> when they came to <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> what a diſhonour is ſuch
mutability to <hi>Conformiſts?</hi> And how little hold is there of them; if ſo
many of the beſt of them will ſo eaſily change with the times? What
wonder if you ſhall do ſo?</p>
            <p>2. And as for Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> he was known to joyn with the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents:
And ſure you will not intereſs him in the Aſſemblies Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>3. And Mr. <hi>Corbet</hi> and I are of one mind; And I thought that the
truth was divided beween the three parties, and that all of them wanted
neceſſary skill and diligence for the healing of thoſe diviſions and the
concord of the faithful: And the event excuſed me in that cenſure.
And now, is the <hi>Synods</hi> Judgment more ours or yours?</p>
            <p>(2.) But either this <hi>Synod</hi> were in the right or not: If not, why
then will you follow them, or plead their teſtimony? If yea, then
they did well in being againſt the Liberty of the <hi>Prelatiſts</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>(3.) But is it poſſible that you can expect that men ſhould believe,
that <hi>their Caſe</hi> and <hi>ours</hi> are the ſame, or that either <hi>All</hi> muſt be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
or <hi>none</hi> that conform not; and that the bare talking for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Toleration, without diſtinguiſhing the Tolerable from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
doth tend to mens Edification? He that will tolerate all, is
bad; and he that will tolerate none that differ, is mad. As it's an ill
argument, <hi>Veſpae habent favos, &amp; apes habent favos; Ergo veſpae ſunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes:</hi>
So it is not a good one to ſay, <hi>Waſps Neſts ſhould be deſtroyed:
Ergo Bee-hives</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>§. 60 But wherein lay the different Caſes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> In many things and great, however you untruly make them
like.</p>
            <p>Firſt the Aſſembly never endeavoured to turn the Independents out
of the Pariſh Churches, and benefices, nor to ſilence them, forbidding
them publick preaching, as you do us; but only would hinder them
from gathering Churches out of other mens Pariſhes.</p>
            <p>2. The Aſſembly put on the Independants, no Oath, no Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Profeſſion, Subſcription, or Covenant as neceſſary to their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
which both ſides confeſſed not to be lawful; and ſo would have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60845:44"/>
impoſed no poſitive bond which they ſcrupled, but only the ſaid O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of their promiſcuous unlimited Church-gathering.</p>
            <p>3. They impoſed no Liturgy, no one Ceremony, no practice on
them, contrary to their Conſciences.</p>
            <p>4. They urged them to declare but what Limits they would allow
to their Church-gathering Liberty; that it might not extend to Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and the intolerable, and could not prevail; Judge now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theſe Caſes are of any kin? Save in the <hi>genus</hi> of not allowing
unlimited Toleration, which we hold to as well as they. Grant us
leave to Preach in the Publick Churches, and to be capable of guiding
reformed Pariſh Churches, yea, or but to Preach or Officiate Publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for nothing, though we live on Alms and beg our Bread, and we
will thank you: Yea, though you hold us to all the terms and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
in the Kings Declaration about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs: And is
this like the Caſe of the Aſſembly, that never offered either to ſilence
an Independent, or forbid him Parſonages, Lectures, Colledge pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
or impoſe on him any one ſcrupled promiſe, profeſſion or
practice?</p>
            <p>And yet <hi>I</hi> again ſay, both ſides were faultily wanting in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and uſe of the terms of Peace.</p>
            <p>§. 61. Serm. <hi>p.</hi> 35. [So that whatever falſe colours and pretences
ſome men make uſe of to juſtifie their preſent practices, if the judgment of

one party ſaith, if the King and the Biſhops Command contrary Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations,
Verſions, Times, Places, Liturgies, and modes of worſhip, the
Biſhops are to be obeyed before the King, and the other ſaith the
King is to be obeyed before the Biſhops. To omit abundance of
greater differences than ſome would perſwade men is between us and
them.</p>

can little know, while the ſpeaker oft little knoweth it himſelf or

a Confutation of your Sermon, that it's hard to know how a mind
not ſtrongly prejudiced could have preached ſuch a Sermon, or plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the ſilencing of ſo many ſuch Miniſters from ſuch a text; Yea,
or can need any more to confute you than to read your Text: 1. It is
ſuppoſed that it was All that had attained to the truth of Chriſtianity
that muſt walk by the ſame rule. 2. It was a Divine Rule then known.

            <p>And to pag. 37. We come as near you as we can in Conſcience;
and we know our own Conſeiences better than you do. But whether
you condemn not your ſelves as Separatiſts in denying communion

that we dare not Preach. And is not <hi>Printing</hi> a far more Publick
declaration, than ſpeaking it in one Room?</p>
            <p>2. When I began to Preach at St. <hi>James'</hi>s, I read a Profeſſion to
the Congregation openly, that I preacht not there as to a ſeparate
Church, but as in concord with all Chriſts Church on Earth, for the
neceſſity of the People that had not many of them heard a Sermon
many a year, the Pariſh having 40000 if not 60000 Souls more than
could hear in the Pariſh Church.</p>
            <p>3. I built a Chapel by money partly begg'd, and partly to my
greater loſs than I will mention, that I might but have helpt thoſe
needy Souls for nothing: For the ſecond Sermon, one that Preacht
for me (that had ſuffered impriſonment for the Kings Cauſe) was
ſent to Gaol, to my great Trouble and Charge. And when I might
not uſe it (ſaid One in Power, <hi>Though you would uſe the Common-Prayer
there) I</hi> gave it up to the uſe of the Pariſh, and take it thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
of Dr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> that he will there teach his People.</p>
            <p>4. I have many and many a time in the Pulpit openly Preacht
againſt Separation, even what he now deſireth.</p>
            <p>5. Not paſt a Fortnight before his Sermon, I Preacht near him (at
the Verge of his Pariſh in my Lecture) two whole Sermons of it, on
<hi>Luk.</hi> 15. the Caſe of the two Sons; ſhewing that there are three
notable ſorts of Separation. 1. The <hi>Perſecutors</hi> that forcibly ſcatter
the Flock, as the Papiſts by dividing, ſinful impoſitions. 2. The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Separatiſt</hi> like the Prodigal, who had rather be at the Tavern,
the Play-houſe, the Whore-houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than at Church. 3. The
<hi>paſſionate peeviſh honeſt Chriſtian,</hi> as in the Text, [<hi>He was angry and
would not come in.</hi>] Here I ſhewed by many reaſons, how faulty and
hurtful this miſtaking paſſionate Separation is: And I took that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to give them many <hi>Reaſons why I communicate with the Pariſh
Church my ſelf, and Separate not from them;</hi> and I told them my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they that <hi>ſuffer meerly for not-hearing, or not-communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thrice a year</hi> as the Law requireth, cannot juſtifie their Cauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome extraordinary reaſon, if they live in a Pariſh that hath a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
capable of that Office. But I did not malignantly equal the Son
that had long <hi>ſerved his Father, and not tranſgreſſed his Commandment,</hi>
with his Brother in his Prodigal deſertion of his Father: But on the
next words [<hi>His Father went out to him and intreated him to come in;</hi>]
I ſhewed that Gods Condeſcention, and Method in ſatisfying his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
paſſionate Children, ſhould direct Miniſters and others how they
alſo ſhould deal with ſuch. And that violence inſtead of loving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60845:46"/>
reaſoning and neceſſary forbearance of ſuch Infirmities,
ſheweth, 1. That ſuch conſider not the corruption of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n are. 2. They know not what need of
Forbearance they have themſelves; nor how liable they are to <hi>Error</hi>
and to Sin. 3. They imitate not God our Father and Saviour, and
know not what manner of Spirit they are of. 4. They have not due
acquaintance with the preciouſneſs of Gods Grace and Image, that
cannot perceive it, if there be but ſuch an Errour or Paſſion to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
it. 5. They conſider not that they alſo may be Tempted, and
what Temptation may do even with upright Souls. 6. They are
ſtrangers to the Paſtoral office; They ſhould excel in Love and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
as much as in Knowledge, and as mothers quiet crying Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and not therefore caſt them out of doors. 7. They Croſs the
ends of the Miniſtry, if they take the Converting of Souls to be any
of its end: For as Generation ſo Regeneration maketh <hi>Infants</hi> and
<hi>Children</hi> before they are grown Men; and Children will be weak and
troubleſome: And he that would have no ſuch Children, muſt not
endeavour mens Converſion. 8. Yea, they greatly increaſe the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
which they would Cure: Men will not love thoſe that hurt them
ſo eaſily as others: And when they are diſpleaſed with you, they are
the hardlier pleaſed with your Doctrine. 9. Driving men into the
Church, maketh it like a Priſon and corrupteth it as compoſed of invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Members. 10. Yea, they muſt deſtroy the Church, if they will
ſuffer none in it that have as great weakneſſes as theſe. Thus I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
both the evil of paſſionate Separation, and of miſtaking the
way of Cure. I would repeat the Sermons, were it not for fear of
being tedious.</p>
            <p>6. I have Printed in my ſecond <hi>Plea for Peace,</hi> what our <hi>Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity

9. I could not have drawn the People ſo much from too great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
if I had not preached to them. At <hi>Acton</hi> I conſtantly heard Dr.
<hi>Rieves,</hi> and his Curate, and I preached only in my houſe between
his Sermons, and then led the People to the Church, which Judge <hi>Hales</hi>
my neighbour thought was good ſervice to the Church. And the very
Sermon that I was ſent to the Common Gaol for, was on <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.
<hi>Bleſſed are the meek,</hi> perſwading to ſubmiſſive peace and patience.</p>
            <p>10. When Biſhop <hi>Morley</hi> forbad me to preach in his Dioceſs, and
I could not get leave at my departure to Preach to my hearers one fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
Sermon in publick; I Preacht in a private houſe to them on <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid'</hi>s
words [<hi>Bring back the Ark of God into the City, if I have found
favour,</hi> &amp;c.] purpoſely to perſwade them as my laſt advice, not to
depart from the publick Pariſh Aſſembly, though the Liturgy be there
the publick worſhip. But if the Miniſter that is there ſhall be intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

them not to own any ſuch Miniſter, nor encourage him in his Uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And it was on that account that they long forbore, till the <hi>Vicar</hi>
was dead and a better ſucceeded him.</p>
            <p>11. Since then I have written to my old Flock to perſwade them
to joyn in the Pariſh Aſſembly, and <hi>I</hi> hear not of three that do refuſe it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>3. But I confeſs they may find more profitable work than to preach
over all the ſuſpected paſſages in the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and other parts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,

Builders and Owners of the houſes are the fitteſt to do ſuch offices to

Would I have none taught the knowledge of Chriſt, but by my ſelf?
While we have all one Faith, it's ſome convenience for men to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Biſhops and Canoneers have done: Though ſome have ſpoken their
diſlike of me, none of them (even when they were in power) did ever

<hi>I</hi> think got into ſmall priviledged places, exempt from the Biſhops
power, and there preached moſt of them without the Liturgy, and all
without the Ceremonies: And was not this againſt Law. Sure Biſhop
<hi>Bancroft</hi> that deſcribeth their attempts to ſet up new Churches and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline

ſelf, than all my Enemies are. But Firſt, I may not be ſenceleſs of
the caſe of many better men, who have great families and no bread
but what they have by Alms in poor Countreys where the people are
fitter to receive than to give. And if they remove to bigger Towns
the Clergy tell them it is for gain, and they that have one, two, three
or more perferments, reproach them as covetous that will rather beg
than ſin or famiſh, yet your Mr. <hi>Hickeringil</hi> on the contrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth
<hi>how little they get:</hi> Were it my caſe as it is very many <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi>

be offered plenty if I would but do that which I take to be the hazard
of my Soul, I ſhould be ſenſible of the temptation.</p>

or books are diſtrained, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> I the rather ſpeak to this, becauſe a
Reverend Biſhop tells me alſo of this wrong, as if thoſe Biſhops
caſe were unlike to his; and citeth the words of the Hiſtorian that
mentioneth the ſuffering of the Churches in <hi>Spain</hi> on that account, as if
<hi>Maximus</hi> had but taken advantage of the Biſhops ſpleen to Tyrannize,
and prey upon the Churches. I deſire not to make any men ſeem worſe
then they are, nor cauſeleſly to open the faults of any. I profeſs to
the world that it is not in an impatient aggravating of any ſufferings of
my own (which are ſmall,) that I write this, but as the true ſtating of
the caſe between us. If the matter of fact be not truly ſtated, the
matter of <hi>right</hi> cannot be well determined. I hate falſe Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>1. It is agreed on by many of the beſt Hiſtorians of that Age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<hi>Beda,</hi> that <hi>Maximus</hi> wanted nothing but a good Title to make
him one of the beſt of <hi>Emperours:</hi> That he was ſaid to be made Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Souldiers, againſt his will, and being once in,
could not go back. His uſurpation was wicked, but a way too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in the Empire. He was of a pious life, and great zeal for the
Biſhops and the Orthodox Religion; what he did was to pleaſe the
Biſhops and to ſuppreſs Hereſie and Schiſme: And it's like enough
he thought by their friendſhip to ſtrengthen himſelf. He reſcued <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:60845:49"/>
at <hi>Milan</hi> from the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and by his threats deterred <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi>
(provoked by his Wife) from perſecuting him, and ſo preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Church of <hi>Milan</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>2 I read not of any of the Biſhops in all his Countreys that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
not with this Uſurper, ſave <hi>Martin, Theognoſtus,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe,</hi>
(that was preſerved by him.)</p>
            <p>3. It was not <hi>Ithacius</hi> and <hi>Idacius</hi> only, but all the Synod of the
Biſhops, that were guilty, and that <hi>Martin</hi> ſeparated from.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Priſcillians</hi> were down-right <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> and ſo are not the
Nonconformiſts, who you ſay agree with you in Doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. It is but the death of <hi>Priſcillian</hi> and a very few more that the
Biſhops were ſaid to have procured; and they were aſhamed of it
when they had done, and denyed that it was their doing. You force
me for Hiſtorical Verity to tell you, that they did not ſilence about
2000 Miniſters, which is worſe than many bodily afflictions; nor did
they deſire <hi>Maximus</hi> to make a Law that all that did not ſuch things <hi>as</hi>
ours, ſhould be ruined by Fines, Impriſoned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Make them not worſe
than they were. Our Quakers are much like the <hi>Priſcillianiſts.</hi>
Had it been but twice as <hi>many of them</hi> that had dyed in priſon, as were
put to death of the <hi>Priſcillianiſts,</hi> the caſes had not been much unlike.
But Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> that dyed in Priſon at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> Mr. <hi>Field</hi> that dyed

Mr. <hi>Joſeph Allen</hi> that had the ſame Lot, and many more ſuch, were
none of them like the <hi>Priſcillianiſts;</hi> but men of whom I and ſuch as
I come far ſhort.</p>
            <p>6. The great miſchief that thoſe Biſhops did was by ſuſpecting men
that <hi>Faſted</hi> and <hi>Prayed</hi> much, to be <hi>Priſcillians;</hi> they brought reproach
by unjuſt ſuſpicions in all Countreys on the moſt ſtrict Religious men; and
<hi>Martin</hi> was called by them a <hi>Priſcillianiſt</hi> for being againſt the Biſhops
Perſecution of them Let not me, but publick knowledge here make the
compariſon: How ſmall was this reproach, for extent and continuance,
in compariſon of that which by occaſion of Non-conformity hath been
caſt on men in <hi>England?</hi> My memory ſerveth me from 1623 or 24;
Commonly in the Countreys, if a man did but pray in his family, and
ſpend the Lords day in Religious Exerciſes, reading the Scripture,
or repeating a Sermon, or reading a good book, or ſinging a Pſalm,
and was againſt ſwearing and drunkenneſs, he was made the common
ſcorne, as a <hi>Puritane,</hi> and the Biſhops Articles, and their reproach of

               <hi>Schiſmatick, Separatiſt, Fanatick,</hi> to the like reproach of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs
and diligence in Religion, though not ſo univerſally as the
name <hi>Puritan</hi> was; Yea if a man had but been for Lectures, and
ſuch like helps as Arch-Biſhop <hi>Grindall</hi> was for (to his coſt) or for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon
Sermons, or would not read the book for Sunday dancing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
he was worſe than ſuſpected and reproached. My neighbours that I
once was a Teacher to, did never preſume to preach nor invade the
miniſterial Office, nor do anything but the work of private Chriſtians,
that is, to pray and repeat the Sermon, and ſing a Pſalm, but becauſe
many ignorant Families that could not read, could not do any of this
in their houſes, they joyned with the Neighbours that performed it,
and this not at time of Publick worſhip: yet becauſe that more than
four ſuch met, they were diſtrained on and laid in Gaoles. Compare
all this (and the removal of many hundred families our of the Land
heretofore) with the conſequents of the Biſhops zeal againſt the <hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But remember that it is not in my thoughts to lay any of this upon
the Biſhops that came in ſince the Impoſitions and actions aforeſaid, and
had no hand in them, and cry not to Magiſtrates to execute the
Laws, much leſs on men of ſuch known moderation as divers of them
are, nor on the Peaceable Conformiſts that own none of this.</p>
            <p>7. And it muſt be remembred that <hi>Martin</hi> was but an odd man, and
ſeemed ſingular againſt the Synods of all the Biſhops, and a man of
little Learning, like one of our Trades-men that is Religious. And
therefore I have wondred that <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binnius,</hi> and our <hi>Rich.
Hooker,</hi> did ſo openly decry the faults of the Biſhops here, and take
part with <hi>Martin,</hi> and not rather turn the reproach on him, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
Separatiſt, and Fanatick: But his Miracles ſilenced all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches;
with the rooted eſteem which ſerious Chriſtians will ſtill
have for ſerious Piety, when the Reproachers have ſaid and done their
worſt Elſe one unlearned <hi>Man</hi> that went in ſordid attire, and lived in
a ſmall thacht Cottage, and lay on the ground, and eat worſe than our
beggars do, and pleaded for the Gnoſticks perſons, was liker to have
been born down as a mad Fanatick, than ſuch men as Dr. <hi>Twiſſe, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Gataker, Richard Vines, Anthony Burges,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hughes, Joſeph Allen,</hi>
and about 2000 more.</p>
            <p>8. Laſtly, Let it be noted that the Cauſe of St. <hi>Martin</hi> was his <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that Hereſie and Schiſme,</hi> even as bad as the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> was not to be
<hi>puniſhed by the ſword,</hi> but only by Church cenſures; and therefore that the
Biſhops did wickedly, in calling for the Magiſtrates ſword againſt them
for then if the Heretick can get the Magiſtrate to be for him, the ſame
ſword may be drawn againſt the Orthodox: And ſo the <hi>Priſcillianiſts</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:60845:50"/>
once got a great Courtier to be for them, and a while turned the ſword
againſt their adverſaries, which occaſioned ſufferings in <hi>Spain</hi> and other
parts. And I wonder how <hi>Baronius, Binnius,</hi> or you that plead for
the ſilencing and other afflicting of Non-conformiſts, under the name
of [<hi>Non-toleration</hi>] and the <hi>Churches endeavours</hi> for <hi>Vniformity,</hi> can
poſſibly keep out the light which would tell you that we may give you
twenty to one in weighing your caſe and ours with <hi>Ithacius</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi>
if any impartial hand do hold the ballance. Is not your whole
<hi>cauſe,</hi> who cry out for the execution of the Laws, and againſt our To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,
(that is, that we are not to be endured) clean contrary to
<hi>Martins</hi> cauſe?</p>

Ejecting, Silencing, Ruining men for things unneceſſary, yea

with you in imputing to us the ſins of thoſe that were no Kin to us, and
we never ſaw.</p>
            <p>3. What a pitiful Caſe is Mankind in, if ſuch an Harangue of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
words can make them believe, that Tolerating or not-To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating
in Cauſes vaſtly different, are the ſame? Is it all one to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men Liberty to ſeduce men from the eſſentials of the Faith, and to
forbid many hundreds to preach Chriſts Goſpel, unleſs they will open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
profeſs that they Aſſent and Conſent to three Books, and Covenant
never to endeavour the Reforming of the Government of the Church,
<hi>&amp;c?</hi> Might not the Papiſts have ſaid to us juſt as you do [<hi>it is the ſame
thing</hi> for us to burn Proteſtants as Hereticks, as for you to expel the
Subverters of the Faith.] But you that are for ſilencing us all, for not

O whither may he rowl that is tumbling down the Hill! I was never

            <p>I do conſent. But 1. Did our 18 or 19 years Silencing them, do that?
2. Do not you do it, that make men believe that we are <hi>Intolerable</hi> and
to be Silenced, and that Separate from our Congregations as if it were
a ſin to join with us? 3. We deſire only a true ſtating of the Caſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>honeſt dealing</hi> which you demand, I and many others conſtantly
perform; and it's ill to intimate that we do not. But you add,</p>

you think not <hi>any,</hi> much leſs <hi>conſtant,</hi> Communion to be a Duty. It's
lawful to have Communion with the <hi>French, Dutch,</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> Church;
muſt conſtant Communion be therefore a Duty? It's lawful to have
Communion with an ignorant Reader, or a drunken Prieſt (at leaſt

that your Sagacity knoweth their hearts, and that all underſtanding

<hi>no Little Intereſt</hi> that moveth me; it is greater than a Deanery or a

Wealth and Pleaſure. 5. And expoſed my ſelf to be called a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

whom <hi>I</hi> have reaſon to ſay, Defend <hi>Grotius</hi> as one of their Religion;
who thought that the Proteſtants can never unite among themſelves till

even that of <hi>Trent</hi> are ſound in the Faith, and that ſecuring the rights
of Kings and Biſhops, and diſowning the Schoolmens abuſes, and the
Clergies evil lives, and reducing the Pope to rule us, not Arbitrarily

without us than with us, and after all, cry out themſelves that we are

that have eyes ſee, who doth more for Toleration of <hi>Popery,</hi> they
that ſay [<hi>Popery and you ſhall ſtand and fall together, except you will

had not rather (with you) that we were Silenced, than that we
Preach, who have been their greateſt Adverſaries? If you will rather
let in Toleration of Popery, than you will Tolerate Proteſtants that
