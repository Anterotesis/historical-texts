            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, That all dfficile words be shunned, by reason, that many people and children must sing that are unlearned.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That, so far as is possible, no words of the Text be wanting, for in the Text there be no idle words or superfluities to be retrinched, as in mens discourse.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If any words be added, that they be pertinent to make the sense clear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we see in the Text some words added. which are printed in smaller letters. PSAL. 16. 2. PSAL. 27. 8. PSAL. 54. 17. &amp;c.</p>

                     </gap>. I, said the Apostle, <hi>will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with understanding, and I will sing with the spirit, I will sing with the understanding also:</hi> This above all must be regarded, that the verse be very clear and easie to be understood: It is farre better without all controversie, that diverse words in a pertinent paraphrase be added, that people may understand what they sing, then to want one word of the Text, whereby the song is made obscure; The Apostle pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth <hi>five words</hi> with understanding, to <hi>ten thousand</hi> obscure: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 19. Saint PAUL is a great enemie to obscurity, and all faithfull Pastours must, and will set their face against it in all things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the soules that their Master hath bought with his bloud, and concredited to them: Let therefore all difficle words be shunned that are not in the Bible; as for the words of the Bible, all should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, A speciall care would be had, that so far as may be, the words of the Text be not changed with any other, that those that have their Bibles before them may read the words of the text in the song<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when other words are in the verse, the Text
<pb facs="tcp:97529:4"/>
seemeth uncouth to him that readeth or singeth: It greatly edifies when the words of the Song are the words of the Text; and this would be very carefully consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and aimed at by all that meddle with the tryall of our labours, that most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently they compare the words of the verse with the words of the Text, that none thereof be wanting, nor any others put into their place, so far as is possible to do the same; the Text must be the only touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone for tryall.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, He that medleth with such a work would have good understanding in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which is the Originall and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; The want of this, or the not taking heed, hath made all English verse that <hi>I</hi> have seen, make a very great fault, in mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking that which is said of God himself, in the PSAL. 82. 1. where it is said, <hi>God standeth in the congregation of the mighty, he judgeth among the gods;</hi> All the Psalmes in English verse that I have seen, by the <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> there understand <hi>mighty men,</hi> which is a very great mistake; the Originall He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew clearly lets us see, that it is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that is there called <hi>El:</hi> those be the words, <hi>Elohim nitsav bagnadath El,</hi> that is,
