            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>In the first action you haue <hi>Christ</hi> in the state of humiliation. In the second in the state of exaltation. In the first he is dying <hi>for sinne;</hi> in the second <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>This Priest was <hi>Christ,</hi> the eternall sonne of God, one with the Father, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

He it was that tooke vpon him this function to be a Priest, and to offer an all-sufficient sacrifice to expiate for the sinnes of the elect. And herein did <hi>Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> mainely differ from the Leuiticall Priests
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3226:8"/>
in that they were onely the persons offering sacrifice, and not the sacrifice it selfe; but <hi>Christ</hi> was both the <note place="margin">Christ both Priest and sacrifice.</note> Priest and Sacrifice: for there could no sufficient sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice bee found for the sinne of man, but onely <hi>Christ;</hi> and none worthy to offer the sonne of <hi>God,</hi> but onely himselfe.</p>
                  <p>But seeing <hi>Christ</hi> in the vnitie of his person had entertained a dualitie of natures, consisting of <hi>Deitie</hi> and <hi>Humanitie,</hi> hence arises a question.</p>
                  <p>Whether the Priestly office of Christ belong vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Quest. Answ.</note> his Godhead or to his manhood, or to both? The answer is, that Christ is this Priest according to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature separately or diuided, but according to both natures ioyntly, as he was both God and man. See this confirmed, <hi>How much more shall the blood of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ who by the eternall spirit, offered himselfe to God, purge our consciences from dead works to serue the liuing God.</hi> By which eternall spirit we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his <hi>eternall Godhead,</hi> concurring with his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to make him a perfect Priest. <note place="margin">Why Christ as Priest was to be God end man.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reasons why the Priestly office of Christ did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that he should be both God and man are these. First as he was a Priest, so was he to be a Mediatour; but he could not be a Mediatour except he were God and man; for <hi>Opera Christi Mediatoris sunt The andri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca: The workes of Christ which concerne his Mediatour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>

                     <hi>proceede from both natures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, because he was to be a Priest after the <hi>order of Melchisedech,</hi> so that he must bee <hi>apator</hi> and <note place="margin">

                     <hi>ametor, without father, without mother,</hi> as <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech</hi> was. Now he was not without father but as hee was man, nor without mother but as he was God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:3226:8"/>
Thirdly, because hee must be both God and man that reconciled in one God vnto man, and man vnto God.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, because no creature could satisfie Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>but onely God, none ought but onely man; wherefore the Godhead of Christ did giue unto his manhood efficacie and merit to deserue at Gods hands remission of our sinnes: for the manhood of it selfe without the Godhead hath no vertue or effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to be meritorious; So it appeares that Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus was the High Priest for his elect, according to both natures:</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Priesthood of Christ there are three things obseruable.</p>
                  <p>First, that albeit Christ was a Priest, yet he did not arise out of the Priestly stocke of <hi>Aaron,</hi> he was not of the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> but of the Princely stocke of <note place="margin">Why Christ did not arise out of the Priestly stocke of <hi>Aaron.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Dauid,</hi> being borne of the tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> aud that for these two reasons.</p>
                  <p>First, to shew that hee was not a Priest after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but of a new order differing from the Leuiticall as the <hi>Anti-type</hi> from the <hi>Type,</hi> the true Priesthood from the figuratiue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he arose of the Regall tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that so like <hi>Melchisedech</hi> hee might bee not onely a Priest but a King, Yet notwithstanding in the priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Aaron</hi> there were many resemblances of Christs Priesthood 1.

saluation of all beleeuers: in that by the merit of this oblation of his death and passion hee hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for all his members eternall glorie.

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But how can the sacrifice of Christ beeing (but finite and temporarie) be of infinite and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall merit?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The act of Christ vpon the orosse, offering himselfe a sacrifice for the sinnes of his Saints was a finite act, and temporarie, lasting but some certaine houres, and so consequently could not be of it selfe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>and eternall vertue: but if we consider that with his manhood there was inseparably vnited his Godhead which was of eternall and infinite efficacie; and Christs sacrifice was accepted of his father, not <note place="margin">Math. 3 17.</note> onely as the sacrifice of <hi>the sonne of man,</hi> but also as the sacrifice of the <hi>Sonne of God his onely begotten Son,</hi> then we mustneedes confesse the sacrifice of Christ to be of infinite and eternall merit. Here then is the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this doubt. Albeit the Manhood of Christ
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3226:10"/>
onely was the sacrifice for our finnes which did satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Gods wrath, yet the Manhood of Christ alone was not sufficient: for the Dietie must concurre (though not in suffering) yet in giuing vertue, power, and officacie to merite eternall life at the hands of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, wee are to obserue the parts of Christs Priesthood which are two.</p>

                     </note> whereby Christ hath payd the price for our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and hath giuen himselfe an all-sufficient ransome for vs. From which satisfaction ariseth our reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation whereby God is well pleased with vs in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </note> Priesthood of Christ, the Thesis or point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine followes, <hi>That there neuer was, nor euer shall be any Priest that could or shall hereafter offer a perfect satisfactorie sacrifice for the sinnes of the redeemed, but onely Christ Iesus the son of God.</hi> For if any creatures could haue satisfied for the sin of man, and reconciled him vnto God, he would neuer haue layd so heauy a burthen vpon his onely Son, as to endure the shame of cursed Iewes, and (which was tenne thousand times more) the infinite wrath of his heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the transgressions of mankind. And indeede Christ onely was sufficient for this office if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, he that was to offer such a sacrifice must bee <note place="margin">Reas. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> God and man, after the order of <hi>Melchizedech, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out father, without mother;</hi> which should be King of <hi>Salem,</hi> and authour of eternall peace; who was so but onely Christ?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee that offered such a sacrifice was of <note place="margin">Reas. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> no lesse worth, merit, aud dignity with God then the sacrifice it selfe; seeing (as <hi>Ireneus</hi> speakes) <hi>The sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice receiues its efficacy and value from the Priest that offers it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore the sacrifice that was offered for the sinnes of man, beeing of infinite worth and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, according as the sinne of man was of infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie, and deserued infinite punishment; so must the Priest likewise bee of infinite desert at the hands
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3226:11"/>
of God that must offer so great a sacrifice. Hereupon it followes that the humane nature of Christ beeing perfectly holy of it selfe, yet not infinitely holy, could neuer haue beene a sufficient sacrifice for our sinnes, had not the Dietie beene vnited to it, so to make him an infinite Priest, that hee might giue infinite merite and efficacie to his oblation. But a creature of infinit desert could not be found. Not Angels who are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in being, and whose holinesse is but deriued from God, his Sanctitie being the fountaine and theirs the streames. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>called Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, the Angell told <hi>Daniell, Dan.</hi> 9. that Christ should take away sinne by his sacrifice, and the <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 2.</note> holy Apostle sayes, <hi>Christ offered himselfe an oblation and sacrifice to God of a sweet smelling sauour.</hi> So that this sacrifice could be offered of none but Christ. Are they so many Christs?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, there was but one high Priest at once among the Iewes, to signifie that there was but one high Priest that could take away our sinnes by offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a satisfactory sacrifice. But are not they innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, hee that offered this sacrifice was to be of no lesse dignitie and worth then the sacrifice it selfe, seeing a sacrifice is accepted for his sake that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it. But dares the masse priest say he is himselfe of equall dignitie with the sacrifice he offers: or that it is accepted for his sake? No not for his eares.</p>
                  <p>Lastly the sacrifice that the Priest offers in the masse, either is the same that Christ offered or another; if it be another, then it is not propitiatory, seeing the true satisfactory sacrifice was but one according to the text, <hi>hauing offered one sacrifice.</hi> If it be the same, why then doe they make the sacrifice of Christ imperfect
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3226:15"/>
and weake by their so often reiteration; yea, why doe they make the Scripture false which sayes,, <hi>Hauing offered one sacrifice once for all.</hi> And as the Leuiticall sacrifices being so frequently repeated did shew that they were in themselues imperfect, and <hi>could neuer</hi>

                     <hi>make the commers hereunto perfect;</hi> so doth the often repetition of the sacrifice of Christ argue the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> But the factors of the Church of Rome will say, that Christ may haue deputies on earth in his stead to offer sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer hereunto two wayes. First, I say Christ is not bound to offer any more sacrifice at all; for the oblation of himselfe vpon the crosse did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate mans redemption, and put an end <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>all typical sacrifices of the law, and to his sacrifice which he was to offer for mans reconciliation? wherefore seeing Christ is not to offer any more sacrifice, what needes he a deputie to offer sacrifices, where neither seruice is required nor expected, what need is there of a substitute?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I answer by the way of admission; let vs grant that Christ is yet to offer sacrifice, or to continue his begunne sacrifice, which is most erroneous. Yet we must consider Christ two wayes. 1. as God. 2. as a Mediatour. As hee is God with the Father, and the holy Ghost, he hath Kings and Magistrates to bee his deputies on earth: therefore they are called <hi>Elohim</hi> Gods. But as he is a Mediatour he hath neither depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie nor vicegerent, neither king to rule ouer his Church, nor priest to offer sacrifice for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> If they aske what wee doe then with Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3226:15"/>
in the Church of England?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, wee make them not Mediatours and sacrificing priests (as <hi>Parmenian</hi> the heretick and the papists doe) but we haue them for such purposes as Christ hath commanded, namely, to administer the word and sacraments, to vse prayer and discipline in the Church, which is no part of the office of Christs eternall priesthood, or chiefe sacrificers dignity,</p>
                  <p>Plainely then doe appeare vnto vs the blasphemie and sacriledge of the Priests of Rome in establishing their massing priesthood, for while they seeke to maintaine their owne glory, they robbe Christ of his; endeauouring to confirme the multiplicity of their priests, they ouerthrow the singular priesthood of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But heere may bee demanded a question whether the title priest may properly be assigned to a Minister of the new Testament?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, howsoeuer it bee crept into the Church, yet (as learned <hi>Fulke</hi>) it is not a proper title for the ministers of the Gospell, in regard, that wee haue but one Priest Iesus Christ; for the office of the Priest is to offer sacrifice which doth not appertaine to the ministers of Christ Iesus, neither is the name priest any where in the new Testament ascribed vnto the Ministers in respect of their office.</p>
                  <p>But how then shal we answer to that place of <hi>Paul,</hi>

as sacrificing the Gospell; and so <hi>Erasmus</hi> translates it, explained by the word following, namely, that the <hi>offering of the Gentiles;</hi> where it appeares that a sacerdotall action is attributed vnto <hi>Paul,</hi> being a <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of the Gospell;</hi> and therefore that the title priest may as lawfully and conueniently be ascribed to him.

So <hi>Origen</hi> and other of the fathers tearme the preaching of the Gospell a priestly or sacrificall worke; not absolutely but comparatiuely and by way of simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> But here may bee obiected these testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scripture, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. 9. <hi>Reu.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Reu.</hi> 20. 6. by which place it appeares that there are priests of the new Testament which ought still to offer sacrifice vnto God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Vnto these places I answer, that if you consider who these are that are here spoken of, you shall finde them not to be onely the Clergie, but all faithfull Christians which haue not a materiall or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall priesthood but a spirituall and an internall, and so they doe offer spirituall sacrifices as I shall

                  <p>First, to speake somewhat of a sacrifice in generall, and of the kinds of sacrifices.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. To shew the necessity of this sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>First to speake of sacrifices in generall.</p>
                  <p>Sacrifice was instituted by God for the vse of man after his fall; for it is thought that if man had not sinned, there had neuer beene any institution of sacrifice. The persons imployed in sacrificing were
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3226:17"/>
men; for as the Apostle vnder the Gospell, would at <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 34. 1.

                     <hi>by God whereby we offer some externall thing vnto the true God, which wee know will be acceptable vnto him.</hi> I called it a sacred religious action instituted by God, because it was a part of Gods worship prescribed vnto the Fathers before the writing of the law in <hi>Sinai,</hi> and taught by them vnto their children from age to age, and after the deliuering of the law commaunded expresly to the people of Israel. Againe, it was a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and religious action, because it was to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed holily and religiously to Gods glory, the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Church, and the saluation of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son offering. Againe, I say it is the offering of some external thing: as <hi>Abel of the firstlings of his flock, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 4.</note> For it must be some outward visible thing animate or inauimate. I speake of the sacrifices of the law, and not of the Gospell, which I shall shew to be as well internall as externall. I say moreouer that it must be offered to the true God; and therefore all sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices offered by the Heathens vnto their Idolls and fained gods are improperly called sacrifices, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that it can neuer be called sacred which tends to the dishonour of the true God. Furthermore I say there must bee ioyned with this, Knowledge; for there can be no acceptable sacrifice vnto God, which is done ignorantly, without the knowledge of Gods holy will, the Apostle sayes <hi>whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinne.</hi> And <hi>without faith it is impossible to please God;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> now faith cannot subsist without the knowledge of that which we doe beleeue. Lastly I say it must bee a

thing acceptable to God. Therefore the price of a whore, the price of blood, a dogs head, swines blood, and the like, though they were offered yet are they abhominable, because they are forbidden, yea whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is unseemely or vndecent is not acceptable.</p>
                  <p>The Leuiticall sacrifices were of two sorts <hi>Ilastika</hi>

In the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory, propitiatory, or satisfactory sacrifice (for these different titles belong all to one thing) the Iewes had respect vnto their sinnes, and by the laying their hand on the beast, and slaying it before the Lord, they did in act confesse that they themselues had deserued death eternall for their sinnes, but by the blood of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ the immaculate lambe who was to dye for mankind, they were assured to receiue remission of their sinnes, and freedome from eternall death.

Expiatory sacrifice were also referred those oblations which were offered for the cleansing of lepers, for the purification of women after childbirth, for tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of dead bodies, for the sanctifying of Priests for all these pollutions had respect to the pollution of sinnes.</p>
                  <p>The other sacrifices were <hi>Eucharistica;</hi> or offerings of thanksgiuing, whereby they did testifie their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse for benefits temporall or spirituall; this kind of sacrifice was called <hi>Zebach Schelamim, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>And to this sacrifice were referred the <hi>meate offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and drinke offerings, the first fruits and the tenths</hi> all which were testimonies of their thankfulnes.</p>
                  <p>And indeed all sacrifices may be reduced to these two heads. Either <hi>Ilastika,</hi> or <hi>Eucharistika, Expiatory,</hi> or <hi>Gratulatorie.</hi> For according vnto Gods affection towards man, such were mens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>towards God. Now God is either angry with vs and so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth vs; or is well pleased and so blesseth vs; and all the effects of God vpon euery man are either bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings or cursings; when hee is angry, hee sends cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings; when hee is well pleased, hee sends blessings; wherefore hauing stirred him vp to wrath by sinnes, the Iewes offered <hi>Ilasticke</hi> sacrifices to appease his wrath; hauing appeased his anger and pleasing him
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3226:19"/>
by obeying his commandements, they obtained his blessings and fauours to their bodies and soules, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they offered <hi>Eucharisticke</hi> sacrifices to testifie their thankfulnesse to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Now in both these kinds of sacrifices had the Iews respect vnto the Messiah, fixing the eye of their faith vpon Christ that was to come, both in him expecting saluation by the satisfactory sacrifice of his death, and in him rendering thankes vnto <hi>Iehouah</hi> for all his blessings, which they were made partakers of through the Messiah.</p>

For before hee brake the bread and gaue the cup to his Disciples; it is the opinion of all ancient and moderne writers, that lifting vp his eyes vnto heauen, in the name of all the elect that were, are and euer shall bee in the world, he gaue thanks to his heauenly Father for all his blessings of nature, grace and glory, but especially for that remission of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But it is demanded, <hi>Which of these two sacrifices</hi> it is that the Apostle speakes of?

And for this reason the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that fell from God had no benefit by the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Christ, nor by his death and passion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he tooke not vpon him their nature, neither in

                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, the death of the beasts in the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall law did figure out the death of that sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which the Sonne of God was to offer vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for mans Redemption. So that in that nature wherein Christ dyed, in that nature he was to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: but Christ as he was God could not dye; for the Godhead is <hi>apathes,</hi> and cannot suffer; but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his humanitie he dyed truely, and not fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically, and in shew onely, as <hi>Marcion</hi> and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> heretically thought.

                  <p>First, hee was by his transgression guilty of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>before God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he was depriued of all his grace of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and righteousnesse which God had conferred vpon him in his creation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he was driuen out of Paradise, to signifie his banishment from the celestiall Paradise. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was necessary that there should bee a sacrifice
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3226:22"/>
offered for man.</p>
                  <p>First, that his sinnes might be remitted whereby he was turned from God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that he might be restored againe to the state of grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that he might be re-united and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto God, and inherit eternall life.</p>
                  <p>These three were effected by the sacrifice of Christ.</p>
                  <p>For first by this Sacrifice our sinnes are pardoned, and the guilt of all our iniquities is washed away by the blood of Iesus: hee was that promised <hi>fountaine</hi> which should <hi>be set open for Iudah and Ierusalem to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Zachar. 13. 1. Rom. 4. 25.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, by this sacrifice wee are made pertakers of his grace, whereby wee are comely in the eyes of God the Father, for hee thereby imputed his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse vnto vs, and communicated that life of grace which was radically in himselfe the head, vnto all his faithfull members: for by him it is that <hi>wee all receiue grace for grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hereby are wee entitled againe vnto the kingdome of heauen lost by our first parents: for <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>when this earthly tabernacle is dissolued,</hi> we are put inro possession of that <hi>building of God not made with hands which endures for euer in heauen.</hi> All these three are contained in one verse. Christ Iesus <hi>is made vnto</hi>

By this that hath beene spoken wee may note that the beginning, middle, and end of mans happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is from the sacrifice of Christ; by him wee are deliuered from the bondage of sinne; by him wee are in the liberty of grace, by him are wee estated in glory.</p>
                  <p>By him we haue our fetters knockt off, and our fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy rags cast away; by him we are arrayed with rich apparrell of holines and innocencie; by him wee are brought into his fathers presence and are accepted of God Almightie.

                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing then the saluation of all beleeuers is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought and consummated by the sacrifice of Christ, here may arise a question.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether there be any sacrifices to bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by Christians vnder the Gospell or no?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, there are not any Ilasticke or propitiatory sacrifices to bee offered for attonement with God; for to that end Christ <hi>hath offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe once for all.</hi> But as you haue heard that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are spirituall Priests, so they haue spirituall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to offer still vnto God; which sacrifices are these.</p>
                  <p>First, a broken and a contrite heart, <hi>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart</hi>

Wherefore the Fathers called it an vnbloody sacrifice, because it was not a proper sacrifice, but onely mysticall and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</p>
                  <p>And indeed this makes it not to bee properly a sacrifice; because in a sacrifice we giue vnto God, but in a Sacrament wee receiue from God; but in the Lords Supper wee giue not the body and blood of Christ vnto God, but receiue it from the minister as from Christ for the confirmation of our faith, which makes it to be properly and truely a sacrament: but a sacrifice it is called improperly and by representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus you see what was the sacrifice offered by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3226:24"/>
Christ, and what are the spirituall sacrifices of euery Christian.</p>
                  <p>Now followes the third branch of this first part <note place="margin">The end of Christs sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> of the text. Namely, the cause why Christ offered this sacrifice, or the end whereunto this sacrifice was directed, which is said here to be for sinne.</p>
                  <p>But this man hauing offered one sacrifice for sinne.</p>
                  <p>Here we are to note that albeit the Angels had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Note.</note> as well as man, yet it was not for their sinne that Christ offered sacrifice (for they had no benefite by his incarnation, death, or passion) but for the sinnes of mankind; and withall we are to obserue that albeit Christ was a man endued with true humane nature, yet in regard he was not a sinnefull man but a <hi>lambe without blemish and without spot,</hi> a lambe for his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. 19.</note> of nature, and without blemish for integritie of conuersation, therefore hee needed no sacrifice to be offered for him to purge his sinne, as all men els doe, but onely offered in behalfe of all beleeuers.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we may safely affirme that Christ recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued no benefit by his owne sacrifice in respect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <note place="margin">Christ tecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued no benefit by his owne sacrifice.</note> of his sinnes; for seeing hee was without sin, he needed no sacrifice to bee offered for himselfe. Wherefore the actiue obedience of Christ to the law did appertaine both to the elect, and to himselfe: to the elect that the law might be fulfilled by Christ for them, to himselfe, for as hee was a creature after the image of God, so was hee bound to obey the law of his creatour: but his passiue obedience appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth onely to the faithfull, seeing he had not sinned: therefore he deserued no punishment, and hauing not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>And when we say that Christ dyed for all, wee take it thus, that the death of Christ is sufficient to saue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>And for the first of these.</p>
                  <p>If this sacrifice of the Masse haue any ground in Scripture, the Papists will be sure to alleadge whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer may seeme to make for their purpose.

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I answere, let vs learne what this Altar is, and wee shall soone know what the sacrifice is. The scope and meaning of the Author is to prooue that as the beasts were burned without the campe which were offered for sinne-offerings for the people; so Christ suffered without the gates, being made a sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering for his elect; and as the Priest that serued in the Tabernacle had no part of that sinne offering, so they that trusted in the ceremonies of the leuiticall Law, and thought to be made perfect by legall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices; they had no part in Christ, and that because they did make frustrate the Crosse of Christ, which was the visible Altar, whereon hee was offered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gate.</p>

                     <hi>Christs sacrifice. And (saith he) according to this second manner, it is proper to this sacrament that Christ is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molated or sacrificed therein.</hi> Thus these great and learned Doctors, pillars I may call them of the Church of Rome confesse the same with vs, that Christ is not really, properly, and truely sacrificed in the Eucharist, but Metonymically; because therein is a representation of the death of Christ, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of his passion; and an application to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular beleeuer of the benefits of Christs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption vnto himselfe by faith.</p>
                  <p>And here we are to take notice of the reason, why the Fathers tearmed the <hi>Sacrament</hi> by the name of a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and why they called it an <hi>vnbloody Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing the whole outward seruice both of the Iewes and Gentiles consisted principally in sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it seemed hard and harsh to those that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted either from the one side or other, and like to giue much offence, if the Church should wholy abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish all sacrifices; because these Prosolites newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to Christianity did not beleeue that religion could subsist without sacrifices. Least therefore they might exasperate or prouoke either the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Christians applyed themselues both to heare and speake of altars and sacrifices; and for that the Apostles had taught them that all externall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices had their end in Christ, they therefore durst not giue any approbation to the continuance of Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish sacrifices, much lesse to Heathenish: therefore they called the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> their prayers, their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, their almes, and well-nigh euery religious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3226:42"/>
a Sacrifice, the Table of the Lord, an Altar, the Bishops, and Pastors, Priests. And thus the Fathers called the Supper of the Lord, the true Sacrifice of Christ, because of the truth of <hi>representation,</hi> and truth of the <hi>effect</hi> thereof to the faithfull, because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <note place="margin">August. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

                  <p>About the 1000 yeare they beganne to ordaine Priests, with these words, <hi>Accipe potestatem missas celebrandi, &amp; sacrificium offerrendi pro viuis &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis.</hi> Take power to celebrate Masses, and to offer Sacrifice sor the quicke and the dead.

those who had payed him a good price to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred when hee receiued the Sacrament, that inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally the vertue of his communicating might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them to saluation.

                  <p>But from the time of the Laterane Councill, this doctrine of the Masse tooke such roote, and spread it selfe so farre and so fast that the greatest part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope is darkned with the darke shade thereof; grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by degrees from an action of thanksgiuing to an Eucharisticall Sacrifice, and from thence to a Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory sacrifice by way of Mystery and Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and from thence to a true, proper, and reall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory sacrifice, equall with, nay farre more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all then the sacrifice that Christ himselfe offered vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the crosse. And this dangerous and blasphemous doctrine crept in the more easily by the ignorance of these latter ages both in the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, caused by the troubles of the Church of Rome; as also by the corruption of languages, which was in this last thousand yeares, occasioned by the mixture of diuers nations together in seuerall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and especially Italy; and this heresie beeing crept into the Church was fostered and nourished by the coldnesse of mens deuotion, the couetousnesse of the Priests, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>of the Bishops. The
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3226:49"/>
coldnesse of mens deuotion was such, that whereas in the feruent zeale of the Christian Church, the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Lord was celebrated euery Lords day, yea in some Churches euery day, and great multitudes resorted and thronged thereunto, yet in processe of time, men began so to neglect the Lords Table, that there was this law enacted to compel them to a more carefull respect of communicating, <hi>That such lay peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as did not communicate at the least euery feast of the Natiuity, Easter and Whitsontide should bee held for Infidells.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This law was afterward ratified by <hi>Charles</hi> the <note place="margin">Carol. Mag. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>138. 182. 167.</hi>
                     </note> Great; and vrged vpon the people.</p>
                  <p>But hereby it came to passe that the profits of the Priests were much curtalled, because the people brought not so many offerings as in former times; wherefore the Clergie thought to vse a speedy reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for this disease; and therefore began to teach them, that the Sacrament was not onely profitable for the saluation of the Communicants, but also for all their friends, and kindred liuing and dead, which the Priest should remember secretly with himself at the time of celebration; and this they called <hi>Vim <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, the force &amp; efficacie of the Masse.</hi> This broght in store of gaine to the Priests purse, as <hi>Diana</hi> did to <hi>Demetrius</hi> and his companions; and as the <hi>Pythonisse</hi> did vnto her <note place="margin">Act. 10. 25. Act. 16. 16.</note> masters; no maruaile then if they stand to maintaine that which maintaines them.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine of the Massing sacrifice they cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly built vpon two foundations, which were layd both at this time, the better to keepe the people in awe, and to cause the more respect vnto their sacrfice.</p>

                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:3226:49"/>
The first was <hi>Transubstantion;</hi> for after it was taught that the bread and wine was changed substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially into the body and blood of Christ, then what reuerence was too great for this sacrifice? who could doubt that it was Propitiatory?</p>
                  <p>The second was Purgatory; for then (might the people argue) if our friends departed out of this world doe abide the scorching flames of Purgatory; and that wee our selues must thither too; and if the holy sacrifice of the Masse hath such vertue as to ease the soules therein; then let vs out of charitie to our friends pay some portion of money to the Priest, for the cessation of their paines; and out of loue to our selues when we dye, let vs leaue grounds and goods to the Church that Masse may be sayd for vs when we are dead. Thus you see how the sacrifice of the Masse got footing: vpon what ground it stood, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues.</p>
                  <p>But God that still prouideth for his Church, will, and hath caused light to breake out of darknes, that albeit the darknes of Fgypt bee palpable, yet light shall shine clearely in <hi>Goshen;</hi> and to this end hath sent diuers of his seruants to deliuer truth out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and to manifest the light there of vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>

                  <p>Thus haue I let you see briefly (and I doubt more briefly then so ample a matter doth require) how the sacrifice of the Masse crept into the Church, and how it hath continued.</p>
                  <p>How first it was celebrated in a most plaine and simple manner.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it began to admit some encrease of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, especially the <hi>offerings for the dead,</hi> which was but a gratulation and thankesgiuing for them, vntill 200. yeares after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:3226:51"/>
Thirdly, <hi>prayers for the dead,</hi> got entrance into the Supper about 400. yeares; then came in <hi>Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and redemption of soules thence by Masses, though not generally taught nor authorized by any Councill.</p>
                  <p>About the 780. yeare <hi>Gregoryes Masse</hi> was publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken vp in the Churches of Italy, whereas before <hi>Ambrose his Masse</hi> was of more generall vse.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the disputations of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> began about the yeare 840., but were not fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded till the <hi>Councell of Lateran</hi> by <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, <hi>anno</hi> 1216. After which came in the offering of the body and blood of Christ vpon the altar. And after that, there followed the enclosing carying about and adoration of them. Thus grew the Church of Rome from euill to worse, till it came to that mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable state wherein it now is.</p>
                  <p>And as the Romanists are Innouatours in respect of the Sacrifice of the Masse, so are they also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect both of the Canon &amp; of the Ceremonies of the Masse: for whereas they boast that the forme of the Masse in respect of the Canon is so ancient, as that they deduce it from the Apostles, and to this end al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge the <hi>Ecclesiasticall Hierarchy of Dionysius,</hi> some of their owne writers doe question the veritie and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of that book, doubting whether it be spurious or no; and that the Canon hath admitted diuers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions by seuerall and sundry Popes appeares by their owne <hi>Polidore Virgill,</hi> whose words bee these. <note place="margin">Polid.

                     </note> the Idolatrous Romanes, (after the mysteries of their worshippe were finished) did communicate within the Temple little Cakes consecrated to the honour of their Gods to whom they did offer their sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>These little round cakes or hostes were eaten by the Sacrificer and the assistantes, standing and not sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The Flower whereof they were made, was called <hi>Mola;</hi> from whence is deriued this word <hi>Immolare</hi> to Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>These little cakes were diuers according vnto the diuersity of their gods and goddesses, and had on them the Images of those gods or goddesses, to whom they were dedicated. From whom our super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious Aduersaries haue beene bold to borrow their Idolatrous practise of offering a wafer cake with the Picture of Christ vpon the Crosse, which cake is no longer or it was, but (as they teach) is really transubstantiated into the very body of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Nor must I here forget to set before the eyes of the Christian Reader, the behauiour of the Masse-Priest, while he is offering his sacrifice. First he makes three
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3226:56"/>
crosses vpon the round host to signifie the threefold Doctrine of Christ, by the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost; in pronouncing these words, <hi>Haec dona, hoec munera, hoec sancta sacrificia illibata.</hi> Other Masse Glossers interpret the third Crosse to signifie the treason of <hi>Iudas.</hi> Then followes fiue crosses more to figure the fiue dayes of respite betweene Palme-Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and Good-Friday. Or otherwise the fiue wounds of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Of which fiue crosses, the three first are made to signifie the deliuering of Christ vnto the high Priest, Or to figure the price which Christ was sold for, to wit, three times ten which make thirty.</p>
                  <p>The other two crosses are made separately the one vpon the host, the other vpon the chalice alone, to play the two persons of Christ and Iudas, then hee stretcheth out his armes to figure Christ stretched on the crosse. Which done he maketh three crosses to represent the threefold estate of such as haue bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by that sacrifice, namely, those in Heauen, on earth, in purgatory.</p>
                  <p>He smiteth afterwards his breast, to play the part of the Publican repenting in the Temple: But this smiting must be with the three hinder-most fingers; for the thombe and the fore-finger are reserued to consecrate and transubstantiate the Host into the body of Christ; moreouer he smiteth his breast three times, to figure the three-fold offence of thought, word, and deede. Then he eleuateth the host to be adored. Then he lifteth vp his voyce to represent the person of the theefe, or the Centurion which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Christ in his passion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:3226:57"/>
Six other crosses are againe made, three vpon the chalice couered, to represent the three houres that Christ hanged on the crosse aliue; and the other three on the chalice vncouered (with the round host lifted vp againe) to figure the three houres that Christ hanged on the crosse dead. Then he kisseth the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and maketh two crosses to figure the water and blood that issued out of the side of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Then the Priest must take the couering cloath off from the chalice, and couer it with the patyne, to figure the breaking of the vaile of the Temple in the middest at the death of Christ. This done, the host is put from aboue the chalice and is couched vnder the corporas to figure the burying of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The Priest hauing thus acted the parts of Christ, of the holy Theefe, of Iudas, then acteth the person of the Centurion in singing the Pater Noster, by the seauen petitions whereof <hi>Durandus</hi> would signifie the seauen weepings of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen graces of the Holy Ghost, or the seauen Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, or the seauen deadly sinnes. This song finished, the Priest keepeth silence to signifie the silence, or rest of Christ in the Sepulcher.</p>

                  <p>Againe, the Masse is not so ancient as our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries pretend, neither in respect of the Canon, nor in respect of the Ceremonies, least of all in respect of the Sacrifice. The Canon being patched toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by sundry Popes, who haue added their parts and parcels at seuerall times. The Ceremonies as the diuers garments, holy-water, wax-tapers, the Offertory Prayer for the dead, Procession, &amp; the like, crept in also by degrees, one after another as their owne Histories declare sufficiently. And the sacrifice not acknowledged by any till within these 400 and odde yeares, about the time of the Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, vnder <hi>Innocent</hi> the third.</p>
                  <p>Now let the indifferent Reader iudge of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie of our Aduersaries who bragge so much of antiquitie, endeauouring to deduce their Masse from the Apostles time, against their owne consciences, and the credit of all hystories.

                  <p>And first for the maintaining of the sacrifice of the <note place="margin">Argum. <hi>1. Psal. 110. 4. Heb. 5. 6.</hi> Rhem. annot. Heb. <hi>7</hi> sect. <hi>8.</hi> Bellar. cap. <hi>6.</hi> Hoffmeist. asser. sacrif. Missae.</note> Masse they alleadge. That <hi>Christ is a Priest for euer after the order of Melchizedech;</hi> but the proper act of <hi>Melchizedechs</hi> Priesthood did consist in sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing vnder the formes of bread and wine. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The eternity of Christs Priesthood standeth in the sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of his body and blood in those formes by those Priests whom hee hath promised to continue in his Church till the worlds end. <hi>Rhemist. annot.

                  <p>And that <hi>Melchizedechs</hi> Priesthood consisted in oblation of bread and wine, they would prooue by these Reasons.</p>
                  <p>First, from the word, <hi>He brought forth.</hi> The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <note place="margin">Bellar. c. <hi>6. Translators of</hi> Doway. pag. <hi>56.</hi> annot. on Gen. <hi>14.</hi> &amp; pag. <hi>57.</hi>
                     </note> word is properly applyed to the bringing forth of a sacrifice; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. The like word is vsed to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abels</hi> sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because <hi>Abraham</hi> had no need of bread and wine to refresh himselfe, being returned with so great spoyle from his enemies, and so hauing suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to refresh himselfe with, it is likely <hi>Melchizedech</hi> brought them forth to offer to God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as <hi>Melchizedech</hi> is said to be the Priest of the High God, so it was requisite that the Scripture <note place="margin">Bellar. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:3226:59"/>
Fourthly, from the phrase of the words, <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech brought forth bread and wine, for hee was the Priest of the most high God;</hi> the scripture alleadging this as a reason of his bringing forth bread and wine, <note place="margin">Bellar. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> because he was a Priest, and did it to sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Christ is said to bee a Priest for euer: but this Priesthood cannot remaine, except his sacrifice remaine: therefore seeing the sacrifice of Christ on <note place="margin">Bellar. ibidem.</note> the crosse is done, he must haue another sacrifice dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be offered in the Church, and that is the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Melchisedech</hi> in bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>Vnto these we answer seuerally.</p>
                  <p>First, concerning the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Iaza</hi> or <hi>Iaksa,</hi> which they say signifies properly to bring forth a sacrifice; this is false, for it properly imployes as much as <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre,</hi>

                     </note> to bring forth; as if he should say, <hi>Exire feeit &amp; adferri panem,</hi> hee made bread and wine to bee brought forth, and the word is vsed in this sense most commonly: as, <hi>That thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel forth of Egypt.

And where it hath any relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a sacrifice, there it is ioyned either with the word sacrifice or oblation, restraining the generall signification thereof to the speciall act of offering or sacrificing.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore whereas many of them reade it <hi>obtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit, he suffered:</hi> they corrupt the text, for it is <hi>protulit, he brought foorth;</hi> and vnto this haue we the consent of all the Fathers, who note that it was rather a <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent</hi> act of his <hi>Regall</hi> office proceeding from his

                  <p>I answer, it appeares not that <hi>Abraham</hi> had refreshed himselfe by the spoyle taken from the kings, because in the refusall of the profer made vnto him by the king of Sodome, he protests that hee would not take any thing, saue onely that <hi>which the young men had</hi>

that he should be refreshed rather at his hands, then by the king of Sodom a wicked Infidell.</p>
                  <p>But suppose <hi>Abraham</hi> had refreshed himselfe and his souldiours with the spoyle, yet what knew <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedech</hi> that; wherefore in curtesie, and to expresse his inward a acrity, hee declares it by his outward li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality and bounty; and thus much may bee colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of the words of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who sayes, <hi>That Melchizedech ministred to Abraham and his host vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualls</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, whereas they say, that <hi>Melchizedech</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Priest of the high God, it was necessary that his sacrifice should be mentioned, but no sacrifice is mentioned but his bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>I answer there is mention made of his sacrifice <hi>implicitely,</hi> for in that he is said to be a Priest, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposes his offering of sacrifice; neither is it of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that his sacrifice should be mentioned, seeing he might be a Priest, albeit the matter of his sacrifice be not nominated; and doubtlesse many things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Melchizedechs</hi> Priesthood were concealed according to the saying of <hi>Paul. Of whom wee haue many things to say, which are hard to be vttered, because ye are dull of hearing;</hi> yet <hi>Paul</hi> shewes whereby hee <note place="margin">Heb. 5 11.</note> declared himselfe to bee a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But suppose the matter of his sacrifice be not spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, must it therefore needs follow that hee sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced bread and wine?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they ground vpon the phrase (<hi>for he was</hi>)
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3226:61"/>
alleadging it as a reason why hee offered bread and wine, <hi>for he was</hi> (say they) <hi>because he was the Priest of the high God.</hi>

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> Then mentioning his Priesthood he sayes, <hi>and he was the Priest of the most High God;</hi> and immediately shewing wherein he declares his Priestly office sayes, <hi>and bee blessed him;</hi> in the former is expressed his Kingly, in the latter his Priestly function.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly they say, the Priesthood of Christ cannot be eternall except there remaine a sacrifice, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines no sacrifice but of bread and wine, because the sacrifice vpon the crosse was finished at Christs death.</p>
                  <p>Vnto this we answer by denying the falshood of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3226:61"/>
this argument in diuers points.</p>
                  <p>First, we say the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Christ may remaine eternall, though the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> remaine not eternally <hi>in sacrificing;</hi> for (as I haue shewed formerly) the eternity of Christs sacrifice is not to bee iudged by the eternity of the act of sacrificing, but by the vertue and efficacie of the <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which are so <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 14.</note> meritorious as to procure eternall saluation vnto all beleeuers for whom it was offered; and in this sense the Priesthood of Christ is said to be eternall.</p>
                  <p>Againe, we affirme that the Sacrifice of Christ shall remaine for euer; not <hi>in offering,</hi> but as <hi>hauing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb 7. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>beene offered;</hi> so the <hi>humane nature of Christ</hi> which was our Sacrifice shall for euer remaine hypostatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnited to the <hi>Deity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, it is not necessary that Christ should haue an externall Priesthood here on earth that should offer bread and wine, and bee after the order of <hi>Melchizedech;</hi> for in the time of the law there was an externall Priesthood after the order of <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech,</hi> yet euen then was <hi>Christ a Priest after the order</hi>

                     <hi>of Melchizedech;</hi> and as he had a sacrifice in <hi>fore,</hi> so now hath he in <hi>fuisse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we demand here, if the proper act of <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dechs</hi> sacrifice consist in bread and wine, why doth not <hi>Paul</hi> mention it: for in the historicall relation of <hi>Melchizedechs</hi> meeting of <hi>Abraham.

                  <p>And if the Church should continue a sacrifice af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3226:62"/>
                     <hi>Melchizedechs</hi> order, and haue no direction from Christ or his Apostles, it may soone erre in the maine point of Christian religion. <hi>Ho sius</hi> and after him <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> saith, That this mystery was too great for the Hebrewes to conceiue; but by their leaue, the Apostle tells them of things as strange in a manner; of a man without <hi>Father, without Mother, without beginning or end of dayes.</hi> And if there had beene any difficulty, of whom might they haue beene more clearely and plainely instructed then of the Apostles? and why were not the Hebrewes as capable of this doctrine as any nation among the Gentiles?</p>
                  <p>And doubtlesse had the substance of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> consisted in the offering vp of Christ vnder the forms of bread and wine, both our Sauiour aud his Apostles would haue spoken clearely of it, for as Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> to this purpose. <hi>Let no man alleadge vnto me the</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I will conclude this answer with shewing two things.</p>
                  <p>First, wherein <hi>Melchizedech</hi> was a type of Christ; aud in what respect Christ is said to be a Priest after <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the absurdities which will ensue vpon their doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was a type of Christ in his name <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech,</hi> which signifies <hi>king of righteousnesse;</hi> so was <note place="margin">Isay 9. 6.</note> Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that he was <hi>king of Salem,</hi> that is, King of peace, so is <hi>Christ the Prince of peace.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:3226:62"/>
3. In regard of his double office exercising pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely the sacred functions both of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Priest;</hi> so did <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that he is said to be <hi>apator,</hi> and <hi>ametor, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out father, without mother;</hi> so Christ was <hi>without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> as man, <hi>without mother</hi> as God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the eternity and continuance of his office, for there is no mention made of his death, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he might be a type of the eternity of Christs priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In the excellency of his person, beeing greater then the Patriarch <hi>Abraham;</hi> which appeares in bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him. So is Christ aboue all men in regard of his humane nature, it being perfectly sanctified by the Godhead, and made the head of the Church. So that the bringing forth of bread and wine was no type of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Christ, albeit I deny not but it was a type of his <hi>Regall</hi> bountie and munificence, typifying the spirituall refection which <hi>Christ</hi> our King affords to all that warre against the enemies of their saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, obserue here the absurdities that will follow hereupon.</p>
                  <p>They say the order of <hi>Melchizedechs</hi> sacrifice consists <note place="margin">Vbique offertur sub sacerdote Christo, quod protulit Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedech quando benedixit Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.

                     </note> properly in sacrificing bread and wine; &amp; their Priests offer after the order of <hi>Melchizedech:</hi> hereupon it will follow that either <hi>Melchizedech</hi> offered vp the body of Christ vnder the formes of bread and wine, as they doe; which no man euer affirmed; or they offer one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread and wine as he did, and that they will neuer confesse; or else the sacrifice of <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> and of the Romanists being different, they must needes bee
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3226:63"/>
of different orders; and thus they wound themselues with their owne weapons; for if they will ground their sacrifice vpon <hi>Melchizedechs</hi> offering bread and wine, they must needes then confesse that in the Masse is offered nothing but bread and wine; and indeede the Fathers typically applying <hi>Melchizedechs</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth bread and wine to refresh <hi>Abraham</hi> and his souldiours returning from the slaughter of the kings, vnto the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> make an apt and fit comparison; for so Christ by the bread and wine in the Sacrament (being eaten with faith in the thing represented) nourisheth all beleeuers, refreshing them in the skirmish against their spirituall enemies.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thinkes to shake vs off, and to make vs loosen our hold by telling vs, That the sacrifice of the Masse, and the sacrifice of <hi>Melchizedech</hi> agree in the outward symboles and formes, though not in the substance, and that is sufficient; for the representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in the accidents not in the substance, and that was but the type or Symbole, and therefore the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance may be diuers.</p>
                  <p>What hath <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aduantaged himselfe by this excuse? hereupon it will follow, that they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate bread and wine onely doe more properly imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> sacrifice, then the Masse-Priests who say they consecrate flesh and blood vnder the formes of bread and wine. In the one there is the <hi>forme and substance of Melchizedechs</hi> sacrifice; in the other the <hi>accidents</hi> alone.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if <hi>Melchisedechs</hi> sacrifice doth represent the sacrifice of the Masse, it must represent it as a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; but the Masse is no sacrifice but in respect of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3226:63"/>
the inward substance, for the outward formes are not the sacrifice, but the body of Christ vnder those formes: <hi>ergo Melchizedechs</hi> sacrifice must repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the Masse in the substance which is the body of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, types and shadowes differ from the body in outward symboles onely, but agree in substance, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> shewes, <hi>Christ</hi> to bee the same spirituall <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 4.</note> meate and drinke to the <hi>Israelites</hi> and vs, but to be sundryly represented by diuers Sacraments or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations; wherefore the sacrifice of <hi>Melchizedech</hi> and that of the Masse, (if it were a true resemblance of <hi>Christs</hi> sacrifice) should differ in externall forme, but agree in substance.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if <hi>Melchizedechs</hi> Priest-hood be eternall by the offering of the body of <hi>Christ</hi> by the Priests of <hi>Rome,</hi> then it would follow, that either these Priests shal say Masse and offer this sacrifice after the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this world, and the day of iudgement; or else <hi>Christ</hi> shall make choyce of some others, who may offer this sacrifice in Heauen, or else this sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice must cease, and so not be eternall; any of which no man of a sound minde or firme iudgement will admit.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, if <hi>Melchizedechs</hi> Sacrifice of bread and wine, were a type of the Masse, then should it be (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds the Masse to be) a true <hi>propitiatory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </hi> by way of representation or recordation. But let vs grapple with our aduersaries a little more closely.</p>
                  <p>First wee doe confesse the <hi>Paschall Lambe</hi> and the <hi>Eucharist</hi> to haue some analogy and similitude; as that they both represent Christ crucified; as also they were both to bee eaten; the one with sowre hearbes, the other with sorrow and repentance; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the end, for remembrance of deliuerance, the one corporall, the other spirituall. But againe, there were many dissimilitudes, the <hi>Passeouer</hi> was eaten with blood, the <hi>Eucharist</hi> without materiall blood. The Passeouer was eaten at Euen, the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is administred in the Morning; of the <hi>Passeouer</hi> nothing was left, but of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> is left and reserued by
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3226:64"/>
the Papists; the <hi>Passeouer</hi> was eaten in their houses, the <hi>Eucharist</hi> in the Church; seeing then they agree not in all things; why may they not disagree in the matter of a sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>But to speake precisely, we cannot grant the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lambe</hi> to be a Type of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> albeit this succeeded in the roome of the other; but properly and <note place="margin">

                  <p>Vnto the assumption we answere: It is not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the <hi>Paschall Lambe</hi> was sacrificed; because sacrifices were brought vnto the Priest, and offered by none but a Priest on the Altar; but the passeouer was slaine by the housholder and all his family (as <note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi>

                  <p>But let it be granted that the <hi>Paschall Lambe</hi> was a Sacrifice, yet no otherwise then Eucharisticall for the remembrance of the great and admirable deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance of the Iewes out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Yea, if we grant
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3226:65"/>
it to be propitiatory it helpes them not, but rather disaduantageth them in their practise; for if they will haue the <hi>Paschall Lambe</hi> to be a figure of the Masse, how comes it to passe that the former was offered with blood, this without, the one by the whole family, the other onely by the Priest; of the former nothing was to be reserned, but they reserue the host to be kept in the pyx; the former was not to be carried forth of the house; but the host is carried about in the streetes to be worshipped and adored.</p>
                  <p>Neither do the fathers compare the <hi>Paschall Lamb</hi> to the Eucharist or Lords Supper but onely in these three respects; first, that as the Iewes did eate the one, so do Christians the other. Secondly as the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lambe</hi> did represent <hi>Christum moriturum,</hi> Christ which was to die; so the Lords Supper doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Christum mortuum,</hi> Christ which hath dyed.

                  <p>Touching the first, namely, the eating of the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lambe,</hi> and the feeding on Christ in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaks, <hi>Hoc mysterium tradidit,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Chrys. hom. <hi>83.</hi> in Math.</note>

                  <p>Lastly, they are compared, in respect of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration. <note place="margin">Lyra. Exod. c. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> So <hi>Lyra.

                  <p>And thus much for answere vnto the second argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     </note> and whereupon they most depend is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the prophesie of <hi>Malachy,</hi> chap. 1. 11. <hi>For from the rising of the Sunue, to the going downe of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in euery place incense shall be offered to my name, and a pure offering; for my name shall be great among the Heathen, saith the Lord of Hoasts.</hi> Seeing the sacrifice of the Masse is so generally offered among all Gentiles: therefore it must needs be that <hi>pure oblation</hi> foretold by the Prophet <hi>Malachy.</hi> And that this Sacrifice may the better appeare, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleadgeth these reasons.</p>
                  <p>First, from the signification of the Hebrew word <hi>Mincha,</hi> which properly betokeneth an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <note place="margin">Bellar. cap. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> Sacrifice made with oyle and incense, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be vnderstood of Spirituall and internall sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is called a pure offering, such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be polluted; but prayers may be polluted, onely the sacrifice of the Masse cannot bee defiled by the illnesse of the Minister.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Prophet speaketh of such an offering as was not in vse among the Iewes, saying, <hi>I will not accept any offering at your hands,</hi> but spirituall sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">Verse <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> were in vse among them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Prophet speaketh directly to the Priests, <hi>Thus saith the Lord of Hoasts vnto you, oh ye Priests;</hi> and reproouing their sacrifices, bringeth in a <note place="margin">Verse <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> new kind of offering, which a new Priesthood should offer to God, which cannot be meant of spirituall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:3226:67"/>
To these we answer: That the intent of the Lord by the Prophet is to oppose the Gentiles against the <note place="margin">Answere.</note> Iewes, and shew the difference betweene the Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call sacrifices which they defiled, and the spirituall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices which should bee offered not by one nation onely, but by euery people vnder the new Testament.

                  <p n="3">3. Liberality towards the poore in workes of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>The first is shewed in these words, <hi>From the rising of the Sunne to the setting of the same, my name shall bee great among the Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second in these words, <hi>and in euery place incense shall be offered to my name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is signified by the word <hi>Mincha,</hi> or a <hi>pure oblation;</hi> for as <hi>Zanchius</hi> obserues by the names <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> of bread and wine all beneficence and liberalitie is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in the Scripture. So <hi>Iacob</hi> calls the Present, hee <note place="margin">Gen. 33. 11. 1.

But I tye not my selfe precisely to this exposition of <hi>Zanchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> vnderstanding by <hi>Mincha,</hi> Beneficence, or Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I answer to <hi>Bellarmin</hi> that if he will haue <hi>Mincha</hi> vnderstood properly and not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, then it would follow that the Prophet did speake
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3226:67"/>
in that place of the Iewish ceremonies which should bevsed among Christians, but with more purity then among the Iewes: but the Papists confesse that hee speaketh not of Iewish sacrifices, but of the sacrifices of Christians.</p>
                  <p>Againe, if he will haue <hi>Mincha</hi> to bee vnderstood Metaphorically, then the Masse is but figuratiuely a sacrifice, and not properly; at most it will bee but flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer or bread without any <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha</hi> was. And whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> inferreth that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Mincha</hi> signifieth properly an offering of flower or bread with oyle and incense: therefore it cannot be vnderstood of the spirituall sacrifices of Christians, how vnschollerlike (and therefore how vnlike him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) doth hee argue? Who knowes not that many things are spoken figuratiuely, being applyed impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly from their natiue significations to signifie things which indeed they are not, <hi>I am a doore</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>I am the vine;</hi> if these things be vnderstood li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally and not Metaphorically, we shall make but a bad construction. But an example like this of the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> may bee that of the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> where speaking of the Church of Christ among the Gentiles he faith, <hi>And they shall bring all your brethren</hi>

                  <p>

But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> vrges that the Prophet speakes of a pure offering which cannot be polluted, but spirituall sacrifices may be defiled by the offerer.</p>
                  <p>I answer, No holy action, as prayer, preaching, mortification, prayses, Almes-deeds, and the like, are sacrifices but onely as they are offered in and through Iesus Christ, so that in respect as they proceed from vs simply, they may bee defiled by our inherent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, yet being offered through Christ they are pure and holy; for as our Sauiour telleth vs, it is the <note place="margin">

                  <p>I will conclude this answer with laying before your eyes the common consent first of the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the Euangelist S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Diuine, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul;</hi> then of the Fathers of the Church in suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages.</p>

                  <p>Thus the beloued Disciple of Christ expounds what is meant by this incense: <hi>And another Angell came and stood at the altar, hauing a golden censer, and there was giuen to him much incense, that he might offer</hi>

                  <p>I do not deny but that <hi>Antiochus</hi> was a type of Antichrist, for as the former set vp an Idoll in the Temple, so this latter sets vp images in the Church; the one burnt the Scriptures, the other conceales them from the lay people; the first hindred the dayly sacrifice, and this latter hath conuerted the great sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ into an abhomination, in that the Priest must offer a propitiatory sacrifice for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead, greater abhomination then this was not in the dayes of <hi>Antiochus.</hi>

Doubtlesse, had <hi>Daniell</hi> spoken of Antichrists taking away the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Masse, the Apostles would not haue either forgotten, or willfully pretermitted so great a matter. But by their forgetfulnesse, we may conceiue the Masse not to be worth remembring; or by their volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary omission, we may iudge it indigne and vnworthy to be spoken of.</p>

Secondly, I demand how Christ <hi>is euer with his Church vnto the end of the world? Turrian</hi> answers for all the rest, Christ is with vs <hi>in the mystery of the</hi>

See now how our subtle aduersaries haue entangled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; for <hi>how can Christ be euer with his Church in the sacrifice of the Masse, when the sacrifice it selfe of the Masse (by their owne confession) shall bee abolished by Antichrist for the space of three yeares and six moneths?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I demand whether that <hi>Iuge sacrificium, dayly sacrifice</hi> be meant properly or Metaphorically? if properly, then the sacrifice of the Masse is Iudaicall; then ought it to bee offered onely in one place, and that euery day, morning and euening, which our Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Priests obserue not. If Metaphorically, why then doe they vrge the verity and reality of a Hila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke or Propitiatory sacrifice? or why doe wee not agree and consent that it is Propitiatory by resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, if Antichrist shall abolish the sacrifice of the Masse for the space of three years and sixe months, then I demand, how shal there remaine in the Church of Rome a continuall and constant succession neuer to bee interrupted?

                  <p>Herein are our aduersaries contrary to themselues,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3226:78"/>
as they are alwayes contrary to the truth.</p>
                  <p>Diuers other arguments are alleadged by them, but these are the principall; and seeing their strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est testimonies are so infirme and weake, I thinke it wil be supervacaneous and vnnecessary to trouble my selfe in giuing answer to those which are more friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, hauing the lesse pretence and shew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore thus much shall serue for the third part of this confutation, namely the answering of their obiections.</p>

                     <p>The fourth and last part now followes, wherein wee shall lay downe arguments sufficiently proouing our owne opinion, that in the Masse there is not a true reall Propitiatory sacrifice for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead, and therefore not lawfull to be vsed in the Church of God. And this is prooued.</p>
                     <p>First, that sacrifice which is al-mighty, al-sufficient, and absolutely perfect, in respect of the desired end cannot be reiterated by men; But the sacrifice of the the immaculate Lambe Iesus Christ vpon the crosse was almighty, al-sufficient, and absolutely perfect in respect of the desired end which is the saluation of the faithfull. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The al-sufficient and perfect sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ cannot be reiterated in the Masse.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is confirmed by the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, <hi>The law which had a shadow of good things to come,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 1. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>and not the very image of the things, can neuer, with those sacrifices which they offered yeare by yeare conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,</hi>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:3226:78"/>
                        <hi>make the commers thereunto perfect; for then, should they not haue ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged, should haue had no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of sinnes.</hi> What doth the Apostle conclude here? He opposeth the Gospell to the law; our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Priest Christ Iesus, against the Priests of <hi>Aaron;</hi> his sacrifice which had no need to be renewed, against their sacrifices repeated euery day; the holinesse and effectuall sanctifying power which was in his sacrifice, against their weakenesse and disability to sanctifie. <note place="margin">Verse 9.</note> Hereupon he concludeth, <hi>Hee taketh away the former to establish the latter,</hi> the sacrifices of the law, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish his owne sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Now how could this conclusion be good, if this sacrifice should be reiterated? seeing the often repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion argues weakenesse and impotency: therefore the Apostle so often vses these words <hi>once offered,</hi> to note the al-sufficiency of Christs sacrifice in the single and vnrepeated act of offering; hee hauing annihilated, and disanulled all other sacrifices whatsoeuer.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the blood of Christ shed personally by himselfe, being of sufficient vertue and merit to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, cleanse, and redeeme all beleeuers, it must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follow, that there needes no reiteration, but we may content our selues with that onely sacrifice offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon the crosse.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is so plaine and Orthodoxe that hee deserues not the name of a Christian that shall deny it.</p>

                     <p>For our aduersaries teach that the body of Christ in the Masse is an externall sacrifice, and is truely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto God the Father vnder the formes of bread and wine.

                     <p>The consequence is euident. For hee that goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to offer that sacrifice which was perfectly fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed vpon the crosse, cannot but by his reiteration preiudice, and call in question the perfection thereof; for as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaketh, he that hath a soueraigne medicine, which by once applying is perfectly able to cure a disease, and shall often apply the same, doth derogate from the vertue thereof: so he that shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterate the all-sauing sacrifice vpon the crosse, by the frequent reiteration, charges it with impotency, and imbecility.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore whatsoeuer pretence our aduersaries may vse, they by their Massing sacrifice, doe no lesse then robbe the al-sufficient sacrifice of the Crosse, and with irreligious blasphemy derogate from it, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious power to saue all that beleeue.</p>

The Ceremoniall law was abrogated; the Morall law was fulfilled; the sacrifice of Christ was perfected; the saluation of mankind accomplished.

                     <p>But our subtle Antagonists thinke to auoide the <note place="margin">Sadeel. aduers. miss. sacrif. c. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> force of our argument by this cunning distinction; There is say they two degrees of remission of sinnes.</p>
                     <p>The first that God would for his part, and as much as in him lyes, be reconciled to men.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that he would receiue them into fauour, they working by faith and repentance.</p>
                     <p>The first degree (say they) is in the sacrifice of Christs death on the crosse.</p>
                     <p>The second is in the sacrifice of the Masse; and for the confirmation of this distinction they adduce <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 19.</note> the saying of the Apostle, <hi>God was in Christ reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the world vnto himselfe, not imputing their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes vnto them; and hath committed vnto vs the word of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

                     <p>But our aduersaries, by this distinction thinking to auoid us, haue giuen vs the greater aduantage. For this latter degree of remission of sinnes is nothing els but the application of the sacrifice of Christ vnto all men; as if they should say, that, then are wee made partakers of that great benefite of Christs sacrifice,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3226:82"/>
when we doe receiue him with a true faith. And for this end was the sacrifice of the Masse instituted:</p>
                     <p>Vt cruenti sacrificij salutaris virtus, in remissionem <note place="margin">Synod. Trid.</note> corum, quae quotidie committuntur a nobis, peccatorum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>; That the sauing vertue of the bloody sacrifice may be applyed vnto vs, for the remission of those sinnes which are dayly committed by vs.</p>
                     <p>From hence I conclude, that if the application of a Propitiatory sacrifice bee not the sacrifice it selfe, (for he that confounds the thing and the application of that thing, shewes but weakenesse of iudgement) and that in the Masse there is an application of the great Propitiatory sacrifice offered by Christ, it must needes follow, that in the Masse there is no Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory sacrifice it selfe, true, and reall, but onely an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the great and al-sufficient sacrifice offered by Christ. Therefore the Apostle sayes, that <hi>God hath committed to vs</hi> (his ministers) <hi>the ministery of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From which words I collect these two obseruations:</p>
                     <p>First that the Pastors of the Church of Christ are Ministers of application of Christs sacrifice; but not of sacrificing Christ himselfe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that this application is made not by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing of Christ, (as our Romanists dreame) but by teaching, admonishing, and exhorting, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Sacrament according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Christ.</p>

                     <p>The Consequence appeares by this, that the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Christ, and the slaying of Christ are neuer seperated in the holy Scripture: For it was not with Christ, as with the beast vnder the Law, which were first slaine and then offered vppon the Altar; but Christ, in the instant of his death was offered a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a sweet smelling sauor to his Heauenly Father.</p>

                     <p>Our aduersaries answere. That there is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall immolation of Christ in the Masse, because by the power and vertue of Transubstantiation the body of Christ is consecrated and made to subsist by it selfe, and the blood of Christ is consecrated and made to subsist by it selfe, and so though they are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated locally and in appearance, yet they are not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated <hi>propter concomitantiam;</hi> by concomitance they are both ioyned together.</p>

By this their distinction they thinke to vp hold their Masse by which they ouer-turne it. For first, in that they say it is a Sacramentall immolation, herein they speake more truely then they are aware. wherein wee consent with them; for if it be Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall it cannot be proper, reall, and externall, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is Sacramentall, is so <hi>relatiue</hi> hauing reference vnto that substance, whereof it is a shadow or resemblance.

                     <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> our aduersaries themselues confesse; they will not say Christ is slaine really and truely in the Masse, least their Priests should, become <hi>Christochthonoi, Christ Killers.</hi> Yet how can they auoid the suspition of treason against the life of Christ, when they seperate his reall body from his blood; for it is greatly to be feared that they who powre out his liuely blood, and breake his reall and substantiall body are guilty of the death of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is prooued because Christ did perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfie for the sinnes of all the elect, appeasing fully the wrath of God by his sacrifice vpon the Crosse; and now ceasing from making any further satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he onely sitting at the right hand of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth intercession for vs. For to satisfie the wrath of God is, to doe that for vs which wee should haue done, and to suffer that which we had deserued, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death; and so Christ should againe yeelde obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law, and suffer death againe; but the Apostle sayth, <hi>Christ being once dead, dyeth no more;</hi> neither is Almighty God so vniust, as to require sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of him that hath perfectly satisfyed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
                     <p>But our aduersaries say that Christ is sacrificed in the Masse to apply vnto vs the satisfaction which Christ hath giuen for vs on the Crosse. But so in applying satisfaction he makes satisfaction; for Christ cannot be sacrificed truely, but hee must truely die, and he cannot die, but to make satisfaction. Againe,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3226:84"/>
if Christ ought to be sacrificed againe, that the fruite of his sacrifice may be applyed vnto vs, then ought he as well to be incarnate againe, in the wombe of the Virgin, that the fruite of his incarnation may be applied vnto vs; to die, to be buried, to rise againe, that so the fruite of his death, Sepulture, and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection may be applyed vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the application of the benefit of Christs sacrifice, by reiteration of his sacrifice is not found in Scripture.

                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> he is not offered by the Priests of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the sacrifice of the Masse.</p>
                     <p>The consequence is true, for if there be a true and reall sacrifice in the Masse, there must needes follow a true and reall Priest-hood which offereth this sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and so Christ is not the onely Priest of the new Testament.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is denied by our aduersaries, but is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by vs.</p>
                     <p>First, there is no other proper externall Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood vnder the Gospell, but that which is after the order of <hi>Melchizedech;</hi> of which order there is no man worthy, but onely Christ, as is sufficiently declared.</p>
                     <p>And whereas our aduersaries vainely boast their Priest-hood to be after the order of <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> herein they are contrary to Scripture, which makes this not to be a common Priest-hood, as <hi>Aarons</hi> was, but personall, belonging onely vnto Christ; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle sayes, that <hi>Christ because he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for euer, hath</hi> [<hi>Aparabaton Hierosunen</hi>] <hi>such a</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Priest-hood as cannot passe from one to another.</hi> Where the Apostle plainly shewes that such as were mortal, and consequently not eternall, were vncapable of that order of <hi>Melchizedech;</hi> such are the Priests of <hi>Rome,</hi> mortall as those of <hi>Aaron</hi> were, and thereof vnto them cannot this Priest-hood be diuolued.</p>
                     <p>They thinke to cut vs off with this distinction: Christ is the primary or principall Priest; but men may be secundary and lesse principall, by whose mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery Christ may offer himselfe vnto God. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund then, was not Christ euen vnder the Law a
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3226:85"/>
Priest after the order of <hi>Melchizedech?</hi> and were not the Priests of <hi>Aaron</hi> being compared to Christ that was to come Secundary Priests? were they not therefore Types and figures of the Priest-hood of Christ? wherefore when the primary or superior Priest was come, the Priest-hood of <hi>Aaron</hi> vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and the Apostle would haue no legall Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to remaine. But where hath he substituted any other secundary Priests instead of the former? Certes the Scripture hath not appointed any.</p>
                     <p>Againe, by the same reason that the Apostle disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulles the legall Priest-hood, hath he also excluded all other externall Priest-hood vnder the Gospell, for he opposeth him that is immortall against those that are mortall, God and man, against those who are meere men: Now if the Priests of <hi>Rome</hi> be no freer from mortality, or fuller of deity then the Priests of <hi>Leuy,</hi> they are then by the same reason both exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for <hi>Cui ratio &amp; perfectum medium conclusionis conuenit, eidem ipsa conuenit conclusio.</hi> To whom the true reason and perfect <hi>medium</hi> of a conclusion doth agree, to the same also the conclusion it selfe may be applied.</p>
                     <p>Againe, Christ is plainely manifested to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Priest of the New Testament, (and so alone able to offer the sacrifice of propitiaton for our sinnes,) by that figuratiue entring alone of the high Priest once a yeare into the Tabernacle.</p>

                     <p>This is <hi>Suarez</hi> his confession, and as much as <hi>Luther</hi> and we desire, for if the Euangelists haue not layde downe any institution of a sacrifice, nor so much as named a a sacrifice in the Eucharist, wee ought not to embrace it; this therefore argues the malice of our aduersary <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who calls this a ridiculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reasoning in vs, which is vsed by a Doctour of his owne order not inferiour to himselfe in learning and iudgement.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, let vs appeale vnto the iudgement of the Cardinall himselfe, who answers in another case af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same manner; for hee reciteth the <hi>Liturgies</hi> that passe vnder the name of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> because <hi>all things</hi> (saith he) <hi>contained in those liturgies, and in the</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus doth the Cardinalls argument frame it selfe: whatsoeuer in the seruice of God is not by prescript precept, or direct example of Christ confirmed, is not lawfull or warrantable; see now the partiality and philautia of the Cardinall; for what hee thinkes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in himselfe, he accounts ridiculous in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>The Liturgie of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> is not lawfull, because it contains many things not taken either from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

or commandement of Christ, yet we may not say, that the Masse is vnlawfull because it cannot be prooued by either example or commandement of Christ. Note here the Cardinall requires greater authority for the confirmation of a Liturgy then of their Massing sacrifice.</p>

mentall presence of the Lords body and blood there is a true, reall, and actuall application of his death (<hi>quo ad meritum,</hi> in regard of the merit of it) to all that receiue with faith. But the Iesui te will haue a proper death of Christ in the Eucharist, euen as he is truely, really, substantially and corporally present; and yet see how he thwartes and crosses himselfe in the last words, saying, <hi>Christ in the Eucharist dyes not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence we may frame this Argument. After the same manner that Christ is in the Eucharist, after the same manner hee dyes in the same [for an actuall and corporall presence requires an actuall and corporall death as a sacramentall presence, a sacramental death onely] But in the Eucharist (by our aduersaries owne confession) Christ dyes not properly, actually, or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> in the Eucharist, hee is not properly, actually, or bodily present.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, note how contrary this doctrine is vnto it selfe. The body of <hi>Christ</hi> (saith he) and the blood of <hi>Christ</hi> are consecrated apart and seuerally, yet they do not subsist apart, least there should be an actuall, and reall effusion of the blood of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I demand, if it be so that they are consecrated and made apart, then when the Priest hath consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the body of <hi>Christ</hi> first (for hee cannot consecrate both in an instant) doth not that body subsist without blood, till hee hath made and consecrated the blood also? This is strange in the sacrament that the body of <hi>Christ</hi> and his blood should admit for a time, such an actuall separation as is betweene that which hath a being, and that which hath no being.</p>

Lastly, note how enigmatically he tells vs of those things which are separated by consecration, and yet are indiuisibly conioyned, that they cannot be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; contrary to the institution of Christ, who tooke the bread, and the cup seuerally, consecrating them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, to figure vnto vs that actuall and reall separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body and blood of Christ vpon the crosse.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But whence proceedes this insufficiencie of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3226:95"/>
masse? if it be the same body, and consequently the same sacrifice (as they teach) how hath it lost its ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that it should not be infinite in the Masse, as well as on the crosse? <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleadgeth three reasons hereof, but so weake and infirme, as can no way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeme a man of so great learning.</p>
                     <p>The first is taken from the sacrifice it selfe which is offered; for in the sacrifice of the crosse the very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall being of Christ in his humane body was destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <note place="margin">Bellar. de missa l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note> but in the sacrifice of the Masse, the sacramentall being of Christ onely is destroyed. But this hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth himselfe to be no cause why the one should be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and the other infinite.</p>
                     <p>The second is taken from the person offering; for in the sacrifice of the crosse, the person offering is the Sonne of God immediately by himselfe; but in the sacrifice of the Masse, the person offering, is the Son of God, by the hand of the Priest. As though a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man could by his infirmity disable the sacrifice of Christ, and diminish the extent of that infinite oblation.</p>
                     <p>The third reason is taken from the will of Christ; for albeit he could by one oblation obtaine all things of God for all men, yet he would not, but the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of his passion, should bee obtained in a certaine measure; and if any man desire a reason hereof, it is not for vs curiously to search into it; but his will is a sufficient reason.</p>
                     <p>These grounds, alas, how weake are they for a Christian to build his faith vpon?</p>
                     <p>How shall a man bee established by such tottering foundations?</p>

                     <p>But wee are to obserue, that the Apostle by these words, excludes and cuts of all iterations of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ; for otherwise, if Christ should now be often sacrificed really, though after any manner, the difference of the Apostle could neuer stand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Leuiticall sacrifices which were often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, and the sacrifice of Christ, which was once offered.</p>

But we cut off <hi>Bellarmines</hi> answere, by affirming; That albeit both the Eucharist and Baptisme doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the death of Christ vnto vs, yet is not Baptisme superfluous, because it is of Christs institution, so is not the Masse. Againe, they apply Christs death di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly; baptisme as the seale of our regeneration; the Eucharist as a signe of our redemption; the one sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies our sanctification by the washing of Christs blood; the other our iustification by the sufferings of the same Christ our Sauiour; the one for our initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Church; the other for our confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so that neither of them are superfluous; but the sacrifice of the Masse is superfluous, because the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and shewing forth of Christs death is sufficiently performed without a sacrifice. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the comparison holds not, that the Masse may as well be vsed to apply the vertue of Christs death, albeit the Eucharist doth the same, as baptisme, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptisme is of Christs institution, the Masse is not; and baptisme, and the Lords Supper, though they both apply the death of Christ, yet in diuers manners, and for diuers ends.</p>
                     <p>But the Papists pretend the same to be the end of the Masse, which is of the Lords Supper.</p>
                     <p>And whereas <hi>Bellarmine</hi> sayth, the Apostle speakes of the bloody sacrifice of Christ, it is true, for he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer once dreamed of an vnbloody sacrifice which could neuer haue any existence, <hi>in rerum natura.</hi> For if you marke the Apostles words, hee quite knockes this vnbloody sacrifice of the Papists on the head, saying, <hi>Not that he should offer himselfe often, &amp;c.</hi>

Againe, if he vnderstand it of some indiuiduall actions of religion, which were to be performed for the saluation of such particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as should beleeue afterward, it is true, they were not finished, because the persons whom God had appointed, and decreed to vse as meanes for the conuersion of others, were to liue in future ages, and had not as yet beeing, and consequently could not at that time finish those acts, whereunto they were destined of God; but if he vnderstand by these words, [<hi>All things necessary for mans saluation, are not finished</hi>] all the specificall acts of religion, as Prayer, Preaching, Administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:3226:99"/>
and whatsoeuer of that kind which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to mans saluation is not finished; this is false, for that they had their institution from Christ before his death, and so in the <hi>species</hi> they were finished. Or if thereby the sacrifice of <hi>Christ</hi> was not finished; this is false; for both it, and the saluation of man by it was finished; as appeares by the Apostles vsing the same words, saying, <hi>With one offering, teteleioken, consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit, he hath consummated for euer such as are sanctified.</hi>

                        <hi>Argument.</hi> 17.</head>
                     <p>The seauenteenth argument is taken from the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood of the Canon of the Masse, and it is thus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Such as is the Canon, such is the sacrifice. But the Canon of the Masse is false.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> the sacrifice is false, and consequently not Propitiatory.
<pb facs="tcp:3226:99"/>
The falshood of the Masse appeares in diuers things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the ancient Church when the Lords Supper was celebrated, the Christians vsed to bring their <hi>agapai,</hi> which were the bread and wine for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the poore, and the maintenance of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry; and when they had laide downe these oblations (which were neuer accounted a Propitiatory sacrifice) they prayed for the prosperity and preseruation of the Church: which in the Canon before the consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is applyed vnto the bread and wine, and the bread and wine is offered vnto God the Father for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in the Canon, They pray vnto God that he would accept that pure sacrifice of the body and blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> as he accepted the sacrifices of <hi>Abell</hi> and <hi>Melchizedech.</hi> In which words they become intercessours vnto God the Father to accept his Son Iesus Christ, as though he were not worthy to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of himselfe. And how absurd is it to compare the most pretious sacrifice of the body and blood of <hi>Christ</hi> (if it were so really and truely) vnto the sacrifice of <hi>Abel,</hi> which was but a lambe or a goate.</p>
                     <p>And how vnwisely doe they pray that God would accept the sacrifice of his Sonne as hee did accept the sacrifice of <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> whereas it cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare (as is formerly prooued) by the holy scripture, that <hi>Melchizedech</hi> offered bread and wine; how absurd is it then to compare the sacrifice of <hi>Christ</hi> with that sacrifice which neither was, is, nor shall be?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Canon saith, that the Priest offereth vnto God the heauenly Father the bread of life. But where are they commanded to offer the bread of life,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3226:100"/>
seeing in the scripture there is mention made of eating the bread of life, but not of offering?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Canon ouerthrowes the article of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension; for it commands the Angells to carry that vnspotted sacrifice to the high Altar of heauen, and to present it before God the Father. What? Is not <hi>Christ</hi> ascended, and fitteth for euer at the right hand of God? and hath he now more need of the helpe of Anglls then when he first ascended by the whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his Godhead? and cannot hee appeare before his Father, but by the assistants of Angells?</p>
                     <p>But let me bee bold to demand three questions of our aduersaries grounded vpon these words of the Canon, <hi>Supplices te rogamus omnipotens Deus, iube haec perferri per manus sancti Angeli,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We humbly beseech thee, O Omnipotent God; that tbou wouldest command</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>this sacrifice to be carryed by the hands of the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, vnto thy high Altar in the sight of thy diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>First, if they vnderstand it of the bread and wine transubstantiated into the body and blood of Christ, how comes it to passe, that they are not taken by the Angell, and carryed immediately into heauen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the prayer of the Church?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I demand, if their doctrine bee true of their Multipresence, that the true humane body and blood of <hi>Christ</hi> be both in heauen, and in many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand places vpon the earth at one time, what need then the Angell to carry the body of <hi>Christ</hi> into heauen, where it is already before his heauenly Father?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, (if it be so as they say, that <hi>Christ</hi> in the night when he instituted the Lords Supper, did offer
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3226:100"/>
himselfe, his naturall body and blood vnder the forms of bread and wine, a true Propitiatory sacrifice to his heauenly Father) I demand whether the Angell did carry this sacrifice into heauen, or whether it did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>before his Father in heauen, or no? If they say no; how then was the sacrifice accepted? or how comes the Church to pray for that priuiledge, of hauing this sacrifice carryed into heauen, which was not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to the sacrifice offered immediately by Christ himselfe? If they affirme that it was carryed into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, it would then follow, that <hi>Christs</hi> body was in heauen before his passion, resurrection, or ascension; and when he in his humane nature ascended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from his Disciples, hee found his humane body and blood before his Father, and to haue beene there before it came thither.</p>
                     <p>Thus they make <hi>Christ</hi> to haue two bodies, and consequently two soules; and so <hi>Christ</hi> is not one, but two; but many; but innumerable. These absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties doe directly result, and arise from their blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Canon; which is so grosse and palpable, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues to be hissed out of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the Canon in diuers places ouerturnes the Mediation of <hi>Christ,</hi> in that they pray to Saints and Angells making them to be intercessours; it also esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishes Purgatory and prayer for the dead, doctrines so dissonant from the truth of the Scriptures, as when we see them authorized in the Church of Rome, wee may iustly call in question the vertue of their massing sacrifice.</p>

                     <p>The eighteenth Argument is taken from the effect of the Masse; thus. That which destroyeth the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Lords Supper cannot be a true Propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sacrifice for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> the pretended sacrifice of the Masse is not Propitiatory for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is not denyed by our aduersaries.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus prooued. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum est visibile signum inuisibilis gratiae; a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble signe of inuisible grace;</hi> so that in euery sacrament there is <hi>signum &amp; signatum,</hi> the signe and the thing signified, both which abide whole and intire, in such sort as it is not possible that the one can be the other, or any part of the other. But the sacrifice of the Masse destroyeth the nature of a sacrament, for it taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the substance of the bread, which is the signe and seale of his body; it taketh away the substance of the wine, which is the symbole of his blood; and that by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

away corporall spottes, the blood of Christ which cleanseth our spirituall pollutions; bread and wine which nourish our naturall life, the body and blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> which sustaine and feede vs vnto eternall life. But roundnesse, whitenesse, moistnesse, and red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which they giue vs for signes, what analogy or proportion haue they with our spirituall nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? These accidents of bread and wine haue no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer or vertue to feede the body, but the substance of bread and wine; they leaue those, and take away this; where then is the sacrament when the signe is aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the sacrifice of the Masse taketh away the thing signified in the Lords Supper. Whats that? It is the body and blood of Christ, yea <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe. For the very body and blood of <hi>Christ</hi> was giuen on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them <hi>which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>The last Argument is taken from the vncertainty of this Sacrifice, and is thus framed; That which is a true propitiatory Sacrifice for sinne, giues assurance vnto him for whom it is offered, of remission of his sinne. But, the Sacrifice of the Masse giues not aslu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of remission of sinne:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Sacrifice of the Masse, is not propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is thus proued; That which depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not vpon the institution of the Sacrament, nor vpon the sacramentall words (as the Papists terme them,) but, vpon the intention of the Priest, can giue no assurance of remission: For, if the Priest intend not with his minde, albeit he speaketh the words with his mouth, yet (according to their owne doctrine) he consecrateth not, and so the body of Christ is not really in the Sacrament, and consequently, it cannot be a proper Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>And thus they tye the grace of God, not to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, accompanied with his holy Spirit; but, to the intention of the consecrating Priest; and the Son of God shall not be ours, that is, the life which is in him shall not distribute it selfe vnto the faithfull, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the discretion of this intention shal extend. And it shall be in the power of the Priest to frustrate and send away empty, a whole Assembly of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, gathered together with desire to receiue saluation by this Sacrifice. Yea, howsoeuer the people are apt to depart without any benefit to their soules, for, if
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3226:105"/>
the intention of the Priest be not to consecrate, or that in the act of consecration his minde bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise busied in thinking of other matters, then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ are not vnder the formes of Bread and Wine; neither is it a reall Sacrifice. And neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, if he doe consecrate, yet the people do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate therein, because they are not assured of the Priests intention, and therefore cannot be assuied of the Reall presence of the body of Christ. Now, where there is not assurance in the communicating, there can be no comfortable, or sauing receiuing, <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> but rather sinfull, for so S. <hi>Paul</hi> saies; <hi>Whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sin.</hi> And they themseluer are of iudgment that he receiues not the body of <hi>Christ,</hi> who doth not beleeue that he receiues it: like Magick charms, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in strong imagination and beleese workes the effect.</p>
                     <p>And yet obserue here, how contrary againe they are vnto themselues, when they teach; that, <hi>Opus ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum, The worke wrought, is sufficient to merit.</hi> What difference then is between the godly and the wicked? Or, what priuiledge hath the righteous more then the prophane? seeing both good and bad receiue the same consecrated <hi>Christ;</hi> performe the same worke of communicating? And for all men (that can pay well) without difference is the Sacrifice of the Masse of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
                     <p>Or, what comfort can the Laity of the Roman Church find in the Sacrament, when that which shold giue life to their faith, breedeth in them nothing but doubting, and vncertainty? seeing, that after they haue prepared themselues, they know not what they receiue, because they are not assured of the intention
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3226:105"/>
of the consecration.</p>
                     <p>But here I demand of the Romanists; If the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of the body and blood of <hi>Christ</hi> depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the intention of the Priest, so that if he intend not in the act of consecration, the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> is not then present, neither is the Bread or Wine transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated. How then can the Doctors of the Church of Rome free the people from the sinne of Idolatry, which worship the creature in stead of the Creator, the vnconsecrated Elements, in stead of the true and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall Body and Blood of <hi>Christ?</hi> For, they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the bread, supposing it to be the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> when, through either the negligence, or wilfulnesse of the Priest, in not intending consecration, it remaines in its owne proper substance.</p>
                     <p>They thinke to falue this sore with a nice distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they tell vs it is materiall Idolatry, but not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall; as though Idolatry, masked vnder a couert, were not a sinne: and, because it is not voluntarie, or intentionall, therefore it were tollerable.</p>
                     <p>The Idolatry of <hi>Israel</hi> was neuer so grosse, as to worship any grauen Images in stead of God; but (as our Papists plead) to worship God, in or through their Images: yet, this prouoked God vnto iealousie, and drew downe his vengeance vpon these Idolaters. Is not this more palpable Idolatry, where the Bread and Wine, which are but creatures, are worshipped with <hi>Latreia,</hi> adoration which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues ascribe vnto God alone? And to manifest, that they ascribe vnto this Sacrifice, the same diuine worship which they ascribe vnto God, let but the Christian Reader ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the last generall Councell, held by the Church

                     <p>Thus hauing sufficiently satisfied (as I hope) the indifferent and impartial Reader, concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded parts of this controuersie; as namely, that the pretended sacrifice of the Masse hath no ground in the Doctrine of the Scriptures, practise of the Apostles, or writings of the ancient Fathers: as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly touching the originall encrease and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Masse: Thirdly, of the imbecillity and weakenesse of their obiected Arguments: Lastly, of the firme and solide grounds of our dislike and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. I shall in fine lay before the eyes of all men a briefe enumeration of all the impieties and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies of this abhominable Idoll, and so shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all with a serious disswasion, from all, or any participation in that superstitious worship.</p>
                     <p>The Impieties of this Sacrifice are these.</p>
                     <p>First, it is not onely diuers from the institution of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Christ, but quite ouerthrowes it, as appeares by these particulars. 1. First, Christ instituted a Sacrament wherein he freely offereth himselfe to be receiued of all beleeuers, by faith, and to bee eaten spiritually. They turne it into a sacrifice, which is offered vnto God the Father, not beeing distributed to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but deuoured by the Priest, and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, really, and materially: So that whereas the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3226:107"/>
Church should haue beene thankefull for that God hath giuen his onely sonne for her saluation, shee striues to make God her debter by offering vnto him a sacrifice; but such a sacrifice as he neuer desired, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or commanded. 2. Christ in the Sacrament consecrated bread, and wine, which remained as signes, and symboles of the body and blood of <hi>Christ.</hi> In the Masse they consecrate the reall and substantiall body of <hi>Christ,</hi> taking away the Sacrament in that they take away the signes. 3. In the Sacrament, the vertue and efficacy is in the power of God, making it operatiue by the grace of the Spirit. In the Masse the deede done deserues pardon; and the Priest hath a portion of remission of sinnes, which may bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on whom he will. 4. The Sacrament is onely profitable for the liuing, but the Masse for the quicke and the dead. 5.

                     <p>Twelfely, it opens the mouth of the Common <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Aduersary, who despises both the persons and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all Christians, because the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> worshippeth a breaden God.</p>

                     <p>The fourteenth impiety of the Masse. It maketh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> the Priest of more desert then Christ himselfe. For the sacrifice is not accepted for it selfe, but for the worthinesse of the person offering. <hi>Caines</hi> sacrifice was as good as <hi>Abels,</hi> when yet it was reiected for the wickednesse of him that offered, <hi>Abels</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for the worthinesse of the sacrificer, so the humane nature of Christ being our sacrifice, was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious by the vertue of the God-head, whereby it was offered vnto his Father. But if the Priests do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the body of Christ vnto his Father, he must needes be of more desert then the sacrifice it selfe.</p>

                     <p>I answer; These examples doe not patronize such <note place="margin">Answer.</note> as partake in the Idolatrous Seruice of the Masse. For, first <hi>Eliah,</hi> when he stood by the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> it was not to partake with them, but to conuince them of their Idolatry, and to discouer vnto the people who was the true God.

Herein wee are seriously admonished of our bond and obligation to God the Father for sending his Son, and God the Sonne fulfilling the will of his Father; the remembrance of whose death wee shew forth till he come; who (as verily as the Minister giueth vs the bread and wine to be receiued with our hands, which being eaten and drunken, are conuerted into our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and become nourishments of our bodies) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs his body and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>This was the holy Supper of the faithfull in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, and this is ours; with the rest of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches. But in the Masse there are no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of the holy Supper; but all things are so chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as if the Lords Supper were abolished, and the Masse were come in the stead therof; for in the Masse there is a Prieft in a strange garment, his face fixt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Altar, with a Clarke standing behind him, mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in a strange language, interlarded with signes, lifting vp a wafer in an affected and ceremoniall super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious sort; causing it to be worshipped; dipping it in the wine, eating it alone, persuading the people, that by thus much as hath beene done, beeing at their request, and bought with somepiece of money, he hath sacrificed Christ for them. What shewing foorth <hi>of the Lords death is there till he come?</hi> Nay is there not an abolishing of the perfection, value and efficacy of Christs death and sacrifice?

ful of abhominable blasphemies and grosse impieties? Are not the deaths and sufferings of Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs rather reckoned vp then the death of Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented? Is there not rather a breach of charity then any Symbole of loue, when the Priest eates all himselfe, the common people being excluded from it? where is there any communion betweene the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, (or signification of our engrafting into Christ?) The scriptures neither authorising, nor the Primitiue and Apostolicall Church practising, nor the Fathers in the first 600. yeares acknowledging any such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory sacrifice, as the Church of Rome both offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and adoreth; but in turbulent ages it grew from a Sacrament to a sacrifice; from a Sacrifice of prayse to a Propitiatory sacrifice by way of representation; from thence in times of ignorance, carelesnesse, and Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call contentions to a reall and proper Propitiatory Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>And seeing God our heauenly Father hath spread a table for vs in this wildernesse, while others starue for foode, let euery true Christian say with the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall sonne, <hi>I will arise and goe to my Father;</hi> Let vs all <note place="margin">Luk. 15. 18</note> remember that exuberant and superaboundant refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, which we shall receiue from the table of God our Father, where Christ himselfe is the refection and sustenance of our soules, that our soules being nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by faith in our Mediatour and sacrifice, Christ the Lord, both soule and body may bee saued by him in the day of iudgement,</p>
                     <p>Oh that God would open the blind eyes of such as are ensnared with the allurements of the Romish Church, and deceiued with the false complexion of

                     <p>And for vs that haue beene borne of the Church, and brought vp in her bosome, vnto whom God hath reuealed the purity of his word, and exhibited his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacraments without maime or alteration; let vs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer disclaime our Spirituall mother, making our selues bastards by becomming the children of a Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let coloured Whore; let vs neuer become Apostates from the truth, staining <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
