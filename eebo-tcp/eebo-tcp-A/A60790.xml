            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>THat thou mayst not misinterpret what is well-meant, nor think me over-severe in exposing the odd and indeed impious Carriage of</hi> R. B. <hi>in his manner of demeaning himself in his Pretence of Writing</hi> Notes <hi>upon the</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse, <hi>I will give thee a brief Account what moved me to make these</hi> Reflexions <hi>on this surprising Performance of his. I did deeply resent the gross Injury he has done, First, To the Spirit of Prophecy in the Holy Scriptures, and consequently to the whole Church of Christ, to which it is to be a Guide, and is indeed a marvellous strong Bulwark against Atheism and Infidelity. Secondly, and more peculiarly, To the Church of</hi> England. <hi>And lastly, To that Industrious and Faithful Member thereof, Dr.</hi> H. M. <hi>who has so sincerely laid out his Pains (having no Bribe in his Hand from any Party, but the meer Moments of Naked</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52593:3"/>
               <hi>Truth to sway him) in explaining the Visions of the</hi> Apocalypse <hi>and</hi> Daniel; <hi>and that, as for the good of the Church in general, so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for the just Interest of the</hi> Church <hi>and</hi> Crown <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>as well against all</hi> Fanatical <hi>Fury, as against all the Finenesses of</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And what an enormous Outrage the first is, we may easily conceive from hence; That by the same slight that he slurs the Intelligible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Visions of the</hi> Apocalypse, <hi>all the Prophecies of the Scripture may be slurred and made useless, as having no certain Sense at all, because Men have presumed to expound them differently. Which plainly is to destroy the main Strength and Glory of our Christian Religion, and that Support which is in such an extraordinary way peculiar to it; no Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the World being so confirmed by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of Prophecies, as it is. Which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of Prophecies does not onely strengthen the Christian Religion, but is an assured sign of the Truth of Natural Religion also, That there is a God, and Providence, and Spirits or Angels, and an Immortal Spirit in Man, and a Life to come. All which Advantages</hi> R. B. <hi>gives away in an unaccountable Freak of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52593:3"/>
Scepticism, <hi>and an affected professing (after an operose proposing of the diverse Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Writers on the</hi> Apocalypse) <hi>that he knows not which is true. The sense of which dealing, to any man that is not shallow witted, must needs seem an Ostentation of his</hi> singular <hi>Nasuteness, that when others are such Fools as to think they understand these Prophecies, he discerns that they are plainly</hi> Unintelligible, <hi>and so in an overweening conceit of his own Perspicacity and Discernment, proudly tramples upon all the Learned and Pious Endeavours of such as have attempted to find out the genuine sense of these Holy Oracles of God. Would any one take the pains so operosely to set out his</hi> own Ignorance <hi>to the World in good earnest, but that his blind and haughty Heart did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject therein an esteem to himself of a</hi> peculiar Knowledge, viz. <hi>That nothing at all is to be known in</hi> Scripture Prophecies? <hi>His inept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to which Studies, it's likely, made the doughty</hi> Rationalist <hi>divert to other Theories, and employ his fiery unquiet Spirits to the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a</hi> Method of Theology, <hi>and so to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain young Students with a Sack stuffed full of an infinite Number of dry Chips,</hi> sine succo &amp; sanguine, <hi>unless besprinkled here and there</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52593:4"/>
               <hi>with the Blood of</hi> Priscian'<hi>s broken Pate. But this is something</hi> extra oleas: <hi>Let us pass to the second Injury propounded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this is against the Church of</hi> England, <hi>whom he could not but know to be an express Declarer against the</hi> Idolatries <hi>of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>as is plain out of the Homilies, and to apply some Visions of the</hi> Apocalypse <hi>to the Case: Which is very rationally done, it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incredible, if not impossible, that that Book of Visions setting out the State of the Christian Church from its Beginning, to the End of the World, should omit the</hi> Visionary <hi>noting of such an huge Degeneracy in the Church as</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, <hi>and</hi> bloody Persecution <hi>for not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thereto. Whence our Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>observing Visions so easily and naturally interpretable that way, could not miss of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the Present State of Things, and declare the Church of</hi> Rome, Babylon, <hi>out of which God's People are warned to depart. Which Voice is a most plain and solid Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our separating from the Church of</hi> Rome. <hi>Now for</hi> R. B. <hi>to make it such an hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous thing to interpret any of the</hi> Apocalyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick <hi>Visions against such gross Enormities of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and to make such a</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
<pb facs="tcp:52593:4"/>
               <hi>deal ado about it, as if it were such an Inflamer of the Rage of the</hi> Romanists, <hi>that they would destroy all those that presumed to make any such Application; this Demeanour of his seemed to me to proceed out of a malicious Pique against our Church, as if he would cry</hi> Hallow <hi>to the</hi> Pontificians, <hi>to worry the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and devour it. Which, as it is a</hi> salvage Injury <hi>to our Church, so it is a</hi> gross Indignity <hi>offered to our</hi> English Romanists, <hi>who are Men of a more humane spirit, and not prone to take any more offence at our Churches conceiving their Church to be prefigured by the City of</hi> Babylon, <hi>than we do take at their deeming us</hi> Hereticks, <hi>which is as Criminal a Reproach as can be charged upon any Person. But though these be the Terms of Theological Disputants on each Side, yet Neighbourliness and Good-nature washes them out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of both. And the fair Interpretation of these two severe Terms,</hi> Babylon <hi>and</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, <hi>may be onely this, That the one Party is resolved never to return into</hi> Babylon, <hi>out of which God's People are bid to depart; nor the other to forsake</hi> Rome, <hi>for danger of becoming</hi> Hereticks, <hi>till God shall give better Light. But in the mean time, though they cannot join</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52593:5"/>
               <hi>in a</hi> Religious <hi>Society, nothing hinders but that they may accord in</hi> common <hi>Offices of</hi> Civility <hi>and</hi> Humanity, <hi>and of hearty</hi> Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourliness <hi>one towards another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now, thirdly, and lastly; For the Injury done to Dr.</hi> H. M. <hi>besides what he suffers in common with the</hi> Church of England, <hi>there seems a particular Spite vented against him in</hi> R. B. <hi>his demeaning himself thus in what he has writ in reference to the</hi> Apocalypse; <hi>he moving a many</hi> sleeveless <hi>Questions,</hi> unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, <hi>to ensnare him, and entangle him: When as there is none of them, but if wilful blindness, and natural ineptitude to these things, be no bar,</hi> R. B. <hi>might fully satisfie himself out of what the Doctor has already written. But that which</hi> R. B. <hi>seems to desire to perstringe most in the Doctor, is his</hi> great confidence <hi>of the Truth of his Interpretations in the most concerning Visions: Which</hi> R. B. <hi>his unacquaintedness with clearness of Conception, makes him the more wonder at. For certainly those that conceive things</hi> clearly <hi>and</hi> distinctly, <hi>will be</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>of the</hi> Truth <hi>they discover, whether they will or no. But men that have a</hi> turbid <hi>and</hi> tumultuary <hi>Fancy and Conception, may read much, and write much, and be certain of nothing</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:52593:5"/>
               <hi>when they have done; or if they seem to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so to be, may prove grosly deceived, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly</hi> R. B. <hi>was in his making the</hi> Soul <hi>of Man</hi> Fire. <hi>Which Dream of his (and all men dream waking, till their pure Intellectual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties be sufficiently excited, out of the dull Sopour they are held in by this Terrestrial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) proceeded in all likelihood from the furious fiery Complexion of his very Body, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated Spirits; and I wish the</hi> Annotator's Digression, <hi>that exposes</hi> R. B. <hi>his Folly, in medling with</hi> Theories <hi>he was not able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, may not have stuck in his Stomach, and so instigated him to take this opportunity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But as for the Doctor's</hi> Confidence, <hi>and his</hi> profession <hi>thereof in Matters that tend so much to the good of</hi> Mankind, <hi>to the good of the</hi> Church in general, <hi>and more particularly to the good of the</hi> Church <hi>and</hi> Monarchy <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>I shall sufficiently consider</hi> that, <hi>and the Reasons thereof, in my</hi> Reflexions; <hi>and my</hi> Preface <hi>has run out further already than I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But by this time I hope I have declared enough to prepare thee with candour to peruse what I have cursorily writ, for the justly expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>AFter I had the Opportunity of perusing in MS. Dr. <hi>H. More</hi> his <hi>Paralipomena Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetica;</hi> so it hapned, that a Friend of mine gave me notice, and also procured me the sight of what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had done upon the <hi>Revelations;</hi> of whom I having heard hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what a confident Man he was of the <hi>unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligibleness</hi> of that Book, though I was assured of the Vanity of that Confidence, yet I thought he had studied that Sacred Writing with that Care and Searchingness, that he was able to find such Flaws in what Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and Dr. <hi>More</hi> have writ, that it might give the Doctor just occasion to enlarge his <hi>Paralipomena,</hi> in clearing such shrewd Difficulties as <hi>R. B.</hi> was able to propose, and rectifie, if any thing were amiss in the Doctor's Interpretations, by what <hi>R. B.</hi> had searched out by his anxious Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. But things have fallen out quite contrary
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52593:7"/>
to my expectation, there being nothing either in his <hi>Notes</hi> on the <hi>Revelation,</hi> or in his <hi>Advertisement</hi> or his <hi>Postscript,</hi> offered as Difficulties, but such as with reading either Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> or the <hi>Doctor,</hi> (if <hi>R. B.</hi> his Parts be not very low sunk) he might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily satisfie himself in.</p>
            <p>But I perceive it was never his Intent to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in these Studies, preferring an <hi>affected igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Pride,</hi> before <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>useful Knowledge;</hi> nay, before the Glory of God, and a due Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of his Care and Providence over his Church, in setting out the State thereof from the Beginning of it to the End of the World; which is incredible but he should do in this Volumn of Visions, the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> which <hi>begins</hi> with the Church, and <hi>reaches</hi> to the <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>R. B.</hi> his own acknowledgment. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there should be no Visions touching the <hi>great Degeneracy</hi> of the Church, and of the <hi>late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> from such gross Corruptions, which <hi>R. B.</hi> himself confesses that they deserved greater Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than the Beast and False Prophet mentioned in the <hi>Revelations, (Advertis. p.</hi> 10.) is a thing <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible</hi> altogether, nay, I may say, <hi>impossible.</hi> Nor can all the Wars, Persecution, and Victories of the Church, prefigured in this Book, be restrained to the <hi>Pagan</hi> Empire, and the Times of the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Christians: A thing which <hi>R. B.</hi> disowns, on <hi>Apoc. ch.</hi> v. 1. where, says he, <hi>I cannot conceive those two Learned Mens</hi> Exposition (meaning <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond) who make the</hi> Apocalypse <hi>an Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a Prophetick Stile, and say, that most or very much of it was done before it was written:</hi> And yet to slur the Learned and Pious Labours of Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52593:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he equally, if not more, inclines to their two senses of the Prophecies, than to the other. So inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent is he with himself.</p>
            <p>And indeed he has quitted himself so sorrily and triflingly, if I may be so free as to censure the Writings of one who has writ so much, that some toying Wit may be tempted to fansie the weakness of his Performance, and professed Ignorance, a <hi>flat</hi> Contradiction to the very <hi>Physnomy</hi> of his Face pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed before his Book, whose vast, <hi>eminent,</hi> arched Nose promises no small reach of Wit, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of Understanding: But behold the <hi>Todca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> Prodigy,
<q>
                  <l>—Lignosum structum sine flumine Pontem.</l>
               </q>
an <hi>huge, massie Nose,</hi> devoid of all <hi>Sagacity</hi> under it.</p>
            <p>But to vindicate <hi>R. B.</hi> and his Nose from any such slur, though he makes nothing of flurring the <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Pious</hi> of others; it is not that he wants either Nose or Wit to find out the true Sense of the Book of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> which he slurs, together with the best Intepreters, not to say the Spirit himself that writ it, in making the Sense thereof so <hi>desperately</hi> uncertain and <hi>unintelligible,</hi> and so to <hi>signifie nothing:</hi> but he has been, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Confession, either <hi>rash</hi> or <hi>lazy</hi> in the matter, <hi>(Advertis. p.</hi> 1.) <hi>Forty four years ago,</hi> says he, <hi>I studied it, I doubt, too soon,</hi> (so do I, or at least that you did it too carelesly); and then he reckons up several Authors which he read, names some, and intimates more. And amongst those he names, are <hi>Mede</hi> and <hi>Potter;</hi> and after that he read Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> Dr. <hi>More, Grotius,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> but withal he confesses he did it <hi>superficially.</hi> So that rightly to plead his Cause, it was not for want
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52593:8"/>
of <hi>Nose</hi> or <hi>Wit,</hi> but due and seasonable <hi>Industry</hi> to master the Books he read, or for want of good luck or direction to betake himself to the <hi>best</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Kind, or the <hi>best</hi> Pieces of their Writings, that has rendred him such a <hi>puzzled Thing</hi> as he professes himself. I appeal to him, if he ever was fully Master of Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s <hi>Synchronisms.</hi> I dare say, his desultory and tumultuary Phancy would never be fettered to so close Animadversion. But if he had with patience and steadiness of Mind ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himself to the <hi>Synchronistical</hi> Part, so as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to have understood it, it is impossible but he should have avoided this foul Scepticism touching these holy Visions. But without this <hi>Synchronisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Skill, and the Knowledge of the <hi>Prophetick Style,</hi> to pretend to <hi>understand</hi> the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> or to judge whether it be <hi>intelligible</hi> or no, is as fond, as to pretend to give the true and certain Meaning, or to be able to judge whether the said Meaning can be given, of a <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> Author, while one is very raw and ignorant in the <hi>Lexicographal</hi> Part, and quite devoid of the Skill of <hi>Grammar</hi> or <hi>Syntax.</hi> And this has made <hi>R. B.</hi> that he can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (having read a World of Authors to no better purpose), in stead of informing the Judgment of him that peruses his <hi>Notes,</hi> onely distract his Mind with abundance of variety of Opinions, not able to decide which is Truth. Which is such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent <hi>Stuffage</hi> of the Mind, that the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is not thereby perfected, but burdened; and serves for no use, unless for <hi>R. B.</hi> his vain Osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of having read so many Books, though he has concocted nothing: Like <hi>Marriot</hi> of <hi>Grays-Inn</hi> (as I remember), who was a prodigious Eater, but
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52593:9"/>
neither a stronger Man, nor a better Lawyer, for being such an <hi>Helluo Ciborum,</hi> as this other, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not to be wanting to <hi>R. B.</hi> in any just De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that may excuse the matter; his producing all along so many several Opinions, is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther useless: For though he <hi>himself</hi> cannot decide what is true, yet the <hi>Reader</hi> may; and for this end he sets down so many Opinions, that others may decide what is true. Which is something like the Story a Friend told me, of one <hi>Robbin,</hi> an Hind in a Country-Gentleman's House, that could no read a Letter on the Book, but yet was earnest with the Gentleman's Son, a young Scholar, that went to School, and could write well, to teach <hi>him</hi> to write. To which the young Scholar saying, <hi>Why,</hi> Robbin, <hi>thou canst not read; to what purpose therefore is it to learn thee to write? O Master,</hi> says he, <hi>do but teach me to write, I will get some body else to read it.</hi> So <hi>R. B.</hi> has got the Faculty of Writing and Reading, or rather of Reading and Writing of multifarious Opinions, but he must leave the Office of <hi>Spelling out</hi> which is the truest, to some other.</p>
            <p>That also further recommends his great Modesty, in that he so seldom takes upon him to decide; forasmuch as when he does it the most peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to any indifferent Man he must needs seem to do it most injudiciously; as in that of the Vision of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> having a <hi>Prophetical</hi> meaning: <hi>This,</hi> says he, <hi>being impossible to be proved, is rather to pretend another Revelation, than to expound this.</hi> This is very pertly and <hi>magisterially</hi> spoken. But the Doctor with no less than <hi>Twenty solid</hi> Arguments, in his <hi>Exposition of the Seven Churches,</hi> has so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52593:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there must be a Prophetical Sense of that Vision, that he may well challenge <hi>R. B.</hi> or any more able than he, to confute them if he can. And <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5. 13. he dogmatizes there again, and tells us, those <hi>under the</hi> Earth are the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> on the other side of the Earth. As unphilosophically as magisterially decided! The <hi>Antipodes</hi> are no more under the Earth, than we are; both being above and equidistant from the lowest Center of the Earth. But this is pardonable in a Person so little conversant in Philosophy.</p>
            <p>And now to shew how impartial I am, I will take notice of something that is commendable, and that I would recommend to the rest of his Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Brethren, such especially as fansie Monarchy and Political Government inconsistent with the Reign of Christ, or his Kingdom. And it is his Note on <hi>Apoc. c.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Now is come Salvation, and Strength, and the Kingdom of our God, and the Power of his Christ. Note,</hi> says he, <hi>If Christian Kingdoms be so honourable, and called the Kingdoms of God, and the Power of Christ, and the Fall of Devils; let them better consider it, that cry them down under the name of National Churches, and would have Churches onely to be some gathered out of the Multitude.</hi> This is the onely remarkable sincere Stroke that occurs in all his Notes on the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> so far as I can remember, if he be therein sincere, and heartily contradict his Opinions and Practices in former times. To pass by therefore the mawkish, raw, and dough-bak'd Fancies that are scattered in his <hi>Annotations</hi> on the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> I proceed to his <hi>Advertisement,</hi> where I will use all possible brevity that can be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52593:10"/>
I have already noted out of the first Page, how unseasonably, according to his own Confession, some Forty years ago he betook himself to the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Apocalypse. I doubt, too soon,</hi> says he; and I do not doubt but <hi>too negligently. But then,</hi> says he, <hi>I read</hi> Brightman, Napier, Pareus, &amp;c. <hi>and after that,</hi> Mede, Potter, <hi>and</hi> many <hi>more, besides</hi> Dounhamus de Antichristo, Broughton, <hi>and</hi> other <hi>such; and also the Answerers of</hi> Bellarmine. <hi>He conversed with his Fellow-labourer Mr.</hi> Stevens, <hi>(du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Schism against the Church of</hi> England) <hi>who has written of it, and was much upon it in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse; but I durst not be drawn to a deep Study of it. And when since I read Mr.</hi> Durham, <hi>Dr.</hi> More, &amp;c. <hi>and</hi> Grotius, <hi>and Dr.</hi> Hammond, <hi>and</hi> many <hi>Annotators, I confess Despair, and more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Business, made me do it but</hi> superficially. This is his own Account of his Preparedness to write on the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> when he having <hi>scambled</hi> through a multitude of Authors <hi>carelesly</hi> and <hi>superficially,</hi> he was, for any certain sense of the main and most weighty Visions of that Divine Writing, as unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved of the Truth of things, as when he first began. So that having nothing to deliver to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Understanding Reader, or confirm the Faith of them that want a Guide; yet, as if he laboured under the <hi>Scripturient</hi> Disease even to a <hi>Tenesmus,</hi> could not forbear to write on the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> though he had nothing to write.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, according to his own confession, the Case stands thus; That his Mind wanting those Faculties, which in the Bodily Nourishment answer to the <hi>Concoctive</hi> and <hi>Expulsive</hi> Faculty, which <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes</hi> that which is <hi>Exerementitious</hi> from what is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52593:10"/>
               <hi>good Nourishment;</hi> he wanting, I say, this <hi>secern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Faculty, was not edified by the reading, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gutling up so many Books as he has hastily read, being not able to distinguish betwixt what was <hi>sound Food,</hi> and what was to be sent packing and egested as <hi>course Excrement.</hi> And therefore, as he has taken them in, so he has put them out all alike, or rather <hi>vomited</hi> them up altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Digestion or Concoction; contrary to the Boast of that considerate Writer, that excused his slow Performances with an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I am not of the number of those that vomit, but that weigh accurately what they publish to the World.</hi> This I declare, to the end that no man may be so foolish as to think the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> really the less intelligible for <hi>R. B.</hi> his not understanding it, after his reading so many Authors about it, in his <hi>tumultuary</hi> and <hi>superficial</hi> way: When as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Concealment,</hi> as well as certainty of <hi>Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> was the measure of the framing of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> And as they are not to be understood by the lazy, perfunctory, or prejudiced Peruser of them, and of their best Interpreters; so are they clearly and certainly to be understood by those who with diligence and humility, by those who orderly and methodically set themselves to study them, as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> to his everlasting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation did.</p>
            <p>And therefore he first published his <hi>Clavis Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calyptica,</hi> a <hi>little</hi> Book, but of <hi>vast</hi> moment for the right understanding of the <hi>Apocalypse. R. B.</hi> should have first so fully understood that Book, as that he might be able to judge whether his <hi>Synchronisms</hi> would hold or not: This is the course the Doctor
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52593:11"/>
took, whereby he was enabled <hi>as</hi> to be assured of the truth of most of his <hi>Synchronisms, so</hi> to reject his placeing of the Vials before the Seventh Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet and rising of the Witnesses, which was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky mistake of Mr. <hi>Medes,</hi> and which therefore the Doctor has rectified in his <hi>Synchronistical Scheme,</hi> which <hi>R. B.</hi> may see in his <hi>Epilogue</hi> placed after his <hi>Exposition of the Apocalypse,</hi> where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends the rest of Mr. <hi>Medes Synchronisms</hi> against the <hi>Allegations</hi> of <hi>R. H.</hi> which small Treatise, that <hi>Epilogue,</hi> I suspect <hi>R. B.</hi> never read, no not so much as superficially. But if he had read it diligently, and made himself Master of it, it is impossible I think he should remain so ignorant of these Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyptick Points as he pretends he is. It is the firm ground the Doctors Exposition stands upon, and we may safely challenge <hi>R. B.</hi> to enervate it if he can. But to read an Author superficially, and then to slight him, is like the Villany of those Men that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate themselves into the company of such as they have a mind to have a pretence of saying of them what they please. And thus has <hi>R. B.</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the most Pious, Serious, and Learned Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of the best Interpreters of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what a Wooden Soul this <hi>R. B.</hi> has, one may further discern <hi>(pag.</hi> 4.) by his huge averseness from the calling of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and his marvelous weak arguing against it: And yet his strait and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Mind hugs her self in this cold and crudled In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity. And indeed <hi>R. B.</hi> seems to me not only to have a <hi>Wooden Soul,</hi> but a <hi>Stony Heart,</hi> which neither the Authority of the Ancient Church, which generally held that there would be such an illustrious calling of the <hi>Iews</hi> towards the end of the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52593:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
World (as you may see in <hi>Cornelius a Lapide</hi> upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25.) nor those many Predictions of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prophets, which plainly imply as much, nor that noble Discourse of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the eleventh to the <hi>Romans</hi> about this Point, have been able to pierce, for the admittance of so glorious and gracious a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastrophe</hi> of Gods Providence towards his own <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi> People the <hi>Iews,</hi> who have suffered so great and durable Calamities and Severities of Affliction from Him, who yet is stiled the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and is said to have an <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi> Covenant with that People. To let go those several pertinent Passages in the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> we will only set before the Eyes of <hi>R. B.</hi> what St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25. <hi>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this Mystery, that blindness in part is happened to</hi> Israel, <hi>until the fulness of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be come, and so all</hi> Israel <hi>shall be saved.</hi> Here <hi>Israel</hi> in both places is evidently opposed to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi>'s being detain'd in <hi>unbelief</hi> for a time, <hi>till the fulness of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>come in,</hi> opposed to the <hi>Gentiles Belief.</hi> And this is called a <hi>Mystery,</hi> a great <hi>Arcanum</hi> of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, concerning which the Apostle breaks out into those expressions of profound admiration, <hi>v.</hi> 33. <hi>O the depth of the riches, both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God; how unsearchable are his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his Ways past finding out.</hi> That this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to such a <hi>shriveled</hi> account as <hi>R. B.</hi> gives of this Chapter, is a thing incredible. So that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with what Face he could put out his Notes on this Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> after he had perused those of <hi>Sam. Clark;</hi> who has given so easie, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and Genuine Sense of the said Chapter all along,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52593:12"/>
and of whom <hi>R. B.</hi> himself gives this Testimony, that he is a person of great Judgment, Piety, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and Meekness, <hi>Humility</hi> I suppose he means, and he should have remembred in the perusing his Notes on this Chapter, <hi>that God resisteth the</hi> Proud, <hi>and gives Grace and Wisdom to the</hi> Humble <hi>and Meek.</hi> The want of which made <hi>R. B.</hi> impatient of being better instructed by his <hi>Iunior.</hi> But that a Man so operosely and affectedly professing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> should be content that God should be so <hi>irreconcileably in Wrath</hi> toward the Nation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> as to leave them in the lurch for ever, after so many <hi>splendid Predictions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> is a sign that there is little in the bottom of that Principle in him, but that it is onely an Hypocritical boast thereof. But I have run out further on this Theme than I intended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R. B.</hi> his crude Indigestion of the many Books he has read, has filled the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and part of the ninth Page of his <hi>Advertisement</hi> with a number of Objections, first bred in his Brain, and after scattered on the Paper, like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little crawling Worms or Serpents; but such as can sting none but himself, or such as are as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant or more ignorant than himself: They are about the <hi>Whore,</hi> and the <hi>Beast,</hi> and the like; and he renders his Reason of producing these pretended Difficulties, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. <hi>I mention,</hi> says he, <hi>what I have done, to tell you why I understand not the</hi> Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But by this I plainly understand, that he has not at all consider'd the Doctor's <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Beast</hi> and the <hi>Whore,</hi> though he pretends to have read his Books. For not one of this numerous Fry or Swarm of Difficulties do in the least enervate his

Exposition of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> But he raises Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties against such Authors, or Passages in them, as are most obnoxious to delude and seduce the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. This seems to me very disingenuous Dealing.</p>
            <p>But now, from his tenth Page, to the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, there are miscellanious Matters scattered in him, of a different Interpretation, some better, some worse. The better sort are such things as these: <hi>That Popes and Papists, that allow all those things which he sets down as the Miscarriages charged on that Church,</hi> (pag. 10.) <hi>are liable before God to greater Punishments than the</hi> Beast <hi>and</hi> False Prophet <hi>mentioned in the</hi> Revelations, &amp;c. And, <hi>That</hi> Love <hi>is Christ's Work and Character, and</hi> Hatred <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's; and that we must avoid all unnecessary Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Wrath, and Hatred.</hi> And, pag. 11. <hi>That we must not call every thing</hi> Antichristian <hi>that displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth us, or that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>has used, or doth use.</hi> And, p. 15. <hi>To own Christ and his Gospel, and to murder Thousands or Millions in his Name, for not obeying the Pope in professing Transubstantiation, is incomparably a more aggravated Crime, than the most bloody Pagan Persecution was.</hi> And, (p. 16.) <hi>Christ has one diffused visible Church over the World, and the Pope made another by Usurpation and Rebellion, which was</hi> Regnum in Regno, <hi>as any Rebel might do that could get Strength to set up a Party in Power, to call himself King in some part of a Kingdom. Such an</hi> Antichristianity <hi>as this,</hi> says he, <hi>I make no doubt but the Papacy became guilty of.</hi> And I will insert here what he says in his Notes on 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. <hi>I can easily see many and great Points in which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery is contrary to the Word of God; and I am most</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52593:13"/>
               <hi>moved by such Moral Arguments as Dr.</hi> H. More <hi>useth in his</hi> Mystery of Iniquity; he means that Part which is called <hi>Idea Antichristianismi.</hi> But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his <hi>Advertisement, pag.</hi> 16. where he says, <hi>Let them prove that</hi> Popes <hi>have not been</hi> Antichrists, <hi>that can; it's none of my Work. But if you are never so sure that it is he indeed, pull him not down by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Truths, Duty, or Things lawful,</hi> Antichristian; <hi>nor by telling men, that all Protestants are Idolaters or Antichristian, if they forsake not the Communion of all our Parochial Protestant Churches, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists may re-enter into them as deserted Garrisons, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let any man judge what an <hi>Humorist</hi> this <hi>R. B.</hi> is, who allowing that such things are found in the Papacy that may well furnish out an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> and that are <hi>worse</hi> than <hi>Pagan</hi> as to the matter of Persecution; and whose Constitution is such, that those that act accordingly, deserve <hi>greater</hi> Punishment than the <hi>False Prophet</hi> and the <hi>Beast</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Apocalypse;</hi> and intimates, that the Doctor's <hi>Idea of Antichristianism</hi> is a right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of such Points of <hi>Popery</hi> as are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Word of God; and yet will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this <hi>strange Degeneracy</hi> of the Church to be <hi>prefigured</hi> in a Book of Prophecies, the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> which was writ on purpose to set out the State of the Church from the Beginning thereof, to the End of the World. What can be more incredible? As many as acknowledge the gross Superstitions, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries, and most salvage Persecutions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet deny that they are prefigured in the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> seem to <hi>envy</hi> Christ the <hi>Glory</hi> of so <hi>faithfully</hi> and <hi>punctually predicting</hi> the <hi>State</hi> of his <hi>Church;</hi> and the Church yet <hi>unreformed,</hi> such an

               <hi>excellent Help</hi> to her <hi>Reformation;</hi> and the whole Church such a special <hi>Corroboration</hi> of their Faith in God and Christ, and of a Divine Providence that watches over the Affairs of Men, and of his Church especially; and seem <hi>peevishly</hi> to obscure that Privilege that <hi>Christianity</hi> has above all other Religions in the World, the Visions of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> clearly understood, being the <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Strength and Glory</hi> of our Christian Religion. And therefore I must consess it has raised my Zeal and Indignation against <hi>R. B.</hi> his mawkish <hi>Notes</hi> on the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> which look more like <hi>prophane Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonry,</hi> to <hi>rogue</hi> and <hi>abuse</hi> so <hi>Sacred</hi> a Writing, than a Business of any <hi>edification</hi> to the People of God. And for <hi>R. B.</hi> his Care that those things should not be called <hi>Antichristian</hi> that really were not so, that was one of the Ends of the Doctor's writing his <hi>Idea of Antichristianism,</hi> as himself has declared in the very first Chapter thereof. And what he speaks for <hi>Christian Love,</hi> and against <hi>unnecessary Division,</hi> O that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had had those Sentiments about Forty years ago, and that he had been as tender of unnecessary dividing from the so well constituted Church of <hi>England,</hi> as he would now make shew he is from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> certainly he might enjoy a more peaceful Conscience, and serene Mind. But I take no pleasure in raking into such a Sore.</p>
            <p>The things I like not in some of these eight last Pages, are such as these. (1.) He intimates, <hi>p.</hi> 10. <hi>That they that interpret</hi> Babylon <hi>of</hi> Rome Papal, <hi>turn Religion into Love-killing Faction; and they that believe such an Interpretation, hate and abhor all</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists <hi>merely because they are such, nor have any Evidence for their Opinion, but that such or such a</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:52593:14"/>
               <hi>Private Teacher has told them so.</hi> (2.) He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, <hi>That this interpreting the usual Places of the</hi> Revelations, <hi>(p.</hi> 11.) <hi>of the</hi> Papacy, <hi>that all</hi> Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists <hi>are tempted thereby to hate us and destroy us.</hi> (3.) <hi>To make such Interpretations as these, is to add to the Sense of the Book, and to incur the Curse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> Rev. 22. 18. the Plagues written in the Book. (4.) He says, <hi>The Sense must needs be uncertain, where five of the wisest are of four minds.</hi> (5.) <hi>I blame not modest Conjectures,</hi> saith he, <hi>if men will but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess their uncertainty when they are uncertain, nor use their Interpreting to kindle a partial, hating, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Zeal.</hi> (6) <hi>I confess,</hi> saith he, <hi>I am less able to expound Prophecies than</hi> Daniel, <hi>who yet thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,</hi> ch. 12. 8. And I heard, but understood not. Then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things? And he said, Go thy way, <hi>Daniel;</hi> for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. And <hi>yet,</hi> he says, <hi>he makes no doubt but the</hi> Revelation <hi>is God's Word, though he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands it not.</hi> (7.) And lastly, pag. 12. <hi>To them that say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> saith he, <hi>The Pope is the Beast, the Whore of</hi> Babylon, <hi>the Man of Sin, the</hi> Antichrist, <hi>you have a shift of the contempt of his Words, as of a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, uncertain thing; but who knoweth not that the plain Law of God concludeth, that the Proud, the Worldly, the Malignant, the Idolatrous, Murderers, Persecutors, Liars, the Enemies of Christ's Gospel and serious Godliness, are Satan's Slaves, and shall not enter into the Kingdom of God?</hi> There is something of Good mingled in some of these Sayings; but little Good intended, so far as I discern. But I shall briefly answer to each Particular.</p>
            <p>To the (1.) first, I say, Here <hi>R. B.</hi> bewrays an ill
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52593:14"/>
Nature (as they that have the <hi>Jaundies,</hi> things seem to them yellow.) I know by experience the contrary, and the Doctors Interpretations of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse,</hi> of the truth of which I am sufficiently confident, though they make the <hi>Papal Corruptions</hi> concerned in the Vision of the <hi>Beast,</hi> the <hi>Whore</hi> and <hi>False-Prophet,</hi> yet I never had the more hatred or disgust against the <hi>Romanists</hi> for that. But as for their <hi>Corruptions,</hi> I thought their being shewn them in those and the like Visions to be so lively prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, were the most likely way to make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on their Condition, and seek timely by an <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly</hi> Reformation to amend it, those Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ever avoiding the least shew of encouragement for such a Reformation as is to be carried on by <hi>Popular Tumults</hi> and the <hi>Sword,</hi> and suggesting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that the most effectual Instruments in the Hands of <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> will be those that he calls the <hi>Philadelphian</hi> Church, who are made up of <hi>Loyalty</hi> to their Prince, be he of the <hi>Reformèd</hi> or <hi>Unrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> Religion, and of an <hi>hearty sincere Love</hi> to <hi>all</hi> Christendom, and to <hi>Universal</hi> Mankind. This Spirit <hi>Aromatizes</hi> the Doctors <hi>whole</hi> Interpretation of the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> But there are some Diseased Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that cannot bear the scent of sweet Odours. Grosser Minds are for a Gross War, and Gross Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which is Diametrically opposite to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Interpretations. Which it may be therefore, <hi>R. B.</hi> being of a more <hi>Iron, Martial</hi> Spirit, may be the more averse from, if <hi>Age</hi> has not, as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, <hi>mellowed</hi> him into a better Mind. And as for such <hi>Interpretations</hi> as concern the <hi>Papacy,</hi> that they are onely the dictates of some <hi>private</hi> Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the <hi>Antichristianity</hi> of the Papacy was the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52593:15"/>
Doctrine of the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches. And <hi>R. B.</hi> upon his <hi>Private</hi> Spirit adventuring to be a <hi>Separative Guide,</hi> has thus <hi>bewildred</hi> himself and his followers. Whenas this <hi>Antichristianity</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a Doctrine own'd by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Jewel</hi> against <hi>Harding</hi> was ordered to be placed in every Parish Church. And the main things of this kind are so plain, that ordinary People are able to <hi>understand</hi> them, and not <hi>believe</hi> them <hi>onely</hi> because the Reformed Churches say so.</p>
            <p>To the (2) second, It seems to me to be a piece of uncharitableness in <hi>R. B.</hi> that he should have such an harsh opinion of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but see, that it is not any <hi>malice</hi> in us Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, but the <hi>Natural Interpretableness</hi> of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypse</hi> that way, that we use those Prophetick Scriptures to <hi>defend</hi> our <hi>own</hi> Religion, and <hi>convince</hi> them of the <hi>errour</hi> of <hi>theirs.</hi> For my own part I think better of them, nor can I (who have so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten admired those Divine strains of Morality in that Pagan Emperours Meditations, <hi>M. Antoninus,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his Idolatrous Religion that could not debase his noble Nature,) forbear heartily to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that Virtue, Piety, Faithfulness and Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity that shines forth in any <hi>Romanist</hi> in despight of his <hi>Romanism</hi> that cannot suppress it. These hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid conceits of <hi>R. B.</hi> of Hatred and Murder from the Papists on this account are effects of <hi>Melancholy</hi> and <hi>Old Age.</hi> If the Doctor be Murdered for speaking Truth in the behalf of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he will find good Company in the other World, and be bid welome by that glorious Martyr of our Church, the Pious, Wise, and Virtuous <hi>Charles the First;</hi> or rather our Blessed Lord Jesus, who was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52593:15"/>
               <hi>Martyr'd</hi> and <hi>Crucified</hi> for us, will be ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive those that conscientiously suffer for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Honour. Ye believe in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve also in me,</hi> saith he, <hi>in my Fathers House there are many Mansions. If it were not so I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and recieve you to my self, that where I am, there you may be also.</hi> As certainly as Christ <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi> after his <hi>sufferings</hi> enjoys any thing in the other State, he that <hi>Conscientiously</hi> suffers <hi>for him,</hi> will thereupon be happy in the other World. And who would not adventure all in one Bottom with <hi>him</hi> to whom the <hi>Prophecies of old</hi> have given such <hi>ample Testimony</hi> (besides the <hi>History</hi> of his <hi>Miracles,</hi> and that <hi>Stupendious</hi> Volume of Visions the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse</hi> imparted by him to his Church) and whom so great a part of the World acknowledge to be the <hi>Son of God</hi> and <hi>Saviour of Mankind?</hi> Certainly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence is more benign and faithful, than to lay such a train as to entrap the most <hi>intelligent</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> to the <hi>loss of their lives in the World</hi> (as it fared with the <hi>Primitive Martyrs</hi> under the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Dragon,</hi> and with some hundred thousands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>healed Beast)</hi> if there be no <hi>Recompense</hi> for such sufferers in the <hi>World to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the (3) third, If to make such Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as <hi>R. B.</hi> counts uncertain, which yet may be true, according to his own account, for ought he knows, be to add to the Book, and incur the Plagues written therein, what does his <hi>Buffonry</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in his <hi>Notes,</hi> that takes away in a manner all that is writ of chiefest concern for the Instruction and Amendment of the Church, <hi>Roguing</hi> all the most
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52593:16"/>
useful Visions, and indeed all in a manner (casting away also the <hi>Prophetical</hi> Sense of the Seven Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches) into a meer <hi>sapless</hi> and <hi>useless Unintelligible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi> Let him scape the <hi>Plagues</hi> as well as he can, he will certainly incur the <hi>loss</hi> of all the <hi>precious Promises</hi> recorded in this Book.</p>
            <p>To the (4) fourth, I answer; It is meer <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry,</hi> and such as whereby all <hi>Philosophy</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> would be taken out of the World. There is the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, the <hi>Jewish,</hi> the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> and <hi>Pagan.</hi> Here any Three disagree from the Fourth; therefore they are all Uncertain, or False. But besides this, there is a <hi>general</hi> Consent of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Interpreters</hi> touching those Visions that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Corruptions of the <hi>Papacy, viz.</hi> That they are concerned therein, though some expedite the matter better than others. And <hi>Grotius</hi> his way, and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s, is meer: Novelty; and they may be both excused for so strangely straining their Wits for such Glosses. For <hi>Passion</hi> edges the <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Hatred</hi> as well as <hi>Love.</hi> And <hi>Grotius</hi> was deeply sensible of what he suffered from the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> more highly and nobly concerned for that <hi>Outrage</hi> which was done to the most <hi>Vertuous</hi> and <hi>Pious</hi> King, and <hi>best Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted</hi> Church in the World. To which Villany and Misery the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Expositions of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> were made use of, which frighted the good Doctor into another way. But the <hi>usual Protestant</hi> way, <hi>well rectified,</hi> does <hi>infinitely</hi> more Service to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> than such forced, incredible Glosses, such as <hi>R. B.</hi> himself is able to confute, though he be so staggering that he can stand to nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52593:16"/>
To the (5.) fifth, <hi>That men should confess their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, when they think themselves uncertain,</hi> I ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily admit. But I do not think it fair, that any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselves, much less the World, with what they are conscious to themselves is a meer Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. For this makes but a rumble and babble in the Minds and Mouths of Men, and makes them think, because they read much, and write much, they are learned and knowing, when there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Noise and empty Fancy and Ignorance at the bottom. <hi>Assured</hi> Knowledge, and <hi>useful,</hi> is the <hi>firm Food</hi> of the Soul. <hi>Uncertain</hi> Fancies and Opinions are no more than superfluous and noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Humours in a <hi>bloated</hi> Body. For my part, I should make <hi>a conscience</hi> in abusing the World with such <hi>Trash.</hi> And therefore the Doctor has openly declared, especially for the main and most useful Parts of his <hi>Exposition of the Apocalypse,</hi> that to him it is <hi>most certain</hi> and <hi>undoubted</hi> Knowledge. And his Confidence thereof he hath publickly professed, both at the end of his <hi>Epilogue</hi> annexed to his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Apocalypse,</hi> and also in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his <hi>Exposition of the Visions of Daniel,</hi> Sect 42. And he hath invited and provoked all that he could, to find what Flaws they could in his <hi>Expositions:</hi> And how he hath quit himself against <hi>S. E.</hi> the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marker,</hi> let the World judge; and also how well he further makes good what he hath writ, by his <hi>Paralipomena Prophetica.</hi> Every one is bound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he publishes a thing, to study the Point so throughly, that he can discern whether it will amount any further than to a <hi>Conjecture,</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is a <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>solid Truth;</hi> and then if it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>useful,</hi> to impart it to the World; and the <hi>more</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52593:17"/>
               <hi>useful,</hi> with the <hi>greater expression</hi> of <hi>confidence,</hi> he being assured of the Truth. And the Doctor's <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Apocalypse</hi> being so apparently <hi>useful,</hi> for the shewing the <hi>Excellency of the Constitution of the Church of England,</hi> it being the most choice part of the Completion of the <hi>Prophecy of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Witnesses,</hi> a Church that had the Honour to be so learnedly defended by the Royal Pen of King <hi>IAMES</hi> the First of Blessed Memory, and to be witnessed to by the <hi>Sacred Blood</hi> of that <hi>Glorious Martyr</hi> King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the First, the most Pious and Vertuous Prince that ever sway'd Scepter in <hi>Christendom;</hi> a Church renowned for <hi>singular Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi> and <hi>Love of Monarchy,</hi> insomuch that King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second (whose late Death we all still lament, though we are abundantly comforted in so <hi>Gracious</hi> a Successor) was heard to say, That the <hi>Church of England-Men</hi> were the <hi>best Subjects</hi> in the World; and lastly, such a Church as our present Gracious Soveraign King <hi>IAMES</hi> the Second (whom God grant a Long, Peaceful, and Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Reign over us), though (for our Sins, I fear) of the other Religion Himself, yet has graciously promised to maintain and support; this doing, of His <hi>Own</hi> most Noble and Free Mind, which was the <hi>onely thing</hi> that could with Reason and Equity be desired. But thus has His <hi>Heroical</hi> Spirit found the Opportunity to remonstrate to the World His <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>Crown,</hi> not onely by <hi>Lineal Descent,</hi> but <hi>Personal Merit.</hi> I say therefore, That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's <hi>Exposition of the Apocalypse</hi> tending to the winning of Men to <hi>such a Church as this,</hi> where not onely <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of Worship, but <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Monarchy</hi> is secured against <hi>Republicanism, Blood,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:52593:17"/>
and <hi>Rebellion;</hi> so that he has disarm'd the Fanaticks from either <hi>Pretense</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> or <hi>Hints</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> to plot their mischievous Designs, he having demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated the 1260 <hi>days</hi> to be passed, and the <hi>Rising of the Witnesses</hi> but a <hi>partial Fall</hi> of <hi>Antichristianism.</hi> Which things tend naturally, as I conceive, to the keeping of the <hi>Crowns</hi> of <hi>Monarchs</hi> on their <hi>Heads,</hi> and their <hi>Heads</hi> on their <hi>Shoulders.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I say, the matter being of so mighty moment, I hope <hi>R. B.</hi> will excuse his Novice (who yet is somewhat older than himself, though he write 70.) whom he would tutour and instruct, if he cannot be so demure and modest as he would have him to be, in matters that are so plain to <hi>him,</hi> and of so <hi>mighty importance</hi> for the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> of Princes against the Fanatical Rabble, who are as mad against <hi>Iesus Christ's Vicegerents,</hi> as the <hi>Iews</hi> were against <hi>Iesus</hi> himself, who would have no King but <hi>Caesar;</hi> nor these any <hi>Monarchs</hi> but a ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>King Iesus</hi> of their own, and domineering <hi>Presbytery,</hi> or shattered <hi>Anarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not be so uncharitable as to think <hi>R. B.</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fanatical sort of Men so disappointed by the Doctor's <hi>Exposition,</hi> from hatching any Evil against the Church of <hi>England</hi> and Monarchy out of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> has been so peevish as to represent the Book, as much as in himself lies, utterly <hi>unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,</hi> that because they can breed <hi>no Mischief</hi> our of it, it may prevent its doing <hi>any Good.</hi> The thing looks over-suspiciously on it. But I leave that to the search of his own Conscience. The latter part of his fifth Particular concerns not the Doctor, whose Expositions are onely for the evincing of Truth, and the convincing of the Conscience,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52593:18"/>
against Killing and Slaying by the Arm of Flesh. He is for no <hi>Division</hi> as to <hi>Civil Society,</hi> nor for <hi>Re-union</hi> of <hi>Protestants</hi> with <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> till they be better Reformed in Doctrine and Worship. But <hi>R. B.</hi> expresses himself so odly in these things, as if he insinuated himself <hi>Popishly</hi> and <hi>Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishly</hi> affected in one Breath. Such a way of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to me smells very mustily of Juggles and Hypocrisie.</p>
            <p>And now, (6.) To that freakish and impertinent Application of that Passage of <hi>Daniel,</hi> I oppose the very following Verse in that Chapter: <hi>Many shall be purified, made white, and tried,</hi> (ver. 10.) <hi>But the wicked shall do wickedly, and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand.</hi> Now whether it be the want of <hi>Holiness</hi> or <hi>Wisdom</hi> in <hi>R. B.</hi> or both, that he understands so little in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> I leave him to consult his own Heart therein, and to consider what a pleasant thing it is to Flesh and Blood to be a <hi>Segregative Rabboni,</hi> and to be applauded by a Sect, though <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Men understand as little the Reason why, as he understands <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Apocalypse.</hi> But while he acknowledges the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> to be the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and yet to be <hi>unintelligible,</hi> what is it but to reproach <hi>God</hi> and <hi>his Word</hi> too at once? <hi>Daniel</hi> tells us better News: <hi>The</hi> wicked <hi>shall</hi> not <hi>understand, but the</hi> wise <hi>shall</hi> understand. And yet this vain <hi>R. B.</hi> affects the esteem of more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Wisdom, in pretending not to understand these Visions; else why does he take the pains to ostentate his Ignorance, and so in effect to glory in his Shame?</p>
            <p>And, (7.) to the last, I say, The <hi>Romanists</hi> do
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52593:18"/>
more familiarly elude all those Charges of Idolatry, Murder, Persecution, Lying, and the like, charged upon them from Reason and Scripture. For to these they will answer; but since this demonstrative way by <hi>Synchronisms,</hi> that so plainly prove that those Visions which the Ancient Fathers interpret of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> necessarily fall into the Times of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> they have, so far as I know, ever had the Discretion to decline answering. Indeed <hi>R. B.</hi> tells us, That the Arguments he has writ against <hi>Popery</hi> in eight or nine Books, the <hi>Romanists</hi> have not answered; he, like a <hi>Suffenus,</hi> fancying they forbear to answer them till he be dead or disabled; when questionless it is because they <hi>slight</hi> them; or else, why is it that they have answered the ablest Champions of our <hi>English</hi> Church, (who yet med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with no Prophecies) and thus declined the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering him? When the Writings of these, excel those of <hi>R. B.</hi> as much as the richest <hi>Arras,</hi> the meanest <hi>Kedderminster-</hi>Stuff, as one wittily has made the Comparison.</p>
            <p>This Conceitedness of his Performance I meet with in his <hi>Postscript,</hi> which I have read over, thinking to meet with something new; but it is but <hi>Crambe bis cocta,</hi> and his Seventeen Questions so <hi>poor,</hi> that the <hi>meanest</hi> Capacity, that has any kind of propension to these Studies, may easily sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie himself, by consulting the latest Writers touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Points. To read <hi>R. B.</hi> his Writings, is as tedious to me, as to walk upon <hi>unsound</hi> Ground, <hi>Quagmire,</hi> or <hi>Quicksand, Arena sine calce;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will give my self no longer a <hi>Fatigue:</hi> though I cannot but take notice, how again he harps much upon that <hi>jarring</hi> String, where he supposes the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52593:19"/>
               <hi>Romanists</hi> so brutish and salvage, that they will kill and murder all such as from the <hi>Prophecies</hi> of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture conclude their Church <hi>Antichristian;</hi> when as himself cannot deny, but what they hold and practise, is so.</p>
            <p>What Disease of Ferocity has so tinctured the Mind and Fancy of <hi>R. B.</hi> that he should have such horrid Conceits of the Pontifician Party in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> When as they and our Church of <hi>England</hi> Men, both of highest and lowest Degree, have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in all Civility, Kindness, and Neighbourliness, for these many years, notwithstanding their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Religion, though the <hi>Romanists</hi> in the mean time, according to the <hi>Language</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi> could not but deem us <hi>Hereticks,</hi> of what Quality soever we were, <hi>Noble</hi> or <hi>Simple:</hi> When as yet no Phrase, neither <hi>proper</hi> nor <hi>symbolical,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a Man a more <hi>vile, detestable,</hi> and <hi>criminal Wretch,</hi> than an <hi>Heretick,</hi> with them; they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging them also to the <hi>worst</hi> and most <hi>reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Punishments, such as the most <hi>execrable Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> are adjudged to: And yet I am certain our Church of <hi>England Men</hi> have <hi>not at all</hi> been <hi>enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> or provoked against the <hi>Romanists,</hi> for all this. Why then should <hi>R. B.</hi> have so uncharitable a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> (they are <hi>Men,</hi> or rather <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-men,</hi> as well as we) that they should be so enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged like <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Tygers</hi> against the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Men,</hi> though they, keeping to the <hi>Style</hi> of <hi>their Church,</hi> must deem the Constitution of the <hi>Romish,</hi> as <hi>R. B.</hi> himself does, <hi>Antichristian;</hi> and that this State thereof is <hi>predicted</hi> in Scripture? This looks as if he still retained his <hi>inveterate</hi> spite against <hi>the Church of England,</hi> and even now in his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52593:19"/>
grunting and groaning condition, as he represents himself, as if he had one Foot in <hi>Charon</hi>'s Boat, yet would shew us a <hi>Mischievous Dog-trick</hi> at the last, and excite the <hi>Roman</hi> Wolves (as he Fancies them, he <hi>Cloathing them</hi> in his <hi>own Skin,</hi> or as much as he can <hi>transfusing</hi> his own <hi>mischievous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> into them at his hour of death) to tear us and devour us.
<q>
                  <l>—Quanquam media jam morte tenetur,</l>
                  <l>Non tamen abstinuit—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So fierce and unreconcileable an hatred does he bear (or acts so as if he did bear it) to our Church, that the approach of the extinction of this life can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not extinguish it. But having once injured the Church, he knows how, and not the Church him, he seems desirous to follow his first blow with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated strokes even to his last Breath. The <hi>Finis rei</hi> in this carriage of his, or <hi>Natural Tendency,</hi> is truly such: but whether it be <hi>Finis Personae,</hi> I leave to his own Conscience to examine.</p>
            <p>I will note but one thing more in this <hi>Post-script,</hi> which is his mentioning <hi>David Blundel</hi> and Pope <hi>Ione;</hi> which I should have omitted, but that it put me in mind of what fine sport Mr. <hi>Gadbury</hi> makes on that Subject in his <hi>Cardines Coeli,</hi> &amp;c. which would make a Man suspect <hi>R. B.</hi> to have let drop this in his <hi>Post-script</hi> to please Mr. <hi>Gadbury,</hi> whom he seems humbly to beseech to give him a Cast of his Skill in Calculating Nativities. For if not, why does he conclude his <hi>Advertisement</hi> thus? Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, 1684. Nov. 12. <hi>Natali Authoris. Aetat. suae</hi> 70. It is true, he has not set down the <hi>Hour</hi> of his Birth: But Mr. <hi>Gadbury,</hi> by <hi>Animodar, Trutina Hermetis,</hi> or <hi>Accidentia Nati,</hi> by any <hi>one</hi> of these,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52593:20"/>
as well as by the <hi>rest</hi> will rectifie the Time to a Cows Thumb, and then will find in a trice some <hi>Cardinal</hi> Sign in the <hi>Ascendent</hi> of this <hi>great</hi> Man, <hi>R. B.</hi> which of all the four is least likely to be <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra,</hi> he having writ so much, and <hi>weighing</hi> so little what he writes: Or if it be <hi>Libra,</hi> it may denote, that in his <hi>Balance</hi> the <hi>moments</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> for all different Expositions of the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> are of <hi>equal weight</hi> with him, even as the Sun at his entrance into <hi>Libra</hi> makes the <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Night equal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as for Mr. <hi>Blundel</hi> and Pope <hi>Ione,</hi> I will refer Mr. <hi>Gadbury,</hi> or any other judicious Reader, to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Iewel</hi> against <hi>Harding,</hi> from <hi>pag.</hi> 348, to <hi>pag.</hi> 353, and to Mr. <hi>Foulis</hi> his <hi>History of Romish Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Usurpations,</hi> pag. 180. who at last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thus, <hi>As for mine own Iudgment, I shall wrap it up without Partiality or Passion, in this, That I am so far from being satisfied with the Reasons brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the being of such a Woman Pope, that I may fancy those that assert a Pope</hi> Jone <hi>afford better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Testimony and Arguments, than those that deny it.</hi> And as <hi>Cook</hi> in <hi>English</hi> has sufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Floromondus</hi> and the rest, so does <hi>Maresius</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> and <hi>Congnard</hi> in <hi>French</hi> abundantly confute <hi>David Blundel,</hi> though a Man of great Reading. But be it this way or that way, it shall never trouble me, and so let every Man think as he pleaseth. To which I easily say, <hi>Amen.</hi> For the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Cause against her <hi>Opponents,</hi> whether <hi>Romanists</hi> or <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> depends not on such Curiosities.</p>
            <p>I find my self concern'd to say little more than to advertise seriously Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s followers, and in them all <hi>Sectaries,</hi> what a dreadful and dangerous
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52593:20"/>
thing it is to separate from an <hi>Authentick</hi> Church, <hi>reformed</hi> to the <hi>Pattern</hi> of the <hi>Symmetral</hi> or <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Ages,</hi> and to follow the guidance of a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Spirit;</hi> and I shall pray God, that Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> may repent sincerely, <hi>as</hi> of his former enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous sins against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Crown</hi> or <hi>Sacred Monarchy</hi> thereof, <hi>so</hi> likewise, that he may become <hi>really sensible</hi> and <hi>ashamed</hi> of his present <hi>Crooked Versuteness</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> and of <hi>Rogueing</hi> and <hi>Abusing</hi> the <hi>Divine Visions</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> (which the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> out of his Faithful Care and Providence has procured of his Father for the Guidance and Instruction of Christendom) by this his <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>profane Buffonry.</hi>
