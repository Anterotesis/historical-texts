            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Salutation of Love and tender Good-VVill TO THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE <hi>Peace, for the County of</hi> Bucks, <hi>and ſuch others in that County, and alſo throughout the Nation, as are concerned in the Contents hereof.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IF I ſhould warn you of the Day of the Lord (which is a Day of terrible wrath to the tranſgreſſing Nature, but of peace, love, and tender mercy to the righteous, innocent, ſuffering Seed) If I ſhould tell you that this Day is haſtening upon this Nation, and upon the whole Earth; and if this ſhould affright you, and cauſe you to cry unto the Lord to deliver you from that Nature, and from thoſe ſinful courſes, which make you but as fit fuel for his fire, in the day of its hot burning: I ſay, if by this means ye ſhould be thus prepared for this Day, and yet this Day come not ſo ſuddenly as ye might expect, yet that would be no loſs, or cauſe of grief unto you. But if this Day ſhould ſuddenly come, and find you in your ſins, and ſo the fierce wrath of the Lord break forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and afflict your ſouls, and the day of your Mercy and Redemption be wholly paſſed over by you, This would be matter of unutterable grief and ſorrow to you, and the remembrance of your former eaſe and pleaſures, would but encreaſe the ſenſe and anguiſh of your miſery.</p>
            <p>Certain I am, There is a Day of giving account for ſinning againſt God, and for oppreſſing that in your Conſciences, which diſcovers to you, and checks you for your ſins; and this will as certainly come, as the day of ſinning now is: And then every man muſt receive from God according to his works, and reap the fruit of the deeds done in the body: Then every ſoul muſt inherit according to its Nature, and every Veſſel be filled, with what it is fitted to receive; that which is fitted for mercy, with mercy; that which is fitted for wrath and miſery, with wrath and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: And then the diſtreſſed ſinner will wiſh, <hi>O that I had an hour to eſcape; O that God would once more give me a moment of repentance, and of turning from ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O conſider, Is it a ſlight thing with you, that the infinite God, who is little concern'd in you (being perfectly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and happy for ever without you, but as his love, mercy, and tender nature maketh him concern himſelf about the ſalvation of your ſouls) ſhould give you ſo large a time of Repentance, and ſo many diſcoveries of the evils of your wayes (when at any time ye are retired and ſerious) and ſo many checks and warnings in your hearts, as the vileſt of ſinners, at times, have more or leſs from him? Can ye lengthen out the day of mercy? Can ye limit God how long he ſhould ſtrive with you? O why do ye harden your hearts? why do ye hearken to the luſts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, temptations and counſels of the earthly mind, which in all Ages hath undone all that have liſtened thereunto?</p>
            <p>There is no way of avoyding the eternal, inſupportable wrath of God, but by travelling out of that nature, ſpirit, and courſe, which it is to. Him that ſowed to ſin and corruption under the Law, the Sacrifices would not ſave then; nor him that ſoweth to ſin and corruption under the Goſpel, the Sacrifice of Chriſt will not ſave now: But he that is ſaved by Chriſt, muſt be ſanctified and redeemed from ſin and corruption by him; which, Chriſt worketh by his principle of life ſown in the heart; which principle turneth againſt the contrary principle, diſcovering its nature, and evil dark wayes, and drawing from, and leading out of them. O therefore, Let me in love entreat you, all my dear Country-men (indeed I have no end in it, but your good) to mind that in your hearts, which diſcovers your evils to you, that therein ye may feel the power of life drawing you from them, and helping you againſt them: Greater is the power in this, than the power that is in the contrary principle, as thoſe that hearken to it, and become ſubject, by experience feel. And what if ye loſe a few fond pleaſures for the preſent (which indeed are beneath the true ſtate of a man) ye will loſe a great deal of miſery too, and your gain at laſt will be exceeding great.</p>
            <p>If ye would know, whether I ſpeak truth in theſe things, Come to the true Ballance, and wait on the Lord, till by him ye be made able to weigh. My meaning is, Joyn to the good Spirit of the Lord, when ye ſind it ſtirring in your own hearts: give up unto it, let in its ſtrength upon you; in its warmth and drawing vertue, give up to forſake the evil and purſue the good: Fear not the multitude of evils in the heart, nor the long accuſtomedneſs unto evil, the Lord will help the willing ſoul out of them. And in this obedience to the good Spirit of the Lord, there will be an underſtanding received to know the things of God, and to try words and ſayings, whether they be of him, or of man. And he that tryes in this ballance, cannot be deceived (the meaſure being equal and juſt, and proper to the things which are therewith to be meaſured) whereas the wiſeſt of men, truſting either to their own Underſtandings and Judgments, or to the Judgments and Underſtandings of others, are liable to be deceived: And then ye will acknowledge what love this ſprang from, and what Light and Life it ſprang up in, though through a weak and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Veſſel.</p>

            <head>Concerning PEACE &amp; GOOD-WILL.</head>
            <p>THe true Peace is in the new Nature, which puts an end to the warring and fighting ſpirit inwardly, and turns the whole ſtrength of the Battel againſt the enemies of the ſoul. In the old Nature there are luſts after Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and after Liberty to the fleſh, and fulfilling the ſelf-will of the earthly mind: But theſe are all brought down in the renewed Spirit, by the power, love, and ſweetneſs of the Goſpel of Peace. Here is indeed uprightneſs of heart to the Lord, quietneſs of ſpirit under whatever the Lord ſuffers to be, and good-will towards all men, waiting on the Lord for his ſeaſons of tender Bowels, with ſtrong cries and tears, even for thoſe, who, to the eye of man, may ſeem ſo hardened againſt God and his Truth, as to be out of the reach of mercy.</p>
