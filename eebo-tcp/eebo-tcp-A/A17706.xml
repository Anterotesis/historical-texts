         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vvayes, and that, (if I

of my matter, hath bin the very maintenance and
ſafetie of my right, vvhich elſe had bin troden vnder foote
by the ouer mightineſſe of mine aduerſaries. And heere it
behoueth mee alſo too acknovvledge, the vpright admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracion
of Iuſtice extended vvith fauour in that ſo intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
cace, both by the Iudges and Chauncelour, and by all

after many heerings of the matter vvith great patience and
circumſpection, and vvith ſhevving of ſuche recordes for
both partes, as vvere knovven or thought to make for the
manifeſting of the cace: at length vvhen the matter could
not grovve too ſpeedie end by reaſon of certain difficulties

your honour into the office of high Treaſurer, it vvas by
conſent of the Court put in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>primiſe to ſuch perſones as

I might the better acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh this my deſire tovvardes your
honour, I bethought me of the counſel of the vviſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
<hi>Seneca</hi> in his bookes of Benefiting, the effect vvherof
conſiſteth chiefly in theſe three poynts: namely, that the
thing vvhich is done or beſtovved too vtter thankfulneſſe
vvithall, ought to be very good, very durable, and very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to the partie that is to receiue it. That the tvvo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
poynts are in this vvorke, vvhich I (vpon truſt of your
Lordſhips former goodneſſe and accuſtomed fauour) do
take vpon mee to dedicate to your name, and that the third
poynt alſo ſhall accompanie it: the reaſons that perſvvade
mee are theſe. The things that of their ovvne nature tende
only to the vvelfare and benefite of man, muſt of neceſsitie
be very good: and of the things that are good, thoſe are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaies
<pb facs="tcp:23060:3"/>
beſt, vvhich may redound to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of moſt
perſones, and vvhich being once poſſeſſed, cannot be taken
avvay againſt the vvill of the poſſeſſer: Seing then that the
foundation of this vvorke is a parcell of holy ſcripture, and
that (as ſayeth S. Paule) all Scripture giuen by inſpiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
God is profitable to teach,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> to reproue, to amend, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
men vvith rightuouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. b.</note> that they may be perfect
and forevvard to al good vvorkes: in ſomuch that it is the
povver of God tending to the vvelfare of all that beleeue,
both Ievves and Gentyles: and therevvithall conteyneth
promiſes not only of this preſent life, but alſo of the life too
come: it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but be of the ſelf ſame nature, propertie and
operation that the reſt of the ſcriptures are, bicauſe (as ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
S. Peter) the ſcripture came not by the vvill of man,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. d.</note> but
holy men of God ſpake as they vvere moued by the holie
Ghoſt. And herevpon ſpringeth another co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendacion to
the proofe of the goodneſſe of this vvorke, that the Author
therof is God the ſouerain goodneſſe it ſelfe, and not man.
To be ſhort, the ſame reaſons may ſerue alſo to proue the
durableneſſe thereof.<note place="margin">Eſa. 40. b.</note> For beſides that God him ſelfe prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
that his vvord ſhall indure for euer,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. d.</note> and that the very
heauens ſhal periſh before any one iote of his ſayings take
not effect: in aſmuch as this booke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyneth not vvorldly
vncertaine and periſhing, but heauenly, aſſured and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
benefites: nor things auaylable to fevve, but profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to all vnleſſe they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues be to blame: and moreouer
that God is the Author thereof: it muſt by all likelyhood
needes continue vvith other of the ſame ſort, at leaſtvviſe
among the godly, not for a day or tvvo, but ſo long as men
ſhall haue neede to be edified and ſtrengthened in Chriſt.
VVhich thing vvill appeere yet more plainly, if beſides
theſe generalities vvhich it hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vvith all the reſidue
of holy ſcripture, vve conſider the vvorke more peculiarly
<pb facs="tcp:23060:4"/>
and neerly in it ſelf, vvhich conſiſteth of tvvoo partes, too
vvit, of Text, and of expoſition of the Text. The ſubſtance
of the text of this vvhole Epiſtle to the Galathians, is this:
that vvhen God hath once voutchſafed to inlighten men
vvith the true knovvledge of his goſpell, it behoueth them
to ſtand ſtedfaſt in the truth vvhich they haue imbraced, &amp;
to ſhevv by their godly conuerſation that they be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of light, ſo as they nother turne backe againe as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negates
or as ſvvine to the myre, nor be caried too and fro
vvith euery blaſt of doctrine like vvauering reedes, or like
little children that are ſoone vveerie of the things that they
haue, and fond of euery nevv thing that they ſee. Hereout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſpring other more particular poynts, concerning free
iuſtification by fayth, concerning Chriſten libertie, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the aboliſhing of Ceremonies, concerning the force
and effect of the lavv, and concerning the pure conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of chriſtian lyfe. For the order vvhich the vvriters of holy
Scripture obſerue vvell neere in all their Preachings and
exhortations, is firſt to lay the foundacion of faith in our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and aftervvard to build vp the vvorkes
of charitie and true holineſſe of life, vvithout the vvhich,
faith is not onely naked, but alſo dead. Thus much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Texte and the contents of the ſame. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
vvhereof being vttered in Sermons by that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and godly miniſter of Chriſt Maiſter Caluin (vvhoſe
ovvne doings tending alvvaies too the benefite of Gods
Churche, may yeelde him farre more credite than any
commendacion of mine can doo) containeth not any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
or contrarie matter, but the ſame things layde forth
in more ample and plaine maner, applied to common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie,
euen of ſuche as are of meaneſt vnderſtanding:
by meanes vvhereof a greater number may reape profite
and commoditie by them. In reſpect vvhereof they bee
<pb facs="tcp:23060:4"/>
right neceſſarie too bee ſet before our eyes, and to be beaten
intoo our mindes at all times, and chiefly in theſe dayes,
vvherein it is to be ſeene that many, yea, and vvhich is the
more pitie, too manie, being after a ſort ouerglutted vvith
the long continuaunce of the heauenly Manna, begin too
loth the ſvveete foode of their ſoules, and to long againe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fleſh pottes and garlike of Egipt. In ſomuch that
ſome thinking it ynough to be bare heerers or idle profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
and diſputers of the Goſpell, vvithout yeelding any
frute beſeeming their profeſsion, verifie the ſaying of the
Prophet Eſay in honoring God vvith their lippes, vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
their hart is farre of from him, and ſhevve themſelues
to bee but ſovvers vnto corruption, as ſayeth S. Paule in
this preſent Epiſtle. Some not profeſsing onely, but alſo
glorying in Papiſtrie, the ſinke of all ſinne and vvicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
thinke themſelues vvell apayd that they may bee
enemies in hart and religion, too God and all godlineſſe
and godly men: And otherſome being as it vvere of no
religion, and therefore imagining all things too bee lavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vvhich they like of, are caried headlong intoo all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of looceneſſe by their blinde and vnbridled affections,
and like brute beaſtes coulde finde in their heartes that
all cleanneſſe of minde and bodie (vvithout vvhiche, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſhall euer ſee God) vvere ſo vtterly aboliſhed, as the
verie name of it might neuer bee herd of: vvhereas in the
meane vvhile thoſe fevve vvhom the feare of God and the
deſire of heauenly immortalitie dravveth too a more
heedefull vvareneſſe of efchevving the things that may
impeache Gods glorie and the free proceeding of his
Goſpell, or hinder and offende their neighbour, are in the
eies of ſome perſones not onely deſpized but alſo blamed:
verily as vvho ſhoulde ſay it vvere a faulte too inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
too bee faultleſſe. For aſmuche therefore as this
<pb facs="tcp:23060:5"/>
vvorke (like as all other of the ſame authors) tendeth to the
benefite of the Chriſten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vveale, by putting vs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of our duetie both to God and man, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
minding and practizing vvherof is the ground of all
good order, and the very path vvay too perfect felicitie: I
doubted not but it ſhould be the better accepted of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

            <head>The Argument of Saint Paules
Epiſtle to the Galathians:</head>
            <p>IT is wel inough knowne in what part of the leſſer Aſia the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
dwelt, and how farre their Countrey reached, but as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their originall, and the place from whence they came first, the
auncient Authors are not all of one mind. They all agree that they
were Galles, yea and thereof they bare their name: for they were
called Galgreekes, of a word compounded of Gal and Greeke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the
thing that hangeth in doubt, is out of which quarter of Galland they
came. The Geographer Strabo thinketh that thoſe Galles whiche
were called Tectoſages, came out of the Countrey of Prouince, and
otherſome ſay they came out of Gall Celtike, which is the commoner
opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Howbeeit for as much as Plinie maketh the people of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
to be next neighbours to the Tectoſages: and all Authors wel-neare
agreee that the Toliſtobogians were their companions which
dwelled about the Rhyne: I take it to be most likely that they were
of Gall Belgike which is the loweſt Countrey vpon the riuer of Rhyne
towards the English Sea. For the Toliſtobogians hilde the Countrey
that is nowe called Cleuelande and Brabant. The common errrour
(in mine opinion) grew vpon this, that a companie of the Tectoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
being caſt vpon the Countrey of Prouince, tooke poſſeſsion of it,
and reteyning ſtill their olde name, conueyed ouer the ſame to the
Countrey which they had conquered. And that is the thing which
Auſonius the Poet of Burdeaux meeneth when he ſayeth, vntoo the
Tectoſages, which were first named Belgians. For hee called them
Belgians, and dooth vs to vnderſtande that they were earſt named
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>toſages in ſted of Tectoſages. VVheras Caeſar placeth them in the
black Foreſt, which in thoſe dayes was called Hercinia, or Hertſwald:
I beleeue it happened by ſhifting of places, bycauſe they were retired
thither out of their owne Countrey: which thing may be gathered by
Caeſars owne ſaying, where he maketh mention of them. But we haue
ſpoken ynough of their originall for this time. Plinie reporteth of the
Galathians which dwelt in that part of Aſia, which was called after
their name, that lyke as they were deuided into three principall peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:6"/>
that is too witte, the Tectoſages, Toliſtobogians, and Tro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannes:
ſo alſo they had three head Cities. Now for as much as they
were there among neighbours of ſmall proweſſe, and nothing well
trayned too the warres: they ſpedde their buſineſſe ſo well in times
past, that the greater part of the leſſer Aſia became tributarie too
them. But in the ende they grewe out of kinde, and by little and
little lost their courage, giuing themſelues ouer to pleaſures and
wantonneſſe. By meanes whereof <hi>Cneus Manlius</hi> the Romane
Conſull vanquiſhed them in battell without any great adoo, and
ſubdued them too the Empyre, vnder the whiche they were in the
time of Saint Paule. Nowe although he had taught them the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
faithfully: yet crept there in falſe Apostles in his abſence, which
corrupted his good ſeede by their falſe and wicked doctrine: for they
taught that the keeping of Ceremonies was ſtill neceſſarie. It might
haue ſeemed at the first bluſhe too haue beene a matter of no greate
importance: but Saint Paule debateth of it heere as of the cheefe
article of the Christen fayth. And good reaſon, for it is no ſmall
miſcheefe, when the light of the Goſpell is quenched, when mennes
conſciences are clogged, and when all difference is taken away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the olde and newe Testament. Furthermore, he ſawe there
was a wicked and miſcheeuous opinion interlaced with thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
whiche was, that menne maye deſerue or earne rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
and that is the cauſe why hee contendeth with ſo great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
and force. VVherefore ſeeing wee bee warned what will
followe vppon the matter that is treated of heere: let vs reade it with
diligence. If a man ſhoulde iudge the cace by the Commentaries of
Saint Ierome and Origen: hee woulde maruell why Saint Paule was
ſo whote for any outwarde Ceremonies. But if a man looke too the
welſpring, hee ſhall finde that the things were well worthie too bee
handled ſo ſharpely. And for as much as the Galathians ſuffered
themſelues too bee turned out of the right way through ouergreat
ſimplicitie or light beleefe, or rather through inconſtancie and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
therefore dooth hee rebuke them the more ſharpely. For
I am not of their minde which thinke that Saint Paules rough hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of them, was bicauſe they were naturally dull witted, and hard
<pb facs="tcp:23060:6"/>
of vnderstanding. The Epheſians and Colloſsians had beene temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as well as they. Now if they had lightly giuen place too the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie
of the falſe Teachers, as the Galathians did, thinke wee that
Sainct Paule woulde haue ſpared them? Then was it not the peoples
nature that made him ſo bolde as too be in thatchafe with them, but
rather the vnwoothineſſe of the matter compelled hym too doo ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Nowe that wee vnderstande the cauſe why thys Epistle was written,
let vs come too the order and maner of proceeding whiche hee kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
in it.</p>
            <p>In the two firſt Chapters, hee indeuereth to mainteyne the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of his Apostleſhippe, ſauing that towardes the ende of the
ſeconde Chapter, hee entereth by occaſion intoo the cheefe poynt,
that is too witte intoo the question of Iustification, howbeeit that
the peculiar place where hee handeleth that matter of ſette pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
too the full, is the thirde Chapter. And although that in
thoſe twoo Chapters, hee ſeeme too treate of many things, yet
his drift is but too proue himſelfe equall with the greatest Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and that there is not any default in his owne perſone why hee
ſhoulde not bee taken for an Apostle, and bee as highly eſteemed
as the rest. Neuertheleſſe it is good too vnderstande too what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
hee laboureth ſo muche too mainteyne his owne reputation.
For what matter makes it whither hee bee greater or leſſer than
Peter, or whither there bee no oddes at all betwixte them: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
that Ieſus Christ reigne, and that his doctrine abide pure
and vncorrupted? Seeing that all other must bee diminiſhed too
the ende that onely Ieſus Christ may growe: it is in vaine to ſtriue
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the prerogatiues of men. Furthermore it may alſo be demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
why hee compareth himſelfe with the rest of the Apostles?
For what oddes was there betwixte Petr, Iames, and Iohn?
VVhat needed it then to ſet one agaynst another after that maner,
where ther was ſo good vnitie and agreement? I anſwer, that the falſe
Apoſtles which had abuſed the Galathians, had ſhrowded themſelues
vnder the names of the Apostles, as though they had bin of their
ſending, to the intent to be the better welcom, and to worke their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the eaſlyer. It was a trim way too winde themſelues in, and too
<pb facs="tcp:23060:7"/>
purchace authoritie, to make them beleeue that they repreſented
the Apostles, and that the Apostles ſpake as you woulde ſay, by
their mouth. And in ſo doing they defaced the name, power and
authoritie of the Apostle Saint Paule. For they alledged that hee
had not bin choſen by our Lorde for one of the twelue, nor bin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
for ſuch a one by the rest of the Apostles, and that hee
had not receyued his doctrine, not onely not of Ieſus Christ himſelfe,
but alſo not of any of his Apostles. By this meanes not onely Sainct
Paules authoritie was diminiſhed, but alſo he himſelf eſteemed much
inferiour to them, as one that was no better than one of the common
ſort. If the matter had touched no more but their perſones: it had
bin al one with Saint Paule to haue bin counted among the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
But ſeeing that the doctrine was by that meanes diſcredited:
he ought not to hold his peace, but rather to crie out agaynſt it. L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
what the wilineſſe of Satan is: when he dares not aſſayle the doctrine
openly, hee laboureth too deface the Maieſtie of it by ouerthwart
wayes. Therefore let vs remember that the truth of the Goſpell
was aſſayled in Sainct Paules perſone. For if hee had ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to haue bin bereft of the honour of Apostleship, it had follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
that he had thitherto taken more vpon him than became him:
and ſo, that falſe bragging of his ſhoulde alſo haue made him to bee
ſuſpected in all other things. Againe, vppon that verie poynt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
the authoritie of his doctrine, for ſo much as it had not bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued
as a thing proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an Apoſtle of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
but as from ſome common diſciple. On the otherſide it had bin darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and defaced by the brightneſſe of the names of great perſones.
For the falſe Apostles glorying of the tytles of Peter, Iames, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>utly:
it had bin a yeelding vnto vntruth, and a ſuffering of Gods truth
to bee oppreſſed in his perſone. Therefore hee ſtryueth in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
to ſhewe both the one and the other: that is too witte, that the
Lorde had ordeyned him to be an Apostle, and alſo that he was not
inferior to any of the others, but had the like dignitie and authoritie
that the reſt had, according to the name which he bare as well as they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:7"/>
He might well haue denied that thoſe Gallants were ſent of Peter and
his fellowes, or that they had any charge or commiſsion from them.
But this defence is of farre greater weight, when he ſayeth that he him
ſelfe is of as greate authoritie as the verie Apoſtles. For if he had
ſpoken any lowlier, it would haue ſeemed that he had not bin well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
of his cace. Ieruſalem was at that time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the moother of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
bicauſe the Goſpell flowed from thence intoo all the world, and it
was as the chiefe ſeate of Chriſtes kingdome. All they that came from
thence too other Churches, were honorably receiued, and good reaſon.
Howbeeit there were a number which were puffed vp with pride bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they had beene familiar with the Apostles, or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
had beene trayned vp in their ſchoole: and therefore they
could away with nothing which they had not ſeene at Ieruſalem. All
other maner of dealings which had not bin vſed there, they not onely
reiected, but alſo boldly condemned. Such waywardneſſe and pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is a daungerous plague, when wee will needes haue the cuſtome of
any one Churche too bee receiued for an vniuerſall Lawe. And that
proceedeth of an vnaduiſed zele, when wee bee ſo affectioned to ſome
maiſter or place, that without any iudgement we will bind all men to
that one mannes minde, or all places too the ordinances of that onely
on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>place, as to a common rule. Soothly there is alwaies ambition min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with that maner of dealing, or to ſpeake more rightly, ſuche ouer
great waywardneſſe is alwaies full of vainglorie. But too returne too
theſe falſe Apoſtles, if their fooliſh fondneſſe had led them no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than onely to aſſay too bring in the vſe of the Ceremonies euery
where, which they had ſeene kept at Ieruſalem: they had done ill i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
already: For there was no reaſon why they ſhould of a cuſtome
make by and by a common rule. But there was yet a further miſchief:
namely their wicked and harmefull doctrine, whereby they ment too
bind mennes conſciences, and to ground rightuouſneſſe in the keeping
of Ceremonies. Nowe wee vnderſtand why S. Paule ſpeaketh ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
in defence of his Apoſtleſhip, and wherefore he ſetteth himſelf
againſt the other Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>He purſueth that matter till towardes the latter end of the ſecond
chapter, where he openeth a gap to treate of his peculiar matter: that
<pb facs="tcp:23060:8"/>
is to wit, that wee be iuſtified freely before God, and not by the workes
of the Lawe. For the reaſon wherevpon he groundeth himſelf, is this:
If the Ceremonies bee not able too iustifie a man, then is not the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of them neceſſarie. Howbeeit, he treateth not only of Ceremonies,
but of workes in generall: for otherwiſe it were but a very colde diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.
If any man thinke that this is a drawing aloofe from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Let him conſider twoo things. Firſt that the queſtion coulde not
otherwiſe bee reſolued than by taking that generall principle, that we
be iuſtified freely by the only grace of God: which principle excludeth
not onely Ceremonies, but alſo all other woorkes. And ſecondly that
S. Paule ſtoode not ſo much vpon the Ceremonies themſelues, as vpon
the wicked opinion that folowed them: that is too wit, of purchacing
ſaluation by woorkes. Therefore let vs marke that the holy Apostle
dealeth not impertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, in beginning his matter ſo farre off, but that
it ſtoode him on hand too touche the welſpring of the whole matter, to
the end that the readers might vnderſtand, that the thing whiche he
dealeth with heere is no trifle, but of moſt importance aboue all others:
too wit, by what meane wee obteyne ſaluation. They then doo miſtake
their marke, which imagine that the Apoſtle ſtandeth vpon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
point of Ceremonies: for that could not be well delt with alone
by it ſelf. VVee haue a like example in the fifth of the Actes. There
fell a contention and debate about Ceremonies, too wit, whither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they
were needefull to bee kept or no. For the reſoluing of this queſtion, the
Apostles ſet downe the vntolerableneſſe of the yoke of the Lawe, and
the free forgiuing of ſinnes. To what purpoſe doo they that? For it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
too be an impertinent digreſsion, and that they leape out of the
propounded matter without reaſon. But it is not ſo: For the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
errour could not be liuely diſproued, but by taking a generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
As for example: if it behoued mee too reaſon in defence of
the eating of fleſh: I ſhould not onely make mention of meates, but I
ſhould alſo arme my ſelf with the generall doctrine, and ſhew whither
mennes traditions ought to binde mennes conſciences: and by and by I
would take this ground. That there is but one Lawegiuer which hath
power too ſaue and too destroy. To bee ſhort S. Paule conueyeth his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
heere from the generall to the particular negatiuely, which is
<pb facs="tcp:23060:8"/>
a very ordinarie maner of reaſoning, &amp; moſt agreeable to nature that
can bee. Furthermore if we go to the bodie of the Epiſtle, woe ſhall ſee
by what textes and reaſons he proueth this ſentence, that we be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the onely grace of Chriſt. This matter he handleth too the end
of the third Chapter.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the fourth, he treateth of the right vſe of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
and wherfore they were ordeyned: and there he ſheweth alſo
that they be aboliſhed. For it behoued him too preuent this abſurditie
which would haue run by &amp; by in euery mans head, To what purpoſe
then were the Ceremonies ordeyned? VVere they vtterly needeleſſe?
did the fathers loſe their labour in keeping them? Hee diſpatcheth
both the one and the other in fewe woordes, ſaying that they were not
ſuperfluous in their time, but that they be now aboliſhed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, bicauſe he is the very truth and ende
of them. And therefore he ſheweth that we muſt reſt vpon him. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in that place he ſheweth wherein our ſtate differeth from the ſtate of
the fathers. VVherevpon it followeth that the doctrine of the falſe
Apoſtles is lewde and daungerous, bicauſe it darkeneth the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Goſpell with the old for worne ſhadowes. He intermedleth
certaine exhortations with his doctrine, too moue mennes affections:
and towardes the end of the Chapter he beautifieth his diſcourſe with
a goodly Allegorie.</p>
            <p>In the fifth Chapter he exhorteth them too keepe the freedome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaced
by the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, too the ende they ſhould not yeeld
their conſciences in bondage too mennes traditions: Neuertheleſſe he
therewithall admoniſheth them alſo wherein that freedome conſiſteth,
and which is the true and right vſe of it. And too the ſame ende he
ſheweth whiche bee the true exerciſes of chriſtenfolke, too the intent
they ſhould not loſe their time in muſing vppon Ceremonies, and in
the meane while leaue the chiefe things vndone.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OT WITHOVT cauſe doth S. Peter
ſo earneſtly warne vs to watch againſt our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
who goeth about like a roring Lyon,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5. c. 8.</note> with
his mouth alway open to ſwallow vp the pray
that the fyndeth. For although that on the one
ſyde our Lord Ieſus Chryſt aſſure vs,<note place="margin">Iohn. 17. c. 12.</note> that God
his father hath giuen him the charge of vs, and
that the thyng which he hath in his keeping ſhall neuer periſhe: yet
doth it not follow that we ſhoulde therfore fall aſleepe, and in the
meane whyle haue no care to call vpon God, conſidering the need
that wee haue to do ſo. For fayth doth in ſuche wyſe aſſure vs of
Gods goodneſſe, and that the ſame ſhal neuer fayle vs, that yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
we muſt haue an eye to our owne frayltie, and thereby
bee ſtirred vp too pray God to giue vs inuincible conſtancie.<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 5. a. 4.</note> It is
ſayd, that faith ſhall always get the vpper hand of the whole world:
but yet it foloweth not that we ſhall not haue battayle. Now, on our
owne ſide we haue no ſtrength at all: but we muſt be fayne to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
it elſewhere: and that we may ſo do, it ſtandeth vs in hande
to pray vnto God. For as I haue ſayde alreadie, it lyeth vs vpon to
<pb facs="tcp:23060:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be ſtirred therevnto, by reaſon of the great neede that we haue of
it. And therefore here is a myrrour offered vnto all the faythfull,
whereby wee maye fare much the better, if wee can put it too
our vſe. For Saint Paule had preached through all the countrey of
Galatia, which is a meetly large countrey, and there had reered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Churches. If euer man were filled with all the giftes of Gods
ſpirite too winne men too the Goſpell: wee bee ſure that S. Paule
excelled all others, or at leaſtwiſe all that were of his companie.
And it is certaine that he diſcharged his duetie. Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hee had ſcarcely ſo ſoone turned his backe, but by and by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
gaue a puſh to ouerthrow all, and too make a horrible hauocke
in the whole countrey: and hee wonne ſo great a multitude there,
that the Goſpell was as good as quite aboliſhed, euen among thoſe
that had bin taught ſo faythfully. Sith wee ſee ſuch an example,
ought wee not too caſt downe our eyes, and too conſider that God
warneth vs too flee vntoo him, and to pray him ſo too ſtrengthen
vs, as wee may holde out too the ende? VVhich thing we cannot
doo, except wee bee vphilde by him. Ye ſee then that the faultes
which Saint Paule bewrayeth heere in the people of Galatia, muſt
ſerue for our learning. For it is all one as if God ſhoulde in theyr
perſon ſhewe what our conſtancie woulde bee, if hee gaue vs it
not.</p>
            <p>Although then that wee haue bin faythfully inſtructed in the
Goſpell: yet muſt God bee fayne too woorke from day too day, or
elſe wee ſhall bee ſo fickle minded, that wee ſhall bee caryed away
by and by, and for euerie little occaſion. Furthermore (as I haue
fayde alreadie) Satan is a dreadfull enimie. And therefore it is not
for vs too bee negligent, ſeeing hee lyeth alwayes in wayte for vs,
ſeeking on all ſides to inuade vs, and that if hee ſpie neuer ſo little a
hole, by and by he taketh hys aduauntage too enter: It ſhall not
ſeeme that there is any gappe open for him, and yet wee may bee
taken tardie before wee bee aware. VVherefore let vs marke well
the warning that God giueth vs in this text, and let vs make our
aduauntage of it. And on the other ſide wee ſee howe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
hath at all tymes ſerued his owne turne with the name of
God, and made thereof a falſe cloke too diſguize the truth, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23060:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
too turne it into a lie, or elſe too ſowe ſome diſcorde, that by little
and little the Goſpell might quite fade away. The Apoſtles (as
they that were choſen by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt too beare abrode
his Goſpell, and to preach it through the whole worlde) were well
woorthie too haue bin reuerenced euerie where, and to haue bin of
ſuch renowme and authoritie, as the things that proceeded from
them ſhould haue bin [throughly] receyued. For their calling was
lawfull: it was [well] knowne that they did not thruſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
of their owne heades, but that the ſonne of God had choſen
and appoynted them by his owne mouth, yea and made them as it
were new creatures: being ſillie ſoules and ignorant folke, they
were ſo chaunged, as it appeared well that their doctrine came al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither
of heauenly myracle. For they had not learned ought but
in Gods ſchole: and he had in one inſtant of time ſo indued them
with his grace and power, that they became as inſtruments of the
holy Ghoſt. Yet notwithſtanding, the Diuell miſſed not too abuſe
their name and tytle, too bring ſtore of troubles and ſtumbling
blockes into the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For ſuch as went in their companie, made
their brags when they came in far countrys, that they had bin fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
conuerſant with them: and yet for all that, ſome of them were
ful of vainglorie &amp; pride, &amp; ſought nothing but their own aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Otherſome were ſelfwilled, and could away with nothing
but that which they had ſeene in the Citie of Ieruſalem, and in the
land of Iewrie: and they would haue had the whole world ſubiect to
their Iure, and therwithal would haue turned al things vpſide down
as they ſay. Others were led yet with a more wicked minde, ſo as
they ſought nothing elſe but to ouerthrow all that S. Paul had buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
And all theſe (as I ſayd afore) boaſted that they had not learned
any thing of him, but that they had bin taught their doctrine by
the Apoſtles themſelues. Thus yee ſee howe Sathan hath alwayes
defaced Gods glorie, euen vnder the ſhadow of the gracious giftes
which hee had beſtowed vpon his creatures. And in good ſooth,
we ſee how that vnder the names of the Apoſtles, and of the virgin
Marie, the Idolatrie is the ſame at this day in the Popedom, which it
was among the Painims vnder the names of their falſ gods: for ther
is nothing changed, but only the names of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As for the ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is as filthie and deteſtable in the Popedome, as euer it was among
the Heathen.</p>
            <p>Heere therefore wee bee warned to bee wiſe, to the intent that
if the Diuell abuſe Gods name, wee may bee able to reſiſt him, and
to diſcerne what authoritie men ought to haue, and therewithall not
to be ouerhaſtie of beleefe, nor ouer eaſie to be moued and ſhaken
with euerie winde. For if wee haue not the conſtancie to walke in
the doctrine that hath bin deliuered to vs, when wee bee once fully
reſolued that it is Gods pure truth: it will happen to vs as it did too
the people of Galatia. Yee ſee then that the thing which wee haue
too beare in minde, is in effect, that when God hath giuen vs the
grace too vnderſtande his woorde, wee muſt alwayes go forwarde
in it, and not be ſhaken lyke Reedes, nor caryed too and fro, nor led
vp and downe like little babes: but wee muſt haue the witte and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
to ſticke to the thing which wee knowe too bee offered vs
of God. Marke that for one poynt. But by the way, foraſmuch as
wee cannot haue ſuch power in our ſelues: let vs pray with all low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
and earneſtneſſe vnto God, too reforme vs by his holy ſpirit,
and too giue vs ſuch ſtedfaſtneſſe as wee may neuer ſwarue aſide, and
that when we ſee all things turned vpſide downe in this worlde, yet
notwithſtanding, this foundation may abide ſure, namely that forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as God which cannot lie hath ſpoken to vs, and ſhewed vs his
will: we may ſafely ſtande thervpon without turning any way from
it. Howbeit forſomuch as the Diuell hath many cunning knacks too
thruſt vs out of the way, yea and that (as I haue earſt ſayd) he will not
ſticke to abuſe Gods name to winde himſelfe in, and to get ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
to vs: it behoueth vs to vnderſtand that our reuerencing of men
muſt be in ſuch wiſe, as God may in the mean ſeaſon continue vnim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached,
and that our Lord may haue the whole mayſtrie ouer vs to
himſelfe, as hee that is the teacher of the Church: and that our fayth
depend not, neither vpon mens knowledge, nor vpon any reputation
that we haue of their wiſdome, power, or holineſſe: but that our Lord
Ieſus may alwayes haue the preeminence for vs to reſt and ſettle our
ſelues vpon. For if our fayth be not grounded vpon Gods pure truth,
which is vnvariable: certeinly it will be but a loaſing. This is the thing
that wee haue too gather of the example that is ſette downe heere
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23060:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
concerning the Galathians. But by the way a man might thinke it
ſtraunge, why Sainct Paule ſhoulde deale ſo roughly with them as
wee ſhall ſee hereafter, conſidering that the caſe ſtoode not vppon
the open denying of God and the renouncing of the Goſpell, nor
vpon the blaſpheming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, or the ſetting forth
of any notorious idolatrie: but vpon the ceremonies of the Lawe.
For they againſt whom ſainct Paule ſtriueth in this Epiſtle, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
none other thing, but that the ceremonies of Moyſes lawe
were to be kept, and that men were bounde to them vnder peyne
of deadly ſinne. Now, at the firſt bluſhe it myght be ſayd that their
cace was fauourable in that behalfe. For the cace ſtoode not wyth
them as it doth with the Pope, who during his tyrannie hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
many lawes, and commanded this and that, bringing poore ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
into bondage: but their ſaying was, that inaſmuche as the lawe
was not of men, but of God: therfore it was to bee kept. Heereby
it ſhould ſeeme, that S. Paule had no cauſe to be ſo moued agaynſt
that opinion, although it were not altogether ſound and good. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geyne,
there is yet an other reaſon: namely that wee muſte not
make ſo muche a doe about outward things, as whether one day is
to bee obſerued more than an other, or whether Swines fleſh be not
to be eaten as wel as mutton. For whether a man obſerue any cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
or whether he obſerue none, as for example, If he forbeare
the eating of Swines fleſh, or do any other like thing: is his ſo doing
an vtter forſaking of chriſtianitie? No Yet notwithſtanding, that
is all the quarell that S. Paule hath: yea and thervpon he crieth out,
that the Galathians are backſliders, that they haue forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord
Ieſus Chryſt, and that they are become renegates. Some man wold
ſay, he vſeth ouermuche vehemencie: but herein wee be ſtill war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that the diuell will now and then finde ſmall trifles to draw vs
from the Goſpell ere we be aware, and therfore it behoueth vs to
be ſo muche the better aduiſed: for of our ſelues we ſhal not be ſo,
but muſt in verie deede bee fayne to be gouerned by God.<note place="margin">Eſay. 11. a. 2</note> And not
without cauſe alſo is the ſpirit of wyſedome fathered vpon him, to
the intent wee ſhould ſeeke it in him. Therfore let vs reſort thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
and if any man goe about to bring in a thing that ſeemeth not
to bee of any great importance, let vs bethynke vs what a tayle it
<pb facs="tcp:23060:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
myght drawe after it. And for proofe heereof, when wee be once
turned from the ſimplicitie of the Goſpell, wee ſhall become like
whooremongers: according as wee haue ſeene in the laſt Epiſtle,
howe Saint Paule ſayth expreſſely,<note place="margin">2. Ca. 11. a. 3</note> that the Diuell vſeth Bawdes
trickes and Ruffian trickes, when hee commeth too turne vs from
the doctrine of the Goſpell. Hee will alwayes make ſome goodly
and fayre proteſtation, like as when a Ruffian intendeth to deceiue
a yong wife or a mayde, hee will not vſe any lewde termes or kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie,
for hee knoweth that ſhee woulde abhorre them: but hee
will marke by little and little howe hee may infect hir with hys
deadly poyſon. Euen ſo playeth the Diuell in that behalfe. For if
he ſhould ſhewe his hornes (as they ſay) at the firſt daſh, and ſhewe
himſelfe openly too bee Gods enimie: euerie man woulde ſhunne
him, and we would abhorre him. But hee windeth himſelfe ſlily
in, and creepeth in at ſmall cranies, ſo as wee ſhall woonder that he
coulde preuayle with vs in ſundrie things, and wee ſhall ſtill beare
our ſelues in hande, that wee ceaſſe not to holde with Ieſus Chriſt
and his Church. And yet for all that wee ſhall bee turned away, and
in the ende wee ſhall perceyue our ſelues too bee quite cutte off.
Therefore when we reade this example, that the Diuell had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and corrupted the Churches whereof mention is made heere,
[and that,] vnder the ſhadowe of the Ceremonies of Moyſes lawe:
let vs bethinke our ſelues the better, and ſtande ſtiffely without
turning aſyde by any meanes from the ſimplicitie of the Goſpell.
Furthermore ſeeing hee hath ſtryued and diſputed about the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the lawe: let vs looke well aboute vs too profite our
ſelues by all that is heere conteyned, and let vs ſtande continually
vpon our garde, that wee may finde out the craftes and wyles of
Satan. And whenſoeuer hee ſhall go about too vndermine vs, let
vs looke well too our buſineſſe, and ſtande alwayes too that which
wee haue learned, ſo as we may be out of all doubt, that wee ſhall
not finde any thing in the doctrine of the Goſpell, which is not the
pure woorde of God. For (as I ſayde) that is the thing wherevpon
our fayth muſt bee grounded. And if any man will adde neuer ſo
little too it, let vs not onely ſuſpect it, but alſo abhorre it: for
when there is ſuch a mingle mangle made with Gods pure truth,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23060:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it can be nothing elſe but corruption. Now let vs come to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which Saint Paule keepeth in handling the doctrine which wee
ſhall ſee poynt by poynt. That hee may bee the better heard and
alſo receyued, he confirmeth his owne authoritie, which ſome men
had gone about too impeache. For beholde, the pollicie of thoſe
dogges that incountered agaynſt him, was too alledge that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
taught otherwiſe than hee did. Nowe foraſmuch as Saint
Paule had not bin conuerſant wyth our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt while
hee lyued in this worlde: it was ſuppoſed at the fyrſt, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
were a degree aboue him, and ought to be preferred before
him. And on the other ſyde they inquired who had put him in
that place, as though hee had thruſt himſelfe in, and had done it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of raſhneſſe than otherwiſe. Saint Paule therefore was fayne
too ſet himſelfe agaynſt all this geere, and too ſhewe that hee was
truely ſente of God. Furthermore (as I ſayde earſt) the Diuell
ſtirred vp others, who comming from Ieruſalem, ſayd that that was
the mother Church, and the holineſſe of all Chriſtendome: and
they pretended too bee zeelous ſetters foorth of the pureneſſe of
the Goſpell. By reaſon whereof, it behoued Saint Paule too go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
in ſhewing that hee had not aduaunced himſelfe, nor taken
any thing vpon him of his owne heade, but had obeyed the calling
of God, and of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, who had made him his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.
Yea and hee compareth himſelfe with Iohn and Iames and
Peter,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. d. 9.</note> who were (as men termed them) the pillers of the Church,
and ſo taken to be among all men, ſhewing that hee was no whitte
inferiour to them. And why [doth hee ſo] To the ende his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
might be receyued: for that is the marke that he amed at. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde
when he hath prepared the Galathians too receyue obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently
the warnings that he giueth them: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he debateth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which was at that time in controuerſie, and ſheweth that the
Goſpell is beaten downe, if we haue not the freedom which is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
for vs by the bloud of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: which is, that
the ceremonies of the law ſhould not holde vs any more in ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or awe. For (as we ſhall ſee hereafter) if ſuch ſubiection ſhould
be admitted, all the frute of our redemption and of the ſaluation
which is purchaſed for vs by the ſonne of God, ſhould go to wreck.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But nowe let vs come to the order that S. Paule keepeth for the
mayntenance of his authoritie. He ſayth, <hi>that he is an Apoſtle, not on
mennes behalfe, nor by man, but by Ieſus Chriſte, and by God the father,
which hath rayſed him from the dead.</hi> Fyrſte of all, we haue to marke
here, that Saincte Paule, to the intente too bee receyued, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
himſelfe vppon the ordinaunce and appoyntment of God.
For ſurely no man ought to take vppon hym anye honoure in the
Churche,<note place="margin">Heb. 5. a. 4.</note> ſaue he that is called, as I haue declared alreadie. Beſides
that, our fayth ſhould be verie feeble, if it ſhould bee ſettled vpon
men, howe great excellencie or worthineſſe ſoeuer were in them:
yea thoughe they were perfecter than Angells, yet were that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
our fayth is ſo precious a iewell, as it muſte reſt altoogether
vpon God and his truthe. Seing it is ſo, if a man intend to be heard,
it muſt not be alledged, that he is wittie and skilfull, or that he hath
ſeene and hearde muche, and is a man of great experience: al thoſe
things are but ſmoake, when it commeth too the leadyng of vs
too the kingdome of Heauen. For there the matter ſtandeth not
vpon profounde witte, and high and exquiſite knowledge: all thoſe
things are but the ſleyghts of Satan: Ageyne, wee knowe howe it
is fayde generally of all mannes wyſedome,<note place="margin">1. Co. 1. c. 20</note> that it is but ſtark fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
yea and that God laugheth it to ſcorne, and abhorreth it, bicauſe
it turneth vs away from the obeying of him. Therefore whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
the cace concerneth the teachyng of vs, all thyngs that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
too man, or too anye creature, muſte be layde a water, that
there maye bee a well ordered gouernemente in the Church, and
ſuche a one as God alloweth. For if men aduaunce themſelues
in that cace, God is thereby plucked backe, and in the ende there
wyll bee nothyng but vtter confuſion.</p>
            <p>So muche the more then behooueth it vs too marke well what
S. Paule ſheweth vs heere, in that hee doth not alleadge or bryng
any thyng of his owne for the ſtabliſhyng of his authoritie, but
holdeth hymſelfe wholly too Gods callyng. Marke that for one
poynt. And herewithall wee haue too note, that Sainct Paule boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
not hym ſelfe at all aduentures, as manye harebraynes doo.
For they coulde fynd in theyr hearts to preache with ful mouth,
that God hath ſente them, when as notwithſtandyng they bee but
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23060:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fantaſticall fellowes, and Satans very Champion, ſeruing to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
all. But by the way, S. Paule in proteſting his calling, mente
alſo to ſhewe by whome [he was called,] as wee haue ſeene here
before. And it was ſufficiently knowen, that he had bene conuerted
by miracle to the Goſpel, that he had bin taught vpon the ſuddaine,
that God had by his meanes wrought after a ſtraunge and vnaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not only that it had bin openly reueled vnto two
or three men in the Citie of Antioche that S. Paule was appoynted
too be the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, but alſo that he had good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of it in all places where he came, bycauſe God vttered his
power moſt manifeſtly in him. So then when as S. Paule told them
that he was an Apoſtle, he preſuppoſed that it was already ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
iuſtified, that God was the author of that office of his, and that
the thing which he pretended, was not a falſe ſurmize, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of men, whome we ſee too much ſubiect too vaunting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
Therfore we muſt put a difference betweene S. Paule, and
all ſuch as falſly boaſte and brag themſelues too bee ſent of God, as
the Pope dothe, who too beguile the wretched world, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
himſelfe in his helliſh tyrannie, which he hath vſurped, ſayeth
and ouerſayeth that he is the vicar of Ieſus Chriſte, and the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
of his Apoſtles. And all the cankerwormes of his Clergie who
name themſelues Prelates, togither with all the horned beaſtes
and all the rable of Maskers in the Popedome, will needes chalenge
that honorable title: and (if a man liſt too beleeue them vpon their
ſingle worde) they bee all of them deſcended of the Apoſtles. But
yet for all that, it behoueth vs to conſider what likeneſſe and agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe
they haue too the Apoſtles: and alſo it ſtandeth them on
hand too ſhewe by certaine and infallible record, that their calling
is approued of God. In theſe dayes the Pope and all his, are too ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proued too haue falſified and corrupted the doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
and that the thing which they terme the ſeruis of God, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſtarke abhomination: and moreouer, that there is nothing
among them, but outrageous lies and falſehodes, yea and inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Satan. All this is knowen well inough. But beholde, their
ſhield wherwith they caſt the miſt that couereth al their filthineſſe,
is that there hath bin a continuall ſucceſsion, euer ſince the tyme
<pb facs="tcp:23060:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Apoſtles, and that they repreſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and are the Church, and
therfore that whatſoeuer they put foorth muſt bee taken for good.
VVell, gooto, if they which do nowadayes take that title vpon them
will be herd: they muſt looke whither they haue any reſemblance
of the Apoſtles, and whither they execute the duetie of good and
faithful ſhepeherds. But ſeing they be cleane contrary to the order
which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath ſet in his Church, what ſhall men
ſay to them? Yea (ſay they) but we haue a continuall ſucceſsion from
the Apoſtles. That would be ſhewed firſte of all. They will alledge
ſome recordes, howbeit very triflyng ones. Yet notwithſtanding, it
may be ſayd on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary part, that there were as good ſucceſſors
in the Church of Galatia, as euer there was in Rome: and not only
in ſome one Churche, but in many, as well of Epheſus, of Coloſſus,
and of Philippos, as of other places. And where is all this ſucceſsion
now? If any man thinke himſelf to haue any priuiledge, and name
himſelf S. Paules ſucceſſour: it were meete he ſhould go preach the
Goſpell, and therwithall ſhew good euidence why he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyued.
Therfore let vs marke well at a worde, that when there are
men to preach the Goſpel, and when there are Shepeherds and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeers,
it is not ment that they ſhould diminiſh the authoritie of
God, or preiudice aught that belongeth to him, that is to wit, that he
alonly ſhould not be honored, &amp; that our fayth ſhould not reſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his word: but that by the meanes of men, we ſhould alwayes be hild
vnder his obeyſance. Marke that for a ſpeciall poynt. And aboue all
things our Lord reſerueth that right to himſelfe: namely that men
ſhould not thruſt themſelues in through their own preſumption, but
that they ſhould be raiſed vp &amp; ſent by him. Now therfore (as I haue
erſt ſayd) there ought to be cauſe why, too the end we may diſcerne
and not beleeue at all aduenture, nor at randon. For Satans cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
can boaſt and crake ynough and too much, and ſtand in their
owne conceyt to the vttermoſt, to the intent to wind themſelues in
by their preſumptuouſneſſe. But it behooueth vs to trie what is in
them, that we may be ſure of Gods calling. And how doth S. Paule
ſpeake of it heere? <hi>Not on the behalfe of men</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>nor by men.</hi>
VVhen S. Paule ſayeth that he is an Apoſtle, not on the behalfe of
men: it is a generall poynt which ought too extend to all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23060:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Gods woord, and too all Shepeherds of the Churche. For
(as I haue ſayd heretofore) wheras it pleaſed God that there ſhould
bee Prophetes in old tyme, and that afterward there ſhoulde bee
ſhepeherdes too teach his people: he bereft not himſelf of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraintie:
but rather it was too ſhewe, that men muſt not gouerne
heere after their owne luſt, and in the meane whyle bee but as Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
in Algoriſme themſelues, ſauing onely for maynteyning ſtill
the title, but that vvee ſhould all of vs giue eare vnto him, ſo as the
men whom he ſetteth in office, ſhould bee as inſtrumentes or veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of his holy ſpirite. Now then wee ſee whereat S. Paule amed,
when he ſayd that he was not ſent on the behalfe of men: for ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he ſheweth that he was authorized of God, and that he was his
ſeruant. The ſecond poynt where he ſayeth that he was not ſent
by men, belongeth peculiarly too the Apoſtles. For although that
wee bee called of God, and that he allow of vs: yet are wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
called of men: and if that maner of calling were not
agreeable too Gods will, S. Paule would not haue vſed it. Wee
knowe how Sainct Paule proceeded in that cace, namely how that
in euery place where he came, he ordeyned Miniſters and Shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdes
by election: and no doubte but that doyng of his was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Then let vs marke well, that Sainct Paule dothe not vndiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretely
heere condemne ſuch as were called by mens meanes: but
onely treateth of the thing that was peculiar too the charge of
an Apoſtle. For that was the difference betweene the Apoſtles,
and ſuch as had charge of particular Churches: according whervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſame ſtate remayneth at this day, and ſhall remayne to the
worldes end. For the Apoſtles were not chozen by election of men,
nor by the common policie of the Church: but by the very mouth
of the Sonne of God.<note place="margin">Act. 1. d. 24</note> In ſomuch that when it behoued the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
too put another ſucceſſor in the roome of Iudas, too make vp
the full number of twelue againe: although they themſelues were
there preſent, and a greate multitude of Diſciples with them: yet
durſt they not make any election. VVhen there was any choozing
of a Shepeherde for the Churche of Ieruſalem, or of Antioche, or
of any other people, this faſhyon was vſed: that is too ſay,
firſte they prayed snto God, and therevppon choze ſuche a man
<pb facs="tcp:23060:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as was found meete and conuenient for that office. But as for the
other, they referred it wholly too the will of God, and caſte lottes
for it, as for a thing that paſſed their witte. The cauſe (as I ſayd) was,
for that it behoued the Apoſtles too bee chozen by ſpeciall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
from aboue, bycauſe they were the perſones by whome the
Goſpell was too bee publiſhed ouer the whole world. Nowe as for
S. Paule, he was chozen afterwarde. But howſoeuer it was, he had
equall priuiledge with the reſidue, bycauſe there came a reuelation
from heauen, too ſhewe that he was admitted too the executing of
that office:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. a. 2.</note> he was rapted vp intoo the third heauen, and wee haue
ſeene that he was well lyked of in all things. Finally, that it might
appeare too bee Gods will too giue him a larger commiſsion, and
too haue marked him out for the Apoſtle of the Gentyles: he had
the holy Ghoſte immediatly, whiche ſpake and vttered the woorde
from aboue. Yee ſee then that S. Paule was not chozen by meanes
of men. And yet notwithſtanding, this maner of choozing (as I ſayd
afore) is no faulte in thoſe that are Shepeherdes and Miniſters of
the Churche. But it was requiſite that S. Paule ſhould bee priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
too the intent he might bee comparable with Peter and Iohn,
and with all thoſe that had bin conuerſant and kept companie with
the ſonne of God, while he dwelled in this worlde, and was in this
mortall lyfe. Now wee ſee in effect whereat S. Paule amed. And
hereby wee bee taught, that the reuerence whiche wee owe too
ſuch as carie abrode Gods woorde and beare the name of Shepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdes,
ſerueth not too barre God from beyng herd continually,
nor to barre our Lord Ieſus Chriſte from being the onely Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayſter
of the Churche. It behoueth vs too beare this ſchoole point
well in minde, or elſe our fayth will alwayes bee ſubiect too many
varieties, and he that is cunningeſt among men, ſhall euer go away
with the gole: and ſo ſhall wee haue nothing certaine, but we ſhall
be ſtill chaungyng from day too day, yea euen euery minute of an
howre. VVherfore let vs marke well, that if men alledge the names
of the Churche, of Prelates, or of Biſhoppes: wee muſte alwayes
come backe too this poynt, that they cannot climbe any higher than
too be the ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſte, and to bee allowed of him. And
how ſhall we know that they be allowed of him? Firſt if they haue
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23060:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bin chozen by lawfull order, with calling vppon the name of God.
And ſecondly if ſuche be chozen as are meete, that haue in them
wherewith to execute their office. Lo heere the markes whereby
we may know and be well aſſured, that they be ſuche Shepeherdes
as God alloweth and accepteth. And herewithall it is not ynough
for a man too be called too that vocation: but he muſt alſo execute
the charge that is committed too him, according as S. Paule ſayeth
not ſingly that he was ordeyned an Apoſtle: but in taking that
name too him, he ſheweth that he is ſent to beare abroade the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of ſaluation, and too preache the Goſpell too the world. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they that wilbe taken for Biſhops and Prelates, muſt teach: and
if they be Idolles and dumbe dogges, it is certaine that as they doo
ſhamefully mocke Gods name and abuſe his maieſtie, ſo alſo men
may reiect them and deſpize them, yea and that they ought too be
hild as accurſed, bicauſe they pretend Gods name falſly. Thus yee
ſee what we haue to marke vpon this ſtreyne. Now S. Paule ſayeth
purpoſely, <hi>that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e was ſent of Ieſus Christe, and of God his father who
rayzed him from the dead.</hi> VVhereas he ſayeth that he was ſente of
Ieſus Chriſte, it is too bring vs backe too the thing whiche I haue
touched already: that is to wit, that if we couet too obey God and
to be ſubiect to him, wee muſte imbrace our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and
giue eare vnto him as too the only ſchoolemayſter: and both great
and ſmall muſt ſubmit themſelues to him and too his doctrine: for
he that honoreth not the Sonne, honoreth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the father, as it is
ſayd in the fifth of Iohn.<note place="margin">Iohn. 5. d. 23.</note> And this is well woorthie too be marked:
for euery man will needes be thought to honour God, and to deſire
nothing ſo muche as too hold himſelfe vnder his yoke. But in the
meanewhyle, we ſee that the worlde fighteth againſt the Goſpell,
and noman can willingly finde in his hart to yeeld too it. VVhen it
commeth to the poynt that Ieſus Chriſt calleth vs to him, euery of
vs playes the rebell: we be ſo wilde that he cannot tame vs: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
our faythleſneſſe is to playnly proued, and we ſhewe ourſelues
to deſpize God, how goodly proteſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſoeuer we haue made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
For he ſendeth vs back to his Sonne,<note place="margin">Pſal. 2. b. 12.</note> &amp; willeth vs to ſtoupe to
him to doo him homage. Yet notwithſtanding, as wee ſee and as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
ſheweth too much, euery man would ſhrinke away from
<pb facs="tcp:23060:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſubiection too our Lord Ieſus Chriſte. S. Paule therefore ſheweth
what a maieſtie there is in Ieſus Chriſte: that is too wit, that wee
ought too tremble at his woorde, and to hold our peace when ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he ſpeaketh, and too receyue without any gainſaying, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
he teacheth, or procedeth from him. And without that, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that God reiecteth all the proteſtations that wee can make of
our deſirouſneſſe too ſerue and honour him. Thus are wee exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this ſtreyne, to giue our ſelues wholly ouer vnto our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt, ſeyng he is our [only] Shepeherd, thereby to ſhew that
wee be his true ſheepe, and that wee herken too his voyce, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
it from the voyce of ſtraungers. Now ſeyng that God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himſelf in ſuche wiſe vnto vs, as wee know that our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt calleth vs too him: let euery of vs follow him, and ſhew
that wee be of his flocke in deede. Thus yee ſee what we haue too
beare in minde. Howbeit for aſmuch as there is ſuch vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in a great number, that they cannot finde in their hartes too
ſubmit themſelues euen too the Sonne of God: Sainct Paule doth
heere ſet downe the name of God the father as an Ouerplus. True
it is that the whole fulneſſe of the Godhead dwelleth in Ieſus
Chriſte,<note place="margin">Coloſs. 1. c. 29. &amp; 2. b. 9.</note> and curſed bee he that ſeeketh any other God. But yet
for all that, for aſmuch as our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte appeared vntoo
vs in the ſhape of man, and was conuerſant in this world, and there
deſpized yea and abaced euen too a moſt ſhamefull death, wherein
he receyued all the curſes that were due vnto vs: therefore it is
ſayd that if wee giue not eare too the Sonne of God, the father is
preiudiced therby, accordyng alſo as our Lord Ieſus himſelf decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in that he ſayeth,<note place="margin">Luke. 10. c. 16.</note> He that deſpizeth you deſpizeth mee, and he
that reiecteth mee reiecteth the liuing God that ſent mee. Marke
then whervnto the order tendeth which S. Paule keepeth: namely
that if we do not willingly honour our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his doctrine for certain and infallible: God is ſet at naught,
and we cannot ſay that our intent is too woorſhip him, for he will
reiect all our doyngs. And why? For (as I ſayd afore) it is ynough
too proue vs rebelles, if wee ſeparate the Sonne from his Father.
And S. Paule addeth expreſly, <hi>that Ieſus Christe was rayzed from the
dead,</hi> too the end that his Apoſtleſhip ſhould not be the leſſe eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23060:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and alſo that men ſhould match him with the number &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
of the other Apoſtles, according alſo as he was added too
them after that Ieſus Chriſte ceaſſed too bee any more vpon earth.
For (as I haue touched already) the thing wherwith the falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
which came too ouerthrowe all vpbrayded him, was this: How
now [ſayd they]? He hath not bin the Diſciple of the Sonne of
God as Peter and Iohn were: he is a thing borne out of ſeazon. And
how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhew that he hath receyued his doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt?
S. Paule declareth that if they will needes inquyre of the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, his ryzing againe ought not too haue
diminiſhed it. Surely though our Lord Ieſus Chriſt were brought
lowe whyle he had the veyle of mans nature vppon him, whereby
his glory was after a ſorte hidden: yet was he not abaced in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.<note place="margin">Luk. 2. b. 13.</note>
For wee knowe that the Angelles acknowledged him for
their ſouerayne king, and although he were [borne] in a ſtable and
layd vpon the ground as a creature deſtitute of all help: yet we ſee
that the Starres of the skie bare record of him.<note place="margin">Mat. 2. b. 2.</note> To bee ſhort, the
maieſtie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte was alwayes ſufficiently auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
as long as he was in this world. But yet for all that, there was
a muche excellenter glory in his reſurrection, accordyng as it is
ſayd in the firſt too the Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. a. 4</note> that then he was ſhewed too bee
the Sonne of God. And wee alſo haue ſeene in the ſecond Epiſtle
to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. d. 14.</note> that as he ſuffered vnder weakeneſſe of the
fleſhe, ſo he was rayzed againe through the wonderfull power of
Gods ſpirite. So then, S. Paule ſheweth, that although our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt bee not conuerſant with vs nowadayes, yet muſte not
his Maieſtie therefore bee diminiſhed nor defaced, that we ſhould
not yeelde him his due and deſerued obedience, and receyue his
woorde reuerently without all gayneſaying. This warning is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
behooffull for vs. For what a number of lightheaded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones
doo wee ſee, which woulde haue Ieſus Chriſte too be heere
in viſible ſhape? Their ſaying is, that they would fayne ſee Ieſus
Chriſt conuerſant heere beneathe, and that [then] they would at
the firſt puſh accept what ſoeuer he ſpake to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo as there ſhould
neede but one woord of his mouth to rauiſh them, and there ſhould
neede none other teaching, nor any other man to be much with vs.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:29"/>
Yea, but the Sonne of God which came downe, hath performed his
charge whiche was committed to him of God his father: that is to
ſay, he hath preached the Goſpell, and ſufficiently confirmed it by
his death and paſsion. Afterward beyng rizen againe, he ſent foorth
his Apoſtles. And nowe that he hath all ſoueraine dominion, ſo as
the Angelles bow their knees before him, and that he hath ſuche a
maieſtie as ſurmounteth all glory both in heauen and earth: ought
not all that which he hath done, to ſuffize vs throughly? VVhen it
pleaſeth him too ſend vs mortall men, and too ſend forth the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
and ineſtimable treaſure of his Goſpell in brittle veſſelles, and
yet notwithſtanding will haue vs to receyue them: is it not a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie
to ſay, that if Ieſus Chriſt were with vs and in our companie,
we would obey him? For if heauen and earth muſte bee fayne too
quake vnder him, and his Maieſtie bee knowen euen to the Diuels
of hell: and yet for all that, wee continue blockiſh, and pretend that
he is to farre of from vs: yet notwithſtanding our Lord Ieſus ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſufficiently that he hath not forſaken vs, ſeing we haue the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
preached vnto vs: And that although he dwell not with vs
here by lowe in viſible ſhape, yet notwithſtanding we ſhalbee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
ioyned with him, and that foraſmuche as he is our head, hee
will gouerne his bodie, and there ſhalbe one vnſeparable bond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and vs. Now ſeing it is ſo, we ought of right to yeeld him
obedience, and his reſurrection ought to touch vs to the quicke, &amp;
to worke ſuche a reuerent awefulneſſe in vs, that whenſoeuer the
name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte is ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Eſa. 65. c. 16</note> we may be ſure that it
is the name whereof the Prophet ſpeaketh, wherby all men ought
to ſweare, and whereat they ought to bow their knees. Thus ye ſee
in effect that the thing which we haue to beare in minde, is, that we
ſhould not meaſure the Goſpell after the reſpect and reputation of
thoſe that ſpeake vnto vs, for why, they be frayle men. Nother is
that the thing whereon we ought to ſtay: for that were as muche
too ſay, as we ſhould ſettle our ſaluation vpon the credite of men,
which might cauſe vs too reſt vppon the world: but wee muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that it is Ieſus Chriſt which ſpeaketh. And howe? In the
Maieſtie that is giuen him by God his father: for the power of the
holy Ghoſt was then ſhewed too the full, when he was rayſed from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23060:29"/>
the dead. Then ſeyng our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath obteyned ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
when he was lifted vp into heauen, as too haue ſuperioritie
ouer all creatures: let vs learne too ſubmit our ſelues too him, and
let the ſame ſerue to hold vs in awe, that his woord may be recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of vs, and we aſſure ourſelues that he gouerneth vs, and that it
becommeth vs too ſuffer our ſelues too be taught in his name, and
[too vnderſtand] that although the woorde which is preached vnto
vs proceede out of the mouth of men, yet notwithſtanding it is by
the authoritie of God, &amp; our ſaluation muſt be grounded thervpon,
as well as though heauen opened an hundred thouſand tymes too
ſhew vs the glory of God. Lo (ſay I) how it behoueth vs to be taught
in this world, vntill God haue gathered vs into his euerlaſting heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
And that is the thing which we haue to beare in minde, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng
that the glorie of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte is expreſly ſet
downe in this place.</p>
            <p>Now let vs fal downe before the Maieſtie of our good God with
acknowledgment of our faultes, praying him to voutchſafe to make
vs too feele them, that he may draw vs too repentance the better,
and that we may alwayes hope that if we be once renewed by him,
we ſhall throughly perceyue that it is he which ruleth vs by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpirit, ſo as hauing that record imprinted in our hartes, wee may
boaſt without hipocriſie that we be not tied to this world although
we bee in it, and that wee dwell in it but as pilgrims and ſtraungers,
bycauſe we haue a better dwelling place in heauen, where our heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
is throughly aſſured vnto vs by fayth, although wee poſſeſſe it
not preſently. That it may pleaſe him to graunt this grace, not only

from whence all welfare ſpringeth, and muche

namely that God loueth vs, &amp; that we be ſure

as I tolde you afore. And that alſo is the cauſe, why in the

that God ſhould bee mindefull of him with the fauour that he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

caried and haled him the other way, namely [too deſire] too bee
comprehended in the number of Gods chozen, and therefore hee
ſayeth purpoſely <hi>according to the Loue whiche thou bearest towards thy

loue too all men in generall: but yet is all Adams ofspring cutte
off from him, till wee bee greffed in agayne by Ieſus Chriſt. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is one kinde of loue whiche God beareth towardes all

goods of the worlde cannot but turne too our harme, vntill wee

ſetting downe continually Gods grace or free fauour before the
benefites which he beſtoweth vppon vs. Although then that wee
muſt deſire God to make vs feele his goodneſſe in all things which
he knoweth to be meete for vs: yet muſt wee not forget the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall

and aſſure vs in our hartes that he beareth vs good will. VVhen we
once ſee that light,<note place="margin">Pſal. 4. b. 7</note> let it ſuffyze vs (as it is ſayd in the Pſalme) and

to beare all things patiently, not withſtanding that they ſeeme to be
vtterly againſt vs. And it ſtandeth vs ſo much the more on hand too
beare this leſſon in mind, bycauſe wee ſee men wander away after
their own luſtes. For moſt men are become ſo brutiſh, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
nothing but to haue the things that nature teacheth them too
like of: They haue no regard at all of God. One deſires to eate, &amp;
another to drinke, and the third to haue apparell: and theſe are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
that houer in the ayre. But the poynt whereat we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
is too know that God is the founder of all our welfare, and that
all the commodities which we haue in this world, and all the aydes
which wee haue too help vs with, are benefits proceeding from his
hand. Then if wee cannot apply our deſires vnto God, it is too vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward,
yea and too beaſtly a thing: and yet for all that, the moſte
part of the world is at that poynt. There are otherſome which ſeeme
too take a better way and rule: but yet doo they alſo peruert all.
They deſire God too ſend them the things which he knoweth too
bee good &amp; profitable for them: but in the meane whyle they looke
not to the fountayne wherout of they ſhould draw their firſt water,
that is to wit, too bee reconciled to God. For all is one with them ſo
God ſpare them, and execute not his rigour towardes them. As for
his loue or hatred, they paſſe not greatly for it, ſo he handle them
after the deſire and appetite of their fleſhe. Now although ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of men do ſeeke vnto God, yet doo they ſet the Cart before the
horſe. For they ought to ſet Gods loue in the firſt &amp; chiefeſt place,
and then to come downe to the great number of benefites which he
beſtoweth vpon vs, &amp; wherby he witneſſeth his goodneſſe towards
vs. Albeit then that many men holde not themſelues within the
ſayd meaſure, but make more vnruly requeſtes vnto God than one
man would doo to another: ſo as one man craueth Riches another
Honour, and none is contented with that whiche God ſendeth: yet
notwithſtanding, though men were well aduized in their wiſhes, &amp;
precize in deſiring nothing but that which they haue neede of, yet if
they forget Gods fauour, therein they ſhew themſelues not to haue
profited at all. VVherfore let vs marke how it is not without cauſe,
that S. Paule hath heere ſet downe twoo things ioyntly togither:
that is too witte, that God muſte firſte receyue vs into his fauour,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23060:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo as we alſo may feele him to be truely our father, and to accept vs
as his children: and he thervppon afterward make vs too proſper.
Now, ſuch maner of proſperitie may (as I haue ſayd already) be well
wiſhed for: but yet in the meane while the only goodneſſe of God
muſt be our ſolace: and when we be put too the ſuffering of many
miſeries in this world, ſo as things fall not out as wee woulde haue
them, yet muſt we be contented with this, that God accepteth vs.
And therewithall he ſetteth downe the name of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, bicauſe it is not poſsible that God ſhould fauour vs, but for
his owne ſonnes ſake in whom is his whole delight, according as it
is ſayd,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. b. 6.</note> as well in the. xvi chapter of S. Mathew, as in the firſte too
the Epheſians. Then if we had nothing elſe to ſet before our eyes
but the maieſtie of God, it would make vs afrayd, and we could not
haue any acceſſe vnto him, bicauſe we be frayle creatures, yea and
altogither ſinfull, creeping here vppon the earth, and deſeruing too
be ſwallowed into the bottom of Hell. Therfore it is very requiſite
that Chriſt ſhould ſhew himſelf vnto vs, and that wee ſhould looke
vpon him, to taſte what Gods loue is, and to inioy all the benefites
which he beſtoweth vpon vs: for they belong not to any other than
to his owne onely Sonne, who is the heyre of all things, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeaketh of him in the firſt chapter to the Hebrewes.<note place="margin">Hebr. 1. a. 2</note> Seing then
that all the good turnes whiche God doeth vs, belong peculiarly
too our Lord Ieſus Chriſte: it behoueth vs too communicate with
him, and to be made parttakers of them by his meanes. Therfore it
is not without chuſe that S. Paule ſayeth heere, <hi>from God the father
and from our Lord Ieſus Christ.</hi> Yea and too the intent too giue vs
the greater aſſurance that God will take vs into his fauour (if we
ſeeke him truely and vnfaynedly,) howbeit by the meanes of his
only Sonne: he ſayeth that <hi>Ieſus Christ gaue himſelfe for our ſinnes.</hi>
Now it is certaine that nothing putteth vs out of Gods fauour, but
our owne ſinfulneſſe. For we ſee that his mercy extendeth it ſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the Sparowes that flie in the ayre, and vnto the brute beaſts.
For when as God bringeth forth graſſe in the mountaynes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
other fodder too grow for cattell:<note place="margin">Pſa. 104. b. 14. &amp; 147. b. 8.</note> it is a token that he hath a
care of them. And truly they be markes of his goodneſſe, as it is ſaid
in the Pſalmes. How then ſhould he not loue thoſe whom he hath
<pb facs="tcp:23060:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
created after his owne image, and which approche much neerer too
him, &amp; to his nature, that is to ſay, men? God therfore in reſpect of
his creating of vs, receiueth &amp; auoweth vs for his owne. But for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as we be corrupted and our nature is become ſinful, it cauſeth
God too hate vs and too take vs for his enemies, ſo as there is as it
were a deadly foade betweene him and vs, till he haue taken vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into his fauour for our Lord Ieſus Chriſtes ſake. VVherfore to
the end we may nor haue any cauſe to doubt of Gods loue, S. Paule
doth here ſet downe before vs the Sacrifize whereby the remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of our tranſgreſsions is blotted out, ſo that God hauing now
forgotten all our wretchedneſſe, beholdeth vs as his owne, and as
thoſe on whom he hath ſet his marke, &amp; (to be ſhort) as thoſe whom
he hath created too be his children and heyres. And hereby wee be
warned, that there is none other meanes to pacifie our conſciences,
and to make vs able to call vpon God in full libertie, but by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too our ſelues the ſacrifize offered by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,
wherein he hath made full ſatisfaction [for vs], ſo that henceforth
God receyueth vs as his owne children. And here firſt of all we ſee
the force of the death and paſsion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, how that
therin we find attonement betwene God and vs, ſo that whereas we
were erſt at oddes with him, and he muſt needes haue (as ye would
ſay) abhorred vs: now he voutchſafeth too take vs into his fauour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And why? Bicauſe our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath made amendes for all
our faultes &amp; miſdeedes, by the obedience which he yeelded in his
death &amp; paſsion, in ſomuch that the ſacrifize which he offered was a
[full] ſatisfaction for [all] our ſinnes, &amp; his bloudſhed became like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
our clenzing, and hath waſhed vs cleane from all the ſpottes of
our ſinnes. Thus ye ſee how we may be ſure that God receiueth vs.
And how may we haue the boldneſſe to call vpon him and to reſort
vnto him? Euen by faſtening our eyes vpon the Sacrifize which our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath offered. For if we haue not that, it is certayne
that we ſhal alwayes be afrayd, when we think vpon the maieſtie of
God. For ſeyng we be wretched offenders, how ſhould we not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayd
of our iudge, who is armed to execute the vengeance that we
deſerue? Neuertheleſſe for aſmuch as our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath
buried our faults, we may come vnto God boldly and without any
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23060:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtop. Howbeit it behoueth vs to marke therewithal, that the ſacrifize
wherby our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath reconciled vs to God his father,
is ſo ſufficient, that it behoueth vs to lay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vp all our truſt therein, &amp;
not to ſeeke any other meanes: according alſo as S. Paules intent
heere, is to bring backe the Galathians to the pure truthe from the
which they had bin led away &amp; ſeduced not that they had vtterly
renounced Ieſus Chriſt, but that they had intermingled the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Lawe, thereby to obtayne forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, as who
ſhould ſay there needed other helpes therevnto: according as in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie
it wil well ynough be graunted, that Ieſus Chriſt is the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of the world, but yet therwithal euery man ſeeketh to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pound
with God, &amp; to make amends by himſelf. Now the Galathians had
already bin imbured with the like errour. For this cauſe Sainct Paule
ſheweth the, that ſinnes are none otherwize wiped out, than by the
ſacrifize of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to thintent that our fayth may reſt
wholly there. Therfore if we wilbe, parttakers of ſo great a benefite,
we muſt giue ouer al our vaine hopes, &amp; all the illuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
putteth in our minde, when he turneth vs aſide fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his only grace, by making vs to beleeue that we can
come vnto God, if we bring ſome amends with vs. To be ſhort, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
ſuch time as we be ſure that there is none other waſhing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to skoure out the ſpottes of our iniquities, but the bloud which
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath ſhed, &amp; wherwith we be rinced through
the holy ghoſt: it is certain that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer come freely vnto God,
nor reſt vpon his fauour &amp; loue, but ſhall euer be wandering in our
own imaginacions: &amp; that ſhal be a due payment for our misbelefe,
in that we haue not yeelded our Lord Ieſus Chriſt the honor that he
deſerued. Thus ye ſee in effect what we haue to beare in mind here,
where S. Paule ſetteth the death &amp; paſsion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
before vs, telling vs that that is the thing wherein we ſhall finde the
amends of all our faultes, do as they ſhal not be called any more too
account before God. And he ſayeth purpoſely <hi>that Ieſus Christ gaue
himſelfe</hi> too the end wee ſhould the more boldly take holde of his
Loue. For wee ſee heere, that when our Lord Ieſus Chriſt did put
foorth himſelf too make attonement betweene God and vs, he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not his owne body &amp; ſoule, in ſomuch that he indured extreme
<pb facs="tcp:23060:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
anguiſh in his foule, as he that was our borrow in the ſame, and bare
the wrath of God in our behalfe. And in his body alſo he indured all
reproch and ſhame, and therewithall alſo the horribleſt tormentes
that could be deuized and al this (as I ſayd afore) ſheweth right wel,
that the loue which he bare vs was ineſtimable, ſith he forgate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
after that ſort for our ſakes. But yet notwithſtanding, herewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
S. Paule bringeth vs alwayes backe too the will of God, too ſhew
that when our Lord Ieſus Chriſt did in that wyze performe all that
belonged too our ſaluation, it was no let but that God in the meane
whyle vttered his mercy in the ſame, according as it is ſayd in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
text,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. b. 16</note> that God ſo loued the world, that he ſpared not his onely
ſonne, but deliuered him to death for vs. To the intent therfore that
we ſhould not think that the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt too
pacifie God his father, was after ſuch a ſort that he perſuaded him to
alter his purpoſe, (as men are inclined to ſuch groſſe &amp; earthly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginacions:)
S. Paule (to ſhew vs that God was not reconcyled vnto
vs after the maner of men) telleth vs expreſly that the cauſe why
Ieſus Chriſt was deliuered for our ſinnes, was for that God had ſo
ordeyned it. For if a man be angry with his childe, ſome other man
may ſteppe in, too appeaſe his wrath, and ſuch a one ſhall ſupply the
roome of a third partie. But the cace ſtoode not ſo with our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt when he offered himſelf in Sacrifize too do away all our
ſinnes, &amp; to make vs way vnto God from whom we were ſhet out
before. He came not as one that ſtepped in of his owne head, and as
though God had not meddled with the matter. How then? God (as
hath bin touched not long ſince (did both hate vs and loue vs before
the reconciliation [was made.] And why loued he vs? Bicauſe we be
his creatures. And again, although he ſaw we were ſo wretched, and
vtterly forlorne &amp; damned folke by reaſon of ſin: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
he had pitie vpon vs, &amp; would not haue mankind to periſh vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly.
Thus yee ſee how God loued vs, notwithſtanding that in the
perſone of Adam we were fallen away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him &amp; vtterly corrupted.
Therwithall he did alſo hate vs, euen bicauſe he is the welſpring of
all rightuouſneſſe. Therfore he abhorred the naughtineſſe that was
in vs by reaſon wherof there needed an attoneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be made in the
bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; by the ſacrifize which he offered.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23060:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But yet muſt not that benefite bee fathered vppon any other than
God. Yee ſee then howe it was Gods dooing too ſende his onely
ſonne, and too giue him ouer vnto death for vs. And why? To the
ende that all hatred betweene him and vs ſhoulde bee done away.
This in effect is the thing that ought to be vnderſtood of S. Paules
woordes, when he ſaith that Ieſus Chriſt gaue himſelfe to the death
for our ſinnes, and yet notwithſtanding that the ſame came not too
paſſe without the wil of God, who had determined the ſame afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hande
in his owne euerlaſting purpoſe. Heere firſt of all we haue
too magnifie the mercie that was ſhewed vs, in the perſon of our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. For if God had [but] proclaymed a pardon, and
tolde vs that he woulde take vs to mercie though we were vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of it: that had bin verie much, yea and it had bin impoſsible for
vs to magnifie ſuch a gracious goodneſſe as it deſerueth. But ſeeing
he hath lent vs ſuch a gage of his loue as his owne ſonne, and gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
himſelfe to vs in his perſon, [thereby] ſhewing himſelfe to be
our father: it ſo farre paſſeth all that we haue ſayde, that if all our
wittes were imployed too woondering at ſuche a goodneſſe, yet
ſhould wee neuer come to the fulneſſe thereof. Thus ye ſee what
we haue to marke in the firſt place, when Saint Paule ſpeaketh too
vs of Gods will. [Howbeeit] let vs vnderſtande, that euen from the
time that God had iuſt cauſe to hate vs, and to abhorre vs, yea and
[euen from the time] that we were his enimies (as the Scripture
ſayth) in very deede he neuer ceaſſed to haue ſome regarde of vs,<note place="margin">Ro. 5. b. 10.</note>
and to extende his pitie ſo farre foorth, as he would not haue vs to
abyde in our deſtruction: in ſo much that he hath not thought it
ynough to declare the ſame by word of mouth, but alſo hath giuen
vs ſuch a pledge as wee ſee, that is to wit, that his owne ſonne hath
anſwered for it. Now ſeeing it is ſo that God hath ſhewed himſelfe
ſo gracious and mercifull before we were reconciled to him: what
will he do now when we haue ſo ſure a warrant, and that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
alſo is preached vnto vs, to aſſure vs that we be knit vntoo our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt by fayth, as members of his bodie? Shall we now
doubt of Gods loue towards vs when we haue ſo good a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, as Saint Paule fayth in the fift Chapter to the Romaines?
If ſo be that Ieſus Chriſt (ſayth he) came to put away all our ſinnes
<pb facs="tcp:23060:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at ſuch times as there was yet deadly foad betweene god &amp; vs: ought
not all doubting to be troden vnder foote, and we not be afrayde in
any wiſe too call vpon our God, but aſſure our ſelues of our owne
ſaluation, nowe when God hath ſo confirmed it vnto vs, when hee
hath admitted vs into his fauour, when he calleth and allureth vs as
gently as may be, and when hee ſheweth and certefieth vs that hee
doth as it were hold open his armes to imbrace vs, whenſoeuer we
will come vnto him? Thus ye ſee what we haue to beare in minde
in this ſtreyne. Furthermore, let vs marke alſo the loue of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, how that ſeeing hee hath giuen himſelfe after that ſort
for our ſinnes, he will not ſuffer his death and paſsion to be vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
nor the ſacrifice which he hath once offered, to be voyd and
of none effect, without bringing forth frute in vs. But as hee hath
offered himſelfe once for all: ſo alſo will he be our continuall Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
and Aduocate, to the ende we may be partakers of the clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
which he hath purchaſed for vs, that beeing ridde of all our
fowleneſſe we may appeare [cleane] before God, and ſpeake vnto
him with open mouth. Lo how we ought to gather togither all the
things that are ſhewed vs here for the ſtabliſhing of our faith, &amp; that
we may freely reſort vnto our God, not as ſtraungers to him, but
as his owne children and familiar friendes. And herewithall let vs
learne alſo, to ſhake off all the illuſions and fancies of Satan, who
ſeeketh by all meanes too turne vs away from our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, or elſe to darken the grace which we ſhoulde finde in him:
and when he can not aboliſh it vtterly, he ſnarleth vs and putteth
[new] meanes into our heades whereby to purchaſe fauor at Gods
hande. But let vs cut off all ſuch things, and ſo faſten all our wittes
vpon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as he onely my ſuffize vs, and we vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
miſlyke whatſoeuer ſhall come in our heade too purchaſe
grace and fauor with, aſſuring our ſelues that there is not any other
thing that may cauſe God to receyue vs to mercie, than the ſacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fize
whereby all righteouſneſſe and clenneſſe was purchaſed for
vs. Furthermore, vnder theſe woordes of <hi>Gods will,</hi> it behoueth
vs too comprehende a free goodneſſe, too exclude all that men are
woont too make themſelues beleeue of their owne merits: for in
that ſence alſo are thoſe wordes taken in the holy Scripture, ſo that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23060:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(as I haue tolde you before) the thing which is termed heere by
the name of <hi>Will,</hi> is termed elſewhere by the name of <hi>good pleaſure.</hi>
Saint Paule therefore not onely ſheweth that the welſpring of our
Redemption and Saluation conſiſteth in the ordinance and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
purpoſe of God the father:<note place="margin">Luc. 2. b. 14</note> but alſo intendeth to beat down
all pryde and preſumption, by ſhewing that wee muſt yeelde the
whole prayſe of our righteouſneſſe too the free fauour of God,
which had no regarde at all of our deſeruings. For let vs examine
our ſelues: and what ſhall God find in vs but vtter wretchedneſſe?
And that is the verie cauſe why God voutſafeth his mercie vpon
vs. So then let vs aſſure our ſelues, that hencefoorth wee may
freely lift vp our eyes to heauen, and preferre our prayers and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
vnto God,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. b. 16</note> bycauſe he hath preuented vs, according as it
as ſayd in S. Iohn, that he had not tarried till we loued him, (for that
was impoſsible bicauſe we be wholy bent vnto euill, and are vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
giuen ouer to it:) but had loued vs euen though wee were his
enimies. And ſo ye ſee that the appearing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
was too the ende too reconcile vs to God his father, as wee haue
ſhewed alreadie. That therefore is in effect the thing that wee
haue to beare in minde. Nowe Saint Paule addeth immediately,
<hi>that it was to deliuer vs from this wicked worlde.</hi> Heere he ſheweth
why we bee called too the knowledge of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt:
and alſo why he hath ſet ſo great ſtore by vs, as to redeeme vs as he
hath done: [namely] to the ende we ſhoulde not abide in our filth
and vncleanneſſe, but be withdrawne away from it by him. In verie
deed that is not the cauſe of our ſaluation, but the ende and marke
wherat God loked [in ordeyning vs to ſaluation.] The thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which it ſtandeth vs on hand to haue an eie vnto when our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, is that we muſt begin at the free fauor which
God bare vnto vs, when he determined in his euerlaſting purpoſe,
that we ſhould be brought backe againe vnto him by the meanes of
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And ſo, that was the principall cauſe. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cauſe thereof is Ieſus Chriſt, in whome wee finde all that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
for our aſſurance. For there we ſee our ſinnes blotted out,
inaſmuch as hee is ordeyned to be our borrow, and hath made ſuch
amendes for vs, as nothing can ſtop vs from comming too God.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
That is the ſeconde poynt which wee haue too remember heere.
Now the meane whereby we be made partakers of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, is our imbracing of the promiſes of the Goſpel by true faith.
For the faythleſſe haue no profite at all by the death and paſsion of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, but rather are ſo much the more damnable,
bicauſe they reiect the meane that God had ordeyned: and theyr
vnthankfulneſſe ſhall be ſo much the more grieuouſly puniſhed, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they haue troden vnder foote the bloud of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, which was the ranſome for their ſoules. Therfore it ſtandeth
vs on hande to receyue the promiſes of the Goſpell by fayth, if we
deſire that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould communicate himſelfe vnto vs, and
that he ſhould bring vs to the poſſeſsion and inioyment of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
which he hath purchaſed for vs: ſo as they belong not too
any other than ſuch as are members of his bodie, and are graffed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and receyue him by fayth, according as it is ſayde in the firſt
Chapter of Saint Iohn,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. b. 12</note> that God accepteth and auoucheth thoſe for
his children, which beleeue in his only ſonne. Thus ye ſee what we
haue to remember in the thirde place, when we come too the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our ſaluation. Nowe remayneth that God bee glorified in
vs, as good reaſon is that he ſhoulde be. And in that reſpect alſo,
Saint Paule in the thirde to the Romaynes ſayth, that wheras God
hath giuen vs the meanes in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ro. 3. d. 25.</note> too finde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
at his hande by the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, and there withal
ſent vs the Goſpell to put vs in poſſeſsion of the ſame benefite: his
ſo doing is to the ende that he onely may appeare to be righteous,
and be glorified therefore, ſo as we ſhould yeeld him all prayſe, and
acknowledge our ſelues beholden to him for all things. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
the glorifying of God conſiſteth not onely in our confeſsing
with our mouth that he is the authour of our ſaluation, and that the
ſame commeth of him alonely: and of his mere goodneſſe and free
grace: but alſo in becomming newe men through his holy ſpirite,
ſo as his image ſhineth forth in vs, and we indeuer to giue ouer our
ſelues wholy to his ſeruice.<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4. b. 7.</note> It is ſayde, that God hath not called vs
to filthineſſe and vncleanneſſe, but that his meaning is too make vs
holy to himſelfe. Nowe then ſeeing the cace ſtandeth ſo: it is not
for nought that Saint Paule addeth heere, that Ieſus Chriſt hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23060:35"/>
liuered vs from this wicked world by offering himſelfe for vs, and
that he hath wyped out the remembrance of our ſinnes before God
his father, to the ende we ſhould not lie any longer plunged in our
owne filth and vnclenneſſe, but be as it were ſeparated from the
world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the intent to become the heritage of God, and to diſpoſe
our whole life to ſuch obedience, as it may be ſeene that like as hee
hath adopted vs to be his children, ſo we alſo haue loued and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him as our father. And out of all doubt, when as it is ſayde that
we muſt be taken out of this wicked world, it is a benefit which we
ought to be abaſhed at. For vnder the word <hi>World,</hi> is comprehended
all that belongeth to man in his owne nature. The worlde of it ſelfe
hath in it neither vice nor corruption: but al the euilneſſe of it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
of the ſinne that dwelleth in vs. So then, whereas it is ſaid that
the worlde is wicked,<note place="margin">1. Iohu <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 19.</note> according alſo as S. Iohn in his canonicall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle
ſayth that all the world is ſaped and plunged in naughtineſſe:
that wickedneſſe is neither in the Sunne, nor in the Moone, nor in
the earth, nor in the water, nor in any of all the things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
in them: but in that we be ſo peruerted, that we haue infected
all things heere bilowe with our vnclenneſſe: and that as long as
men continue in themſelues and in their owne nature, they bee but
filthineſſe, ſo as they muſt of neceſsitie diſpleaſe God. For ſurely
there can be none agreement betweene righteouſneſſe and vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.
But in vs there is nothing to be found but vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Therefore we muſt either be withdrawne from our ſelues,
or elſe we ſhall neuer be able to come nie vnto God. VVhat ſhall
then become of all the blinde wretches, which beare themſelues in
hand that they be able to worke wonders with their free will, theyr
vertues, their wiſdome, and I wote not what elſe? According as we
ſee that men do always like well of themſelues, &amp; although they be
conuicted to haue nothing but filthineſſe in them, &amp; that they be ſo
lothſome as it is pitie to ſee it, and they themſelues ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
of it: yet they will ſtill chalenge ſomwhat to themſelues, &amp;
alwayes deceyue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with their owne fond imaginations. And
yet notwithſtanding when men haue well tried themſelues, all that
they can find in them ſhal be condemned vnder the terme of <hi>naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſse</hi>
[or <hi>wickedneſſe:]</hi> inſomuch that it is ſhewed therby, that there
<pb facs="tcp:23060:36"/>
is nothing but corruption in vs, and that if wee preſume too preace
vnto God as we be of our ſelues, hee muſt needes driue vs a great
way of. Therefore marke this for a grounde, that heere all pride is
beaten downe, too the intent that men may learne too leaue their
boaſting in any thing, ſaue in the free goodneſſe of God, and bee ſo
abaſhed in conſidering their owne ſhame, that they may condemne
themſelues with their owne mouth, and not tarie til God giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
againſt them, but become their owne iudges. This is it in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
which we haue to marke. And now we ſee how it behoueth vs
to walke warely and carefully; that we may be aſſured that the death
and paſsion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt belongeth to vs. For if we will
needes giue bridle too our Iuſtes, it is certaine that our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt will diſclayme vs. True it is that our Saluation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
alwayes vpon the onely goodneſſe of God, and that we muſt
not intermeddle our owne workes when we intende too haue the
certaintie of fayth, but rather renounce our ſelues. Neuertheleſſe
howſoeuer the cace ſtandeth, our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is not come to
giue vs occaſion too abuſe the grace that he hath purchaſed vs, for
that were a mocking of him to his face. If we ſhoulde go wallow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in our owne filthineſſe after that hee hath waſhed vs in his
bloud, were it not a wilfull defyling of the thing that is moſt holy,
ye a and which maketh all the whole world holy? Now foraſmuch
as we are all of vs corrupted, and the whole world is ſubiect to cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and all of vs are condemned: there is not any thing to ſanctifie
vs againe, but [onely] the bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And how
great and intollerable a trecherie were it, if we as much (as in vs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
ſhould fall to beraying of our ſelues again in our own filthines?
The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let vs marke wel, that to inioy the frute of the death &amp; paſsion
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, we muſt not take libertie to do euil, nor to
liue after our owne appetites and luſtes: but we muſt alwayes come
to the ſeparation wherof S. Paule ſpeketh here, which is to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne
from this wicked world, &amp; not to breake aſunder the things
that are knit togither with ſo holy a band, nor to diſanull the order
of God. The faythfull therefore muſt giue themſelues to all pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of life, and conſider that the redeeming of them by our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, and by the ſacrifice of his death and paſsion, is vppon
condition that they ſhould forſake themſelues, according alſo as we
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23060:36"/>
heerehow our Lord Ieſus Chriſt telleth vs,<note place="margin">Marke. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> d, 34.</note> that thoſe which wil be
his diſciples, muſt abace the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues &amp; folow him. What haue we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to do, and what ought to be our trauel all the time of our life? VVe
muſt do our indeuer to withdraw our ſelues from the defilementes
of this world, that we may cleaue vnto our God in pureneſſe of life.
True it is that this thing is not perfected in vs vntill wee bee quite
withdrawne from the world: but yet that is the marke that we muſt
ame at, and whervnto it behoueth vs to draw more &amp; more. Then
like as the faythfull reſort continually to Gods mercie, grounding
themſelues therevpon, and are not otherwiſe righteous than by the
forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes: ſo alſo behoueth it them to kepe on to
the end which S. Paule ſetteth down to vs here, which is to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the world. And thoſe two things are well worthie to bee
marked. Some fantaſtical perſons haue imagined ſuch a perfection,
that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be once regenerated in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, we haue
no more need of the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes. Inſomuch that they
ſay we keepe the worlde ſtill to their Apſie, when wee preach that
we, cannot become righteous but by fayth, nor come in Gods fauor
but by his forgiuing of our ſins, and by his couering of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through
his owne goodneſſe. But that is a diueliſh pride, and yet among Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
there is no more praiſe than that giuen vnto Gods goodneſſe.
So then let vs abhorre ſuch harebraynes, and all their blaſphemies,
when they go about to be witch vs ſo farre, as too make vs beleeue
that we haue no more neede too be pitied of God, nor to haue our
ſinnes forgiuen vs. But let vs truſt vnto it, that it ſtandeth vs on ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
to ſigh and grone al our life long, and that there is none other hope
to aſſure vs of our ſaluation, but firſt to yeeld our ſelues giltie, and
then to be out of all doubt that the bloud of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt
doth continually waſh vs pure and cleane. Mark that for one poynt.
And therwithall let our indeuor alwayes be to bee ſeparated from
this wicked worlde. And how? Euen by praying vntoo God too
touche vs firſt with his holy ſpirite, and afterwarde too increaſe his
giftes in vs, and too mortifie the luſtes of the fleſhe. And ſithe
wee feele ſuch a battell, ſo as we be fayne too inforce our ſelues, or
elſe that wee do but lympe and halt in going vntoo God, inſomuch
that we make many a falſe ſteppe, and oftentymes happen to trippe
<pb facs="tcp:23060:37"/>
and ſtumble: let vs mourne continually ſeeing wee fayle at all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes.
Thus ye ſee howe wee may bee deliuered from this wicked
worlde. [Namely] not by beeing ſet vtterly free from ſinne, like
as alſo when S. Paule ſaith that God hath deliuered vs [from oure
ſinnes] to the intent we ſhould liue perfectly, and vndefiled before
him, it is not for that there can be found any ſuch pureneſſe in any
man ſo long as he is in this worlde: for all our thoughts do conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
rebell agaynſt God, yea and euen the righteouſſeſt men of all
ſhall euermore finde themſelues behinde hande, and perceyue that
they do ſtill dragge their legges after them. But yet howſoeuer the
worlde go, wee perceyue on the other ſyde, that our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt hath alreadie ridded vs by fayth out of the bondage of the
Diuell, and will maintaine vs agaynſt all aſſaults. If we fall to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
and euery man trie what is in himſelfe, we ſhall finde that
when on the one ſide there is any good deſire in vs, ſo as wee ſeeke
to honour God: [on the other ſide] our owne nature leadeth vs
the contrarie way, ſo as we would fayne keepe aloofe from him:
inſomuch that the faythfull muſt needes feele both thoſe two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in them ſelues, namely that when on the one ſide (as Saint
Peter cheereth vs) the holy Ghoſt counſelleth vs too giue our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
to all holineſſe of life:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. a. 1</note> on the other ſide we feele our ſelues to
be plucked backe by many wicked affections, ſo as we cannot come
neare vnto God as we faine woulde do. And that is the cauſe why
Saint Paule in the vij.<note place="margin">Ro. 7. d. 19.</note> Chapter too the Romaynes ſigheth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
that he is vnhappie, bicauſe he cannot do the good that he is
deſirous to do, nor vtterly eſchew the euill that he hateth &amp; abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
Thus ye ſee that the thing which wee haue to marke concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the deliuerance that is mencioned heere, is that our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt hath not ſo regenerated vs alreadie by his holy ſpirite, as
to ſet vs in full freedome to walke as we would wiſh, and to runne
ſo ſwiftly and with ſo cheerfull a courage as were requiſite. But his
deliuering of vs is to make vs holde on our way ſtill towardes our
marke, that is to ſay, to make vs yeelde our ſelues wholy in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
vnto God, and to withdraw our ſelues from our corruptions,
and too forſake them more and more, vntill the tyme of full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
be come, which is, when our Lord God ſhall haue throughly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23060:37"/>
repayred his Image in vs. Now by the way, although the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were partly ſlipt away, and had giuen eare to the buzibodies that
had diſguized the Goſpel, and made ſuch a mingle mangle of it, that
Ieſus Chriſt was as good as ouerwhelmed and buried: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
S. Paule matcheth them ſtill with the faythfull, for whom
the ſacrifize was offered, according alſo as he placeth them in the
Church of God. He ſpeaketh not to the Renegates that had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Ieſus Chriſt. True it is, that he will anon ſhew them their fault:
but yet for all that, he mindeth not to exclude them vtterly from the
hope of ſaluation. For ther were no cauſe for him to write to them,
if it were not to draw them backe againe, and to winne them and to
bring them againe into the good way. Foraſmuch then as S. Paule
laboureth to bring backe the Galathians into the way of ſaluation
(as need was:) therefore he admitteth them ſtill to the ineſtimable
benefit that is purchaſed for vs by the ſonne of God, and reckeneth
them ſtill as ſeparated from the worlde, knitting them to the felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of thoſe whome God accepteth and auoweth for his children.
And that is, bicauſe there was yet ſome ſeede of the Goſpell in
them, and although they were ſnarled in ſome errours, yet they
had not vtterly forſaken God, nor gone quite away from the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.
For that conſideration therefore, Saint Paule holdeth them
backe, and reckeneth them ſtill in the number of the faythfull. And
ſo although we bee not worthie of it, yet will God recken vs as of
his houſeholde for his woordes ſake which is preached among vs.
No doubt but it ſhall bee to our ſorer damnation, if God call vs, and
wee anſwere him not. But if wee haue any good deſire too come
vntoo him, and yet haue ſtill many vyces and infirmities in vs: he
accepteth vs as his owne, for his woordes ſake. And wee bee called
his Church,<note place="margin">Mat. 4. a. 5. &amp; 27. f. 25.</note> not for that we be worthie of that tytle, but bicauſe that
as the Citie of Ieruſalem was called the holy Citie in reſpect of the
promiſes, namely that the Goſpell ſhould come from thence, and
that the Redeemer of the worlde ſhoulde be manifeſted there: ſo
by like reaſon we be called the faythfull, and the children of God,
and are muſtered in the aray of his Church, when the Goſpell is
preached among vs, and men conſent therevnto, although it be not
with ſuch reuerence and perfectneſſe as were meete. Neuertheleſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:38"/>
how ſoeuer the cace ſtande, Saint Paules vſing of ſuch mildene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
towardes the Galathians, is not to foad them in their vyces, nor too
ſooth them vp with fonde flatterie after the maner of many men,
whom we ſee deſirous to bee flattered after that ſort: but we ſhall
ſee anon how he rebuketh them as ſharply as may be, inſomuch that
he calleth them witleſſe. And how can theſe things agree togither?
It is for that on the one ſide, he intendeth to aduaunce the grace of
God, which had bin opened in that Church: and that on the other
ſide, he was faine to ſcoure away the vices that were in it, as neede
was. VVe ſee then hereby, that when God hath planted his Church
in any place, it followeth not by and by therefore, that all things are
to be commended there, and that there is nothing but all godlineſſe
in it, as the Papiſtes imagine, who vnder the name of the Church
would faine couer all their abhominations, yea euen the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and diueliſhe abhominations in the whole worlde. As howe?
The Church [ſay ſay] cannot erre:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4. d. 25.</note> ſhe is the bryde of Ieſus Chriſt:
ſhe is the piller of truth. Yea, but in the meane while looke vpon the
Churches of Galatia. VVhat ſayth the holy Ghoſt of them by the
mouth of S. Paule? Among them there were Renegates that had
renounced the Goſpell: there were as foule and outrageous here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
among them as could be. Then let vs vnderſtand, that we muſt
neuer bee ſo tyed to men, as not to condemne their faultes when
they come to the ſcanning: but that all things muſt be made ſubject
to Gods worde, and euerie thing be condemned that is not agreable
thervnto, ſo as nothing may hinder God from hauing his authority
continually, and from putting all things vnder foot which agree not
with his word, but that men do condemne them, &amp; vtterly abhorre
them. Furthermore, let vs not ceaſſe to draw thoſe continually vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, which haue any enterance alreadie. And although we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
them to be weake or ſtepped aſide out of the way: yet let vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſet forth Gods grace, that it may growe and bee ſtrengthned
more and more in them, vntill we be all gathered thither as we bee
dayly called, that is to wit, to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now let vs fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God,
with acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make vs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
them more and more, and that we may be ſo touched to the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23060:38"/>
quicke, as we may miſtyke of them, and ſo imbrace his grace, as it
may be more and more increaſed in vs, and we be hilde vp and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteyned
in our weakneſſe by his hande, vntill he haue brought vs to
the holy perfection of the heauenly kingdome, which is purchaſed
for vs by the meanes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And ſo let vs all ſay,
Almightie God our heauenly father. &amp;c.</p>

touched alreadie this morning: that is to wit,
that Saint Paule ſpareth not the Galathians, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he mind not too ſhet them out of the
gate of ſaluation. For inaſmuch as his meening
is to bring them backe to repentance: it is good
reaſon that he ſhould ſet the grace of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, as a thing common to them. But yet for all that, he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
them not, but rather rebuketh them for their faults, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for the ouergreat lightneſſe that was in them in giuing eare
to deceyuers, which came vnto them to diſguize the doctrine of the
Goſpell. And to make them perceyue their owne vnthankfulneſſe
the better: he ſayth that <hi>he wondereth to ſee them caryed away ſo ſoone
and ſo eaſily from the heauenly calling,</hi> and how it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe that
they could be ſo quickly thruſt out of the way, &amp; continue yet ſtil in
their doing, ſeing that they had already felt &amp; tried Gods grace in
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For inaſmuch as he labored to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> back
<pb facs="tcp:23060:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
againe, he ſayth not at the firſt daſh that they had turned away from
the Goſpell, but that they had bin ouercome by that temptation.
And afterwarde he addeth, that the ſame was nothing elſe, but that
thoſe buzibodies intended to ouerthrow the truth of God. For ther
is but one pure doctrine of the Goſpell, like as there is but one Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, vpon whom the ſame is grounded: ſo as it is not in vs to
forge a newe Goſpell, but whenſoeuer any bodie goes about too
mingle any thing with the pure ſeede which we haue of our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt, it is nothing elſe but an ouerthrowing of Gods buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
This in effect is the thing which is conteyned in this firſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of S. Paules. But here he might ſeeme to bee ouer ſharpe and
rough in finding fault with the feebleneſſe of the Galathians, ſeeing
they neuer ment to forſake the goſpel, nor yet Ieſus Chriſt who had
bin preached amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them. Howbeit S. Paule paſſeth not for their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
but hath reſpect to the matter in it ſelf, which is, that as ſone
as men turne aſide from Gods truth, by and by they forſake Ieſus
Chriſt, and make themſelues ſtrangers to him. Many men woulde
thinke this ſtrange, according as we ſee there are many that woulde
faine mingle the light and darkneſſe togither. And ſpecially the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
that is in Poperie is a very notable example hereof: for ther
ye ſhall heare men make wonderfull proteſtations of holding ſtill
the Chriſtian faith wherin they haue bin baptiſed. But yet for al that
it is apparant, that al is turned vpſide down: for al ſuperſtitions reign
there: and beſides that, there is too manifeſt Idolatry, yea and that as
groſſe as euer was any among the heathen. By reaſon wherof al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
of God is as good as quite aboliſhed there, bicauſe euerie
man makes himſelfe a Sauiour in ſteade of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.
But now will the Papiſts luſtily replie, that they be no backſliders,
nor haue forſaken Chriſt. Yea, but our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is no
Ghoſt, he cannot tranſforme himſelf after the appetites of men. To
be ſhort, he cannot be ſeparated from his Church. VVhenſoeuer the
Papiſtes vtter this ſaying: they robbe Ieſus Chriſt of all authoritie.
For (ſay they) if there were but one Mediator, what ſhoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the Heeſaintes which are patrones, and of the Sheeſaintes
which are our Aduocates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if any man ſpeake to them of the ſacrifice
wherby our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath once purchaſed perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23060:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for all the faythfull: VVhat (ſay they) and muſt not Maſſe
be ſayde euery day, and Chriſt be offered vp newe againe there, too
appeaze Gods wrath? If a man tell them of the free forgiueneſſe of
ſinnes: and what ſhall become (ſay they) of our owne ſatiſfactions,
whereby we deſerue to haue pitie at Gods hand? Againe, if a man
ſay too them, that all our goodneſſe commeth of our regeneration
through Gods ſpirit, and that there is nothing but ſpottineſſe &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliouſneſſe
in vs, till God haue changed vs: how ſo (anſwer they)
and what ſhall then become of our own free will? To be ſhort, Ieſus
Chriſt ſhalbe named oft ynough, and men wil reſerue vnto him the
title of Redemer. But in the meane ſeaſon his office ſhalbe parted,
and put too the ſpoyle, and euery man ſhall catch a portion of it too
himſelfe. Beſides this, they imagine that the Saints and Angels of
heauen are as patrones to them, and finally they haue infinit wayes
(to their owne ſeeming) wherby to come vnto God. But herevpon
we may well conclude, that the holy Ghoſt doth iuſtly auow them
to be backſliders, and to haue giuen ouer Ieſus Chriſt, and to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſtrangers to him. For they falſly abuſe his name. Ieſus Chriſt
is not variable,<note place="margin">1. Co. 1. d. 19</note> according as wee haue ſeene howe S. Paule in the
ſeconde to the Corinthians ſayd, that we ſhall not finde yea and nay
in him, but that he will continue alwayes at one ſtay. To be ſhort,
whatſoeuer the Papiſts bable concerning Chriſtianitie, is altogy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hypocriſie and leaſing, and they doo but falſifie the name of
Gods ſonne, and abuſe it wickedly. For they make a mumrie
of it, or rather an Idoll. Yee ſee then why Saint Paule blameth
the Galathians for beeing ſo caryed away. Nowe if a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
the reaſon howe: it was in that ſome woulde haue made
them to obſerue the ceremonies of the lawe as things neceſſarie:
and yet had God commaunded them. Yea verely, howbeeit that was
but with a temporall condition for the people of olde tyme, ſo as
they muſte of neceſsitie haue all ceaſſed at the comming of our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Foraſmuch therefore as the Galathians ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the olde figures and ſhadowes of the lawe, with the cleare light
of the Goſpell: Saint Paule being not able too ſuffer it, ſayth that
they were turned aſide from God, yea and vtterly falne away from
him. But there is yet a worſe thing than that: namely that the grace
<pb facs="tcp:23060:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was thereby diſanulled, bicauſe men doo
always beare themſelues in hand, that they deſerue and earne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
before God, to be in his fauour for their ſeruing of him:
and ſo when theſe deceiuers had brought in the ſaid error, that men
ought to kepe the old forworne figures: it was all one as if they had
threaped a meritorious ſeruice vpon God [whither hee woulde or
no.] But our ſaluation muſt bee of free gift, or elſe Ieſus Chriſt is
nothing woorth. I terme it ſaluation of free gift, bicauſe it is giuen
vs ſimplie of God, ſo as wee bring not any thing with vs [to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynment
thereof] but onely an eager deſire too be filled wyth
the thing that wee want. Therefore it ſtandeth vs on hande too
come as poore beggers vntoo God, if wee mynde too bee iuſtified
for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſtes ſake. For if wee imagine neuer ſo
ſmall a droppe of deſeruing in our ſelues, it ſtoppeth vs from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
too our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And not without cauſe dooth
an auncient Doctor ſay, that wee cannot receyue the Saluation
that is offered vs in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, except wee haue
firſt diſpatched the mynding of our owne deſertes, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that there is nothing but vtter wretchedneſſe in our ſelues.
Thus yee ſee why Sainct Paule had yet more iuſt reaſon too ſay,
that the Galathians were caryed away from Ieſus Chriſt and from
his father. But there was yet this clogge more: namely that they
were made too beleeue what other men lyſted, and thereby
brought in ſubiection too a ſlauiſhe bondage, too bee robbed of the
quietneſſe of conſcience which wee ought too haue in our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt. For beſydes that wee bee reconcyled by the ſacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fize
of hys death and paſsion, wee bee alſo ſet free from the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor
of the law, vnder the which wee were hilde in bondage. As for
example (according as we ſhall ſee more fully hereafter, for as nowe
I do but ouerrunne matters whereof we ſhall ſee a larger diſcourſe
afterwarde.)<note place="margin">Deut. 27. d. 26.</note> Ye know howe it is ſayde in the lawe, that whoſoeuer
performeth not al that God commaundeth to the vttermoſt point,
ſhall be accurſed. But it is impoſsible for vs to attaine too ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Therefore it ſtoode vs vpon too haue freedome purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for vs by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, that the Lorde might not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more holde vs vnder his yoke,<note place="margin">Act. 15. b. 10</note> whiche was intollerable as it is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23060:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſayde in the fifteenth of the Actes. Nowe wee ſee in effect why
Saint Paule blameth the Galathians for falling away lyke periured
perſons towardes God, and towardes our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, as
hauing gyuen him the ſlippe, and forſaken the fayth whiche they
had plighted vntoo him. And by this example wee bee warned to
holde vs to the pure doctrine and ſimplicitie of the Goſpell, wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wauering one way or other. For it is not ynough to haue the
name and title of Chriſtians, no nor yet to beare the marke of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme:
but we muſt continue ſtedfaſt in the doctrine of the Goſpell.
For (as I haue ſayd heretofore) our Lord Ieſus Chriſt cannot denie
himſelfe: and when we haue dreamed this and that of him, yet muſt
we bee fayne to knowe him for ſuch a one as he is giuen vs of God
his father. Nowe the Goſpell ſheweth wherefore he is come, what
his office is, the benefites that wee receyue by him, and what hys
power is towardes vs. And therefore if wee haue not the pure and
ſingle doctrine, wherein our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was manifeſted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs: ſurely wee haue nothing at all: and whenſoeuer wee haue
once bin inſtructed in it, wee muſt holde it ſtill too the laſt puſhe.
For if we ſwarue neuer ſo little from it, there will bee nothing but
vnfaythfulneſſe in vs. And in good ſooth it ſtandeth vs on hande
to bethinke vs of the horrible fall wherevnto we were tumbled
with others, when wee were plunged in ſo many errours, trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peryes,
and Illuſions of Satan, that Ieſus Chriſte was vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
too vs. Seeing that God hath nowe of his owne infinite
goodneſſe plucked vs out of ſuch a bottomleſſe gulfe: let vs ſettle
our ſelues too haue a conſtant and faſt fayth, that wee bee no more
ſhaken like Reedes with euery winde, but abyde faſt in the roote
of the Goſpell, grounded vppon the inuincible power of our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt. And againe, ſeeing that in him all Gods promiſes are
yea,<note place="margin">2. Co. 1. d. 20</note> and Amen, and haue their truth in him, ſo as they be performed
there: let our fayth alſo abyde ſtedfaſt there. This is it that wee
haue to remember in this ſaying of S. Paules. Furthermore to put
the Galathians to the greater ſhame, hee ſetteth before them their
calling by grace. Theſe woordes, <hi>from him that hath called you,</hi>
maye bee referred as well too Ieſus Chriſt, as too GOD the
Father: for there is no great difference in the matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But in the meane time we ſee in effect what Saint Paule ment too
ſay. Therefore hee caſteth the Galathians in the teeth with theyr
lewdneſſe, in that they had ſo much the leſſe excuſe of their ſhrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
aſide after that ſort, conſidering the goodneſſe that God had
ſhewed vpon them. For if God call vs, although it were too ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vs too our confuſion, yet ought wee too obey him, bycauſe we
bee his creatures. It becommeth vs to bee ſubiect too his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and howſoeuer hee diſpoſe of vs, it is alwayes our duetie too
ſay, beholde Lorde I am at thy pleaſure: ſo that too vſe any ſhrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away when God calleth vs, is an vtter peruerting of all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Much more when God not onely calleth vs vntoo him, but
alſo ſetteth all the treaſures of his goodneſſe before vs in our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, and ſheweth that hee ſeeketh nothing elſe but too
make vs his owne by gyuing himſelfe ſo wyllingly vntoo vs, when
God (I ſay) vſeth ſuch bountifulneſſe towardes vs as ought too
rauiſhe all our wittes vntoo woondering: muſte wee not needes
bee too too lazie if wee ſhrinke backe? Moreouer, if wee fortune
too wander too and fro after wee bee once come vntoo him, wee
ſhall haue ſo much the leſſe excuce, and feele the ſorer and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
condemnation, as I haue touched alreadie. Nowe then wee
ſee what is imported in thys ſaying where Saint Paule maketh
mention of the grace that the Galathians had bin called too. And
out of doubt wee in theſe dayes are muche more blame woorthie
than the fathers that liued vnder the lawe, if wee continue not in
the pure doctrine of the Goſpell, without turning aſyde from
the things that are conteyned therein. For albeeit that God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Fathers too ſaluation vnder the lawe as well [as vs now:]
yet was not that calling with ſo open and abundant vtteraunce of
the ryches of his mercie, as wee haue it in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.
Therefore let vs looke well about vs, and ſeeing hee hath alreadie
made vs too feele his grace: let the ſame ſtirre vs vp and inflame
vs too bee the bolder too haue an inuincible courage too continue
in the ſame calling, vntill wee bee come too the place wherevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
God allureth vs. So then, if wee compare our ſelues with the
great number of misbeleeuing and ignorant ſoules, it is certain that
our vnthankfulneſſe wilbe ſo much the greater, as Gods grace hath
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23060:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhewed it ſelfe larger and deepelier vnto vs. VVee ſhall ſee many
ſillie ſoules ſtraying heere and there, and yet ceaſſe they not for all
that too be ſubiect too damnation. For he that hath offended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
lawe,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. b. 12</note> ſhall periſh without Lawe. Now for aſmuch as God hath
declared his will ſo freendly vnto vs, and that togither with the vſe
of diſcretion wee haue alſo the doctrine of his Goſpell, which (as I
haue ſayd heretofore) ſerueth too ſhew vs that our damnation ſhall
be more horrible if wee labour not too dedicate ourſelues wholly
vnto him, by meanes whereof our bonde becommeth ſo muche the
ſtreighter: S. Paule addeth another circumſtance, whiche is that it
came too paſſe very haſtely. For certeſſe it was a horrible thing, that
the Galathians hauing bin taught by the holy Apoſtles own mouth,
ſhould bee ſo corrupted as long as he was alyue. Yee ſee then how
it was the more too their blame, that within three [or foure] dayes
after their receyuing of the Goſpell, they were fleeted away and
had mingled many falſe opinions with the truthe of God. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they had continued in the truthe ſome good whyle after
Paules deceaſe: yet dothe it not followe that their ſo doyng might
haue bin a ſufficient diſcharge for them, if they had fallen away af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.
For as the truth wherevppon our fayth reſteth is euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,
although bothe heauen and earth doo paſſe away: ſo muſt our
fayth hold out too the end, and not hang eyther vppon the lyfe or
vpon the death of any man,<note place="margin">Luke. 21. f. 33.</note> but haue hir ankerhold faſtened in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
Therfore if wee chaunge [at any tyme,] whither it bee to day
or too morrow, wee ſhall bee the more too blame, and our vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
ſhalbe ſo much the ſhamefuller. And truely the thing that
S. Paule ſetteth downe heere in the perſone of the Galathians, is
ſeene nowe adayes too much. For ſuch as haue gotten ſome ſmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of the Goſpell, will bee wearie of it within a twoo or three
yeares, if there come no new chaunge in the meane tyme. For they
haue itchyng eares, and wee ſee many fantaſticall perſones become
backeſliders: and bycauſe the truth of the Goſpell liketh them not,
they would alwayes be fleeting, &amp; haue I wote not what new ſtuffe
brougtht in, too feede them in their fond ſpeculations. VVe ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome
greeued, bycauſe they perceyue that the Goſpell aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageth
them not too the worldward: yea and there are ſome that
<pb facs="tcp:23060:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
turne away, bicauſe they ſee it is an occaſion too make them too be
perſecuted, and too purchace them many enemies, or elſe they
ſtarue (as they thinke) whyles other men proſper and fare well.
Thus yee ſee howe Ieſus Chriſte is forſaken of many, howbeit not
from the father too the ſonne, but by reaſon that ſuch as haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him a fayre countenance, are ſuddainely chaunged and fleete a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from him within a twoo or three yeares, or at leaſtwyze with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
halfe a ſcore yeares after. So muche the more then ought wee
too marke well this doctrine, bycauſe it is ſpoken too vs: and alſo
too thinke vppon the reproche which Ieremie layd vnto the Iewes.
Go your wayes intoo farre Countries (ſayeth he) runne beyond ſea,<note place="margin">Ierem. 2. c. 10.</note>
ſee what other people doo: euery man keepes him too his owne I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolles,
and yet there is no Godhead in them: Satan beguyles them
vnder colour of deuotion, and they be ſo ſettled in the ſame, as they
cannot by any meanes bee turned away from it. Now at leaſtwyze
bee you as conſtant as they, ſeyng that God hath ſhewed himſelfe
too you, and you know his will fully and certainly. Let vs beware
that the lyke bee not ſayd too vs now adayes: for wee ſee the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earneſtneſſe
of the Turkes [in their Religion]. And although the
Iewes bee no better than vncleane Dogges, yet are they ſtiffe ſtill
in maynteyning the authoritie of their Lawe. As for the Papiſtes,
they haue nothyng but dotages, ſo beaſtly as it is horrible too ſee:
euen children are able too iudge of them: and yet for all that, wee
ſee howe they burne with furious zeale too maynteyne their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries.
But as for vs, the Diuell doth no ſooner holde vp his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
but by and by wee gad after him: it ſhoulde ſeeme that euery
of vs watcheth too ſpie if there come any newe toy, and the leaſt
occaſion in the worlde will by and by ſhake vs and ſcare vs out of
our way: and thereof wee fee too many examples, euen here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
goyng any further. So much the more therefore doth it behoue
vs too marke the blame that is layd heere by the mouth of Sainct
Paule, agaynſt the vnconſtancie of ſuche as turne away from God,
ſpecially ſo ſoone after he had called them to the grace of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſte. And therevppon S. Paule ſayeth, that it is nothing
elſe but that there bee ſome among them which trouble them, and
would ouerthrowe the Goſpell of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte. Heere
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23060:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
S. Paule ſheweth, that what ſoeuer men bring beſides the Goſpell,
is euery whit of it but ſtarke ſmoke, and that in the end it will bee
perceyued that the Diuell did caſt gewgawes in their wayes, too
couzen ſillie fooles that could not reſt wholly vppon Gods truth.
<hi>It is none other thing</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>but that ſome trouble you.</hi> Truely
this woord <hi>Other</hi> importeth that it is nothing elſe or nothing at all.
Neuertheleſſe Sainct Paule declareth, that the Galathians may
well pretend, that they whiche came from Ieruſalem and from the
countrie of Iewrie, had tolde them that they ought not too ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the Lawe from the Goſpell. No, no, (ſayeth hee) there is no
more but one Ieſus Chriſte, nother is there any more than one do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that leadeth vs vntoo him, and holdeth vs in the faith, where
through wee obtayne ſaluation by his meanes. So then all ſuch as
intend too cleaue vntoo the pure knowledge of the Goſpell, and to
continue in the ſame, muſte not ſeeke any other perfection [than
that]: as for them that go any further, they be troublers that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
and diſorder all things. And this ſaying is well woorthie too
bee marked, too the ende wee may knowe that when our Lorde
hath done vs the grace too teache vs in his ſchoole, wee muſte no
more haue a wauering fayth too reele too and fro, but a reſolute
iudgement and determination too ſay, this is the thing wherein wee
muſt liue and die. But ye ſhall ſee many that will not ſpeake open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agaynſt the doctrine of the Goſpell, but will ſuffer the grace of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt too be preached. If a man aske them what it
is that they finde fault with: nothing, ſay they. But let an Altar bee
neuer ſo ſoone ſet vp, and puppets vpon it, and by and by they runne
to it, they muſt needes go heare Maſſe and ſee al the reſt of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
traſh, they care not which way the world go, and when all thoſe
diſorders are ſet afore them, they thinke not that there is any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
at all. But let vs marke that ſuch beaſtlineſſe bewrayeth that
there is no fayth in them. And why? For, the thing wherein we may
ſhewe, yea and (as in reſpect of our ſelues) feele, whither wee bee
faythfull, is too haue ſuche skill of the Goſpell, as to conclude that
it is Gods infallible truthe, and that it cannot leade vs amiſſe if
wee followe it. Contrarywize the Papiſtes haue deuized an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate
fayth (as they terme it) and that is ynough for them: and
<pb facs="tcp:23060:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
although the wretched ſoules wote not what they meane them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
yet notwithſtanding, beholde (ſay they) I referre my ſelfe
too our mother the holy Churche, I beleeue as ſhee beleeueth. But
ſuch folke ſhewe openly, that they haue no fayth at all, ne knowe by
what meanes too bee ſaued. Neuertheleſſe it is ſayd that wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
rightuouſneſſe and ſaluation by fayth, namely for that wee
imbrace Chriſt as the partie by whom all good things are imparted
vnto vs. Then if our Lord Ieſus Chriſt bee vnknowen, it is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
fayth, but a groſſe Illuſion of Satan, who hath bewitched the
Popiſh doctors too ſpeake after that ſorte: and thereby we ſee that
they haue no knowledge of God, but are vtterly giuen ouer too a
lewd minde. VVherefore let vs marke well, that whereas S. Paule
ſayeth heere, that there is none other Goſpell: it is too hold vs ſtill
in ſuch ſtedfaſtneſſe, that after we haue once learned what our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt is, wee may continue in him, and vtterly giue ouer all
things that are contrarie too the doctrine of the Goſpell. Haue wee
once ſuch skill, it will ſerue vs too fight agaynſt Satan and all the
diuerſitie of opinions that are at this day in the worlde, ſo as wee
ſhall not bee ſhaken downe what trouble ſoeuer happen, nor finally
bee turned aſide from the certaintie of our fayth. But if wee wauer
after ſuch a ſorte that wee become like little children, who if one
man offer them an apple at one ſide they runne thither, and if an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
man offer ſome other pleaſant thing atother ſide they runne
thither likewize, and leauing the firſt go too yeeld themſelues too
the ſecond. I ſay if wee bee ſo fickle minded, it is a token that there
is nothing but mere vnbeleefe in vs. Then let vs aſſure our ſelues,
that there muſt bee ſuch a mutuall agreement betweene our fayth
and the Goſpell, that wee muſt giue our ſelues wholly therevnto,
and neuer bee plucked from it, and our knowing of the things that
are conteyned in it, muſte bee too reſt our ſelues vppon them, as I
haue ſayd already heretofore. Not that all men can bee teachers a
like (for it is very certayne that the moſt parte of thoſe whom our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath in his flocke, comprehend not the tenth part
of the vnderſtanding of the holy Scripture) but that how ſoeuer the
world go, it behoueth vs all to be grounded in theſe poynts, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that there is but one God the father, of whom we haue al things,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23060:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and who hath adopted vs of his owne mere mercie: That there is
but one onely Ieſus Chriſte, by whoſe meanes wee be made part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of all good things: And that wee bee begotten new agayne
by the holy Ghoſt: And as touchyng our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs on hand too bee well aſſured that he is our aduocate, and
that without him wee cannot come vnto God, nor durſt once open
our mouthes to call him our father, ſaue in reſpect that we be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and that he beareth woorde for vs as
our ſpokeſman and patron, guyding vs as it were by the hand, too
bring vs vnto God his father. If wee knowe not theſe things, it is
certayne that wee can obtayne no Saluation. And that is the cauſe
why S. Paule blameth the Galathians, for that they conſidered not
that there is but one onely Goſpell, whiche could not bee altered
without doyng of wrong too our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, who all onely
ought too haue all audience. Therewithall alſo he warneth vs, that
when ſoeuer there come any buſie bodies to turne vs from the pure
ſimplicitie which wee ought too hold vs too concernyng God and
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: wee ought too holde them accurſed. For (as
ſhall bee ſayd more fully hereafter) they ouerthrow the Goſpell of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And it is a right horrible thing, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
which is the foundacion of our fayth and the key too open vs
the gate of Paradice, ſhould bee ouerthrowen. For that is all our
welfare, that is the kingdome of God from whence we (after a ſort)
are baniſhed: and wee can by no meanes come vntoo him, vntill he
haue made vs way by meanes of his Goſpell, to the end wee may be
his people and he our king, and wee bee guided and gouerned by his
authoritie. Yee ſee then that the ineſtimable benefites whiche are
comprehended in the Goſpell, are theſe: namely that men are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
vnto God: that the gate of Paradice is opened vntoo vs:
and that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is giuen vs for our heritage, ſo as we
bee made pattakers of all the benefites that he hath powred vpon
vs, and that he hath warranted our endleſſe Saluation. Now, were it
not better that the whole world ſhould ſinke and periſh, than that
all this ſhould bee ouerthrowen? That therfore is the cauſe why S.
Paule telleth vs, that all ſuch as come too ſet troubles after we haue
bin faithfully taught, and that all ſuch as bring in any curioſities or
<pb facs="tcp:23060:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
foyſt in this or that of their owne brayne, do turne men away from
the kingdome of God and from his royall ſeate, too the intent that
they ſhould not any more be gouerned by him, nor the Scepter of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt be any more lifted vp among them too their
ſaluation. Nowe if wee ſet ſo much ſtore by Gods honour as wee
ought to do, or eſteeme it a precious thing too bee parttakers of all
heauenly benefites, or if wee make account of our owne welfare:
ought not euery of vs too ſhunne thoſe troublers, and too caſt them
out as deadly plagues of the world, when they come among vs and
fall too aboliſhing of the whole Maieſtie of God, and of the grace of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and conſequently of our ſaluation alſo? Thus
yee ſee in effect, that the thing which wee haue too marke heere, is
that wee muſt ſticke with ſo earneſt a minde to the Goſpell, as wee
may not ſuffer our ſelues too bee thruſt out of the way by any
meanes, nor abide that any man ſhould trouble our wits, by bringing
in any new thing more than was afore. Although the men bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo skilfull, ſuttle, ſharpwitted and eloquent: yet let vs ſhake it
off euery wit as accurſed, if it go about to turne vs from the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Goſpell. That is the thing whiche Sainct Paule tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs heere. And when he hath ſpoken ſo, he addeth, <hi>that if he
himſelfe, or an Angell came too preach any other Goſpell than that which
the Galathians had heard and vnderstoode, they ſhoulde ſhake them off,</hi>
hold them as accurſed, excommunicate them, and take them too be
as Diuelles. Heere wee ſee that S. Paule is (as yee would ſay) whote
to mayntayne the ſtedfaſtneſſe of the fayth, to the intent we ſhould
not by any meanes bee ſhaken from it, and that is not without cauſe.
For we ſee what frayltie is in vs, and not only frayltie but alſo fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and rebelliouſneſſe, which are yet woorſe. At the firſt bluſh, if
a man teach vs Gods woord, and that wee be not touched with it in
good earneſt:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. d. 14.</note> we will thinke it the ſtraungeſt thing in the worlde:
for the doctrine will alwayes ſeeme fooliſh too mannes wit, as wee
haue ſeene heretofore. And what is the reaſon? Euen our fondneſſe,
bycauſe our wittes are wandering and rouing, and wee bee natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
bent and foreward too leaſing, and deſire (as it were wilfully)
too bee beguyled. Now then ſeyng that our wittes are ſo marred, it
is no maruell though wee lyke not the woord of God, or though it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23060:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
haue no enterance intoo vs, for all our luſtineſſe is but rebelliouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and whereas we thinke our ſelues to haue reaſon, we be ſtark
blind: and to be ſhort it is not for nought that the ſcripture ſayeth,
that men are nothing but vanitie and leaſing, yea and rebelles too
God, ſo as they draw alwayes backe from that wherevnto God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them. But put the cace that God had done ſo much for vs as
too draw vs too him, and to make vs taſte that his truth is the thing
wherevnto it behoueth vs too hold our ſelues, and that we were ſo
tamed that there were no more wilfulneſſe in vs, but that wee were
ready to yeeld him all obedience: yet is there ſuch a fraylneſſe and
vnconſtancie in vs, that the Diuell ſhall eaſily thruſt vs out of the
way euery minute of an howre. And hereof wee ſee experience e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in thoſe that had bin as mirrours of holineſſe, ſo as yee would
wonder to ſee them ſodainly chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged and gone from the right way.
And what is the cauſe of it? As I ſayd afore, although we be in a good
forewardneſſe, yet can we not hold our owne long, but that we ſhall
by and by go cleane awrie, except God worke in vs and amend our
frayltie. Thus ye ſee why S. Paule doth with ſuch maieſtie maintaine
the doctrine of the Goſpell and the occaſion therof was giuen him
by the Galathians, for they were thruſt out of the way, by reazon
that they were borne in hand, that it behoued them too keepe the
ceremonies of the lawe. S. Paule therefore beholding ſuche an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
and image of mens infirmitie and ouer great lightneſſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that the beleefe of the Goſpell muſt ſurmount all that wee can
conceyue, and that wee muſt not bee remoued from it, nother by
the knowledge, nor by the great cunning, nor by the eloquence of
men, in ſomuch that euen though the Angelles of heauen ſhoulde
deale with vs in that cace, wee ſhoulde take them too bee but
Diuelles. But howe ſoeuer the cace ſtandeth, this were verie
ſtraunge. VVhat? The Angelles of heauen? And agayne, what
is it that Sainct Paule ſpeaketh of? His owne preachyng. Hee
fayeth not ſingly the Goſpell of Chriſte, but the Goſpell which I
haue preached vnto you. And ought that too haue preheminence
aboue all the Angelles of heauen? Firſt and formeſt we ſee, that it
is too no purpoſe too magnifie the doctrine of the Goſpell in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
and vndiſtinct termes: but wee muſte alſo therewithall bee
<pb facs="tcp:23060:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſure which is the ſame doctrine. To be ſhort, there are many among
vs that can well ynough mocke at the fondneſſe of the Papiſts: but
if a man poze the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the principles which euen yong children ought
too know perfectly, they can no skill of them: and ſo that one of
them bee talking of one man and another of an other, all is one too
them, they haue no diſcretion, they make ſuch a hotchpotch of the
matter, as if a man ſhould iumble ſalt and water and muſtarde and
verie wee all togither. Yee ſee then that they can well ynough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
in generall termes that the Goſpell ought too bee preached,
but in the meane whyle they know not what the Goſpell is. Nowe
too correct ſuch faults, S. Paule ſayeth <hi>Namely the Gospell that I haue
preached vnto you.</hi> And hereby (as I ſayd) he ſheweth vs that wee
ought too know, what ſubſtance is contayned in the doctrine that
is ſet foorth vnto vs in the name of God, to the intent that our faith
may bee fully ſetled vpon it, ſo as wee may not bee fickle minded to
bee toſſed with euery winde, nor go at all aduenture too alter our
purpoſe an hundred times a day, but that wee may ſtand out too the
end. This is in effect the thing that wee haue too beare in minde.
But by the way, it ought too make Paules doctrine of the more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
that he ſpeaketh ſo boldly in the mayntenance of it, and
that not through humane raſhneſſe and preſumption, but in the
name of God. For in very deede he ſtandeth not heere vppon the
prayſing of himſelfe in his owne perſone: and that doth he ſhewe
right well in that he ſayeth, <hi>If I my ſelf.</hi> He ſetteth himſelf formoſt,
as if he had ſayd, Let mee, euen mee my ſelfe I ſay bee taken for a
Diuell, if I chaunge the doctrine, or if you finde me to haue ſwarued
in any maner of wize. Heere S. Paule ſheweth that he ment not too
purchace reputation too himſelfe, ne fought in his owne quarell, to
haue it ſayd of him that he was a fineheaded fellow, or a wyze and
excellent man: no, but he raungeth himſelf in aray with the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and ſayeth, let vs all imbrace the doctrine of that Mayſter too
whoſe charge God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vs, and vnto whoſe gouerment
we ought too bee ſubmitted. For although I bee he that taught you
the doctrine: yet is it not mine, but Gods who is vnchaungeable:
and although yee ſhould ſee me chaunge, yet bee not you remoued
nor abaſhed for it, but eſteeme mee as a Diuell, hold mee accurſed,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23060:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and for your own partes continue you ſtil ſettled in the truth which
you haue learned, and as for mee, curſe you mee, and ban you mee,
yea and the very Angelles of heauen too, rather than too chaunge
any whit of the truthe of Gods Sonne, or too turne aſide from it.
Heere wee ſee well ynough, that S. Paule ſought not aught elſe, but
that Gods truth might haue ſuch reuerence among men as it deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
and bee ſo receyued, as all our wittes, all our thoughts, all our
luſtes, and all our affections might bee ſubdued and hilde pryſoners
vnder it, and that it might not be lawfull for any liuyng creature to
chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge aught therof, but that God only might ſpeake by the mouth
of his only Sonne, and we hold him for our Mayſter, yea and euery
of vs obey him without gaynſaying. That is the thing which S. Paule
ſought. How beit for aſmuch as wee cannot now lay forth the reſt,
it ſhall bee reſerued till the next Sunday if it pleaſe God.</p>
            <p>Now let vs fall down before the Maieſtie of our good God, with
acknowledgement of our faults, praying him too make vs perceiue
them more and more, and that the feeling of them may draw vs too
right repentance, and cauſe vs too growe and increace in fayth, ſo as
wee may bee true ſacrifizes too him: that like as our Lord Ieſus of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
himſelf for our redemption, ſo wee alſo may bethinke vs too
dedicate our ſelues wholly vnto him, and be guyded by him in ſuch
ſtedfaſtneſſe, that nother in lyfe nor death wee may not ſeeke any
other contentation and reſt, than too apply our ſelues too his good
will, nor glorie in any other thing than in the Saluation that is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaced
for vs in him. That it may pleaſe him too graunt this grace,
not only to vs but alſo too all people and nations of the earth, &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee haue ſeene heretofore that we muſt be ſure
of the truth of the Goſpell, or elſe our fayth is
no fayth but rather an opinion, if we be ready to
ſtagger too and fro. Now then the very proofe
which we ought to make of our fayth, is to bee
fully ſetled and reſolued in our ſelues that God
hath taught vs, and that he hath ſo vttered his
will vnto vs, that if we ſwarue from it one way or other, it is all one
as if wee did wilfully caſt our ſelues away. And for this cauſe wee
muſt not only receyue Gods woord as good &amp; holy: but alſo beare
ſuch honour too it, as to hate whatſoeuer is agaynſt it, yea or which
agreeth not fully with it. For when as S. Paule ſpeaketh heere of an
other Goſpell: his meanyng is, that if men diſguyze the pure ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie
which they haue learned of him, there remayneth nothing
elſe but vntruth and corruption. VVherfore let vs learne to ſet ſuch
ſtore by Gods doctrine, that wee may not only eſteeme it in it ſelf,
but alſo reiect as diueliſh things, what ſoeuer ſhall be brought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
or repugnant vntoo it. And truly Sainct Paule thinkes it not
ynough too ſpeake of men, but mounteth euen vntoo the Angelles
of Heauen, and ſayeth that wee muſte rather hold them accurſed,
than alter any whit of the fayth which wee haue of the Goſpell. He
dothe well too ſpeake of himſelf firſt: and he doeth that, too ſhewe
that he had no regard of his owne perſone, but that he ment ſimply
too honour God, and too cauſe his woord to bee receyued of all the
worlde without gaynſaying. Therefore it was needefull that Sainct
Paule ſhould vſe that proteſtation: for if any man exempt his owne
doctrine by priuiledge, he maketh the ſame a priuate cace. But he
that teacheth, ought too raunge himſelfe in the common aray and
too ſubmitte himſelf obediently too the Goſpell of our Lord Ieſus
Chriſte, ſo as wee may not haue any other Mayſter in this worlde
of whom too hold our fayth, but that the Sonne of God may haue
all ſoueraintie ouer vs as belongeth vntoo him. And Sainct Paule
ſpeaketh purpoſely of the Angelles, bycauſe the falſe Apoſtles and
deceyuers that were come intoo the countrie of Galatia, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the name of Peter, Iohn, and Iames: and therefore he ſetteth a
barre in their way, ſaying that when they had all that could bee on
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23060:46"/>
theyr ſide, yea and that the whole world tooke parte with them, all
that was nothing. Moreouer though they had the very Angelles of
heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with them, yet ſhould God neuertheleſſe ouer rule the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his
word, &amp; all creatures be thruſt downe. For if any thing lift vp it ſelf
againſt Gods truth, wherin his image ſhineth forth and his maieſtie
and glorie ought to be knowen: the ſame ought alſo to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
&amp; to be hild as accurſed. It might perchaunce ſeeme at the firſt
bluſh, that S. Paule vſed an exceſsiue faſhion. For too what purpoſe
bringeth he in the Angels, ſeyng wee know how they be wholly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
too do Gods will?<note place="margin">Pſalm. 103. d. 20.</note> According as it is ſayde expreſly in the. 103.
Pſalme, and as we ſee moreouer through the whole holy Scripture,
that they haue not any other regard, than ſimply to obey God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then that it is impoſsible that the Angelles ſhoulde falſifie the
pure truthe: Sainct Paule ſhoulde not haue brought them in. Yea
it might bee thought that he dooth them wrong and iniurie, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that God hath giuen them the grace too abyde in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and too walke quietly as he hath appoynted them. But it is
not without cauſe that Sainct Paule ſpeaketh ſo, for aſmuch as the
Diuell doth alwayes indeuer too bring the things that may bee well
liked of, to ouerthrowe the pure doctrine withall. And wee ſee, how
that euen Gods name hath at all times bin pretended by deceyuers,
and although they brought nothing but illuſions and mockeries, yet
not withſtanding they proteſted with ful mouth, that they were ſent
of God. By reaſon wherof, the Prophets had much ado in fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
ſuch as labored to abuſe the worlde vnder ſuche couert, [in ſo
much that] they were faine too come to the triall, to know whither
God ſpake by their mouth or no. And wee knowe alſo how Sainct
Peter ſayeth,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2. a. 1</note> that like as among the people of olde time there were
many deceyuers whiche troubled the Churche and brought all
things in a broyle: ſo wee alſo in theſe dayes muſte looke too
haue vnderlinges of Satans, whiche ſhall labour too ſowe darnell
among vs, and the Churche muſte ſtill bee ſubiect too the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience,
bycauſe God intendeth too bewray and trie whither
wee bee his in truthe or no. For the Hypocrites will ſoone bee
ſhaken downe, when they find occaſion to chaunge. They be ſo light
headed and fleeting, that they muſt needes be trotting too and fro.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But Gods children which haue taken liuely and deepe roote in the
Goſpell, will neuer be remoued. And therefore doth God alſo giue
bridle to Satan, who rayzeth vp falſe Prophetes as it is ſayd in the
thirtenth chapter of Deuteronomie,<note place="margin">Deut. 13. a. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> bycauſe God intendeth too
know by experience, whither wee loue him or no, that is too ſay,
whither we beare him the honour that he deſerueth, by reſting vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him, yea and by reſting vpon him with a true and vnchaungeable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie.
Nowe ſeing that the Deuill hath in ſuch wiſe troubled the
Church, and ſo ſowen his errours as he hath taken couert vnder the
name of God: it behoueth for the mayntayning of that point &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
that Gods woord abide in his full and perfect ſtate. For when
the Paynims worſhipped their Idols, they alwayes abuſed the name
of God, and all that they did was Religion as they termed it, and (to
theyr owne ſeeming) there was none other holineſſe in the worlde,
but the following of their fond deuices. But contrarywiſe the holy
Scripture telleth vs, that all their Gods were but Diuels. And what
agreement is there betwene thoſe two ſayings? Yea, but for aſmuch
as the thing that the Heathen men tooke in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, was but a masking
to vnhalow the name of God, and to conuey it ouer to their Idolles:
therfore it is requiſite that that fond opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be cut of. And we
ſee at this day how the Pope &amp; all the filthie puddle of his Clergie,
do beare vs in hand that they be Chriſtes vicares, &amp; that they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the Church, and are the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles. Al this geere
muſt be beaten downe, or elſe wee ſhall neuer know what fayth we
ought to ſticke vnto. Ye ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after what maner S. Paule alledgeth
here the Angels. As if he ſhould ſay, what ſoeuer authoritie of men
be alledged, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not in any wiſe preiudice God or his word. For his
woord muſt haue the vpper hand, and all high &amp; excellent things in
this world muſt ſtoupe &amp; be brought low: and not only the mortall
creatures, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Angels alſo, in ſomuch that if it could come to
paſſe (which thing is vnpoſsible) that an Angell ſhould ſet himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, he ought to be abhorred. And let vs not thinke that the
Angels are wronged herein. For what is all their glorie and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
It is too do ſeruis to their Maker, and to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
who is their head as well as ours. So then, if a man make bold with
theyr name too the end that Ieſus Chriſte bee glorified, and that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23060:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Goſpell may abyde in perfect ſoundneſſe vnappayred: therein
the Angelles are willing too yeelde, ſo their name ſerue to ſuch vſe,
for that is their cheefe deſire. Thus yee ſee why Sainct Paule ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
bold with the name of the Angelles, although he meene not
that they can at any time ſhrinke from their obedience vnto God.
And he repeteth the ſame ſentence agayne, ſaying, <hi>that who ſoeuer
ſhall bring any new Gospell, let him bee bilde as accurſed.</hi> Nowe firſte of
all wee ſee heere, how God intendeth too bee honored and ſerued
at our handes: namely not with ſtraunge Ceremonies and faſhions
as men are woont too doo: but our cheefe ſeruis is to herken vnto
him, and as ye would ſay to brydle our ſelues, holding all our ſenſes
priſoners vnder his woord when he ſpeaketh vnto vs, according alſo
as he himſelf proteſteth in his prophet Ieremie.<note place="margin">Ierem. 7. c. 22.</note> Haue I (ſayth he) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
Sacrifize of thy fathers? No, but the thing that I required
of them, and which I ſtill require of you as the homage that you owe
vnto me, is that you herken to my voyce. In that text God ſheweth,
that men may well ouerlabour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in bringing their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions
to him vpon hope to pleaſe him thereby, but all ſhall be but
filthineſſe, till wee haue learned to herken to his voyce, and to obey
him. Marke wel this poynt which is very notable, leaſt we labour in
vayne as we ſee the wretched Papiſts doo. For it hath alwayes bin a
common diſeaſe in the world, that men knowing wel that they were
created to ſerue God, haue torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues &amp; taken much paine
[to do it,] &amp; yet all hath bin vayne &amp; vnauaylable, bicauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
not at the right poynt of ruling their life by the will of God, and
of ſetling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues fully to take nothing in hand but that whiche he
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded them. Yee ſee then that the meanes too haue our ſeruis
acceptable vnto God at this day, is too giue eare vnto him, too ſuffer
ourſelues to be taught by his word, to be gouerned altogither ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and to frame our life with al our deedes &amp; thoughts fully accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ſame. And herein we ſee the benefite that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs in calling vs to the knowledge of his Goſpell. On the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
we ſee (as I ſayd afore) how the poore Papiſtes ryſe early, &amp; bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues about this &amp; that, without end or ceaſsing of their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels:
&amp; yet in the meane while, not only the time is loſt, &amp; their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
is vaine &amp; vnprofitable, but alſo they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues are abhominable
<pb facs="tcp:23060:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before God. Then ſeying the cace ſtandeth ſo: let vs make account
of the grace that God hath grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vs in declaring his will vnto vs,
&amp; let vs vnderſtand that wee muſt not walke at aduenture, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
betweene good and euill, howbeit not after our owne wit and
imaginacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but by goyng to Gods ſchoole, &amp; by learning the things
that he alloweth, aſſuring our ſelues that nothing deſerueth too bee
eſteemed, ſaue the framing of our ſelues to the rule which he hath
giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs by his word. Marke that for a principle. And herewithall we
ſee alſo what the maieſtie of the Goſpell is, &amp; that it is not for vs to
bring in mens opinions in that cace to wrap our ſelues in any doubt
as the Papiſts do now adayes, who haue none other buckler agaynſt
vs, but the traditions of the Church, Councels, and Antiquitie. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
when they haue thronged all the world togither, will it bee able
to counteruayle the Angelles of heauen? No certainly. Now then
we may well mocke at their fooliſhneſſe after the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of S. Paule,
and ſay that if the Pope and all the rable of his ſtinking Clergie had
the Angelles on their ſide, it were nothing at all in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who hath all ſoueraine power, and before whom
all knees ought to bow, not only of mortall creatures, but alſo euen
of things that are aloft in heauen, according as it is ſaid in the Epiſtle
to the Philippians,<note place="margin">Phil 2. b. 10 &amp; Eſa. 45. d. 23.</note> where this ſaying is applyed to his perſon, in that
God ſweareth that al knees ſhall bow before him, &amp; all tunges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that he only is to be glorified. Yee ſee then that the way for vs
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the doctrine of the Goſpel, is to abide vnremoued by the
authoritie of men, &amp; (when it is told vs that ſuch a one is of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
or that,) to aſſure our ſelues that ſeyng God hath giuen vs the
grace to be fully reſolued in our minds, it behoueth vs to hold vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to it without chaunging. This is in effect the thing that wee
haue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider in this ſentence: Now herevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. Paule ſheweth, how
it was not without cauſe that he ſpeke ſo of his Goſpell that he had
preached. For he ſayeth <hi>that he teacheth not after the maner of men, or
that he doth not ſet forth men, nor counſell [them] after the maner of men,
but that he ſetteth forth God, and ſeeketh not to pleaſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
Afterward he addeth, that his Goſpell is not of men, but that it was
reueled to him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue, as I haue declared already. It had not bin
ynough for S. Paule to haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Goſpell in generall, except
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23060:48"/>
he had ſhewed therewith, that he had bin a true &amp; faithfull miniſter
of it. For the Diuell ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well ynough away, that the name of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
ſhould be of very great eſtimacion among vs: but in the meane
while he would not haue vs to know what it meaneth, nor ceaſſe to
be inta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled in ſtore of errours, &amp; to haue our wittes rouing here &amp;
there. Then it is not ynough, that the name of the Goſpell be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the world: but we muſt alſo know what maner of thing the
Goſpell is, and what is contayned in it. And that is the cauſe why S.
Paule chalendgeth that faithfulneſſe of teaching the Goſpell, in ſo
much that if any whit of it be chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, let the ſame be accurſed. And
this yet againe is well woorthy to be noted. For when the Papiſtes
reade this place, they do nothing but skoffe at it: and God alſo hath
dulled them, ſo as there is leſſe wit in them, than in little chyldren.
For they vnderſtand it [thus: namely] that Paule ment, that if a
man ſhould make another Goſpel, as if a man ſhould write a booke,
and the ſame ſhoulde not bee the Goſpell that was written by him,
then they ſhoulde vtterly reiect it, bycauſe the Goſpell was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
proued already. But in the meane whyle they thought not
that all that was contayned in Paules Epiſtles was euery whit of it
Goſpell: but they rather ſurmyzed, that he had written ſome ſtorie
of the Goſpell, and that if any other had bin brought in vppon the
refuzall thereof, the ſame that had bin ſo brought in, ſhould haue
had no credite nor reputation. But wee ſee that in that cace theſe
wretched beaſtes haue nother reaſon nor vnderſtanding, nor any
taſte at all. So much the more therefore dothe it ſtande vs in hand
too marke, that S. Paule had good cauſe too ſpeake of the Goſpell
which he had preached, euen to ſhewe as it were with his fingar the
doctrine which it behoueth vs to be fully perſwaded of. VVill we be
of the flocke of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt? Then is it not ynough for vs
too accept what ſoeuer is tolde vs in his name: but wee muſte put
that thing in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re which is ſpoken in the tenth of Sainct Iohn,<note place="margin">Iohn. 10. a. 5</note> which
is, too bee able by herkening vnto his voyce, too diſcerne his voyce
from the voyce of ſtraungers, and too bee alwayes fully perſwaded,
that there is not any other than he, too whom wee ought too yeeld.
Thus ye ſee how the way to be vnder the guiding of our good ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
is that we ſwarue not one way nor other when men aſſayle vs,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but euery of vs indeuer to drawe home to himſelf, ſo as we become
not like wauering reedes, but ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſtedfaſt in the doctrine which we
ſhall haue learned. In ſo doing our Lord Ieſus Chriſt will auow vs to
be of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie and number of his ſheepe, and alwayes do the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of a ſhepeherd towards vs. But if we play thoſe men which care
not which end go foreward, in ſomuch that if a man tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt is the only he vpon whom we muſt reſt to haue any truſt
of Saluation: it is well, they can like well ynough of that doctrine:
and on the contrary part if a man ſet ſtore of trumperie before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and go about too trouble their wittes with this and that, [they can
well ynough away with that too] and all is one to them: if there be
no diſcretion in vs, it is a token that we haue no certaintie of fayth.
For we muſt be out of all doubt, that Ieſus Chriſt is the only May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
ſeyng that that charge is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to him by God his father, and
alſo that he hath fully performed the ſame. If wee bee not at that
poynt, it is certaine that wee ſhall alwayes bee caried away with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
and imaginacion, and that there ſhall be no fayth at all in vs.
And that is the cauſe alſo why S. Paule declareth, that the Goſpell
which he had preached, is the ſame which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
to be preached and publiſhed, and wherof he is the author
in the name of God his father. Seing it is ſo: it behoueth vs to hold
vs to it: and ſo conſequently when S. Paule ſpeaketh of another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
he meaneth the minglemangle and corruption that might bee
put vnto it: as if he ſhould ſay, VVhatſoeuer is added or patched to
the doctrine of the Goſpell by mans deuice, ſo as they can not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themſelues with the ſimpleneſſe therof, but that they do varie
from it: is euery whit of it mere leaſing. And therfore let vs ſhun it
as a poyſon, for ſurely no poyſon can bee ſo deadly as a falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And if men doo naturally keepe themſelues from the things
that may hurt this tranſitorie life: ought not our ſoules to be much
more precious too vs? VVhat care ought wee to haue that they be
not poyſoned by any trumperie of men? Too bee ſhort, lette vs bee
ſure that as ſoone as any by matter is added too the pure doctrine of
our lord Ieſus Chriſte, it is playne falſehod. For he will not onely
hee hilde as principall, but he muſte continue alone without any
companion, and all thoſe that teach, muſt firſt become his ſcholers,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23060:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo as he that ſpeaketh in the Church ſet not downe any thing of his
own, or which hath bin coyned in the warehouſes of men, but ſhew
himſelfe to be the true diſciple of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and teach
vs all by the authoritie of him. Marke that for one poynt. And for a
ſeconde, it behoueth vs to knowe what is conteyned in the Goſpell.
For if the woorde Goſpell ſhoulde trotte vp and downe in euerie
mans mouth, and yet in the meane while men make vs beleue that
Chalke is Cheeſe, as they ſay: what a thing were that? VVhat
ſhoulde wee bee the better for giuing ſo honourable report too the
Goſpell, as to ſay it is Gods pure truth, wherevntoo all creatures
ought to ſubmit themſelues? It ſtandeth vs on hande too knowe
what is the ſubſtance of it, ſo as wee may bee ſure that the ſonne of
God is come downe hither to guide vs vntoo God his father, too
the ende wee may vnderſtande after what manner hee will bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
at our handes, and furthermore bee made priuie too Gods
will, that wee may frame our whole life thereafter, and not inuent
a ſeruice after our owne luſt and lyking, but yeelde him that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which he requireth and alloweth aboue all things. Againe, wee
muſt [learne too] knowe howe miſerable our ſtate is, if wee intend
to ſeeke our ſaluation in our ſelues. For there is nothing in vs but
ignorance, infirmitie, weakeneſſe, yea and ſtubborneſſe and wicked
luſtes: and to be ſhort, we bee hilde in Satans bandes, ſo as he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vs like ſillie beaſtes, euen as Aſſes and Oxen that are ſolde: and
if we intende to be ſet free from ſo horrible bondage, and tyrannie,
we muſt go too none but God, aſſuring our ſelues that hee is the
fountaine of all welfare. Furthermore foraſmuch as wee cannot
come vntoo God, but we muſt firſt come to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,
who is come downe vnto vs: ſo as wee muſt ſeeke all that we haue
neede of in his fulneſſe, and repoſe our whole truſt there, and not
haue any other preparation, righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, or perfection
than him, but be vtterly emptied in our ſelues, and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
not ceaſſe too truſt that hee will leade vs too God his father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
VVe muſt alſo vnderſtande by what meanes we bee iuſtifyed, that
is to wit, by the ſacrifice of his death and paſsion. Beſides this, when
we come to pray vnt God, let vs reſort vnto him as our Aduocate,
that he may beare worde for vs. Ye ſee then that the thing which we
<pb facs="tcp:23060:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ought too knowe concerning the Goſpell, is that there is but one
onely lawe whereby to rule our lyues: that we muſt haue but one
certaine beleefe, ſo as wee knowe the God whom we ſhould ſerue
and worſhip: that we behold him in the perſon of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt who is his verie Image: that we muſt haue none other thing
to reſt vpon than Ieſus Chriſt: and that all our thoughts muſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
thither, aſſuring our ſelues that in him the father hath put all
things requiſit for our faluation, and that he alſo doth by the power
of his holy ſpirit, guide and gouerne vs, in ſuch wiſe, that being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his protection, we be ſure that the Diuell and all his champions
can do nothing againſt vs, when we bee ſo preſerued by his power.
This is the contempt of the Goſpell, which it behoueth vs to know,
or elſe the things that are ſpoken here wil do vs no good at al. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
S. Paule, to ſhew that he doth not without cauſe preferre
himſelf before thoſe that went about to diſguiſe the doctrine of the
Goſpel, by thruſting in ſome minglings and additions: vſeth two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
The one is, that he had behaued himſelfe faithfully &amp; with
a pure and right meening mind in teaching the Galathians and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The other is that he had not ſet forth any thing of his own
head, but had receiued his matters by heauenly reuelation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Now it behoueth vs to mark wel theſe two argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to the end we may perceyue, that S. Paule hath not without
cauſe declared heretofore, that this doctrine of his ought too bee of
good credit, &amp; that it was not lawful for any liuing creatur to ſtriue
againſt it. Hervpon wee may gather a generall rule, how wee ought
to be ſure of our faith. For the Angels ſhal not come down to ſpeak
to vs after a viſible maner, but we muſt be taught by the mouthes of
men. And yet for all that, (as I haue ſayd already) we muſt holde this
for an infallible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion, that we haue the doctrine whervpon our
fayth is grounded and ſetled, from God and from our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt. And how ſhal we perceiue that? By the two reaſons that are
ſet downe here. VVherof the one is, that ſuch as teach vs haue a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
and zeale to bring vs vnto god, and arme not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with the
title &amp; name of men, no nor hauè any thing at all of man, but folow
the trace which God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded all his to kepe, that is to wit,
that they win the world vnto the obedience of him. Let that ſerue
for one point. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, beſides their good zeale, they muſt alſo haue
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23060:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a certeintie [of doctrine] ſo as hee that ſpeaketh may not take any
thing vpon him, nor paſſe his bounds, but from hand to hand deliuer
the thing that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded him, in ſuch wiſe as Ieſus Chriſt may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be heard, &amp; ſuffered to ſpeak, and al mouthes elſe be ſtopped,
ſauing only in way of hearkning, that his doctrine may bee knowne
vnto vs. Now as touching the firſt, wher S. Paul proteſteth his good
mind: he ſaith <hi>that he doth not cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel</hi> [or perſuade] <hi>according to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but
according to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And hereby he meneth, that he went not to worke
with a worldly affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but had labored to apply himſelf ſimply vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, ſeing he had bin called by him: &amp; alſo that he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus
Chriſt for his maſter, ſo as he laide not forth any thing but him, nor
toke any backfence of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as thoſe do which would allure ſimple &amp;
ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t folk vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who hunt for credit here &amp; there, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ho,
ſuch a man ſaith ſo. But it is only God that is to be hearkned vnto.
For though al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with one accord would turne vs aſide from him:
ſurely he alone ought to outwey ten C. M. worldes, if there were ſo
many. Then ſeing the cace ſtandeth ſo, let vs mark well the doctrine
that is conteined here, where S. Paule ſetteth down his owne affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which ſerueth to giue vs a generall rule: according wherevnto
he addeth immediatly, <hi>that he had not labored to pleaſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> For ſo ſone
as folk ſpeake after the appetite of men, Gods truth muſt nedes be
corrupted. Alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he addeth, <hi>that if he ſhould pleaſe men,</hi> he were not the
ſeruant of Ieſus Chriſt. But the diuell hath many meanes &amp; ſlightes to
darken Gods truth, in ſuch wiſe, as it may wel ſeme vnto vs that we
be ſtil with God, &amp; yet in the mean while we ſhalbe a great way of
from him, vnleſſe we haue wiſdome and diſcretion as it is giuen vs
heere. Therefore let vs haue the skill too diſcerne God from men,
ſo as we may not be abaſhed nor amazed when wee ſee many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties,
muche diuerſitie of opinions, and many incounters and
diſputations. Let none of all thoſe things make vs chaunge our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe.
And why? Let vs looke no more but whether wee can bee
ſure in God: if we haue that once, let vs boldely deſpiſe the whole
worlde. But if we bee not well ſettled in our fayth: it is certayne
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> euerie blaſte of winde wyll ouerthrowe it; or at leaſtwyze
make it too ſtagger too and fro. Therefore let vs take ſuch taſte,
as wee maye knowe that God hathe verily had pitie of vs, too
the ende too ſhewe vs hys wyll: and let vs looke well too ſuche
<pb facs="tcp:23060:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as teach vs, [and marke] of what minde they be led and gouerned,
whether they ſeeke to obey God on their owne part, and too leade
vs in the ſame way by their owne example. Furthermore, when S.
Paule ſayth, that if he ſhoulde pleaſe men hee were not the ſeruant
of Ieſus Chriſt: that doctrine implyeth verie much. For we knowe
well ynough what men are of their owne nature, howe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them but iniquitie and ſtubbornneſſe agaynſt God. Then if
we minde to pleaſure them: we muſt giue ouer God and haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to doo with him. For men go alwayes backwarde if they bee
not compelled to come vnto God, and they kicke agaynſt him like
wilde beaſtes. Therefore wee cannot pleaſe them but by ſtraying
from God, and by giuing the brydle to ſuch as leape out, eft a tone
ſide, and eft a toother: yea and euen the good men coulde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
finde in their heartes, that God ſhoulde applie himſelfe too
their appetites. For although they bee ſtill minded too ſerue him:
yet are they not at all tymes, and in all poyntes ſo well ruled, as to
haue giuen ouer all their owne opinions, lykings, and deſires, but
that ſometimes they ſhall euerie one of them be tempted to do one
thing or other, inſomuch that if wee were not hilde ſhort, and made
to retire out of hande, wee would runne to our deſtruction. To bee
ſhort, there is none of vs all but hee woulde bee pleaſed, inſomuch
that if they which haue the charge to buylde and teach the Church,
would pleaſe men: they ſhoulde bee fayne too renounce our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt. And hereby all Miniſters of Gods worde are taught to
ſhet their eyes when they intende to diſcharge their duetie fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
ſo as they muſt not looke aſide too regarde men according to
their diſordered deſires which they ſee, but ſette aſide all deſire of
their good lyking and fauour. And if they purpoſe to lead thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
God which woulde elſe bee ſtubborne hearted: whatſoeuer
come of it let them ſo deale, that God may haue his right, and that
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt may haue his authoritie. For (as I haue ſayd
alreadie) what is too bee done when we ſpeake in his name? VVee
muſt not onely generally condemne all that is of our owne nature,
but alſo ſo ranſacke mens conſciences, as euerie of them may feele
that God executeth his iuriſdiction there, and that the Goſpell is
not onely a launcing yron to pricke, but alſo a ſworde that pearceth
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23060:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the marye of the bones, as the Apoſtle ſayth in the Epiſtle too
the Hebrewes.<note place="margin">Heb. 4. c. 12</note> There muſt then be neyther thought nor affection,
which the Goſpell muſt not ſearch. Truely it cannot bee but that
they which are ſo wounded, muſt needes grone and haue ſome
greefe and hartbyting. But yet muſt wee ſhet our eyes at all that,
and not regard what men couet or deſire, but paſſe on ſtill forward.
Furthermore, this warning ſerueth not onely for the Miniſters of
Gods worde, but for all men ingenerall. Therefore if we deſire too
bee Chriſtians, let vs learne to do ſo much honour to the ſonne of
God, that although his woorde bee not verie well too our lyking,
nor we finde fauour in it according to our naturall witte: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
we may not ceaſſe too receyue it obediently. And ſo
when any man commeth to a Sermon, lette him firſt and formoſt
make his reckening to be rebuked as meete is, and let him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
that it is for his profite that hee is not ſoothed. And if hee
haue itching eares, let him lay them away from him, aſſuring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
that elſe he is forcloſed, ſo as hee ſhall neuer receyue the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
to his profite and inſtruction. VVherefore let vs all ſuffer our
ſores too bee rubbed, and our ſelues to be condemned, and too bee
dealt with cleane contrarie to our lyking. Thus yee ſee how euery
of vs ought to be prepared, if wee purpoſe to bee ſcholers too the
ſonne of God, and to yeeld him the mayſtrie which belongeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him. And wee ought too endeuer this thing ſo much the more,
foraſmuch as we ſee our nature driueth vs to the contrarie way. For
we bee blinded with ſelfeloue, and euery of vs coueteth too be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured:
but honoured we cannot bee, but by flatterie and lying.
For who is he among vs that deſerueth to bee commended? There
is nothing but filthineſſe and infection in vs before God. For all
the goodly vertues which we haue to outwarde ſhowe, are but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
till God haue reformed vs. So then it is certaine, that all
that euer we haue of our owne nature muſt be clenſed, or elſe wee
ſhall rotte in our owne wretchedneſſe. And therefore foraſmuche
as there is none other meane to drawe vs to ſaluation, but by clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
vs of all our vyces, and the ſame clenſing cannot bee done but
by violence: when we bee warned by the doctrine of the Goſpell,
ſo as our owne conſciences rebuke vs, although we like well to bee
<pb facs="tcp:23060:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nowe and then flattered and ſoothed, yet let vs ſeeke to be ſpoken
vnto earneſtly, and to haue our faults told vs, and to be made aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of them, and too haue our vnhoneſtie diſcouered, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be pleaſed: for it were the next way to make vs rotte in our
owne naughtineſſe if we ſhould holde it ſo in ſecrete: and it woulde
coſt vs dearly the ſetting on, if we ſhould be ſo flattered by men, and
in the meane ſeaſon, the heauenly Iudge ſhould thunder downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
vs. Thus ye ſee how euery of vs ought too profite himſelfe by
that which S. Paule ſpeaketh here, namely that if the preachers gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
and pleaſe men, in ſo doing they renounce God: and if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
him, what ſhall become of the reſt of the people? VVhither
ſhall they be led but to the diuell? Therfore when any man commes
to a Sermon, let him beare well in minde, that he which preacheth
ſpeaketh not of his own authoritie, but in the behalf of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God his father hath appointed to be our iudge. And
to what ende is Ieſus Chriſt our Iudge? To the ende that euery of
vs ſhould condemne himſelfe, and that hauing ſo paſſed condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we ſhould reſort to him to be quit. Now then if a mortall man
couer my ſinnes for ſome loue that he beareth to me: will the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Iudge ſpare me bicauſe hee ſpareth me? VVere it not better
that he which hath the charge to teach me ſhould condemne me, &amp;
ſhew me my faults, to the end I might be ſorie for them, and learne
to miſlike of the thing that would bring me to deſtruction? Ought
not I to take the profer, while God hath his armes ſtretched out to
receyue mee, and while Ieſus Chriſt commeth before me, offering
me vp to God his father, as an acceptable ſacrifice of ſweete ſauor?
And ſo, muſt it not needes be that wee are as good as mad and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
by Satan, if we cannot abide to haue our ſores rubbed and
bewrayed, that we may be brought to that which is for our welfare?
If a man pleaſe a ſicke bodie, what will become of him? Shall hee
giue him drinke euerie minute of an houre? Shall he giue him wine
whereas hee ſhoulde giue him water? Shall hee giue him Sallets?
It were the next way to poyſon him. Too bee ſhort, it is certayne
that a man doth alwayes ſeeke hys owne death, when hee woulde
haue men too ſoothe him. But nowe whiche is the better, either
that he which hath the ordering of a ſicke man ſhould yeeld to al his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23060:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deſires, or that he ſhould bridle him notwithſtanding that he chafe
at it and gnaſh his teeth, and ſtorme bicauſe hee may not haue hys
owne will in his deſires? But it is certain that if there be inordinate
deſires in ſick folkes, there are much more inordinate deſires in vs.
VVhat would become of vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they that haue the charge to bear
abrode Gods word, and ought to play the phiſitions, had not a care
to kepe vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the things which they know to be hurtfull to vs, and
to miniſter the things vnto vs which they know to be for our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare?
For ſurely if they ſhould ſooth vs in our affections, it were the
way to caſt vs quite downe. This in effect is the thing that we haue
to conſider, when S. Paule ſpeaketh of his affection. Now he addeth
the ſecond argument: namely <hi>that he had not his gospell of men, but by
reuelation from heauen.</hi> He confirmeth ſtill his matter, in that hee
ſayth that neither Peter, nor Iohn, can haue any ſuch reuerence in
their owne perſons, as that men ſhoulde be bounde to hearken too
them as of themſelues, for that is reſerued to God alone, and to our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and they muſt not haue any companion. Then
ſith it is ſo, let vs learne to loke vp when the cace co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie
of our fayth, and let vs ſurmount all that is in this world, and
quite and clene giue ouer men. And though they be neuer ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
yet let not our faith reſt here beneath, nor vpon any creature,
but let it be grounded vpon God. The Papiſtes will ſay, we be full
of pride and ſtatelineſſe, for that wee will bee wyſer than all the
worlde. Truly if we reſted vpon our owne wit and weening, or vpon
our owne opinion, it were too great a pryde. But foraſmuch as
wee walke in humilitie, ſhrinking downe from all our owne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and wiſedome, and acknowledging that we muſte bee fooles in
thys worlde if wee will obtayne the wiſedome of God: Seeing (I
ſay) that wee haue ſuche a modeſtie and ſoberneſſe in vs, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
not too knowe more than is lawfull for vs, but in the meane
whyle doo ſo magnifie Gods doctrine, ſo that wee can defie all that
is of the world: that loftineſſe muſt needs be good, for it is the thing
wherin God will be glorified. Therfore we may defie the Croſſes &amp;
Myters &amp; Gewgaws of the worlde, and all the hornes of the Pope
wherby he aduanceth himſelf againſt God: I ſay we may defie them,
yea and abhorre them, as things full of filthineſſe and infection,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whereby oure mortall enimie Satan goeth about to poyſon vs. And
therewithall let vs bee ſo ſetled vpon Gods truth, as wee may try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
ouer all that is agaynſt it, aſſuring our ſelues, that our fayth
muſt get the vpper hande of all that euer ſetteth it ſelfe agaynſt it to
batter and beare it downe: the which thing to do, Satan neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth
too torment vs as much as is poſsible. But if wee bee once
ſtrengthned in our God, let vs not feare that wee ſhall bee vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
by all his temptations: for we bee ſure that as long as God is
on our ſyde, we may eſteeme all that ſhall come of creatures to be
no better than ſmoke.</p>
            <p>Now let vs fall downe before the maieſtie of our good God,
with acknowledgement of our faultes, praying him too make vs
feele them more and more, till we be vtterly rid of them, and that
ſo long as we haue to liue in this worlde, he will beare vs vp in our
weakeneſſe, till hee haue remedyed it, and we bee throughly refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
according to the perfection of his righteouſneſſe wherevnto
he calleth vs. And ſo let vs all ſay, Almightie God our heauenly
father. &amp;c.</p>

diſciples of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. For ſo long as we ſhall follow
our owne luſtes, the gate ſhall bee ſhette agaynſt vs, and wee ſhall
neuer haue any enterance in vntoo the Goſpell. And truely we ſee
howe the Prophete Eſay ſpeaketh thereof.<note place="margin">Eſay. 30. 6. 10. 11.</note> Hee ſayth that all ſuch
as will haue men to preache pleaſurable things to their lyking, doo
dryue away God as farre off from them as they can. True it is
that they will not ſpeake after that ſort. For euen in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
of Iewrie, euerie man proteſted to ſerue the God that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
too their father Abraham, and which had publiſhed his law
by Moyſes. Sacrifyzes were offered in the Temple, and there were
fayre ſhewes ynowe there. Neuertheleſſe the Prophete conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in one woorde, that men were deſirous too bee ſoothed, and
fayre ſpoken too, and by meanes thereof coulde not ſuffer God
too guide them, nor giue him leaue too lay hys yoke vpon theyr
necke. Ye ſee then that the meanes for vs to bee prepared too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the doctrine of the Goſpell, and to bee edified by the ſame,
is that wee bee not wedded too our owne lykings, but ſuffer our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt to ſpeake the things that are expedient for our
inſtruction. Howbeeit beſydes this, wee muſt alſo bee as it were
wounded to the heart by the worde that is preached to vs, or elſe
wee ſhall neuer fare the better for it.<note place="margin">Heb. 4. d. 12</note> For (as I declared this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
it is not without cauſe that the Goſpell is lykened to a ſharpe
ſwoorde, and it behoueth vs verely too bee made true ſacrifizes
by renouncing all our owne luſtes, and all other things which God
condemneth, and too indure the ſame paciently, too the intent too
bee wholly brought backe too the obeying of his will. And heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
we muſt alſo call to minde what hath bin treated of heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore:
that is to wit, that all men as wel great as ſmall, muſt ſtoupe,
and the ſonne of God muſte haue the preeminence and mayſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
in ſuch wiſe as there may be no mo Sheepherdes but hee, and
wee all of vs bee his ſheepe. True it is that ſuche as haue the
charge too preache the Goſpell may well bee called Sheepheards:
howbeeit, that is not for that they maye doo any thing in theyr
owne name and authoritie, or that the ſame ſhoulde impeache
the ſuperioritie of the ſonne of God. For as for mee whiche doo
ſpeake heere nowe, I muſte not bring ought of mine, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
<pb facs="tcp:23060:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my ſelfe aboue others: for my ſpeaking vnto all this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
is in ſuch wiſe, as my doctrine muſt firſt be applied to my ſelf,
and [afterwarde] beare ſway ouer all other men without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
For there is no highneſſe in the worlde, which can exempt
it ſelfe from the ſubiection whiche all of vs owe too the ſonne
of God: according as wee haue ſeene heeretofore, howe it is the
propertie of the Goſpel to bring downe all the glorie of the world,
ſo as men may not preſume too ſet vp theyr briſtles, nor too cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
ought to themſelues, but that ſuch as weene themſelues too
bee moſt excellent, maye be vtterly abaced and made nothing, and
all things bee made captiue to the obedience of the Goſpell. And
that is the cauſe why Saint Paule too confirme his doctrine, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that it came not of men, nor was learned in their ſcholes: but
that hee had it of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, concerning whom the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gaue commaundement, that men ſhoulde heare him. For that
prerogatiue is giuen peculiarly vnto him, and ought not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,<note place="margin">Math. 3. d. 17. &amp;. 17. 5</note>
neither to any man, nor to any Angell of heauen. Good
reaſon it is, that men which ſpeake as inſtruments of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, ſhoulde be heard: but (as I tolde you before) that is not
to impeach the authoritie which he hath ouer vs. But howſoeuer
the cace ſtande, the certaine and infallible rule to attaine to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is that our Lorde Ieſus be the onely maſter and teacher, and
that we be teachable to receyue his worde without gaineſay or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying.
And Saint Paule thinkes it not ynough that he holdeth the
things of Ieſus Chriſt which he hath publiſhed: but alſo he vtterly
reiecteth &amp; excludeth men in that behalfe, to ſhew that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of them were not ſufficient to ground and ſettle our fayth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.
For wee ſhall neuer leaue ſtaggering till we bee come vntoo
God, and vntoo that perſon whom hee hath ſtabliſhed as heade and
cheefe teacher ouer vs. Nowe whereas Saint Paule ſayth that hee
telleth it them: it is not for that the Galathians and others had
not heard the like afore: but bicauſe they had bin vnthankfull, ſo
as they had bin intangled in many errours and paltryes. Therefore
hee bringeth them backe againe too the well head: as if he ſhould
ſay, vntill ſuch time as men haue full concluded with themſelues
too ſuffer themſelues too be gouerned ſimply by the pure woorde
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23060:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of God, they ſhall bee alwayes in a mamering, and the Diuell ſhall
no ſooner rayſe vp any trouble agaynſt them, but they ſhall bee ſo
diſmayed, as they wote not which way too turne them. For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth
vs too bee firſt of all ſure, that as touching the doctrine
wherevppon our fayth is ſettled, wee holde it of God and not of
men. True it is that all men ſhall not haue the like reuelation that
Sainct Paule had: but it ought too ſuffize vs, that our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt hauyng ratyfied the Goſpell wyth his owne bloud, and
alſo commaunded his Apoſtles to publiſh it abrode, hath giuen them
ſuch proofe, that the doctrine which wee receyue of them is of full
authoritie, and vtterly out of all doubt: this (ſay I) ought to ſuffize to
holde vs as it were in priſon, and too keepe vs from admitting anie
of all the things that men can alledge. But let vs alſo call to minde
what the Apoſtle telleth vs in the firſt too the Hebrewes:<note place="margin">Heb. 1. a. 2.</note> namely
that God hath laſtly ſpoken to vs by the mouth of his owne ſonne,
to the intent we ſhoulde haue all perfection of doctrine in him. Ye
ſee then that the thing which we haue to beare away, is that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualation
whereof Saint Paule ſpeaketh here, ſhall not bee common
to al other men, but ſerueth to warrant the doctrine which we haue
receyued by his meanes, ſo as wee ſee it is our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt
that hath ſpoken. And whereas hee excludeth men after that ſort:
it is to ſhewe vs, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt doth not giue vs ſome
bare enterance, as if a man ſhoulde teache a childe his Apcie, and
afterwarde ſende him to a better learned mayſter: Our Lord ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not ſo by halues vntoo vs, but in full perfection: inſomuch that
both in lyfe and death, we muſt alwayes ſtand ſtedfaſt in the things
that we receyue of him, and forſake whatſoeuer commeth of men:
for all mingling will bee but corruption; as I tolde you thys mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.<note place="margin">1. Pe. 4. c. 11</note>
And that alſo is the cauſe why he exhorteth thoſe that ſpeake
in the Churche, too holde faſt continually the Maieſtie of God,
and not too bring in ought of their owne, nor too put foorth any
thing whiche breedeth of theyr owne brayne. For in what cace
ſhoulde wee bee, if men myghte intermeddle themſelues wyth
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and euery man caſte in his morſell and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luppe
(as they ſay) and that wee mighte haue a Goſpell ſtuffed
with mens dreames and fancies? It woulde bee nothing elſe but
<pb facs="tcp:23060:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a horrible confuſion. Yee ſee then that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt
hath not his authoritie among vs, vntill men bee put downe, and
all other creatures with them, and that all giue eare vntoo him fro
the leaſt too the moſte. This in effect is the matter which wee
haue to beare in minde. And in deede wee ſee howe that in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Text too the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Co. 2. b. 6</note> Saint Paule declareth that he had
preached the perfect wiſedome, when he did ſet foorth our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt, and that there a man ſhall finde whatſoeuer hee
can wiſhe for his welfare. And in one other Text too the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians
hee ſayeth,<note place="margin">Eph. 3. d. 18</note> that that is the thing wherevntoo wee muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
all our ſtudie, bothe farre and wide, ſo as wee neede not too
bring any petie traſhe, too further the thing that hee had ſette out
afore. Then ſith it is ſo, wee ſee that all ſuche as intangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in mens deuices and inuentions, haue a diſguiſed Ieſus Chriſt,
and a baſtarde Goſpell whiche God diſclaymeth, ſo that our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie
can bee no Chriſtianitie, except wee continue in the
things whiche wee haue learned of the ſonne of God, who is our
onely Maſter, and in the things which the Apoſtles alſo haue taught
vs in his name. Lo what wee haue too remember in this Text.
Nowe heerevppon Saint Paule ſheweth his owne conuerſation,
whereby it maye bee gathered, that out of doubt hee was as it
were faſhioned by the ſpirite of God. For ſo ſtraunge an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
as was ſeene in hys perſon, coulde not happen, except
God had put too hys hande, and wrought after a ſecrete and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed
faſhion. And ſo yee ſee in effect whereat hee amed,
when hee ſayeth that the Galathians knewe his conuerſation or
maner of lyuing. VVee haue heere a good leſſon. Howbeeit, that
we may profite the more by it, let vs marke howe Saint Paule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
the thing that hee had touched afore: which is, that a man
ſhall not find a ſtedfaſt foundation in any creature whereon to ſetle
fayth, but that God onely muſt bee the founder thereof, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
men bee meane, and inſtrumentes of it, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
they haue neede too bee authoriſed of God, and too haue it
knowne that hee hath ſent them and allowed them, and that they
bring not any thing which they haue not receyued of him. Nowe if
a man haue an eye too the vertues that were in Sainct Paule,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23060:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
certainly hee deſerued well too haue ſome credite and audience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
menne. Yet notwithſtanding hee acknowledgeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
that hee is nothing as in reſpect of himſelfe, and that all
that euer he hath, is onely to ſerue our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and to ſet
forth the things faythfully which he hath receyued of him.<note place="margin">

ſhall wee then ſay too ſuch as haue neither good life, doctrine or

them ſome ſtatelineſſe and ſuperioritie, ſo as their ſayings go
for ſawes: are they therefore aduaunced aboue S. Paule? [Admit
they were:] yet muſt all loftineſſe of man ceaſſe, and bee pulled
downe, ſo as nothing may hinder the exalting of Ieſus Chriſt. As
for example,<note place="margin">Math. 11. b. 11.</note> although S. Iohn Baptiſt had recorde borne vnto him
that there was not an excellenter man borne of woman: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
he ſaith that both himſelf and others muſt be dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,<note place="margin">Iohn 3. d. 30.</note>
that Ieſus Chriſt might grow and increaſe. Likewiſe S. Paule
ſpeaking of it in another place,<note place="margin">Ephe. 1. d. 20.</note> ſayth that the Church muſt in ſuch
wiſe be builded, as our head Ieſus Chriſt may always haue preemi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.<note place="margin">Col. 1. c. 18.</note>
For if we ſhould ſo aduance men, that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be
defaced among them, that were a terrible building, and ſuch a one as
ſhould bring nothing but ruine and confuſion. And in good ſooth, if
a man ſhould become as big as a Piller of this Church, and his head
of the bigneſſe of ones fiſt, ſo as it ſhould be hid betwene his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
He ſhould be a monſter, and it were much better for him too
keepe his ordinarie proportion. But like as the Church is the bodie
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">Eph. 1. d. 23</note> ſo muſt hee bee aduaunced aboue all men,
and euery man muſt loke vpon him, and ſticke to him. And certeſſe
the Papiſts condemne themſelues at this day by their own prouerb,
in that they ſay a man cannot knowe God for his Apoſtles. And in
verie deede they haue buryed Ieſus Chriſt in ſuch ſort, that he is as
good as hidden in the worlde. For they haue robbed him of all that
belonged to him:<note place="margin">Eſa. 33. d. 22</note> inſomuch that whereas he is called the lawgiuer,
the Iudge and the King, to ſhew that he alonely ought to beare rule:
we ſee how me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue decked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with all thoſe feathers. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs kepe our ſelues from ſuch confuſion: &amp; if we increaſe, let
vs always abide in the root &amp; groundwork of the ſimplicitie of the
Goſpell. Let vs take good heed that we ſwarue not a heare breadth
<pb facs="tcp:23060:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from it. And as touching that which is reherſed heere concerning
the conuerſion of S. Paule: it tendeth ſtill to this ende, namely to do
vs to wit, that he did not thruſt himſelfe in of his owne heade, but
that God reached him his hand, and that the doctrine which he had
preached was giuen him by reuelation, ſo as it might ſafely be hilde
as the worde that proceeded out of the mouth of God, and [conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently]
as the certaine and infallible truth. I haue tolde you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
that if a man ſeke to be heard for his owne skil, for his great
and deepe vnderſtanding, for his fayre ſpeech, or for his great elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:
all thoſe things are nothing but filthineſſe and dung, and
that God only muſt haue that authoritie and honor at our handes:
and that foraſmuch as it pleaſeth God to ſpeake to vs by the mouth
of his only ſonne: only Ieſus Chriſt muſt haue the preeminence to
be the maſter and teacher of all his, and wee likewiſe muſt become
his flock to heare his voyce. Lo how our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is to be
honored among vs: namely by becomming his true ſcholers, and
without feyning. In the Popedome a man may wel ynough worſhip
ſome Marmoſet with the honor of Ieſus Chriſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as in the meane
while the Goſpell is troden vnder foote and blaſphemed, and yet
notwithſtanding thoſe blind wretches thinke themſelues too haue
made a fayre hande. Yea, but [in very deed] it is an open ſpitting in
the face of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, when men renounce his woorde
wherein they ſhould beholde his glorie and maieſtie, as Saint Paule
ſayth in the ſeconde to the Corinthians.<note place="margin">2. Co. 3. b. <hi>S.</hi>
               </note> Then is it no honouring of
Chriſt, when men make many murlimewes and ceremonies: but
when they ſubmit themſelues ſimplie to the doctrine wherein it is
his will to be knowne, and wherein hee ſheweth himſelfe vnto vs as
it were face to face. Thus ye ſee in effect what wee haue too beare
away. And herewithall in this conuerſion of Saint Paules, wee ſee
perfectly the heauenly power which he minded to ſhewe vs heere:
that is to wit, that it was not of man, but that God had vttered hys
arme, to the ende it might bee knowne that ſuch chaunge came of
him, and that S. Paule was become a new creature. For ſurely it is a
more excellent worke of God, when a man is repayred after his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
than when we be borne into this tranſitorie lyfe. And ſo wee
ſee howe Saint Paule was made a newe man. And that is the cauſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:23060:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
why he ſayth expreſly, that he perſecuted the Church of God, that
he made hauocke of all things, and that he played the cutthrote (as
ye would ſay,) vntil God had changed him, and of a rauening woolf
made him a meeke ſheepe, and finally a ſheepheard in his Church
vnder our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Thus then we perceyue, that S. Paule
was ſent vs by the hand of God, and that he bringeth a ſure marke,
ſo as we ſee he did not thruſt himſelf in, but that it was a worke of
the holy Ghoſt, and there was nothing of his owne coyning in the
doctrine that he preached, forſomuch as it behoued him too haue
quite and cleane renounced himſelfe, to the end to giue and applie
himſelf to the ſeruice of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For had S. Paule bin
led with vainglorie, wee bee ſure he was honoured among his owne
countrymen, and he could haue wonne his ſpurres there. Againe, if
he had ſtood vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reputation of a holy life, he was vnblameable.
On the other ſide he was at his eaſe &amp; liued in reſt. But it ſtood him
on hand to haue made no more account of all the things that are to
be deſired to the worldward, and which he had highly eſteemed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. b. 8.</note>
than of dung &amp; durt, (as he himſelf proteſteth to the Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)
and it behoued him to caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al away as things hurtfull, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as he ſaw well how they were all of them impeachments that
hindered him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comming to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. S. Paule ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not onely gaue ouer the reputation which he had to be a great
doctor, &amp; therwithal a holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; as it were a little Angel: &amp; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
the reſt, eaſe &amp; commodities of the worlde: but alſo did before
god giue ouer all his opinion of purchaſing eternall life by his own
good workes. All theſe things he reiected as abhominable, knowing
well that he was blinded with pride, in that he had imagined that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing was auaylable before God, or that he could purchaſe any
fauor by that meane. It behoueth him (ſay I) not only to haue thruſt
all theſe things vnder foote, but alſo to haue abhorred them, as hee
himſelfe proteſteth. Forſomuch then as we ſee this, we be ſo much
the better confirmed in that which he ſayth: namely that in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his office of Apoſtleſhip, he had nothing of man, nor of himſelf,
for he had bin quite &amp; cleane ſtripped out of all the things which he
had made great accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of before. For in that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth himſelf to
haue bin a perſecuter of Gods Church, we ſee that to the entent to
<pb facs="tcp:23060:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mainteyne ſtill the honour of God, and the authoritie and maiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod
of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, whom he ſerued, he doth not in any
wiſe ſpare himſelfe. But behold alſo it behoueth vs to proceede in
the like cace. If we purpoſe to imploy our ſelues to Gods ſeruice, it
ſtandeth vs on hande to forget our ſelues, and not to be curious in
ſeeking the things that are for our owne behoofe, or for our owne
honour. Vntill ſuch time then as we bee come to the vtter abaſing
of our ſelues, wee can neuer giue our ſelues to the ſeruice of God
wherevnto we bee called. I ſpeake purpoſely of thoſe that haue the
charge to preach the Goſpell, whom it behoueth too bee abaced in
themſelues, or elſe they can neuer execute faythfully the charge
that is committed vnto them. On the other ſide, we ſee howe Saint
Paule doth not diſguiſe any thing, nor take any ſhadowe or couert
to bee receyed among men, but had rather reape the blame that
hee had deſerued, and to bee ſhamed afore men, than to couer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with vaine ſtartingholes. For he ſayth he had perſecuted the
Church, bin a rouer and a cutthrote, and had ſhedde innocent bloud.
But yet doth not this proue that Saint Paule had not indeuered to
liue in holineſſe and perfection:<note place="margin">Phil. 3. b. 6.</note> for hee had bin a myrror of great
vncorruptneſſe. He termeth himſelfe vnblameable: and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cauſe. For he ſayth he was ſo blynded, that he thought himſelfe
righteous before God, bicauſe there was not any ſpot in him that
coulde bee condemned by men. Truely there was hypocriſie in
him, like as there is in all men that are not renued by Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.
VVhen they ſurmyze themſelues to bee well lyked of all the
worlde: then is it certaine that they are nothing but corruption,
till God haue taken them into his guiding. And ſo ye ſee that men
ſhall bee abuzed, bicauſe they ſticke too theyr mother witte in iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
what is good and euill. But contrariwiſe our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt telleth vs,<note place="margin">Luc. 16. d. 15</note> that all the things which are highly eſteemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men, are abhominable before God. Surely howſoeuer the cace
ſtand, S. Paule had indeuored himſelf to liue holily and without any
blame or reproch, And yet for al that, when he was once conuerted,
hee coulde not ſay hee had done well, and that his deuotion was
woorthie too bee allowed. But contrariwize hee declareth that
he had bin a perſecuter, and that all this geere was nothing woorth.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:23060:57"/>
VVhat is too be ſayd then of that which now adayes is called deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and the ſeruis of God?<note place="margin">

good intent, all men (too their owne ſeeming) haue affection and
zeale, and they beare themſelues in hand that God is much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and indetted too them for the things whiche they doo. Yea, but
wee know that God hath not commaunded them any of the things
that they bring vnto him, but euery of them behaueth himſelf after
his owne fancie. How ſoeuer the worlde go with them, it is but an
opinion, that they weene they doo well, and that is all. One ſayes, it
ſeemeth ſo to me: another ſayes, I learned it ſo, and ſo was I taught.
Now if God ſhould allow all theſe things, he ſhould haue great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
to beare. For the things that men haue inuented of their own
heads, are but ſtinking dung before him. And yet for all this, euery
man alledges this fooliſh bragge, that he ment to ſerue God. But
therefore it is ſayd in one woord by the Prophet Eſay,<note place="margin">Eſay. 1. c. 12</note> who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
theſe things at your hands? Lette him that ſet you a woorke
pay you. For as for mee, I will neuer put this geere in my reckening
booke: I vtterly diſclayme it, bicauſe I require obedience. Now S.
Paule hath very wel gathered this matter. For if he had iudged here
of other men, it ſhoulde haue had leſſe power and force, than when
he ſpeaketh of himſelf, and in nowiſe ſpareth himſelf, but ſayeth that
all the holineſſe for which he had bin commended among men, was
but a the euerie, bicauſe he had bin as a mad beaſt, full of fierceneſſe
and rebellion againſt God. Then if S. Paule make ſuch a playne and
free confeſsion: muſt not all mouthes bee ſtopped, and al of vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that when wee thought too haue ſerued God, wee were (as
yee would ſay) in a maze, and it was but a leading of vs too the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of Hell? And in good ſooth, as the wretched vnbeleeuers rack
themſelues, they doo but double their owne condemnacion, for the
Diuell ſnarleth them ſo much the more in their damnation. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs acknowledge that wee haue bin rebelles too God euer
ſince the time that wee would needes ſerue him ſo after our owne
fancie, and that there was nothing in all our whole lyfe, but errour
too make vs ſtray all the world ouer, and too plucke vs backe rather
than too ſet vs foreward, and finally that all the deuotions whiche
<pb facs="tcp:23060:58"/>
men deuyze, are but ſlightes and illuſions of Satan, to ſinke vs down
too the deepeſt dungeons of death. So then let vs returne too this
obedientneſſe, and acknowledge that there is no way for vs too rule
our life wel, but by being taught in the ſchoole of the Sonne of God.
But doo wee thinke that the Superſtitions that raigne now adayes
in the world, and haue their full ſcope there, are better than the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
that were in the tyme of S. Paule? It is true that there were
many wicked corruptions in the Churche of the Iewes. For Sectes
were ſprung vp, and the Phariſies (whiche were yet the pureſt and
ſoundeſt of all the reſt) had mingled many gewgawes with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis
of God, in ſomuche that all was corrupted among them. But
howſoeuer they fared, yet Sainct Paule had alwayes the lawe and
the holy Scripture. As for the traditions whereof he ſpeaketh, he
tooke them as appurtenances: but yet in the meane whyle his
mynde was too mayntayne the Lawe of Moyſes, whiche had Gods
woorde in it, and the vnchaungeable truthe, and whiche ought too
haue the ſame reuerence to the worldes end. Yet notwithſtanding
he had but the letter of the lawe, as wee haue ſeene heretofore in
the Epiſtle too the Corinthians.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. b. 6</note> But now adayes as for them that
bee the deuouteſt in the Popedome, what haue they? VVhen they
haue alledged all that they can, it is certayne, that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is as good as buryed among them, and noman makes account
of it. They will not ſay that it ought to be caſt away, for that were
too great a blaſphemie, and men would abhorre it. But what ſoeuer
they pretend, the Goſpell is nothing with them in compariſon of
that which hath bin ordeyned by their holy Councelles, and by our
moother holy Churche. Yea and they are not aſhamed too ſay, that
the Goſpell &amp; al the holy Scripture is as a noze of waxe, ſo as there
is no certaintie in it, but that it muſte bee interpreted altogither by
men. Lo how Ieſus Chriſt is mocked and skorned. Thinke yee that
ſuch men may make vs beleeue all their owne inuentions, when as
they be ſo manifeſtly contrary to themſelues. Then let vs marke,
that if S. Paule did ſo condemne himſelfe with his owne mouthe [in
the things that he did] when he followed not our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:
no excuſe ſhal be auayleable nor go for payment before God, when
men ſwarue aſide from the ſimplicitie of the Goſpell. This is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:23060:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the thing that we haue to gather vpon his text. But let vs marke
therewithall, that God vttered a ſingular grace in S. Paule, too the
end that by his example wee might know, that our calling too ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
hath bin of his meere and vndeſerued goodneſſe. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
that if we haue ſlidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> backe, and broken our promis made
in Baptime to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, yet how ſoeuer the cace ſtand,
we ſhall not fayle to be receyued to mercie, ſo we confeſſe freely &amp;
without hypocriſie, that there was nothing in vs but confuſion, and
that God muſt haue bin fayne to remedie the matter of his wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
goodneſſe. True it is (as I haue touched afore) that S. Paule was
taken for a holy man, and it might well haue bin ſayd, that God had
accepted his deuotions, and that there had bin ſome good prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in him afore hand: howbeit, all that was but a pluckyng of him
backe,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. b. 8.</note> as I haue touched already in the thirde too the Philippians,
where he ſayth he could not take hold of Ieſus Chriſt, and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible
benefites that are in him, vntill he had miſlyked all
the things that he had earſt eſteemed and had in reputation, as his
owne rightuouſneſſe and holineſſe. VVee ſee then after what ſorte
God wrought in the perſone of Paule, in ſomuch that in the firſt to
Timothie,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1. c. 13.</note> he ſetteth foorth himſelf for an example &amp; patterne, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Ieſus Chriſt had ſhewed in him, that he was come to ſaue all
wretched ſinners, to the end we ſhould not doubt too bee receyued
when we keepe the right way. VVhat did Frewill in S. Paule for the
bringing of him to the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Goſpel? [nothing:] but God
was fayne too thunder downe vpon him from heauen, too driue out
the pryde and preſumption that was in him. He was not only drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by the hand, but alſo God did caſte ſo thicke ſcales vppon his eyes,
that hee was as a blynde wretche. And beſides that, he was ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
too the ground and aſtoniſhed, too ſhewe that the knowledge
and cunning, whiche he thought himſelfe too haue before, was but
ſtarke blindneſſe, and that this darkneſſe had ſerued too bring him
too a new light. For if God had lette him ſtill alone in his perfect
plight, ſurely there woulde alwayes haue remayned ſome foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
ſelfeweenyng in him, and he would alwayes haue mingled ſome
tricke of his owne deuyce and brayne, with the doctrine of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt: &amp; therfore it behoued him to be blinded &amp; to abide ſo.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:59"/>
For in aſmuch as he had earſt bin in great reputation, and bin temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to hold his ſtate ſtill: it was requiſite that he ſhould be brought
downe, and lifted vp againe, and caried like a little babe, or rather
like a carkeſſe or dead body. Thus yee ſee how it behoued S. Paule
too bee corrected after a violent maner: whereby wee ſee that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
free will, nor deuotion, nor holyneſſe ſtoode him in any ſteede,
but that all ought too bee attributed to the meere mercy of God.
And in very deede wee ſee how he yeeldeth a pure and vnconſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
confeſsion thereof. Then ſeyng it is ſo, let vs marke alſo, that
when God calleth vs too him, it is not for that he ſeeth vs diſpoſed
therevnto, or for that wee bee in any good readineſſe too it afore
hand: but bycauſe it pleaſeth him too drawe vs of his owne meere
mercie, as we ſhall ſee yet more at large hereafter. And if we minde
too be parttakers of the grace of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte as S. Paule
was, the way what wee muſt take, is to confeſſe that there is nothing
at all in vs, but that wee muſt bee fayne too receyue from aboue, all
the things whereof wee bee deſtitute, and too haue God woorke in
vs after ſuch a ſorte, as the prayſe of our ſaluation may bee reſerued
too him alone without any exception. And in that reſpect alſo S.
Paule addeth, <hi>that when it had pleazed God too call him too preache the
Goſpell, he did immediately fall in trayne, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yted not at all for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of man,</hi> for it was ynough for him that God had ſente him, and
that he was auowed by ſuch a Mayſter. VVherevppon he did not in
any wiſe ſpare himſelf, nor ſtand ſcannyng of the matter, but reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
himſelf fully to go foreward on his way, and to hold out in ſuch
wyſe as wee haue ſeene, which is a ſure record that God gouerned
him by his holy ſpirite. This is the thing which wee haue too beare
in minde. And therwithall we muſt alſo marke well how he ſayeth,
<hi>that God had prepared him from his mothers wombe, and in the end called
him too publiſh his Goſpell.</hi> Here S. Paule ſheweth that his calling af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that maner, was not for any forewardneſſe or woorthineſſe that
was in his owne perſone: but bycauſe he had bin chozen of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
before he was borne. That is the cauſe why he purpoſely vſeth
this ſaying that <hi>from his moothers wombe,</hi> he had bin as it were ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
and dedicated vnto God. How then could he bring any thing
of his own power? For what could he do when he was yet vnborne?
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23060:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God therefore muſt needes bee the woorker in that behalfe. Again,
he addeth that God called him. True it is, that he ſpeaketh this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his office: but yet notwithſtanding hee magnifieth Gods
goodneſſe in generall, to ſhewe that too him onely we be beholden
for all that wee haue, not onely in reſpect of this flightfull lyfe, but
ſpecially for the euerlaſting ſaluation of our ſoules. This cannot be
layd out too the full at this time, and therefore wee will leaue a
peece of it till the next time. Howbeit for a concluſion, let vs marke
how S. Paule ſheweth vs as it were in a mirrour, that our yeelding
of our ſelues in obedience vnto God, happeneth not through any
mans putting foorth of himſelf, but through Gods reaching out of
his hand from aboue, and through his drawyng of vs too himſelfe,
euen at ſuch time as wee could not ſeeke him. No doubte but men
will alwayes imagine ſomewhat too commend themſelues withall.
Neuerthelater all is but illuſion: and the Diuell vſeth that tricke to
make vs too darken Gods grace, too the intent wee might be bereft
of it. For it is good reaſon that God ſhould leaue men in ſuch plight
as they bee, when they will take vpon them that whiche belongeth
vntoo him, and not condemne themſelues as they bee woorthie.
Therefore let vs marke well, that all the goodneſſe which wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
in this world, proceedeth of Gods meere grace, and that there
is not any thing that can bee graunted too our ſelues. And that wee
may the better perceiue this free goodneſſe: let vs vnderſtand that
wee muſt lay downe all worthineſſe of our owne deſertes, and haue
an eye, firſt too Gods free election, and afterward too his callyng.
VVherefore then are wee inlightened with the knowledge of the
Goſpell? Is it for that wee haue deſerued aught? No: but bicauſe
God hath chozen vs before wee were borne, yea and euen before
the making of the world,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. a. 4.</note> as it is ſayd in another place. Yee ſee then
at what poynt wee muſt begin, too the end wee bee not puffed vp
with vayne pride whiche woulde make vs breake our neckes in the
end, but rather bethinke vs too walke in lowlineſſe, remembering
how it is ſayd in another place, VVho is it that ſholeth thee out, or
that maketh thee more excellent than others? It is God (ſayth he,)
who hath done it of his owne meere goodneſſe. VVhen S. Paule
confeſſeth there that it is God which hath ſeparated or ſholed vs
<pb facs="tcp:23060:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
out: it is to cut off all allegations of men, beyng well aſſured that no
man can ſay he is better than his fellowes, ſaue onely bicauſe God
hath chozen vs, yea euen before we were borne. And this choyze of
God is ſecrete, vntill he ſhewe by effect that he calleth vs too him.
And how doth he that? By his Goſpell: and therein there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
grace. The one is when the doctrine is preached too vs. For we
ſee the miſerable ſtate of the world, how a number of ſillie ſoules,
and a number of blinde wretches wander there in darkneſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſuccour or ayde, when in the meane whyle our God offereth vs
foode, yea and putteth it intoo our mouthes: and is not that a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
grace? But yet further, God muſte bee fayne too call vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardely,
and too touch vs in ſuch wiſe by his holy ſpirite, as his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

it comes of him, and he ſeale the ſame in our hartes by his holy

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee haue ſeene what cace is handled heere by S.
Paule: that is to wit, that men ought not to bee
aduaunced ſo highe, as that the glory of God
ſhould bee defaced or diminiſhed in reſpect of
them, or of the reputation that we haue of their
perſons. For oftentimes we be giuen to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend
creatures to much, ſo as the ſame carieth a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
to Gods woord. And although S. Paule co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare himſelfe heere
with the other Apoſtles: yet hath he not regard of his own perſon,
but is deſirous that the goſpel which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto him ſhould
be receiued with al reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And for the bringing thereof to paſſe, he
alledgeth here Gods graces rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his own vertues. For he doth
not alledge or rehearce heere what he had done as of himſelfe, but
<pb facs="tcp:23060:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what he hath donne through the chaunge that was happened vnto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
him, which men might perceiue to be from heauen, and not through
his owne indeuer. Yea and we ſee, how he declareth freely, that all
his chaunging after that maner, ought too bee fathered vppon the
meere goodneſſe of God: for he vſeth the terme of good <hi>Pleaſure.</hi>
VVherein he excludeth, what ſoeuer is of man, to the end it ſhould
not bee thought that he minded too reſerue aught too himſelfe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
he ſayeth not that he had ſought the Goſpell, but that he had
had it by reuelation. Thirdly he ſayeth it was God that called him.
And laſtly he ſayeth that it was not for any readineſſe that was in
himſelfe afore hand (as peraduenture a man might put one of vs too
ſome ſeruis when he findeth vs meete for a thing:) but he ſayeth
that God had ſeparated him aforehand from his mothers wombe.
VVee ſee then that S. Paule intendeth not to exalt himſelf, but only
too make Ieſus Chriſt knowen by his meanes, and to keepe the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Goſpell from impeachment vnder the colour that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men had gotten great reputation through the whole worlde.
And (as wee ſee) the troublers that were come into the Countrie of
Galatia, tooke a deceytfull couert vnder the name of the Apoſtles.
S. Paule therfore ſheweth, that the thing which hee hild, he had not
of men. And likewiſe alſo he braggeth not that he had conquered o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
deſerued aught, but that at leaſtwyſe it was knowen how God had
ſo ſet out his grace in him, as the ſame ſerued to make the doctrine
of more authoritie which he bare abrode. But by the way, there is
no doubt, but that in the perſone of S. Paule, wee haue heere a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of Gods goodneſſe, in ſuch ſort as it ſheweth it ſelfe towardes
vs, and whereof we bee parttakers, to the end that all men from the
ſmalleſt to the greateſt, ſhould learne to humble themſelues. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when wee come too the knowledge of the Goſpell, although
wee haue no ſuche reuelations as Paule had: yet notwithſtanding,
this thing dooth alwayes take place and hath his continuall courſe,
namely that it is not of our ſelues, nother can men put foorth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to it of themſelues, but all proceedeth of Gods meere good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
for that he hath ſo ordayned. For the woordes that S. Paule v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
exclude all reſpectes that can bee had, as when one man ſhall
doo another man good for ſome deſert, or for ſome other thing that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23060:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he findeth in his perſone. He dooth no more heere, but ſet downe
ſimply, that for aſmuch as God findeth no woorthineſſe in vs, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when it pleaſeth him to accept vs for his children, and to draw
vs too the knowledge of his Goſpell, he ſheweth that his ſo doyng
proceedeth of his owne purpoſe and will. Thus then the thing that
we bee taught heere, is that fayth is in ſuche wiſe the meere gifte of
God, that men cannot chalendge too themſelues the prayſe of their
comming too the light of the Goſpell, where their happineſſe and
welfare lie, but ought to glorifie God, bicauſe he hath bound them
too him by choozing them, and calling them too leade them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto:
for as for the cauſe thereof, he ſeeketh it in himſelf and in his
owne meere mercie. As much is too be ſayd of all the charges wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboutes
God imployeth vs. True it is that men chooze one another
according as they ſee abilitie in them to bee put to ſome buzineſſe:
ſo as one is ſet too rule a countrie, another too preach Gods word,
and another too this or that. In ſo doyng wee haue an eye too the
things that God hath put into euery man, and it is good reaſon ſo to
doo. But yet for all that, how ſoeuer the cace ſtande, hee that is ſo
chozen, (what handſomneſſe and abilitie ſoeuer he haue too go
through with his dutie) muſt vnderſtand that God had marked him
out before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that he is not framed theretoo by his owne policie,
but that God hath wrought it in him. And therfore let vs not thinke
that he which hath a better and more foreward wit than other men,
hath it of himſelf. For whereof is it long that wee bee not blockiſh
as many creatures are, whom we ſee to be without witte or reaſon?
VVho is it that hath put ſuche difference betweene men? It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
that of neceſſitie God muſt haue marked vs out, and appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
what wee ſhould bee, euen before wee were borne. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
who ſoeuer hath eyther wit or any other excellent gifte aboue
other men; lette him aſſure himſelfe that God hath faſhyoned him
therevnto. Againe, when wee bee come too age, God muſte bee
fayne too thruſt vs ſtill foreward and too guyde vs, howbeit that
the ſame bee by a ſecrete power. VVee ſee that the Paynims haue
ſome care of the bringyng vp of their children, and that ſome of
them haue a better minde to their ſtudie than others. But yet how
ſoeuer they fare, it is God that guydeth and gouerneth them from
<pb facs="tcp:23060:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aboue, ſo as all ought too bee attributed vntoo him. And heere yee
ſee why S. Paule hauing ſayd that God reueled his ſonne vnto him,
addeth that as he had called him too preach, ſo alſo he had erſt ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him out aforehand from others: that is too ſay, he had hild him
faſt as he that wiſt well too what ſeruis he were beſt too apply him.
Then ſeyng it is ſo, wee haue cauſe too walke in humbleneſſe, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our ſelues that if there bee any excellencie in vs, wee muſte
not euery man bragge of it as of his owne, but acknowledge God
too bee the author of all that he hath beſtowed vppon vs, and that
his meere goodneſſe is the fountayne whereout of wee draw. Now
if this extend too the ſmalleſt giftes of grace which wee receyue of
him: what doth it too the ineſtimable benefite which he beſtoweth
vppon vs, when he calleth vs too the knowledge of his Goſpell,
when he openeth vs the gate of Heauen, too ſhewe vs that he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs all for his children and that he is our father, and when our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt is ſo knit vnto vs, that by his meanes wee bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
made ſure of the endleſſe lyfe? Can we ſay that we haue any
thing of our owne, when God maketh vs parttakers of ſuche a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?
Yee ſee then that the thing which wee haue too gather vppon
this ſtreyne, is that God hath ſo reſerued too himſelfe the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
of mans lyfe, that it is his peculiar office to guyde our ſteppes:
and he knoweth wherevntoo he hath ordeyned vs. And therefore
it becommeth vs too magnifie his mercie, in that he hath vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
too inlighten vs by beleeuing his Goſpell, too the intent wee
might knowe him too bee our father, and reſt vppon him, and pray
vnto him with full truſt. Let vs aſſure our ſelues, that the hauing of
this commeth not of our owne freewill, but of his touching of vs
too the quicke by his holy ſpirite. For our Lord Ieſus Chriſte who
hath all wiſedome in him, cannot bee knowen of vs except he bee
reueled, according as he himſelfe auoucheth that noman commeth
vnto him except the father drawe him.<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. e. 44.</note> Beholde, Ieſus Chriſt was
conuerſant in the worlde at that time: he preached the Goſpell and
publiſhed it with open mouth: and yet notwithſtanding he ſayeth
that noman ſhall come vnto him, that is too ſay, noman ſhall frame
himſelfe too his obedience, except the father haue wrought in his
hart by the power of his holy ſpirit. Now that Ieſus Chriſt is ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:23060:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from vs as in reſpect of diſtance of place, and as in reſpect of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, ſo as wee ſee him not heere beneath too haue any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
knowledge of him: how ſhall wee come vntoo him, if wee bee
not drawen by the grace that is ſpoken of heere? And if fayth bee
a ſpeciall gifte of God, and wee cannot come too our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſte except we bee led vnto him by the hande of God his father:
howe can they that ſhould drawe others doo it of their owne abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie?
Needes then muſte God vtter yet a ſecond woorking. And
that is the cauſe why Sainct Paule ſetteth downe bothe twayne of
them: that is too wit, firſte that he had bin inlightened himſelf, and
ſecondly that he had bin ordeyned and ſtabliſhed as a Mayſter and
teacher too drawe othermen, to the good way of Saluation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God had ſet him. VVherefore let vs aſſure our ſelues, that God
graunteth a ſingular grace too ſuch as haue charge too preache the
Goſpell, when he voutchſafeth too apply them therevnto. And that
is not onely too the end that wee which are in that ſtate and office,
ſhould walke in the feare of God, and not chalendge aught too our
ſelues: but alſo too the intent that euery man ſhould in that behalf
haue a record of the loue that God beareth too his Churche. If men
ſhould thruſt in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues on their owne heads, it might be ſayd that
wee were taught at all aduenture. But when as we know that noma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is of ſufficient abilitie too open his mouth to ſpeake of Ieſus Chriſt
as he ought too be ſpoken of, but that it is Gods doyng to ſend forth
thoſe of whom it behoueth vs to be taught: thereby wee perceyue
the care that he hath of vs, &amp; finde much better that he is our father
and hath not forgotten vs. And moreouer this ſerueth to ingraue the
truth of the Goſpell in our hartes, to the end wee may know how it
is not a doctrine that proceedeth of men, but as of Gods ſendyng?
And that although he be ſerued by his creatures: yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
he maketh them as inſtruments of his ſpirit, and it is he himſelf that
gouerneth them. Yee ſee in effect how we may make our profite of
this doctrine. But yet doo wee vnderſtand Gods grace the better, in
that it is ſayd that he hath chozen vs and kept vs too himſelf, euen
from our moothers wombe. And yet is this no let, but that he hath
alſo moreouer reſerued vs from before the creation of the worlde,
according as Sainct Paule ſpeaketh in other textes:<note place="margin">Eph. 1. a. 4.</note> howbeeit it
<pb facs="tcp:23060:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is ynough that in this place he excludeth all that euer commeth of
men. VVhen a childe commeth out of his moothers wombe, what
bringeth he with him? VVhat woorthineſſe [hath he]? Surely he
is a poore carkeſſe full of filth and vncleanneſſe. Now then if God
marke vs out at the time when there is nothing in vs woorthie too
bee accepted of him, or whiche deſerueth any loue or lyking: wee
may perceyue thereby, that if he apply vs too any honorable ſeruis
afterwarde, it is by reaſon of his owne mercie, accordingly as they
whome God gathereth too bee of his flocke, are called inſtruments
of his goodneſſe. Thus yee ſee that the cauſe why Sainct Paule
ſpeaketh purpoſely of his birthe, is too ſhewe that there was no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
on his owne behalfe when God drewe him, but that God
had reſpect too his owne eternall election, the which he continued,
in that it was his will that the ſame creature ſhoulde come into the
worlde, and had alwayes guyded it too that ende. Then let vs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
our ſelues, that when ſoeuer God beſtoweth any of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
vppon vs, wee muſte alwayes come backe too this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
namely too mount vp too his euerlaſtyng purpoſe. Not that
wee bee able too comprehende howe or why hee hath chozen vs,
(for that paſſeth all capacitie of man.) But for that wee muſte con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that Gods preferring of vs before thoſe whom he leaueth as
of caſtes, is not for that hee findeth vs woorthie or capable of ſuche
a benefite, but bycauſe hee had ſo ordeyned before he had created
vs and put vs intoo the worlde, yea and euen before there was ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heauen or earth.<note place="margin">Iohn. 6. d. 37.</note> And that is the cauſe why it is ſayd that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth
vs to be giuen to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt before we can come
vnto him. And who is it that maketh that gift? It is not euery mans
offering of himſelf of his owne meere motion. True it is that wee
ought to do ſo: for our fayth importeth obedience &amp; ſacrifize, ſo as
it beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vs to dedicate our ſelues to God willingly, &amp; to make
a preſent bothe of our bodies and of our ſoules vnto our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, as to him that hath bought vs. Neuertheleſſe, this (as I ſayd) is
not of our owne meere motion, but God muſt be fayne to bowe vs
therevnto. And why ſo? Euen bycauſe wee were his afore. And
how belong wee too him? not by inheritance, nor by any title that
wee can alledge on our owne behalf, but only bycauſe he choze vs.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23060:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now then wee ſee what this texte importeth. But let vs come backe
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oo the cheefe poynt that Sainct Paule treateth of heere. For the
things that I haue diſcourſed hithertoo, are but too ſhewe that our
adoption ſerueth not too bereeue God of his glorie, whiche thing
they doo that bragge of their owne free will, vertues, and merites.
VVherefore lette vs put away all ſuch pryde, and confeſſe that wee
bee beholden too God for all things. Howbeit let vs alſo conſider
therewithall, that Sainct Paules rehearſing of this chaunge, is too
aſſure vs throughly, that the doctrine whiche he deliuered vs in his
lyfe, and which wee haue nowe ſtill in wryting, is not of this world,
nor forged of his owne brayne, but a thing wherevnto he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
of God. And wee haue neede to bee grounded vppon ſuche
a certaintie, for elſe, whereas our fayth ought too gette the vpper
hande of Satan and of all things that are agaynſt our Saluation: it
ſhould alwayes ſtagger, yea and bee but a waueryng opinion. But
nowe let vs ſee a little what battelles wee haue too indure. If wee
leaned vntoo men, what ſhoulde become of vs? what ſteadineſſe
would there bee in vs? Seyng wee bee dayly aſſayled with ſo many
temptations, that by all lykelihood wee ſhould bee ouerwhelmed
and periſhe: as for example, in that our nature is ſo wholly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
too diſtruſt, too lying, too vanitie, and too deceyt: and againe,
in that we haue ſo many luſtes, which are as ſtormes &amp; whirlwindes
to ouerthrow all our fayth: were it poſsible for vs too ſtand or too
haue any conſtancie, if we were not grounded vpon God, and knew
that the doctrine which wee followe is the pure truth that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
out of his mouth. Then ſtandeth it vs on hande too haue that
firſt of all. True it is that among the Papiſts men wil content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with ſome imaginacion. For it is ynough with them, too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
as the Church beleeueth, as they ſay. Howbeit in the meane
whyle the Diuell holdeth them in his nettes, and they be like ſillie
beaſts that are ſtarke blind. But as for vs, wee muſte bee out of all
doubt, that we be taught of God, and that the woord which we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
is his. Therefore it behoueth vs to giue eare too the preaching
of the doctrine which was brought by S. Paule, and therewithall too
conſider that S. Paule did not thruſt himſelf in of his owne head, but
that God ſerued his owne turne by him, as by an inſtrument that
<pb facs="tcp:23060:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he had ordayned too that purpoſe. Thus yee ſee wherevntoo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth
vs too referre that which is ſpoken heere. For had S. Paule
followed Chriſtianitie from his childehood, or had he learned it at
ſchoole, truly it had bin a gift of God: but then had not we had ſuch
an open auouchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and euident record as we haue by his chaunge,
in that of a rauening woolfe he became not onely a ſheepe, but alſo
a ſheepeheard: and whereas he had bin a deadly enemy of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
now he is become a ſeruant of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
erſt he had nothing in him but blaſphemie, crueltie, pryde and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
wee ſee he hath the zeale of Gods ſpirite, he hath all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
and meekeneſſe. Seyng then that wee perceyue ſo great and
ſuddayne a chaunge, it is as much as if God had vttered his power
of purpoſe that S. Paule ſhould not be taken for a mortall man. And
verely for the ſame cauſe alſo did God take vp Moyſes intoo the
Mountayne,<note place="margin">Exod. 24. c. 18.</note> and keepe him there by the ſpace of fortie dayes, when
he intended too haue his lawe publiſhed. For had Moyſes [foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with]
preached the things which he knew by reuelation: ſurely he
had diſcharged himſelf of his duetie as a true ſeruant of God: but
the thing had not bin knowen too be ſo excellent as it was, in that
God kept him fortie dayes vppon the Mountayne, and afterwarde
made him come downe with a ſhyning face, ſo as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could no more
abyde too looke vppon him without dazeling of their eyes, than too
looke vpon the brightneſſe of the Sunne, but he was fayne too put
a veyle before him. Therefore all theſe things ſerue too proue, that
he deuiſed not the law of his owne head, but was as an Angel of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
yea and muche more excellent than an Angell, for ſomuch as
God had ordeyned him therevntoo. In lyke cace is it with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
for Ieſus Chriſte could well haue chozen ſuch as had bin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercyzed
a long whyle aforehand in the Lawe and holy Scriptures,
and had ſome countenance to the worldward, and had already pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaced
ſome reputacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and degree among men: but he choze poore
ſillie ſoules and handycraftes men without any learning at all, and
yet notwithſtanding made them too ſpeake after ſuche a ſtraunge
faſhion, that through the eloquence and hyghneſſe of knowledge
which was in them, they paſſed all ſuche as had bin eſteemed moſte
skilfull and ſharpwitted in the worlde. VVee ſee then that by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:23060:64"/>
Gods ſo ſuddayne chaunging of them, their doctrine was made of
ſo much the more authoritie vntoo vs. Euen ſo ſtandeth the cace
concerning Sainct Paule. That then is a thing which ought too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
vs, and when ſoeuer wee bee taught by that whiche hee hath
left in wryting, let vs aſſure our ſelues that God ſpeaketh too vs,
and that he was the inſtrument of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
furthermore, <hi>that he did not then commune with fleſh and bloud,</hi>
that is too ſay with any mortall man, <hi>but went ſtreytwayes into Arabie,
where be abode three yeares, and from thence returned too Ieruſalem too
ſee Peter, and ſawe not any other of the Diſciples than him and Iames.</hi>
Herein it might ſeeme at the firſt bluſhe, that S. Paule had to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſdeyned the reſt of the Apoſtles. For although he had the
knowledge of the Goſpell, yet might he well haue bin more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
and the conſent and agreement that Gods children haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelues, doth ſtrengthen them the more, as wee finde by
experience. It ſeemeth then that Sainct Paule diſdayned a meane
that was fit for himſelfe, and might haue ſtoode the whole Churche
in good ſteade. But there was a ſpeciall reaſon that drewe him the
other way: which was, that men ſhould not ſurmyze that it came to
paſſe by worldly meanes, for it was not yet ſufficiently knowen.
Then if he had gone too Ieruſalem, and communed with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
men woulde haue ſayde, this man is in ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me doubt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he went thither too diſpute, and in the ende was ouercome.
And ſo it would haue bin thought that it had bin of mannes doyng,
and the glorie of God had bin ſo much darkened thereby. But
when as Sainct Paule had bin a man full of crueltie, that ſought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but too aboliſhe the memoriall of the Goſpell, a ſheader of
the bloud of the Martyrs, a blaſphemer of God, and an inforcer
of the poore weakelings too renounce Ieſus Chriſte: when as men
ſawe him too bee ſuch a one, that is too ſay, as a man beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with ſuch rage, as he would neuer leaue till he had borne downe
the Goſpell: and yet notwithſtanding ſawe him ſo chaunged in one
minute of an hower, and noman ſpake to him: yea and blinded and
beaten downe too the earth, ſo as he lay there lyke a poore dead
man, and afterwarde was rayzed vp agayne as it were out of his
graue, and his eyes by miracle opened, ſo as God ſente a man
<pb facs="tcp:23060:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vntoo him of no greate fame named Ananias, who baptized him,
ſtrengthened him, and made him too receyue the viſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble tokens of
the holy Ghoſt: and that therevppon he went his way into Arabie,
a countrie where Ieſus Chriſte had neuer bin ſpoken of afore, (for
although the Iewes had bin ſomewhat diſperſed, yet was the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
vtterly vnknowen:) I ſay, when wee ſee howe Sainct Paule
went that way too woorke: who is he that can ſay that he learned
aught of men, or that he had bin wonne too it by diſputation, or by
reaſon, or by any other maner of [worldly] meanes at all? Nay
rather wee ſhall bee conſtrayned too graunt, that what ſoeuer was
too bee found in him, was of Gods putting intoo him. That then
was the ſpeciall reaſon why Sainct Paule communed not with the
Apoſtles. And truely heere he ſpeaketh of them as it were in way
of skorne, terming them fleſh and bloud. Howbeit, it is not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing
of the giftes whiche they had receyued of God, when wee
make compariſon betweene our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt and them. And
wee ought too marke that well. For when wee ſpeake of men,
ſurely they may well bee called fleſhe and bloud, as wee ſee they
bee called in the firſte of Iohn.<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. b. 13</note> Yee ſee then that men of their
owne nature are nothing but corruption. And for aſmuche as they
would fayne preſume to much of their owne wiſedome and power,

                  </gap>. a. 6.</note> fleſhe and bloud. Yea and ſometymes by this ſaying <hi>fleſh and
bloud,</hi> the holy Scripture meaneth this ſinfull nature of ours whiche
wee haue ſince the fall of Adam. For wee haue no more the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptneſſe
that was in vs, but contrarywiſe wee bee vtterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
or rather beaſtly, and there is nothing but filthineſſe in vs, ſo
as wee be not able too doo any thing that is aught woorth, further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth
than God gouerneth vs. Lo in what wize we be termed fleſh
and bloud. And therefore it is ſayd, that our beyng inlightened in
the knowledge of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, commeth not to vs by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage,
nor is had of fleſh and bloud, but that we bee mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God through his begetting of vs newe agayne by his holy
ſpirite, yea euen after a ſpeciall maner. For wee woulde holde
altogither with the worlde, if he ſhould let vs alone too our ſelues.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23060:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Againe, in the ſixtenth of Sainct Mathew it is ſayde, that fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſhe and
bloud had not tolde Peter and his fellowes that Ieſus Chriſt was
the ſonne of God:<note place="margin">Mat. 16. c. 18.</note> but the heauenly father. Thus ye ſee how men
are called fleſh and bloud: namely when they bee compared vntoo
God, to ſhewe that wee haue not ought but corruption in vs. True
it is that our ſoules are immortall: neuertheleſſe the Scripture
ſpeaketh ſo of vs in way of contempt, to the ende wee ſhoulde bee
voyde of preſumption. But as for the Apoſtles, they were alreadie
regenerated by Gods ſpirite: and therefore there was more in
them than fleſhe and bloud, as wee haue ſeene by the Text laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.
Yet notwithſtanding, whenſoeuer they bee compared with
God, then muſt al that is of our owne nature be comprehended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the termes of fleſhe and bloud. And why? For elſe it ſhoulde
come in queſtion, too knowe whether the Apoſtles might by their
owne woorthineſſe and excellencie preiudice the Goſpell, as the
foreſayde troublers pretended to ſhrowd themſelues withall. But
Saint Paule ſheweth, that if God withdraw that which is his, there
ſhall remaine nothing either in Peter, Iohn, or Iames, but that they
be the ſonnes of Adam as other men are, ſo as there is nothing in
them but corruption. So then let vs not abuſe the gracions giftes
that God hath put into them, to deface the Maieſtie of him and the
Goſpell. Thus ye ſee after what maner Saint Paule ſpeaketh here
of the Apoſtles. For wee haue heard howe hee ſayde heeretoofore,
that if an Angell from heauen ſhould gainſay the Goſpell, he ought
to bee hated and curſed as if hee were a Diuell. And how ſo? Is it
meete that men ſhould ſpeake ſo reprochfully of the Angels which
are ſo noble creatures, and which are called the heauenly princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities
and powers of God?<note place="margin">Ephe. 1. d. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </note> It is no wrong at all too doo ſo too
them, when it commeth to the yeelding of ſoueraine dominion too
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt who is their heade, for it behoueth them too
be placed vnder him. Therefore let vs not thinke wee haue anie
wrong offered vs, though we were troden a hundred tymes vnder
foote, ſo it bee to the exalting of Gods name, and that our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt may haue his dutie and ſupremacie reſerued vnto him,
ſo as hee may bee heard both of great and ſmall, and all men ſubmit
themſelues too him in true obedience of fayth. Nowe herevppon
<pb facs="tcp:23060:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we may gather howe blinde the wretched Papiſtes are in honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Apoſtles and Martyrs in ſuch wiſe, that God is robbed of
his honour and ſeruice, inſomuch as it ſhould ſeeme that all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
and is reſerued to him is put to the ſpoile and pray [among
them.] For what difference make they betweene him and hys
creatures? And beſides that, our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is as good as
buryed, bycauſe they plucke awaye the office from him that was
giuen him. For in ſted of beeing our Aduocate too giue vs ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
vntoo God his father, and that wee ſhoulde go right foorth
vntoo him if wee intende too haue our prayers and ſupplications
heard: they haue ſette vp an infinite multitude of Aduocates, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones
and Interceſſours, and Ieſus Chriſt is Iacke out of office.
Nowe when wee ſee that the creatures haue obteyned ſuch honour
among men, that by that meanes God is as it were thruſt backe,
and his worde borne downe: thereby we perceyue that the Diuill
hath turned all vpſide downe. Therefore how ſoeuer the world go,
let our eſteeming of men be after ſuch a ſort, as God may hold ſtill
that which is his owne: and if we compare him with his creatures, let
vs conſider that all is but vanitie, and whatſoeuer commendation
they haue here, the ſame is a recorde which God giueth vs of hys
loue, to the ende we ſhould keepe onwards vnto him, and he be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.
Yea and let vs conſider, that we cannot honour God as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth,
but by ſubmitting our ſelues to his worde. For all they that
make many Ceremonies to beare men in hande that they deſire to
ſerue God, are miſlyked of him, vntill ſuch time as they be ſubdued
to him, and alſo to his worde. And that alſo is a cauſe why S. Paule
ſtryueth for the authoritie of the Goſpell. For hee thinkes it not
ynough too haue God and Ieſus Chriſt talked of: but hee will alſo
haue euerie man to receyue the doctrine conteyned in the Goſpel,
without gainſaying. And heereby wee ſee, how that nowadayes all
Religion is decayed, and there is nothing but helliſhe confuzion in
Poperie. For there is talking ynough of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,
but after what ſort? Knowe they his power? Can they tell too
what ende hee is ſent of God his Father, and what benefytes hee
bringeth vs? No whit at all. He ſhall be called the Sauiour of the
worlde, and in the meane whyle euerie man ſeeketh his ſaluation
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:23060:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in himſelfe, or at ſome Saints hand of his owne forging. Lo at what
poynt they be. And therefore ſo much the more doth it ſtande vs
vpon, to beare in minde the thing that is ſhewed vs heere: which is,
that whenſoeuer God is ſpoken of,<note place="margin">Eſa. 24. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is not any that muſt not bee thruſt vnder foote, too the ende that
God may haue all preeminence. And foraſmuch as God accepteth
any honour or ſeruice that wee doo vntoo him, vntill wee bee
ſubiect too his woorde: let vs receyue the whole doctrine of the
Goſpell and let nothing plucke vs backe from yeelding ſuch reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
therevnto, as too ſubmit our ſelues too all that is conteyned
therein. This in effect is the thing that wee haue too gather vppon
this place, where the Apoſtles are termed fleſh and bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
whereas Saint Paule addeth, <hi>that hee went to Ieruſalem too ſee
Peter:</hi> it is a ſure recorde that his former ſpeaking of his going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
Arabie, was not of any pride or diſdayne, but too the ende
that Gods grace might bee knowne, and that no worldly meanes
might bee made as a veyle too keepe men from knowing that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt had wrought by ſingular myracle, in that a man whiche
had bin ſo ſtubborne before, had beene brought too the lure. Thus
yee ſee on the on the one ſyde, howe Saint Paule ment too reſerue
vntoo God his due: and on the other ſide, that yet notwithſtanding
he ment to ſhewe there was good agreement betwene him and the
other Apoſtles. And euen ſo muſt we do. For in many men there are
alwayes two euill extremities too bee found in that behalfe. There
are ſome ſcoffers which make pretence to magnifie gods grace, and
in the meane time are but traytors to God, full of poyſon &amp; pride,
preferring their owne dreames and dotages before him. If a man ſay
vnto them, how now? Seeing that God hath graunted grace to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men, and they be knowen to be men wel ſeene in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and they imploy themſelues faithfully in preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
to vs: therefore why do ye not agree with them? O (ſay they) I
haue not to do with any man liuing vpon earth, I ground my ſelfe
vppon none but God. Theſe are the prowde and ſtately, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to haue the holy Ghoſt in their heades, &amp; certaine reuelations
of the holy Ghoſt, and yet notwithſtanding they breake the vnitie
<pb facs="tcp:23060:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Church, and diſpize Gods gracious giftes. So much the more
therefore doth it ſtande vs on hande to keepe the meaſure that we
ſee heere. For although Saint Paule haue on the one ſide declared,
that he went ſtraight wayes into Arabie as ſoone as he was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
too the ende it might be knowne that Ieſus Chriſt had bin hys
only maiſter and teacher, as indeed he only ought alwayes to haue
preeminence ouer vs: yet neuertheleſſe he hath alſo well ſhewed
[on the other ſyde,] that he ment to be in vnitie of good concorde
with the reſt of the Apoſtles, and was deſirous too haue it knowne
to the whole worlde, that his minde was too agree with them, and
that they were as inſtruments of the holy Ghoſt. For as I haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
afore, it is no ſmall helpe too the confirmation of our fayth,
when we be ſo linked togither, &amp; that God calleth not any one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
alone, but hath many that ſubmit themſelues too him, ſo that it is
ſeene that they be guided all by one ſpirite, that they bee all of one
minde, that they ame all at one marke, and that they ſhew themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
to be Gods children, by going on forwarde too the heritage of
the heauenly life. That helpe then is fit for the confirmation of our
fayth: and it was for Saint Paule too ſhewe that hee was rightly lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with the Apoſtles, and ment not too ſeparate himſelfe from
them. VVherfore let vs marke the maner of dealing that is ſhewed
vs here, to the intent we ſwarue not to the one extremitie or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But there are ſome ſo lightheaded, that they will giue ouer the
doctrine of the Goſpell for right naught, and as ſoone as they heare
a man ſpeake, by and by they muſt receyue whatſoeuer hee ſayth.
Howbeeit, if we bee no better ſettled than ſo, ſhall we bee able too
withſtande all the alarums whiche the Diuell our mortall enimie
will giue vs? Then muſt men ſtand ſtoute to their tackling, and all
of vs from the moſt too the leaſt, muſt ſticke faſt togither too our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. For like as he is our heade, ſo muſt he alſo bee
exalted,<note place="margin">Eſa. 11. c. 12</note> and (as the Prophete Eſay ſayth) he is the marke that all
men muſt looke at. Sith it is ſo, let vs learne to forbeare our reſting
in ſuch wiſe vpon the outwarde appearance of men, that the ſame
ſhoulde impeache the maieſtie of Gods Sonne. But yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
when we be once fully ſettled vpon that poynt: we muſt all
of vs be contented to be taught of him that is giuen vs too bee our
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:23060:67"/>
teacher, and not be ſo prowde as to ſtande euerie man in his owne
conceyt, (for ſo ſhall we but make variance in the Church:) but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to agree togither, and euery of vs put forth that which is giuen
him, that the vnitie of our fayth may be [as a bonde] to knit vs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither,
ſo as we may make one Temple of God. For it is not ſayde
for nought, that we be the liuely ſtones whereof Gods Temple is
builded. Now if euerie of vs ſhoulde bee ſundred from other, and
left alone by himſelfe: what woulde become of it? Shoulde there
be any building? No: but contrariwize there woulde be vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.
If we couet to haue God dwell among vs, and too bee of
houſeholde with vs, wee muſt worſhip him truely, and euery of vs
apply himſelfe as much as hee can poſsibly to his neighbours. Not
that we muſt ſhrinke from God to cleaue to men (for it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that we ſhoulde all of vs bee at diſcorde one with another, and
togither by the eares as whot as fire among our ſelues:) but when
wee bee knitte vnto God, that is a good harmonie: and that is the
meane for vs to holde the way that Saint Paule hilde, who woulde
not match himſelfe with the Apoſtles to darken Gods glorie, or to
hinder the doctrine of the Goſpell, and yet notwithſtanding fayled
not to come from a ſtraunge countrey to ſeke them, yea euen with
great trauell, and with the induring of right hard temptation: for
(as we ſee) they charged him to haue bin a perſecuter of God &amp; his
truth. Seeing that S. Paule came after that ſort to ſhewe howe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
he was with the reſt of the Apoſtles, and too giue recorde
thereof to the whole Church: therein wee ſee, that the deſirouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
which he had to ſerue God, and his ſtoutneſſe too aduaunce
Gods word aboue all creatures, letted him not to be full of curteſie
and modeſtie alſo. And euen ſo muſt we do too. That is to ſay, we
muſt receiue the conſent of our brethren, &amp; ſeeke to conforme our
ſelues too them in ſuch wiſe, as we may all be members of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and Ieſus Chriſt be our heade, and not be ſcattered aſunder, nor
euery man walke alone by himſelfe, but ſeeke to communicate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuch maner one with another, as euery man may guide his ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and all go on forwarde to one marke, and eche of vs giue cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to other, ſo as there may be ſene a good agreement among vs.
True it is that wee cannot haue peace with all men: wee ſhall fayle
<pb facs="tcp:23060:68"/>
greatly of that. And therefore S. Paule in another place ſayth, that
we muſt ſeeke to be at peace with all men,<note place="margin">Ro. 12. d. 18</note> at leaſtwiſe as much as
is in vs: whereby he ſheweth, that we ſhall be conſtreyned to bee at
variance with many folkes. For the Diuell hath many vnderlings,
and they be all of them bent agaynſt Gods worde: and we alſo muſt
ſet our ſelues agaynſt them, if we intende to haue the pure doctrine
of the Goſpell on our ſyde. But howſoeuer the cace ſtande, if wee
ſee any man willing to ſubmit himſelfe too our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,
let vs receyue him, let vs preuent him, let vs ſeeke to agree wholy
togither, and let vs not looke to be honoured aboue other men, nor
ſay how now? If I ſhould agree with ſuch a man, it would ſeeme that
I am become his vnderling. VVo bee too vs if we haue ſuch pride
in vs. But let our onely ſeeking bee, to haue Ieſus Chriſt to be our
heade, and in ſuch wiſe become members of his bodie, as wee may
all woorſhip him, and call vppon him with one mouth in vnitie of
fayth.</p>
            <p>And now let vs fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God

he intended to gather togither gods children, to the end they might

Beſides this,<note place="margin">Act. 9. d. 26</note> Saint Luke ſheweth vs that Saint Paule muſt needes
haue bin led with an inuincible conſtancie, ſeeing hee ſtepped not
out of the way, although men made no reckening at all of his doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
For he ſayth that the faythfull had him in ſuſpition, and that
they ſhunned him when hee came too Ieruſalem. Nowe it was a
greeuous temptation to Saint Paule, to ſee that he coulde not bee
receyued intoo the companie of the faythfull, conſidering that hee
had ſuffered ſo much alreadie. For we knowe that at his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to Damaſco,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. g 33.</note> the gates were ſhet vpon him, (as we haue ſeene
heeretofore) ſo that he was fayne too bee let downe in a Panyer or
Basket. Ye ſee then that as ſoone as hee was conuerted to the faith
of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, hee was by and by toſſed with great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions.
After that, hee went intoo the Countrey of Arabie, and
there trauelled faythfully. And thinketh hee for all that, too haue
friendſhip and attonement with the faythfull? The gate is ſhette
agaynſt him, and men ſhunne him as a wilde beaſt. But before [hee
was turned to the fayth,] he had bin honoured, and in great credite,
bothe with the enimies of the Goſpell, and in the Sinagog of the
Iewes. He had renounced all theſe things, euen ſo farre as too ſee
himſelfe baniſhed out of the place: and yet for all that, they vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed
not to admit him to haue place in the Church. VVherefore he
might haue bin ſo greeued at ſuche vnkindneſſe, as it might haue
made him to haue giuen ouer all, if he had had his minde tyed here
bylowe. Howbeeit foraſmuch as he had giuen himſelfe wholly too
Gods ſeruice, and was fully determined too holde out to the ende
although men cunned him no thanke for his labour: therefore hee
turned not aſide from his right way. And ſuch examples ought too
incourage vs at this day, when wee ſee there are ſo fewe (yea euen
in the Church,) that like well of the thing that is done of a pure and
right meaning zeale, inſomuch that ſome backbyte it through en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,
others are ſo ſqueymiſh as a man cannot by any meanes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
them, and other ſome are full of wicked ſlaunderouſneſſe and
lying. Therefore foraſmuch as we ſee howe men doo oftentymes
cauſe vs to ſwarue one way or other: let vs learne to giue our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
in ſuche wiſe vntoo God, as we may ſtedfaſtly continue in the
way which hee ſheweth vs, and not excuze our ſelues by our owne
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:23060:69"/>
weakneſſe, ſeeing that Saint Paule goeth before vs, and reacheth
vs his hande. He was a fraile man as we be, and yet did God ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
him in ſuch wiſe by his holy ſpirite, that he ouerpaſſed ſuche
lettes. VVherefore ſeeing wee perceyue our ſelues to bee weake,
let vs beſeech God to arme vs with ſuch conſtancie, as wee may not
ceaſſe to diſcharge our duetie towardes him, though ſome miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
vs, ſome blame vs, and otherſome mocke vs, and make none
account of all our labour when we indeuer to doo well. Although
then that our labour ſeeme to bee loſt and miſpent, yet let it ſuffice
vs that God lyketh and alloweth of it. And ſo yee ſee what wee
haue too gather vppon that Text. Aboue all things, let vs not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet
to be renowmed, and too get great fame in this worlde: for let
vs ſtreyne our ſelues as muche as may bee poſsibly, and yet ſhall
wee neuer bee better, than Saint Paule was. After he had preached
the Goſpell in ſuch wyſe, yea euen as a man continually rapt vp
intoo heauen, inſomuche that although the reuelation whereof he
ſpeaketh in the ſeconde too the Corinthians,<note place="margin">2. Co. 12. a. 2</note> was exhibited too him
but for one tyme, yet the frute of it ſhewed it ſelfe all the tyme
of his lyfe: yet notwithſtanding hee was vnknowne in the meane
while: yea euen in all the Churches of Iewrie. And ſo it might ſeme
well that hee had not greatly profyted, ſeeing that all his labour
was buryed. But it was ynough for him that God edified the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
ſtraungers by his meanes. VVee ſee then that hee ſought not
too bee muche renowmed, nor too purchaſe credite and authoritie
among men. As concerning that hee ſayeth, <hi>the Churches of Iewrie
that were in Christ:</hi> hee addeth that worde of purpoſe, bicauſe there
was yet ſtill ſome ſeede of God among the Iewes, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
were ſo giuen too them, as they were not vtterly cut off, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
ſuch time as they renounced Ieſus Chriſt quite and cleane, and
thereby were vtterly bereft of the inheritance of the life that was
aſsigned vntoo them. For like as God had choſen the lyne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:
ſo our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt came intoo the worlde too bee
the miniſter of thoſe whome God had ſo adopted, and to performe
the promiſes that had bin giuen to their fathers. Our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt reiected not the Iewes too whome the promiſes belonged
(according alſo as it is ſayde in the ſeconde of the Actes) but the
<pb facs="tcp:23060:70"/>
Church of God abode among them ſtill,<note place="margin">Act. 2. f. 39.</note> and their Circumciſion
was not a thing deuiſed by man. And although they were al growen
out of kinde, and many errours and wicked opinions were crept
in among them, ſo as Gods ſeruice was turmoyled, and Religion
corrupted: yet notwithſtanding, that people was acknowledged
for Gods houſeholde flocke. The Sinagoges therefore that had not
yet bewrayed their vnbeleefe by withdrawing themſelues from Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, are reckened heere by Saint Paule for Churches, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beeit,
not for perfect Churches, for they were not yet regenerated
in Ieſus Chriſt. For then was the renuing of the whole worlde,
when Ieſus Chriſt was ſent too bring home vntoo God, both thoſe
that were neare hande,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. d. 17</note> and thoſe that were farre off: neare hande,
as the Iewes which had the lawe ſtill: and a farre off, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
men who had no likelihood of the heauenly kingdome, bicauſe
God had left them like poore wilde beaſtes, and they were ſtrayed
away in their owne ſuperſtitions and Idolatries. But Ieſus Chriſt
came to gather all togither, and to knit all things togither again that
were ſcattered afore. And thereby we ſee how the law ought to haue
led the Iewes to the Goſpell, as it is ſayde throughout all the holy
Scripture. And it is very needfull for vs [to knowe the ſame,] leaſt
wee ſurmize that none of all the things that are conteyned in the
law, can ſtand vs in any ſtead in theſe dayes. For it is certaine, that
although the Ceremonies be no more in vſe, yet the truth and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of them remaine alwayes vntoo vs, ſo as wee cannot euen at
this day be faythfull, but we muſt alſo be the children of Abraham,
and the diſciples of Moyſes. Not that we muſt be hilde ſtill vnder
the olde ſhadowes: but that wee muſt match things togither which
cannot be put aſunder: that is to wit, the Law and the Goſpell. But
yet further, let vs vnderſtande, that we cannot at this day be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the Church before God, (that is to ſay, all the companies of
men in the worlde cannot obteyne that honourable tytle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) except
we bee in Ieſus Chriſt. For that head muſt knitte vs vnto God his
father, and by that meanes muſt we haue enterance into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen. And therefore as for all them that knowe not Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, although they bee marked with baptiſme, and beare the
name of Chriſtians: yet are they but as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

common report was, that hee which had earſt perſecuted the fayth, dyd
preach the ſame, and that God was glorified by that meanes.</hi> Heere once
agayne wee ſee that Saint Paule preacheth not his owne prayſes,
for hee condemneth himſelfe too haue beene an enimie and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter
of the Church. True it is that hee ſpeaketh of the common
report: but yet doth hee rehearce the verie thing as it was done in
deede. So then hee cloketh not the thing that was too hys owne
reproche and ſhame. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>man might haue caſt him in the teeth, that
hee had perſecuted the poore faythfull ones, that hee had too the
vttermoſt of his power ſhed innocent bloud, yea and that hee had
compelled the weaklings to blaſpheme. But yet for al this, he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to this inditement of his owne accord, and ſpeaketh not as moſt
men do, who make as it were a glorie of it, that they haue bin eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Goſpell. It is certaine that Saint Paule in making ſuche
reherſall, was touched with earneſt ſorineſſe for that misbehauiour
of his,<note place="margin">1. Co. 15. a. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </note> according as in another Text hee ſayth, that hee is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to bee called an Apoſtle. Nowe then, yee may bee ſure he felt
alwayes ſome pricking in his heart, for that hee had earſt ſo rebelled
agaynſt God, and bin ſo euill mynde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, yea and altogither ſpitefull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
the Goſpell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neuertheleſſe howſoeuer the world went with
him, he had leuer to acknowledge his fault with al humilitie, than to
leaue the thing vnſought that might be to Gods glorie. So then let
vs learne with him, too acknowledge ſimply the offences that wee
haue committed, when it ſtandeth vpon the honouring of God and
let vs not be loth to receiue ſome ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e before men. For that is the
way for vs alſo too haue our ſinnes buryed before God, ſo as they
may neuer come to account, nor to remembrance more: that is to
wit, if we be contented too ſuſteyne ſome marke of infamie before
men if neede be, that God may haue his due. This therefore is the
thing whiche wee haue too remember in that it is ſayde, that the
common reporte wente that hee had earſt deſtroyed the fayth, as
hee had done in deede. Truely the fayth of the Goſpell ſhall
euermore get the vpper hande of all the aſſaultes of Sathan, and
<pb facs="tcp:23060:71"/>
of all the wicked: Therefore it lay not in Saint Paules power <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
aboliſhe the fayth nor too ouerthrowe it, at ſuch tyme as hee was
caryed with ſuch furie as wee haue ſeene. For the fayth is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vppon Gods truth whiche is inuincible, it is not ſubiect too the
opinions of men. But Saint Paule had reſpect heere too the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie
of the ſimple ſort whome hee had caſt downe as muche as
lay in him.<note place="margin">Act. 26. c. 11</note> For it is ſayde in the Actes, that hee did not onely
perſecute the Chriſtians, but alſo made ſome of them too recant.
Lyke as nowadayes when any great number is perſecuted, ſome
ſpare neyther theyr bloud nor theyr lyues for the confeſsing of the
name of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Otherſome redeeme this wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and flightfull lyfe by recanting, ſo that they baniſh themſelues
from the Kingdome of heauen as muche as they can, caſt themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
intoo Satans ſnares, and throw themſelues headlong into end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
death, and all too eſcape the handes of Tyrantes and of theyr
enimies. Therefore Saint Paules crueltie is purpoſely condemned
by the holy Ghoſt, for that he not onely was full of pryde and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe
agaynſt God, but alſo had inforced many too recant and
giue ouer the fayth of the Goſpell. Yee ſee then howe hee beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
himſelfe: and that muſt ſerue for our learning. For although
the worde abide ſtill in his full ſtate, and wee preiudice it not at all
by our weakneſſe: yet notwithſtanding the fayth is caſt downe in
our perſons. For if I ſwarue too pleaſe Gods enimies, or if I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyze
the truth, or by any meanes diſsemble: then is my fayth
defaced.</p>
               <p>True it is (as I haue ſayde alreadie) that Gods worde ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
holde his owne: and yet oftentimes the fall of one man ſhal
draw a great hauocke after it. If men ſee ſome one perſon recant, at
whoſe hande great conſtancie was looked for: then are many poore
ſoules ſhaken, and they wote not what too ſay. True it is that wee
ought not to reſt vppon men: but yet for all that, (as wee ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
agayne anon) there are many that haue neede too bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by good example. Nowe if a man caſt a ſtumbling blocke
in their way, they bee as good as vtterly ouerthrowne, or elſe they
be ſo hartſhaken as they wote not where to become. VVherfore let
vs lerne to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit our ſelues vnto god! &amp; ſeing that the diuel hath ſo
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:23060:71"/>
many vnderlings whiche ſeeke nothing but too bring all too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
and imploy themſelues wholy to ouerwhelme the Chriſtian
fayth: let vs pray God to ſtrengthen vs with ſuch conſtancie, as our
enimies may bee put too ſhame though we bee aſſayled neerelyer
than we bee. And let vs not onely care euery man for himſelfe, but
alſo for the great number of poore ſoules whom wee ſee as it were
in the VVoolues mouth: for they ſhall bee tormented and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and finally laboured by flatteryes and allurements too recant.
Therefore when wee fee ſuch aſſaultes gyuen too our brothers:
at leaſtwize let vs haue the heart too pray God too ayde them at
theyr neede, ſo as theyr fayth maye continue ſtill inuincible, and
get the vpper hande, and that they may neuer ſwarue, for all that
euer Satan and all his broode can practize. So muche the more
then behoueth it vs to marke this Text, where it is ſayde that Saint
Paule did caſt downe and deſtroy the fayth. For although God
will alwayes maintaine his truth: yet doo not men ceaſſe too go
too deſtruction, bycauſe theyr fayth is ſhaken by ſwaruing and
ſtepping aſyde from the right way. Furthermore, wee haue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
too confirme oure ſelues, ſo that althoughe men continue
not in ſuch conſtancie as were requiſyte, and too bee wyſhed, yet
let vs not bee too muche abaſhed at it, ſeeyng it is a thing that
hathe beene common in all ages. VVas Sainct Paules prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the leſſe credite, bycauſe there were manye renegates,
that in the ende ſhewed themſelues too bee Hypocrites and full
of vnfaythfulneſſe? Euen ſome of hys owne companions that
had beene linked wyth him as twoo fingers of one hande, gaue
him quyte ouer in the ende. And yet muſte not Sainct Paules
doctrine bee reiected for all that. Alſo when hee perſecuted the
Chriſtians before hee was conuerted, althoughe that manye had
renounced the ſaluation whiche they ſhoulde haue accepted as
it was offered them in Ieſus Chriſte: yet ought not the fayth
too bee defaced therefore. Likewyſe in theſe dayes when wee
ſee manie wretched folke quayle and giue ouer all, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
agayne holde oute at whoſe handes wee woulde not haue
looked for any greate conſtancie: let vs profite our ſelues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and bee oute of all doubt that although the whole worlde go
<pb facs="tcp:23060:72"/>
too ruyne, yet wee haue a good and ſure foundation, if wee reſt
vppon our God. Nowe whereas Saint Paule addeth, <hi>that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
glorifyed God in him:</hi> it is too ſhewe the better, (ſo as men
might perceyue it euen by eyſight) that the chaunge whiche was
made in him, proceeded of the onely hande of God. And all of it
commeth too this poynt, namely that hee had not thruſt himſelfe
in, and that it coulde not bee layde too his charge that he had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
at all aduenture, nor that there was any raſhneſſe or preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in him, or that hee was dryuen wyth any worldly reſpect,
but that God had gouerned and guyded him. For whereas the
faythfull had glorifyed God in him: it was by acknowledging that
the renuing of ſuche a man after that faſhion, and the making of a
rauening VVoolfe too become a Sheepe, yea and a Sheephearde,
was his woorke, and a verie miracle that proceeded from hym.
Marke that for a ſpeciall poynt. And heereby wee ſee briefly, that
they on whom God hath beſtowed giftes of grace, ſo as they
excell and are farre aboue all others, muſt not therefore aduaunce
themſelues, but finde meanes that the prayſe may bee yeelded too
him that hath right too it, and which hath deſerued it. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs keepe this rule of humilitie, whiche is, that wee ſeeke
not our owne eſtimation, nor too preferre our ſelues aboue oure
neighbours, for any of the gyftes that God hath beſtowed vppon
vs, but that God may alwayes haue his preeminence, and euerie
of vs learne too glorifie hym for it, when wee ſee any of hys gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
gyftes in any man. And that is verie needefull: for there
hath alwayes beene ſuch ſpytefulneſſe among men, that euerye
man enuyeth his companyon, bycauſe all men deſire to be greateſt.
And vntill God haue well tamed vs, and we be learned to obey
meekely: it is certayne that there is none of vs all, but he woulde
fayne ouerreache his fellowe. Nowe out of this ambition ſpring
alwayes enuie and ſtrife, togyther with diſdayne, grudging, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byting,
and ſuche other lyke things. But contrariwyſe, when
wee haue well digeſted the rule that is gyuen vs heere, by and
by wee learne too glorifie God as oft as wee ſee any tokens that
come from him. For when wee enuye thoſe whome God woulde
haue honoured, and go aboute too deface his giftes whiche wee
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23060:72"/>
perceyue in them, and all excellencie: ſurely wee doo not onely
offer wrong too mortall creatures, but alſo too God, who is the
Authour of the gyftes in them. [As for example:] I ſee a man
that is able too edifie the Churche, and God hath indued him with
ſuche gyftes, that his labour maye doo good: nowe I fearing leaſt
hee ſhoulde bee aduaunced too muche, and I bee plucked backe
by it, doo go aboute by my ſlaunders and ouerthwart meanes,
too deface and diminiſhe the thing that God hathe putte in hym.
It is all one as if hee woulde hyde all Gods gyftes, and bring them
in contempt.</p>
               <p>And whereof commeth this, but of the curſed ambition that
I ſpake of afore? Nowe in ſuche heauing at men, there will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
bee ſome ſtrife and hartburning: and too bee ſhort, all muſt
needes go too wracke, bycauſe God is offended at it. For at
whome doo theſe wrongs ame? True it is that I doo wrong too
my neighbour whome I diſgrace after that ſorte: but therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
I doo alſo blaſpheme God: ſo as wee cannot deface the giftes
and vertues that are in anye man, but that our dooyng is foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
matched wyth blaſphemie, wherethrough God is greeuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offended. And why? For God will bee acknowledged in all
his giftes, and when hee offereth himſelfe vntoo vs, it is good
reaſon that wee ſhoulde honour him. Therefore whenſoeuer
wee ſee any tokens of the holy Ghoſt in anye man, if wee treade
them vnder foote, or holde ſcorne of them, and miſlyke them:
is it not a defacing of Gods Maieſtie too the vttermoſte of oure
power? Truely wee will not confeſſe it, but yet is it ſo in verye
deede. And therefore muſte wee take ſo muche the better heede
of that whiche is ſpoken heere: namely that the faythfull glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
GOD in the perſon of Sainct Paule, when they ſawe hee
had wrought after that manner in hym: and that by that meanes
wee bee put in mynde that wee bee bounde too yeelde God hys
dew honour, whenſoeuer hee offereth or ſheweth vs anye of
his gyftes. For the reproche or wrong is not done too the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
but it is GOD that is vnregarded in ſo dooyng; by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hee is defrauded and robbed of the right that belongeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:23060:73"/>
And ſo much the more doth it ſtande vs on hande to remember
this leſſon, bycauſe we ſee this naughtineſſe too bee as great nowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes,
as euer it was. Howe many are there that commende the
giftes of God that are profitable for the common edifying, and for
the welfare of the whole Church? Nay rather, the Diuell beareth
ſuch a ſway, that euery man through his owne vnthankfulneſſe,
hindereth himſelfe too receyue the frute of Gods giftes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hee might bee parttaker. So then if wee had honeſt and well
meening heartes, ſurely wee ſhoulde alwayes fare the better when
wee ſawe any good example: and where any man is indued with
Gods giftes, wee ſhoulde applie the ſame too our owne profite:
but wee ſhette our ſelues out of the doores through our owne can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerhartedneſſe,
ſo as wee cannot inioy the benefite that is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vs. Againe, wee ſee there are ſome ſo ſpitefull, that of verie
malice they woulde fayne make men beleeue that the Sunne ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
not: yee ſhall ſee them ſo diueliſhe, that it ſpyteth them at the
heart too ſee Gods name glorifyed by another mans meanes.
Muſte that fellowe haue the honour ſay they? Verely as who
ſhoulde ſay, that euerie man ought not too haue an eye too the aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of himſelfe, that God might bee honoured as he deſerueth, in
the giftes that he giueth men as hee himſelfe liſteth. But there are
ſome ſo cankerhearted, that they coulde finde in theyr heartes too
plucke God out of his ſeate, rather than too abyde thoſe paciently
whome hee hath indued with his giftes, and which imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to the edifying of his Church, or that men ſhoulde receyue
them and acknowledge that God will be honoured in them. Seeing
then that men are nowadayes ſo full of malice and venim: we haue
the more neede too beare in minde what is ſhewed vs heere: that
is too witte, that God muſt bee glorifyed in all hys benefites that
are ſeene of vs, aſſuring our ſelues that they come all of his mere
liberalitie, and that hee is the Authour of all good qualities, ſo as
there is not that commendable thing in any creature, which ought
not too bee fathered vppon him. VVherefore let vs learne too
glorifie God in all poyntes and all reſpectes.</p>
               <p>Nowe herevpon he addeth, <hi>that yet once againe hee made a iourney
to Ieruſalem, and commoned with ſuch as bare the countenance and had moſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23060:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
authoritie, too the end he might not</hi> [ſeeme too] <hi>haue runne in vayne
heretofore, nor runne in vayne hereafter.</hi> Here wee ſee howe S. Paule
was neuer ſatisfied in ſeeking all that might bee too the aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the kingdome of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and too the taking
away of lettes, too the intent that the Goſpell might haue his free
courſe and full ſcope, yea &amp; that he was not led therevnto by vaine
preſumptuouſneſſe, as wee ſawe this morning: but conſidered that
the wicked ſorte woulde lay to his charge, that yet at length he came
too ſubmit himſelfe too the Apoſtles, too learne ſomewhat at their
handes. He conſidered that this might well bee ſayd vnto him: but
hap what hap would, he intended not too forſlowe his duetie in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
agreement with the [other] Apoſtles. I ſay not that he ſought
a worldly matter at worldly mens handes: but too make his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
well allowed in all poynts. For it is certaine that S. Paule go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too Ieruſalem, was not too skan who had taught beſt: but too
make a mutuall declaration among themſelues, that euery one of
them had ſerued God and preached the Goſpell faithfully. That is
the cauſe why S. Paule went thither. Therefore wee ſee heere his
mildeneſſe, in that he ſpareth not himſelfe at all, ſo the Church may
receyue any frute or confirmation of fayth by it, and men may bee
wel aſſured that the Apoſtles reckened him as one of their aray and
companie. Againe, beſides his mildeneſſe, wee ſee alſo his zeale. It
had bin ynough for him too haue runne into many countries: hee
had bin in Arabie and gone about all that land: he had bin in Cilicia
where he was borne, and alſo in Syria: and afterward hauing firſte
gone about the whole lande of Iewrie, he returned too Ieruſalem.
Seyng he made all theſe voyages, and tooke none eaſe at all: it was
a token that he would leuer haue bin dead than aliue, ſo the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte might haue bin furthered by it, and
the Churche haue receyued any profite by his trauell, as I ſayde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
VVhen we ſee ſuch examples, let vs on the one ſide learne to
cut off our owne ſlouthfulneſſe, and to be more hartie in praying
vntoo God, not too ſuffer vs too lie weltering alwayes in our vices
when wee bee ouer cold, but too waken vs vp, and too graunt vs
the grace too ſpende our ſelues in his ſeruis, ſpecially at neede and
when neceſsitie requireth it: and therewithall too ſtrengthen vs in
<pb facs="tcp:23060:74"/>
the doctrine that S. Paule bringeth, ſeyng that his ſeruing too the
glory of God and too our welfare, was in good earneſt. For had he
done it faynedly, it is certaine that he could haue gone too woorke
after the maner of worldly folke. But now ſeyng he came without
fetching, and ſought frendſhip &amp; concord with the faithful although
he were reiected, and ſpared not himſelfe though the paynes and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
that he tooke were not knowen of: it is a ſigne that he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
as before God, and that the holy Ghoſt guyded him in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.
Furthermore whereas he ſayeth that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moned with thoſe
that were eſteemed and had in reputation, to the end he might not
[ſeeme to] haue runne in vayne, nor runne in vayne [hereafter:] he
meeneth not that he had loſt his labour, if noman liuing had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of his doings: but he had an eye too many weaklings which
ſhould haue bin in doubte, if God ſhoulde not by that meanes haue
drawen them too the full knowledge and certaintie of the Goſpell.
I tolde you not long ſince, that our fayth muſte needes bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen,
(howbeit not in reſpect of it ſelf, but in reſpect of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie,)
when wee quayle. Euen ſo the labour of thoſe that preach
and publiſhe the Goſpell is vayne and fruteleſſe, bycauſe wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
not as were too bee wiſhed, except God bliſſe the labour and
giue it increacement. VVhereas Sainct Paule ſayeth, <hi>to the end it
may not ſeeme that he had runned in vayne:</hi> it is not to be vnderſtood
that ſuche as preache the Goſpell doo loſe their labour and auayle
not at all except God bliſſe their doyngs by his togither woorking:
for the preachyng of the Goſpell ſhall alwayes bee an acceptable
ſacrifize vnto God, although the world receyue nothing but death
and damnation by it, according as we haue ſeene how Sainct Paule
in the ſecond too the Corinthians ſayeth, wee be a good ſauour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God. Although the vnbeleeuers bee poyzoned by the Goſpell
through theyr owne leudneſſe, and it ſeeme too them that there is
nothing elſe but filthineſſe in it: yet wil God alwayes take in good
woorth the ſacrifize that wee offer vntoo him. So then, in this text
Sainct Paule ment not to ſay that he had runne in vayne, as though
God had bin mocked by him, and that his preachyng had bin too no
purpoſe: but he had an eye too thoſe whom he had taught, and too
thoſe alſo whom he intended too teach too the end, howe that they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23060:74"/>
were not edified when they perceyued not ſome good agreement
betwixt him &amp; the other Apoſtles, which were knowen to be ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Here a man might caſte ſome doubte,
whither thoſe perſones were faithfull or no, in aſmuch as they had
not beleeued the Goſpell, except they had bin ayded by men. The
anſwer is eaſie: namely that the only woord of God ought to ſuffize
for our fayth. If it be demaunded wherevpon our fayth is grounded,
and how it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to full perfection: it is by Gods woord. How ſo?
Are not the Sacramentes added to the woord? Yes, as helpes bicauſe
we be ouerweake: yea &amp; there is an Othe alſo, in ſomuch that God
ſweareth: all which things are ouer and beſides the woord, yea and
as an ouerplus. But he intendeth too lift vs vp againe when he ſeeth
vs ſtumble: and when we bee ſo weake that wee truſt not ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to his power as wee ſhould do, he giueth vs ſuche helpes. For
when wee ſee good agreement betweene Gods ſeruants, ſurely it
helpeth vs much, and it is a good warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto vs. Likewiſe the bloud
of Martyrs ought ſurely to bee a great furtherance of our ſaluation,
and wee muſt bee confirmed by it, as though it were ſome ſeale too
make Gods doctrine of the more authoritie among vs. Then are
they helpes too drawe vs to the fayth, and too mayntayne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
vs in the ſame. As much is too be ſayd of myracles. Miracles
do not giue vs beleef of Gods woord, but prepare vs to it. For God
vttereth his power in them, too the end we ſhould be the better wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened,
and his woord haue the more reuerence amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs, and finally
they ſerue vs for ſeales. For when we beleeue the Goſpell, and that
our beleefe is not vtterly out of all doubt: God addeth that confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo is it with the thing that S. Paule treateth of preſently.
For what a thing had it bin, if men had ſeene any diſagreement or
trouble betwixt ſuch as were of great authoritie? VVhat might the
ſillie ſoules haue thought, but that they muſte haue bin amazed at
it and ſayd, Alas, what meaneth this? VVee wote not on which ſide
too turne vs. Seing there is ſuch variance betweene thoſe whiche
ſhould ſhew vs the way, that one drawes cleane contrarie and backe
too other: alas howe may wee nowe bee aſſured? Thus yee ſee
that manie ſimple folke had bin ſore ſhaken. And that is it whiche
Sainct Paule mente by ſaying, that hee intended too common
<pb facs="tcp:23060:75"/>
with Peter and Iohn and Iames, for a witneſſe through the whole
world, that they allowed of his doings, and that the Goſpell whiche
he preached was no ſtraunge doctrine, but the very ſame Goſpell
that Ieſus Chriſt had taught his diſciples, and whiche he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
them too publiſh ouer all the worlde, and whereof he had
committed the charge vnto them. And hereby wee be done too vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
agayne, that beſide S. Paules zeale, mildeneſſe, ſtoutneſſe,
and conſtancie: God foreſaw euen then, that this agreement which
he vttered betwixt him and the other Apoſtles, would ſerue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
vs alſo euen at this day by reaſon of our weakeneſſe. For aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
therefore as wee bee rawe and weake, let vs apply to our vſe
all the helpes that God giueth vs, and let vs alſo for our parte inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
too agree in ſuch wyze with the children of God, as euery of vs
may bee a help too his neighbour, and not imbattell our ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
another. For wo be to him that ſhall ſow ſuch Darnell, as the
ignorant and weake ſort ſhall bee hindered by it. And therewithall
let vs conſider the miſchiefe that may happen, when ſuche as haue
the charge too preache the Goſpell, are ſo disfamed, by ſlaunders, or
elſe ſo brought in ſuſpicion, as a man cannot tell whither he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
them or no, as though God had not ordeyned them too ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
the kingdome of his Sonne, and too publiſh the Goſpell in
many Countries, or at leaſtwiſe among many folke that ſhould bee
edified by them. Curſed be he therefore that ſhall caſt ſuch a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingblocke
in their wayes. So then, let vs by all meanes indeuer
too agree with thoſe that ſerue God, and too help ſuch as haue the
gifte and abilitie too edifie the Churche, and are put in office. Let vs
lende them our hand, that their labour may bee profitable bothe for
our ſelues and for all our neighbours, that by that meanes God may
bee glorified, and wee more and more with one hart and one mouth
call vppon him as our father.</p>
               <p>And now let vs fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God
with acknowledgement of our faultes, praying him too make vs ſo
to feele them, as it may drawe vs to right repentance, and make vs
beſeeche him too vſe his infinite mercie towardes vs, vntill he haue

he ſheweth how there were deceyuers alſo, which wound the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues

that he vſeth, importeth ſo much, and it cannot wel be expreſſed [by

there were Couſiners which intermedled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vndermyningly

of the Goſpell to be corrupted. And let vs marke, that thoſe dogges
pretended not to reiect vtterly the whole doctrine of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

in the meane while their intent was to haue a halffaſte Goſpel,
which ſhould bee nother fiſhe nor fleſhe (as they ſay) but a medly of

them to haue profited truly in the ſchoole of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
for that they haue not ſuffered themſelues too be miſledde or thruſt

alwayes ſuffer ſome troublers to ſowe darnell ſeede, and too labour
too turne the pure doctrine vpſide downe. He coulde well lette it
if he thought good: but he giueth Satan the brydle, that our fayth

here. He ſayeth <hi>that they were crept in as it were by ſtealth, too
ſpie out the libertie whiche wee haue in our Lorde Ieſus Christe.</hi> The
libertie that hee ſpeaketh of heere, concerned Ceremonies. For
(as we haue touched alreadie, and ſhall more fully ſee agayne here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after)
God had ordeyned many figures vnder the Lawe, too holde
the Fathers in hope of oure Lorde Ieſus Chryſte, till hee were
come and ſhewed too the worlde. The Sacrifizes therefore with
all their appendants and appurtenances, and the Sanctuarie with all
that was in it, ſerued bycauſe our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte who is the
truthe and ſubſtance of thoſe things, had not yet ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
It was for the fathers too bee led and guyded vnder ſuche
ſhadowes.<note place="margin">Gal. 4. a. 1.</note> And that is the cauſe why Sainct Paule will vſe the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of yong children that are vnder Tutors and gouerners.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:77"/>
The auncient fathers therefore tooke profite by keeping the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Lawe: for thereby they were alwayes confirmed in
the things that were promyſed concerning the Redeemer. And for
that cauſe alſo it is ſayd, that the Sanctuarie was made according too
the Patterne that Moyſes had ſeene in the Mount. Now, that Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne

with his grace, which is vttered too vs by his meanes now adayes in

therefore alſo the veyle of the Temple rent aſunder at his death,<note place="margin">Math. 27. f. 51.</note>
too ſhew how it was Gods will too haue the faythfull come more
familiarly vnto him. S. Paule ſayeth now, that wee haue libertie in
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: and that is, bycauſe wee bee no more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
too the bondage that laſted in the time of the Lawe, according
as he will hereafter take example of circumciſion, and as he treateth
of it in another place alſo too the Coloſsians.<note place="margin">Coloſs. 2. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not by the hand of man, but by the woorking of Ieſus

the circumciſion that was ordeyned for the Iewes, wee haue Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
which witneſſeth the ſame thing vntoo vs: namely that wee
muſt become new creatures too dedicate our ſelues wholly too the
ſeruis of God. And ſo wee ſee that the libertie or freedome whiche
is purchaced too vs by our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, is that the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the lawe are layd away, ſo as wee bee no more ſubiect nor
bound vntoo them. Now at the firſt bluſh a man would thinke this
were no great thing. For what harme were it if we were firſt bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and by and by after circumcyzed? Or if we knew that our Lord
Ieſus Chriſte only is the whole perfection and accompliſhment, and
yet had the figures thereof ſtill? Firſt if men ſhould keepe ſtill the
ceremonies as in the time of the lawe: the glorie of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt ſhould be diminiſhed for it, according as it is ſayd that the
law was giuen by Moyſes, but truth and grace were vttered too vs
in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">Iohn. 1. b. 17.</note> for ſo it is ſayd in the firſte chapter of S.
Iohn. Therefore he ſhould be bereft of his honour, if wee ſhoulde
not haue the libertie that he hath brought vs. And it behoueth vs to
vnderſtand, that our ſtate is better and more excellent now adayes,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23060:77"/>
than was the ſtate of the old fathers, bicauſe our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
is giuen vntoo vs, and in him we haue all that was figured at that
tyme. So then, men do wrong to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in keeping
ſtill the ceremonies of the Lawe. That is one poynt. Againe, for as
much as he is named the Sonne of rightuouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Mala 4 a 1.</note> we muſt not be
led ſtill as though there were but a ſparke of light: but wee muſt
faſten our eyes vpon the doctrine wherein our Lord Ieſus Chriſte
is ſhewed vntoo vs, and wherein wee may alſo behold him face to
face,<note place="margin">2. Co. 3 d. 18</note> to come euen vnto God his father, as hath ben ſhewed in the
ſecond too the Corinthians. Moreouer, if the ceremonies of the
Lawe bee conſidered without our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that is to ſay,
if they be ſeparated from him: they bring as it were a binding with
them,<note place="margin">Colo. 2. c, 14</note> and a recorde of condemnation and death vpon men. And
therevpon doth S. Paule ſtand in the ſeconde too the Coloſsians,
where he ſayth that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte hath vpon his Croſſe,
torne aſunder and blotted out the obligation or handwriting that
was againſt vs. For if the Sacrifizes ſtoode in force at this day, wee
ſhould ſee there that we be all in daunger of eternall death before
God. And why ſo? The ſleaing of the poore beaſts was not for that
they themſelues had deſerued it, but to ſhewe vnto men as it were
in a liuely picture, that they were all worthy to periſhe. Then if the
ſame continued yet at this day, we ſhould ſtill ſtand bounde vnder
the ſame obligation of death. But we be diſcharged of it, by oure
Lord Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Colo. 2. c. 15.</note> And that was the tryumph of his death, as Saint
Paule ſayth. Thirdly the auncient fathers knewe that although the
Lawe was giuen them, yet they obtained ſuch fauour of freedome
at Gods hand, that all their faults were forgiuen them. But if men
ſhoulde nowadayes be put to the neceſsitie of keeping all the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies:
it woulde be an intolerable yoke, as it is ſayd in the .xv.
of the Actes:<note place="margin">Act. 15. b. 10</note> For the cace would not only concerne ceremonies,
but alſo the drowning of vs in diſpaire. For is it poſsible for men
to do the things which God commaundeth all men to do without
any exception or releaſe? No. For the thing that God requireth
and demaundeth, paſſeth all our abilitie: and if we fayle but in any
one point; we ſhould be ouerwhelmed vnder the bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>then. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for that cauſe, this libertie is of ſuch importance, as we cannot
<pb facs="tcp:23060:78"/>
bee ſure of our ſaluation, nor freely call vppon God, excepte wee
knowe that we be no more hilde vnder the yoke and bondage of
the Lawe. There is yet one poynt more which ſhall bee layd out at
length: which is, that ſuch as would needs make the faythfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte
to the keeping of ceremonies, had therewithall a wicked and
vntowarde imagination, that men were iuſtifyed and did purchace
grace at Gods hand by ſuch meanes. And that was an vtter aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
of the force of the death &amp; paſsion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
Now then, we ſee it was not cauſeleſſe that S. Paul ſtroue ſo ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agaynſt the ceremonies of the lawe, to the ende they ſhould not
be ſo brought in vſe agayne, that the faythfull ſhould be hilde in
bondage vnder them. And we haue neede to be warned thereof:
for in theſe dayes we haue the like encounter agaynſt the Papiſts.
True it is that the Papiſts haue leſſe colour than had the decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of whom S. Paule ſpeaketh. For although they were Satans
vnderlings, and ſought nothing but to peruert the truthe of the
Goſpell, yet had they at leaſt wiſe this colour, that they broughte
not in their owne dreames and traditions, but alleaged the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of God, howe that the lawe ought to be kepte, and that was a
meetely apparant excuſe. But the Papiſts haue no ſuche founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
For all their Ceremonies are forgeries of mans brayne. It
is true that they haue mingled Iewiſhneſſe with them, and made
ſuche a galimaufrey as a man can not tell of whome they haue bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
moſte. But howſoeuer the world go, yet are the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of mens ſetting vp, which are at this day in the Popedome.
Nowe when we ſtriue to aboliſhe them, they ſay wee trouble the
worlde for nothing. And then ſteppe in theſe Neuters, whiche
woulde fayne pleaſe bothe parties, and make a Baſtarde Goſpell.
Thoſe fellowes caſte vs in the teeth, that wee bee ſeditious, and
that throughe oure preciſeneſſe wee ſet muche trouble in the
worlde. And for proofe thereof (ſaye they) is it meete that there
ſhoulde bee ſuche ſtryuing aboute Ceremonies, ſeeing they bee
things indifferente? Yea forſoothe: For if God woulde haue the
Ceremonies of the lawe (which yet notwithſtanding came of him
and by his expreſſe commaundement) too come too an ende in
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: what ſhall wee do when men will of their
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:23060:78"/>
owne fooliſhe raſhneſſe ſet vp others in their ſtead? Seeing that
God would haue his owne aboliſhed, why ſhould men ſtep foorth
therevpon, and bring in their owne deuice, and make God beleeue
that he was not well aduiſed? See yee not a curſed blaſphemie?
Nowe vve knowe that the cauſe vvhy God vvould haue the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of his lawe aboliſhed in theſe dayes, was to the intent that
the grace of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be the more lightſome
and better knowen.<note place="margin">Mal. 4. a. 2</note> For he is the dayſunne of righteouſneſſe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all thoſe ſhadowes muſt ceaſe, and it is he in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue the
body and ſubſtance of them,<note place="margin">Co. l2. c. 17.</note> ſayth S. Paule. Seeing then that God
had that reſpect and reaſon: the figures muſt paſſe and vaniſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
But now what reaſon wil the Papiſts bring, when as men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
by eyeſight, that all their Ceremonies are a burying of our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and yet that they binde men to the keeping of
them vnder payne of deadly ſinne? And furthermore when as in
all their Ceremonies, they haue a certeyn opinion, that Baptiſme is
not inough for them, but that they muſt haue holiwater to chriſten
or baptiſe men euening and morning: and finally, that when they
haue brought in all their pelting traſh, and al their gewgawes, there
muſt alwayes be ſomewhat in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to draw poore ſoules into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage:
is it to be borne withall? On the other ſide, we ſee there is
ſo ſtreight a yoke, as it is able to ſtrangle the poore wretches. For
the ſeelie ſoules are bereft of the freedome that was purchaſed for
them by the death &amp; paſsion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. VVe ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
how it is not without vrgent cauſe, yea &amp; extreme neceſsitie, that
we ſtriue againſt the Popiſh tyrannie about ceremonies, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering
that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath not his deſerued preheminence, ſo
long as men buſie their wits about thoſe ſmal trifles, &amp; that more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
their wretched conſciences are alwayes in vnquietneſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ende or ceaſsing: and finally, that on the otherſide the Papiſts
thinke to deſerue grace by the things which they terme Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
bearing themſelues in hande, that that is the meane whereby
men ſhuld become righteous to obteine ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſee that
S. Paul in his time was driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuſteyn that ſtrife. And foraſmuch as
our caſe is altogither like at this day, ſo as we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not hold our peace
except we wil betray both god &amp; ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: we muſt fight ſtoutly agaynſt
<pb facs="tcp:23060:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that helliſh tyrannie, and againſt thoſe pelting traſh trumperie and
illuſions of Sathan, whereby hee would fayne eyther quite deface
the Goſpell, or elſe ſo turmoyle it as a man ſhoulde not knowe
which is the pure truth. This in effect is the thing that wee haue
to beare in mynde. And whereas S. Paule ſayth, that he yelded not
one iote too ſuch men: it is too confirme vs ſo muche the better
on the thing that I touched euen nowe. Peace and friendſhippe
are an amiable thing among men. They bee ſo indeede, and wee
ought to ſeeke them to the vttermoſt of our power. But yet for
all that, we muſt ſet ſuch ſtore by Gods truth, that if all the world
ſhould bee ſet on fyre for the mayntenaunce thereof, wee ſhoulde
not ſticke at it. As much as wee can poſsibly, let vs purchaſe peace:
and if the matter concerne but our owne perſons or goodes,
let vs endeuour too compound with our aduerſaries, let vs beare
with them, and let vs labour to ouercome them by our patience:
Lo in what maner wee ought to buy peace. But yet in the meane
while let not Gods truth be deminiſhed, nor ſuſtein any harme or
preiudice. For the peace that men ſeeke among themſelues ſhall
euermore be accurſed, if God be not therewithall acknowledged
and magnified as he ought to be, and his word alſo continue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impeached,
for that is the knot of our bonde: and if we intend to
haue it acceptable to God, and the end of it to be good and for our
welfare, ſurely God muſt knit vs togither. And hee hath giuen vs
his Sonne,<note place="margin">Eph. 2 c. 14</note> who is called our peace, too the end we ſhould all of vs
fall in order vnder him. Then if we minde to haue good and holie
peace, let vs ame vs at this marke of yeelding our ſelues vnder the
obeyſance of Gods ſonne, that he may be our head and we his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
like as there is but one Church. But if any man goe about too
withdraw vs from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: let vs rather beare all the
hatred, outrages, and madneſſe of the world, than to ſeeke ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.
And let vs not be afraide of all the reproch that can bee
done vnto vs according as nowadayes we ſhalbe falſly ſlaundered
as ſtirrers vp of many ſtrifes. yea verily, but what can wee do with
it? For it behoueth vs to abide ſtill in the truth of the Goſpell, or
elſe woe bee vntoo vs. If the Papiſtes will not agree with vs, but
bee vtterly wilfull in the ſtubbornneſſe that is ſeene too bee in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:23060:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them: wee muſt bee contented to be at defiance with men, ſeeing
they purpoſe too turne vs from the peace which wee ſhould haue
with God by the means of his Sonne, who not without cauſe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that title as I told you before. Therefore when they crye out
vpon vs, wee muſt be fenced with this anſwere of Elias which hee
made vnto Achab. Art not thou he (ſayd Achab) that troubleſt Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell?<note place="margin">3. Kings. 18. c. 17.</note>
For the Prophet was accuſed (as we be nowadayes) bicauſe he
labored to bring the people backe againe too the pureneſſe of the
Lawe, and fought againſt the ſuperſticions and Idolatries that had
bin deuiſed: [by reaſon wherof] the king thought verily that Elias
had bene come to make trouble ſedition, and vprores, according as
the princes of this world could find in their harts always to welter
in their own filth, &amp; paſſe not of the ſeruing &amp; honoring of God,
but al is one to them [what come of it] ſo they may be maynteined
in their ſtate. But the Prophet anſwered him, ſaying: [It is not I,]
but it is thou and thy fathers houſe. For they that wil not agree vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, nor hold themſelues to his ſeruice in ſuch wiſe as he hath
apointed it in his word: they [ſay I] are the troublers of the world,
and the parties that ought to be blamed for all the vprores, varian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and debates that happen. For (as I haue ſhewed alreadie) it is no
reaſon that God ſhould be robbed of his right, when men ſeeke to
knit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues togither. Ye ſee then in effect what we haue to think
vpon, when S. Paule ſayth that he would not yeeld one minute as
in way of ſubiection, to ſuch as wownd in themſelues after that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
vnder falſe coloures, to make a baſtarde Goſpell full of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glemangles
and corruptions: for Gods trueth is the thyng that
was to be knowne firſt of all. Furthermore let vs not be afrayde of
the ſlaunder that is layd vpon vs [in telling vs] that it is pryde &amp;
preſumption when wee will not ſubmit our ſelues: like as nowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
the thing that the Papiſts alledge againſt vs, is that we ſeeme
to take vpon vs to be wiſer than all the world, and that it is a great
pryde in vs, that wee cannot fynde in our heartes too ſubmit oure
ſelues too the common faſhyon. True it is that the title of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is amiable, lyke as I ſayde euen nowe of peace: but yet muſt
God bee obeyed fyrſte of all. For if wee will openly ſpyte God,
and playe mockeholyday with him too the intent too ſubmitte
<pb facs="tcp:23060:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our ſelues vnto men, and bowe downe our necke too beare their
yoke, and in the meane while giue no audience vnto God: what
ſhall become of it? Surely we can not frame our ſelues to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
in way of ſubiection or yeelding to them; but God muſte bee
thruſt out of doores, and his word as it were troden vnder foote,
ſo as it ſhall haue nother authoritie nor reuerence amongeſt vs.
VVhat is it that the Papiſts would haue vs to do? That we ſhould
leaue Gods worde, and giue ouer our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and yet in
the meane while receiue all that euer they haue deuiſed. They will
not ſay in flat termes that God ſhall be ſpoyled of his honour, nor
that Ieſus Chriſt ſhall haue no more authoritie among them, they
will not ſpeake ſo with open mouth, but yet it is ſo in deede. Like
as theſe deceyuers agaynſt whom S. Paule ſtroue, made fayre pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
inow that they ment to be Chriſtians, but yet for all that
he was fayne to come to the touchſtone, and to examine all things
throughly. Now would the Papiſts haue their traditions receiued:
and what maner of things are they? VVe ſee that our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt is as good as buried there, as I haue ſhewed alreadie. Againe,
there is nothing but corruption in them: the things that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnder them are vtter illuſions of Satan, tending al to this end,
that there may bee no more any certentie, nor any man knowe
wherunto to ſticke. Seeing it is ſo, it is not for vs to make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
God, that men might be obeyed. And therefore let vs haue
as it were a forehead of braſſe to reſiſt them in that behalfe. For the
greateſt manlineſſe that can be, is to keepe our ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſwaruing
aſide for mens ſakes, what colour or fayre ſhew ſoeuer be ſet vpon
the matter, and to deſpiſe euery whit of it as dung and filth, when
it ſtandeth vpon reſeruing Gods ſouereintie vnto him, and vpon
giuing eare to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, to the ende that he may bee
our head, and gouerne vs, and all of vs from the moſt to the leaſt
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue vnder his guiding, &amp; do nothing elſe but ſimply giue eare
vnto him, and receiue the things that are for our maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the
fayth of the Goſpell. Yee ſee then what wee haue too remember
heere concerning S. Paule. Surely if yee ſeeke a meeld and meeke-ſpirited
man, S. Paule was he, yea and he was euen as a myrrour
of all curteſie and gentleneſſe. Agayne, if yee deſire a lowely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:23060:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what greater lowelyneſſe can there bee founde than was in
S. Paule, who abaced him ſelfe beneath all men. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
wee ſee howe he ſtroue for the pure doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and paſſed not to prouoke the wrathe of all the men in the
worlde agaynſt him ſelfe: in ſo muche that it was caſt in his teeth,
that all the troubles whiche happened in the Churche of Galatia,
and elſe where, came of him. I ſaye hee feared not the reproche
wherewith men could charge him, that he was a rebell and had too
muche preſumptuouſneſſe in him. Euen ſo muſte wee do in theſe
dayes. Let vs be peaceable as neere as wee can: let vs relent of
our owne right: let vs not ſtriue for theſe worldly goods, honor,
and reputation: let vs beare all wrongs and outrages, rather
than bee moued to any debate through our owne faulte. But in the
meane while, let vs fight for Gods truthe with toothe and nayle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Agayne, if any body deſpiſe vs, ſo as one ſteppeth vp maliciouſly
agaynſt vs, and another goes about to deface vs: let vs not make
any quarell at all for that. But if any man will drawe vs from the
obeying of our God, to make vs ſtoupe to the tirannie of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let
vs hold our owne in that caſe, let vs withſtande him ſtoutly to the
vttermoſt, and let vs defie all the loftineſſe of the world, to the end
that our lord Ieſus Chriſt be not diminiſhed, but may alwais reigne
ouer vs, and we be ſubiect vnto him. Thus yee ſee in effect how we
ought to put this text in practiſe, and alſo how the neceſsitie of the
time oughte to ſtirre vs therevnto. For nowe a dayes wee bee not
only perſecuted, ſo as wee ſee the fyres kindled too murther the
poore ſeruants of God: but alſo are fayne to be accuſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as ſeditious perſons, by thoſe ſlaues that are in wages
with Antichriſt, to ouerthrowe the truthe of the Goſpell. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
they ſay there is nothing but pride in vs, bicauſe wee will not
receyue their traditions. VVell then, doo they ſlander vs ſo fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly?
Let vs beare it patiently, and let them rayle their fill (as
S. Paule ſayth) ſo our quarell bee alwayes to ſtande for our parte
in the pure truthe of the Goſpell, and to withſtande the Creatures
that will not ſuffer Chriſte alone too reigne, and all knees too
bow before him, and all men to doo him homage. Nowe as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
that whiche S. Paule ſpeaketh of the truthe of the Goſpell,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:81"/>
it a very notable ſaying, and which importeth a very profitable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
For he might well haue ſayd ſimply, to the end that the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
might abyde among you, I would not giue place too them ſo
much as one minute. But he ſpeaketh of the truth of the Goſpell:
Howbeit, not that there is one true, and another falſe: but when
he ſayth that the Goſpell ſhuld continue true, he ſpeaketh it in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of men. And why ſo? For although men make a fayre ſhewe
to be Chriſtians: yet do they alwayes labour to haue ſome medly,
according as we ſee many geeriſh heads in this world, who cannot
abyde that God alone ſhould gouerne vs, but euery man woulde
caſt in his owne collop or morſel, and thereof came the confuſion
that is at this day in the papacie. A man would wonder how ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pelting gewgaws, fooles bables, yea and alſo groſſe abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
could be gathered togither. But that is come to paſſe bicauſe
that men were not contented to obey God, but would needs adde
this and that of their owne fancie. So then, S. Paule ſpeaketh here
purpoſely of the trueth of the Goſpell, as he ſpeaketh of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie
of our Lord Ieſus in the ſecond to the Corinthians.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. a 3.</note> And
what is ment by the ſimplicitie [or ſingleneſſe] of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt? It is matched ageinſt all the minglings that men make. For
(as I haue ſayde already) they haue a fooliſh fancie of ſetting forth
things deuiſed of their owne brayne. Nowe when men doe ſo put
too things of their owne: it is but corruptneſſe and ſtarke abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
And that is the cauſe why S. Paule fayth, that we muſt holde
ſtill the ſingleneſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Therfore when vnder
colour of handling the Goſpell, men go about to make a patched &amp;
pydecoted or motley religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might term it:) it is no more a
true religion, but ther is much falſhod mingled with it. Then let vs
mark wel, that wheras S. Paule vſeth here ſuch ſpeech, he (or rather
the holyghoſt by his mouth) warneth vs that it is not inough for vs
to bear the name of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; to make ſome fair ſhew of cleauing
to Gods word and to the doctrine of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: but that
we muſt ſtick to it throughly, and take heed that we nother mingle
nor foyſt in any thing to it, but conſider that lyke as a litle leuen is
able to ſower a gret deale of dow, ſo al wil be marred, as ſone as we
giue any entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the things that men haue deuized of their own
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:23060:81"/>
heads. To be ſhort, the meanes to kepe the doctrine of the Goſpel
pure, is that men adde not any thyng at all to it, nor bee ſo bolde
and licentious, as too laye one thing or other vppon it, but too
content themſelues with the things that our lord Ieſus Chriſt hath
ſhewed vs, ſo as we become his true diſciples, and be not ſo hardie
as too replie ageinſt him, but that all mouthes may be ſhet, and no
man lifte vp his neb too ſay, this is my opinion, this thinke I to be
good, but euery one of vs receyue ſimply that whiche is taught vs
by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who hath all dominion of reigning ouer
our ſoules. Lo how we may haue the truthe of the Goſpell: And it
beehoueth vs ſo muche the more too practyſe this doctrine, of S.
Paules, by cauſe wee ſee that nowadayes manie men ſeeke nothing
but to mingle one with an other, ſo as they care not of what religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they be, ſo the ſame be moſt tolerable and eaſlyeſt receyued of
the worlde. True it is that among the Papiſtes many be ſo wilfull,
as they will neuer abyde that a man ſhould varye one poynt from
them. For they ſee well, that if there be neuer ſo little a breache
made, by and by al their tyrannie decayeth and falles downe to the
ground. For what holde haue they but by tyrannie and violence,
too tell vs that wee muſte neyther will nor chooſe, but take it for
good? Thoſe therfore that are flatly on the popes ſide, would haue
men too holde through out, all the filthineſſe and abhominations
which they haue had hithertoo. But there are a ſorte of fantaſticall
heads, which would haue a Reformation, wherin the Pope and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humet
and Ieſus Chriſte ſhoulde bee mingled toogither, ſo as men
myght no more diſcerne whiche is whiche: for all is one to them ſo
the world be agreed vppon it: They bear no reuerence at all vntoo
God, and that is the cauſe why all thinges haue bene ſo turmoyled
and confounded in our dayes, and the verie foundation, whervpon
the Interim (as they terme it) was grounded. For ſeing that manye
men coulde not fynde in their hearts to conſent to Papiſtrie: they
thought it good too haue a reformation betweene both. And euen
at this day a greate ſort inclyne ſtil to the lyke reformation. It is
true (ſay they) that there are abuſes, and it were meet they ſhould
bee mended. Yea, but their meening is but too plucke away ſome
leafe or little braunche, and too lette the reſt alone, that the roote
<pb facs="tcp:23060:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
roote myght growe ſtill: that is too ſay, that the Goſpell of God
myghte be defaced with al maner of ſuperſtitions that reigne in the
Popedome. But what for that? heere the holy Ghoſt condemneth
all ſuch neuters, and ſheweth that theyr dooings are but craftes of
Satan, yea and mere illuſions and mockeries to leade ſillie ſoules
to deſtruction, and moreouer alſo a defacing of the glorie of our
Lorde Ieſus Chryſt. And why? For we haue not the Goſpel at all,
except we haue the pure truthe, wherevnto it maye not be lawfull
for men to adde any thing, but all of vs to holde our ſelues to that
whiche is ſhewed vs by our mayſter. Ye ſee then, how that in theſe
dayes we be inforced by the neceſsitie of the tyme, to put this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in vre. And therfore when Gods enimies vpbrayde vs that
wee will not agree with them, let vs alwayes alledge for oure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
that our agreement is to be knit together in our Lorde Ieſus
Chryſt, and to be all obedient too his woord and doctrine. If they
alledge that it is a pryde in vs to reiect ſo the things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by ſuch men as terme themſelues ſuperiors. Let vs anſwer
that we muſt firſt obey God, and that Ieſus Chryſt muſt not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft
of his right, and men ſet vp in his place. If they aske why ſo?
VVere it not better to haue ſome meane way, and that euery man
ſhould ſhew howe he intendeth not too ſeparate himſelfe from the
reſt, than to ſtriue after that faſhion, and to cauſe chriſtendome to
bee as it were ſcattered? Let vs aunſwere that the matter ſtandeth
not vpon knowing who ſhall get the vpper hande, or who ſhall be
maiſter ouer his fellowes: but Gods word muſt continue alwayes
vnimpeached, or otherwyſe all the pretence of concorde, that men
can make, ſhall be but abhomination before God. And why? For it
were better that all things ſhould goe to hauocke and confuſion in
the world, than to abyde that Gods woord (being ſo precious and
holy a thing as it is) ſhould in any wiſe be peruerted: yea it were
better that heauen and earth ſhould be confounded together [than

we read that he ſticked not to circumciſe Timothie. Neuertheleſſe
the matter ſeemed to be all one, and that S. Paule vſed inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

Heathen men which had not bin nouriſhed and inſtructed in the

               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:23060:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Now S. Paule circumcyſeth the one,<note place="margin">Act. 16. a. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and will not doe the lyke
to the other, who will thinke that he kept an euen hande? If wee
conſider all thyngs well, wee ſhall ſee why he refuzed to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyſe
Titus, and yet had circumcyſed Timothie. Circumciſion was
at that tyme lawfull of it ſelfe. It was not lyke the Idolatries that
are in Papiſtrie nowadayes. If ye aske what holywater is, it is an
vnhallowing of baptiſme. For in baptim wee haue a waſhing that
ought to ſuffice vs both in lyfe and death, and God will not haue
vs too haue anie other warrant of the ſpirituall clenzing that was
obteyned for vs by the blud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, but we muſt
be contented with it. But as for the Holywater of the Papiſts, what
elſe is it than an endleſſe baptyſing of our ſelues? As touching the
Maſſe, it is ſo vilanous and outrageous a trecherie, that noman can
come at it, but he muſt defyle himſelf by renouncing the death of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. But Circumciſion ſtoode not in the like caſe:
for it was profitable for the tyme that it laſted. True it is that it
was aboliſhed at the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: but yet for
all that, the Iewes myght keepe it ſtill till they were fully inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the libertie of the Goſpel. Saint Paule therfore had circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
Timothie: and the reaſon why, was for that hee ſawe manye
weaklings, whiche woulde haue bene offended bycauſe they were
not yet throughly confirmed in the knowledge of the Goſpell,
but thought that it behoued them to keepe ſtill the ceremonies of
the Lawe. And it is ſayd, that wee muſt yeeld one to an other, for
charitie byndeth vs thervnto. Euery man muſt not do what he him
ſelf thinks good, to the trubbling of his neybours: but we muſt ſo
faſhyon our ſelues one too an other, as none maye bee offended
through our faulte. S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paule then forbare in hauing reſpect too the
poore Ignorant weaklings, who not withſtanding myghte bee
brought to knowledge in tyme. And as concerning the perſone of
Titus, he ſawe how men went about to lay a yoke of bondage vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Gentiles, and that the ſame wold be a holding of the Iewes
alwayes vnder the Lawe, whiche was then but ſuperſtition. For it
was for them to haue known that the law had ſerued out his time,
and that the ceremonies ſhould not continue for euer. If thys had
not bin made plaine, the Iewes had ben hardned in a wrong opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the Gentiles had receiued a yoke of bondage: and therfore
Paule made reſiſtance agaynſt it. And ſo we ſee it is not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but alſo needfull to vſe things dyuerſly which are nother good
nor bad of their owne nature. As for example, if we ſee a man dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
back from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the Goſpel, or troubled, bicauſe he is not
yet well ſtrengthened: it becommeth vs to forbeare the thing that
elſe were lawfull for vs, according as we haue ſeene heeretofore,
that we muſt always haue regarde what is expedient and fit for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
mans ſaluation. But if we ſee that vnder colour that a thyng
is neyther good nor badde, men goe about to interlace ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe
with it, and to bynde mennes conſciences by conſtrainyng
them to keepe it: there we muſt withſtand them to the vttermoſt.
As for example, To eate fleſhe or fyſhe is a thyng indifferent, as
they terme it, for it is neyther forbidden nor bidden of God too
eate fleſhe. Nowe if ſome ignorant perſon be offended at the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
therof, and thynk it to be deadly ſinne, bicauſe he knoweth
not whether [the forbearing of] it bee a tradition of the Pope,
or a commaundement of God, till he be taught it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we muſt eſchue
offence. Yea and when wee haue to do with any Iewes, which are
not acquaynted with our cuſtomes, and that we go about to winne
them and draw them to the obedience of the Goſpel: we muſt for a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yme (in being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant with them) abſtein from the things which
they think to be forefended. For inaſmuche as they are armed with
the authoritie of God, they would thinke they had ſome reaſon to
condemne vs, if it were not ſhewed them before, how and by what
warrant we might eate of all meates indifferently, and without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
But contrarywiſe, if the Papiſtes woulde bring vs to this
poynt, that wee ſhoulde continually forbeare the eating of fleſhe
vppon Frydays and Saterdays, and in Lentſeaſon, and vpon other
dayes of their appoynting: whiche ſoeuer of vs ſhoulde agree too
that, he were a traytour too the Goſpell, and we ſhould rather die
a hundred tymes. For why? wee muſte keepe the libertie that is
purchaſed for vs by our Lorde Ieſus Chryſte. If it bee ſayde, and
howe ſo? Ought a man too trouble the whole worlde, and too be
ſo wylfull for a little liquorouſneſſe of eatyng fleſh? The queſtion
is not whether a man ſhoulde eate fleſhe or no: but whether God
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:23060:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
oughte too bee obeyed and the thing vſed which he permitteth, or
whether we ſhould reſt vpon the fancies of men.</p>
            <p>Now if a thing be lawful for me by Gods woord, is it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
bycauſe men iudge of it after their own faſhion and guize?
But wee ſee that Gods authoritie is blemiſhed when the right that
belongeth to him, and is reſerued onely to himſelfe, is giuen too
mortall creatures. Againe, there is a clog layde vppon mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
inſomuche that our Lorde Ieſus Chryſte is defrauded of
his due honour. For if he haue purchaſed vs ſuch libertie as to ſette
vs free from the ceremonies of the lawe: it is muche more reaſon
(as I told you this morning) that the things which men haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſhould be layd away, and aboliſhed. VVherfore let vs mark wel
that in all indifferent things we muſt haue regarde to edifying, and
although it be lawfull for vs eyther too vſe or to forbeare a thing:
yet Charitie byndeth vs one to an other. It is a willing ſeruiſable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
when for the edifying of our neyghboures we abſteyn from
the thing which is free for vs to doo. But yet in the meane whyle,
we muſt not vnder the ſhadowe of peace and concord betray Gods
truth, and make a myngle mangle of it, ſo as men maye not knowe
who ought too rule the roaſt here beneath, nor what lawe is too
bee followed, but wee muſt vtterly mainteyne the libertie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Saincte Paule ſpeaketh heere. Loe what wee haue in effect to
holde vs too.</p>
            <p>Now he adedth immediatly, that the Apoſtles <hi>which were in great
estimation, broughte nothyng vntoo hym,</hi> (And hee vppeneth heere
Peter, Iohn, and Iames, who were had in great reputation aboue
the reſte, as pillers,) but onely tooke in good woorthe, and allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
the doctrine whyche hee hadde taughte theretoofore.
And therewythall hee addeth, <hi>That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee paſſed not what opinyon
menne had of Peter, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iames, foras muche as God regardeth not
anye mannes perſone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> That is too ſaye, his outwarde ſhewe or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation
too the worldewarde.</p>
            <p>It ſhould ſeeme here at the firſt bluſhe, that S. Paule ſtriueth for
himſelf, and for his own authoritie and credit. Ther were dogs that
barked againſt him in times paſt, &amp; ſpecially the ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kſliders that had
taſted of the Goſpel: who to prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſom color of their backſliding
<pb facs="tcp:23060:85"/>
and of their renouncing of Chryſt, alledged thus for themſelues.
Tuſhe it is wel inough known, that the Apoſtles ſtroue to wit who
ſhould be greateſt, which was an vnſemely thing, and ſhewed well
that they had ill borne away their mayſters doctrine, who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them to humble themſelues in ſuch wyſe, that euery of them
ſhould make himſelfe leaſt, although he were the greateſt. But wee
haue to marke here, that S. Paule had no controuerſie with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
as he himſelfe alſo declareth. Therfore there is ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
cauſe why he magnifieth himſelfe ſo much: whiche is, for that
thoſe dogges which labored to ſet debate betwene the Apoſtles, &amp;
therwithall to turmoyle and falſifie the Goſpell, pretended always
too bee the diſciples of the Apoſtles and familiar with them, lyke
as in theſe dayes we ſee manie fugitiues and ſhameleſſe fellowes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which abuſe the names of Gods ſeruants, and paſſe not to lie with
open throte, ſaying: Oho, I lerned it of ſuche a man. And yet they
ſpeake of a matter that was neuer heard of, yea and their ſhameleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
ouerſhooteth it ſelf ſo far as to name the verie cities, when as
notwithſtanding, if a man examin them throughly, he ſhall find the
cleane contrarie. So then it was for S. Paule to ſhewe that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of men is not ſufficient to deface the ſoueraigne authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, nor the reuerence that men ought to
beare to his worde. Therfore we ſee fyrſt of all, that Paule ſtroue
not here againſt Peter, Iames, or Iohn, for he agreed verie wel with
them. And ſecondly that he regarded not his owne perſon, but
ment to maynteine Gods cace: that is too wit, that he was ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and eſtabliſhed in the ſtate of an Apoſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Marke for one point
that he did not thruſte himſelfe in vpon a brauerie nor at aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but that God had choſen him thervnto, and that thervppon,
he had ſo borne abroade the doctrine that was betaken vnto him
as the pure truth of God, and of our Lorde Ieſus Chryſte.</p>
            <p>VVherfore if we conſider wherat S. Paule amed, we ſhal not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
haue wherewith to ſtoppe the mouthes of all miſſpeakers, but
alſo be the more confirmed in the fayth which we hold by his tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.
And although there be not nowadayes any ſuch ſhameleſſe
perſons that labor to deface him, or to aboliſh the authoritie of his
Apoſtleſhip: yet doth not that doctrine ceſſe to be for our profit.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:23060:85"/>
As how? VVee haue ſeene already howe Sainct Paule hath ſayde,
that if the Angelles of Heauen ſhould ſteppe vp too preache a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
contrarie to the Goſpell of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte: we ſhould
hold them accurſed. And euen at this day the ſame is good for vs.
For wee may defie Satan, and all the misbeleefe and wylineſſe of
menne, and all the traſhe and ſubtileties which they haue to thruſt
vs from the ſingleneſſe of our fayth: I ſay wee may defie euery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whit
of it. And why? For Gods woorde hath ſuche a Maieſtie in
it ſelfe, that all things that can bee ſet vp agaynſt it, are but ſmoke,
leazing, and filthineſſe. Nowe then if wee take it for a generall
rule, that nother Peter nor Iohn may diminiſhe the Maieſtie of the
Goſpell: it will ſerue vs for a buckler too warde all things that
can bee alledged in theſe dayes too ſhake vs withall: according al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
as wee ſee, that diuerſe weakelings are thruſt out of the way
by that it is ſayde vntoo them, howe nowe? wee ſee that the wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeſt
menne of the worlde, the men of greateſt skill, the Prelates
and ſuche as haue the gouernement of the Churche, toogither with
the Kings and Princes, ſticke too the fayth that hath bin receyued
of long tyme, and too the olde accuſtomed maner of liuyng. Thus
the poorer ſorte haue their eyes bleared, and their wittes vtterly
dulled, and their hartes diſcouraged, by meanes whereof Gods
truthe is forſaken, ſo as it hath nother credite nor reuerence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, and in the meane ſeaſon theſe maskers gette the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
hande, and flaunt it, as who woulde ſay, that men ſhoulde make
Idolles of them, and woorſhip them in deſpyte of God. Then ſith
it is ſo, wee ſee it ſtandeth vs on hande in theſe dayes, too bee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with the doctrine that is contayned heere in Sainct Paule:
which is, that God will haue vs too receyue his woorde without
gayneſaying: and that when our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte came downe
intoo the world, he was ordeyned too bee our Mayſter, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion
that euery of vs ſhoulde herken too him, and ſticke too the
things that he ſpeaketh, without adding aught too, or diminiſhing
aught from that whiche it pleaſed him too ſhewe, bycauſe the full
perfection of all wiſedome is in him. VVhen wee once knowe
this, wee may deſpyze all the gewgawes that menne can lay before
vs. And if menne tell vs that the greateſt men, the wyzeſt men,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:86"/>
the richeſt men, and the men of authoritie of this worlde doo liue
ſo or ſo: [<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee may anſwer,] yea marie, but when all comes too
all, what are they in compariſon of God? VVhen creatures come
before him they muſte all vaniſhe away: for when ſoeuer there is
that Maieſtie giuen too Gods woorde, whereby he intendeth too
trie whither wee honour him or no: it is certayne that wee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
all that proceedeth out of his holy mouthe. Nowe, that
woorde is conteyned in the Goſpell, in ſo much that when we haue
once graunted that God is too bee obeyed, wee muſte no more
runne ouer ſea or lande too ſeeke what his will is: for wee haue a
ſure and infa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lible warrant of it in the Lawe, Prophetes, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.
Sith the cace ſtandeth ſo, wee ſee it is not without cauſe that
the holy Ghoſt woulde haue this doctrine too continue too the
worldes ende. And furthermore wee bee warned therewithall, too
reſte vppon God without wauering at euery blaſt of winde, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as wee ſee how the Diuell ſtirreth vp much varietie of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whiche are as whirlewindes and tempeſtes too dryue vs too
and fro.</p>
            <p>But let vs learne too bee ſettled vppon God, and then ſhall wee
ſtande out too the laſte brunt. For if wee hilde our fayth of Iohn;
or Peter, it woulde bee but a leane fayth, bycauſe they were frayle
creatures, and wee knowe that man is ſubiect too leaſings and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
Therefore it ſtandeth vs on hand, too haue a much ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialler
and ſurer groundwoorke and foundation, than all that is too
bee found in this worlde. And ſo, for aſmuch as wee knowe that
God hath taught vs in the perſone of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and
that men haue bin no more but the inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts thereof: it behoueth
vs too mount vp vnto God. That is the way for vs too apply this
doctrine too our owne inſtruction, where Sainct Paule ſayeth that
the Apoſtles added not any thing vntoo him. Neuer the later, it is
not ment that he de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pyzeth them, or that he intended not to profite
with them: for he liked very well of that, yea and imployed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
by all meanes therevnto, and hild no skorne too bee taught e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
of the meaneſt ſort, as wee haue ſeene. But his intent was that
Gods woorde which he had preached ſhould abyde firme: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
he putteth the wiſeſt men in ſubiection too it, and the men of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:23060:86"/>
greateſt countenance in the world, and ſuch as bare greateſt ſhewe
and reputation in the Churche, to the end that Ieſus Chriſte ſhould
keepe his preheminence ſtill, and men haue an eye vntoo him, and
not vnto men, but ground themſelues altogither vpon one ſelfſame
fayth, and ſay that for aſmuch as the Sonne of God is ſent vnto vs to
ſhewe vs the will of God his father: it is not lawfull for vs in any
wyze too doubt of the thing which wee receyue of him. Thus yee
ſee what wee haue too doo at this day. And whereas Sainct Paule
ſayeth, <hi>that he paſſeth not what the Apostles were, bycauſe God regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not mennes perſones:</hi> thereby he ſheweth that he ought not too
bee counted inferiour too Iohn or Peter, for that he had bin an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell,
and not beleeued in Ieſus Chriſt, at ſuch time as the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
did already preach the Goſpell. For the manner of the world
is, that they which come firſte, ſhould bee firſt ſerued. Sainct Paule
therefore perceyuing that the ſame might bee ſome preiudice too
his doctrine, ſayeth that men muſt not looke what a one he had bin
afore, or what the other had bin afore. And yet his meening is not,
that he ought not too looke backe too humble himſelfe continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or that the giftes of grace which God had beſtowed vppon Iohn
and Peter, ſhould not bee eſteemed and commended as they were
prayſe woorthie:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. a. 8. 9.</note> for we ſee that in other places he termeth himſelf
a poore thing borne out of time, and confeſſeth himſelf too bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorthie
to be counted in the number of the Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sainct Paule
then did not as a number of hypocrites or rather ſhameleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones
do, who all their lyfe long haue bin eyther whoremongers, or
drunkardes, or looce liuers, and of a beaſtly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation, and yet for
all that doo but wring their mouth at it and ſay, tuſh, men muſt not
inquyre what I haue bin. But ſurely men muſt not looke too haue
any other iudges [agaynſt them than themſelues.] For euery of vs
ought too condemne himſelfe, as S. Paule exhorteth vs: and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when we conſider how we haue bin wretched vnbeleeuers,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. f. 28.</note> and
as good as beaſtes, wee ought too bee aſhamed of our owne leud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Sainct Paule therefore wiſte well there had bin cauſe for
him too miſlyke of himſelfe, and too bee aſhamed of his ſtriuing
agaynſt the Goſpell, and therewithall diſdeyned not the goodneſſe
that had bin in Iohn and Iames. At ſuche tyme as Peter and Iohn
<pb facs="tcp:23060:87"/>
were ſcurged and whipped for the Goſpel, Sainct Paule was a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
and paſſed not too ſay that they were rightly dealt withall,
and that it made no matter. But yet for all that, hee ameth at the
marke which I ſpake of afore: namely that for aſmuch as God had
ſo aduaunced him within a little whyle, his former misbehauiour in
tymes paſte ought not to hinder the receyuing of the gracious gifts
that were in him, that they might not profite too the common edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of the Churche.</p>
            <p>Thus yee ſee in effect, that the thing which wee haue too beare
in minde, is that if it bee late ere wee bee called too the Goſpell,
wee muſte bee ſorie that wee haue ſpent our tyme ſo ill, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
that wee haue liued like wretched brute beaſts, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
who is our father too whom wee ought too doo homage, bothe
for our life and for all the goodes which we haue receyued of him.
Therefore wee ought too bee ſorie for that. Againe, when wee ſee a
man returne that was gone aſtray, wee muſte acknowledge ſuche
chaunge too bee a miracle of God. For if a man haue bin a wilde
beaſt, and paſt all hope of beyng brought vnto God, and yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
becommeth as a ſheepe, and ſubmitteth himſelfe willingly too
the obedience of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte: it cannot bee but that the
hand of God hath paſſed vppon him. Therefore it behoueth vs too
know what all men haue bin aforetimes, and euery man ought too
bee his owne iudge in that behalfe: but yet for all that, when a man
hath bin ſlowe in comming vntoo God, if God woorke in him with
ſuche power as it is ſeene that he mindeth too ſet him forewarder
in one day, than ſome other men in ten yeeres: his ſo doyng muſte
not cauſe vs too plucke backe him that was able too edifie, as men
ſometimes doo, ſaying, what was ſuch a one a twoo or three yeeres
ago? ſuche ſayings are nought woorth. Lette vs rather vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that our Lorde hath ſhewed himſelfe ſo much the more, too
the end too be honored. And therewithall, for aſmuch as Gods gifts
ought not too bee vnprofitable: let vs ſuffer them too bee applyed
to the profite and welfare of the faythfull. Yee ſee then that our loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
what men haue bin aforetimes, muſt not bee to deſpyze them
ſtill: for it may bee that God gaue hym the brydle for a tyme
too the intent too bryng hym downe, ſo as he became an vnthrift,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:23060:87"/>
or liued in ignorance, and knew not goodneſſe, or had not any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
or commendable qualitie in him: and yet for all that, God
will ſette him as it were vppon the ſcaffold, and ſhewe by effect
that he intendeth too bee ſerued by him. Therefore it behoueth
vs too take in good woorth, the thing that God giueth and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
vntoo vs in that wyze.</p>
            <p>Thus yee ſee what wee haue to beare in minde, and how neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
it is that wee ſhould ſo doo: for there is not any thing contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
heere, whereof wee haue not the experience nowe adayes.
As touchyng the woordes where Sainct Paule ſayeth <hi>that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
not any mannes perſone:</hi> it is all one as if hee had ſayde, that
God is not tied too the things that are ſeene of vs, or whiche wee
haue in eſtimation, but that he is free too beſtowe his giftes on
whom he liſteth, and how he liſteth. Many men, when they heere
this woorde <hi>Perſone</hi> ſpoken of, doo beguyle themſelues, and wreſt
it agaynſt the meeening of the holy Ghoſte. And therevppon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men ſuppoze that God accepteth not any one man more than
another, for then [thinke they] he ſhould be partiall. But ſee how
they darken Gods free Election: as who ſhoulde ſay hee were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
too men, and that if he choze any of them, the ſame ought
too bee generall without exception, in ſo muche that (too their
ſeemyng) Gods grace flieth in the ayre lyke a Tennisball, and it is
in our power and free will too reache out our hande too catche it,
and too apply it too our vſe. Thus are diuerſe beſotted, yea euen
with too groſſe ignorance, bycauſe they vnderſtande not what is
ment by the woorde perſone. But the holy Scripture telleth vs,
that God in voutchſafing too chooze menne, and too ſet them in a
more excellent ſtate, and too beſtowe the giftes of his holie Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
vppon them, ſtayeth not vppon any thing at all in the partie,
ne paſſeth whither he bee whyte or blacke, olde or yong, noble or
vnnoble, riche or poore, beloued or behated of menne, fayre or
foule. God thinketh not vppon any of theſe ſmall tryfles: for if he
ſhoulde delay too loue vs till he found ſome good thing in vs: hee
ſhoulde lette vs alone ſtill in ſuche plight as wee bee. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the cauſe why Sainct Paule ſayeth expreſly, that God regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not any mannes perſone. And ſo wee ſee now what wee haue
<pb facs="tcp:23060:88"/>
too gather vppon that Text. Firſt of all (as I haue ſayde already) let
vs learne too receyue Gods giftes, and too make our owne profite
of them when they bee offered vs, and let vs not take occaſion too
refuze them as many men doo, whiche labour too cloke their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe
by alledging one thing or other. But whither they alledge
antiquitie, or what ſoeuer thing elſe, lette it not hinder vs too take
profite by thoſe whom God ſendeth too vs: for though they bee
not paſt three dayes old, nor can magnifie themſelues among men,
nor haue done many exploytes and valeant enterpryzes: yet is it
no matter too vs, ſo wee perceyue that our Lord hath giuen them
ſuch giftes as may bee auayleable too our edification, and therefore
let euery of vs ſtoupe and become teachable, aſſuring our ſelues that
if wee refuze the good that is offered vs by man, wee do not wrong
too the man, but for aſmuch as God is the author thereof, and wee
hold skorne too receyue that which commeth of him, we be woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
too bee vtterly bereft of the thyng that he is mynded too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe
vppon vs, and of the benefites which he hath after a ſorte put
intoo our hand. Lo what wee haue too beare away. Furthermore
lette vs learne alſo, not too bring any imaginacion of ſelfe value
when wee come vntoo God. But let him that is noble, mightie,
or riche too the worldwarde, lay away all ſelfe eſtimation, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it too bee vtterly nothing before God: and lette him
that is poore and miſerable, aſſure himſelfe that he is not quite ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off, though men deſpyze him. Alſo let vs practyze that which
is ſhewed vs by S. Iames, which is, that the brother which is greate
and noble ſhoulde glorie in his ſmalneſſe, knowing that he hath all
things of Gods onely meere goodneſſe: and that the brother which
is poore and of lowe and meane degree, ſhould glorie in that God
hath adopted him, and giuen him ſuche a ſtate as paſſeth all the
kingdomes of the worlde, ſeyng it pleaſeth him too auow vs after
that faſhion for his children. True it is that where as men gaze
vppon the outward apparance and fayre ſhewe of things: God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
a good conſcience, God looketh at the vncorruptneſſe of
the hart. But yet muſt he be fayne too put the ſame before into it:
for at the firſt he ſhall not finde it in vs. Let God looke vppon all
the children of Adam,<note place="margin">Pſa. 14. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 3.</note> and (as it is ſayde in the Pſalme) hee ſhall
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:23060:88"/>
fiude nothing but vtter corruption. They bee ſtarke rotten in their
wickedneſſe. See what our nature is. Then is there not any thing
that coulde moue God too accept vs, and too preferre vs before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
but wee muſte become veſſelles of his goodneſſe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that his accepting of vs, is not for our owne woorthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
but that when he choze vs too himſelfe, and ſet vs intoo the
way by his holy ſpirite, euen then he knew what ſoundneſſe was in
vs. Not that wee haue any at all of our owne: but bycauſe he doth
as it were beholde himſelfe in vs. For looke howe many good
things there are in the faythfull, ſo many recordes are there of
Gods goodneſſe in that he hath ſhewed himſelfe bountifull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
them.<note place="margin">Act. 10. e. 34</note> That is the cauſe why that in the tenth of the Actes
and in other places, this accepting of perſones is put for the dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
and vizors whiche are as falſe illuzions: of whiche ſorte are
riches, credite, dignitie, nobilitie and ſuche other things, whiche
ſerue too make menne too ſet ſtore by themſelues, and too ſtande
in their owne conceytes.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. b. 17.</note> But it is ſayde that God doothe looke
into mennes hartes, and not gaze vppon the outſide of them, ſo they
ſubmit themſelues too him obediently, as I haue declared alreadie.
This is in effect the thing that wee haue too beare in minde. Now
S. Paule addeth immediatly, <hi>that the Apostles auowed him too be their
fellowe and gaue him their hande,</hi> as it were too warrant that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
which he had preached, was in all poynts conformable to their
doctrine, &amp; that all of them had ſerued our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
S. Paule addeth, <hi>that he was by common conſent receyued as the
Apostle of the Gentyles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that is too ſay, of ſuch as had not bin brought
vp vnder the lawe, nor were Iewes by birthe and auncitrie. Heere
wee ſee that S. Paules ſtryuing was not with the Apoſtles: for they
auowed him too bee their fellowe: nother did he diſdayne them:
for wee haue ſeene before, that although his comming to Ieruſalem
was with aſſured knowledge that God had appoynted him, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
ſure and infallible reuelation, after he had bin caught vp intoo
the thirde Heauen: yet notwithſtanding hee was not caried with
pryde, nother vndertooke he that iourney to Ieruſalem, to common
with the Apoſtles for feare leaſt he had already or ſhould thereafter
runne in vayne. For his deſire was too haue all menne knowe, that
<pb facs="tcp:23060:89"/>
he chalendged not any ſpeciall thing too himſelf, but that his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeeking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was, that the Sonne of God might bee publiſhed all the
worlde ouer, and that menne ſhoulde woorſhippe him and reſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
him, ſo as he brought not a newe Ieſus Chriſte, but was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
in all poyntes too Peter and Iohn, and too all their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.
If Sainct Paule had ſhrunke aſide by himſelfe, it woulde
haue bene ſayde, that his meening was not too haue any conſent of
doctrine with the reſt of the Apoſtles. But nowe, ſeyng he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
after that ſorte too agree with them: he ſheweth that he was
not caried away with any pryde or preſumptuouſneſſe: and that is
it whiche he meeneth by ſaying newe agayne, that the Apoſtles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uowed
him too bee their fellowe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then dothe he not take vppon
him too bee aboue them: but will haue men knowe that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
ſerued our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; that he was one of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and that the Goſpell which he had preached muſte not bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as a doubtfull thing, but [as certaine] as if Peter or Iohn had
ſpoken it, in ſomuch that when Sainct Paule treateth thereof, hee
ſayeth not, it is I, but he ſayeth it is Ieſus Chriſte. VVhither it bee
Peter, Iohn, or Iames that ſpeaketh, let vs looke that the Sonne of
God haue euer the mayſterhood aboue vs, and lette the thing that
commeth of him bee receyued, whither it bee by mee or by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Sainct Paule will not haue men too gaze after him, any more
than after the leaſt man in the worlde. The thing which wee haue
in effect too remember in this texte of Sainct Paules, is that he had
no minde at all of himſelfe, ne ſought any whit of his owne, but
was contented that Ieſus Chriſte ſhoulde haue the prayſe that he
deſerued, and that his woord ſhould be receyued with all reuerence,
and as for all other things, he cared not what became of them. As
touching the other poynt, that he was accepted for the Apoſtle of
the Gentiles:<note place="margin">Act. 13. a. 2.</note> it is agreeable too that whiche Sainct Luke alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearceth:
namely that Paule and Barnabas were ordayned Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
bycauſe God had ſholed them out for the ſame purpoſe, too
preache the Goſpell among the Gentyles. Then dyd not that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
come of menne: but God had pronounced his vnreuocable
ſentence of it: and Sainct Paules treating after that ſorte of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
dooth no whit diminiſh the commiſsion of the other Apoſtles.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:23060:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But ſeeing he was ſent of God in deed, and that his calling was not
grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men, nor he had preaced in vnmeaſurably, nor thruſt
himſelfe in vpon a geeriſhneſſe, but was choſen thereunto of God:
the Apoſtles ſhewed that they woulde not in any wiſe ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
ſuch a calling, bicauſe it was of ſufficient authoritie, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from God. And heere we ſee yet better, howe all men ought
to frame themſelues to obedience, too the intent that nothing may
let the worde of God to bee a brydle and yoke, too holde vs ſo in
awe, as none of vs may follow his owne fancies, luſtes and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but ſuffer our ſelues to be guided and gouerned by the hand of
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Nowe if it were not lawfull for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
to refuze Saint Paule, bicauſe he was ſent from heauen: what
ſhall we do? Shall it not bee a diueliſh pryde, if wee cannot indure
that the gouernment and order whiche God hath ſtabliſhed in hys
Church, ſhoulde continue vnimpeached, but would chaunge cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
at our owne pleaſure, to ſet vp and pull downe according too
the deuice of our owne fooliſh brayne? Then if wee go about too
make ſuch trouble in the Church, is it not all one as if wee woulde
plucke the Sunne out of the skie to ſpite God withall. Therefore
ye ſee heere, that the thing which we haue to beare in minde, is that
the gouernment of the Church is ordeyned of God, and that they
which go about to chaunge any thing in it, are full of diueliſh pride,
and muſt in the ende fall downe for aduauncing themſelues in ſuch
wiſe. Nowe as touching that Saint Paule was ſent among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:<note place="margin">Mark. 16. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

it was not an altering of that which had bin vttered alreadie
by the mouth of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt when he ſayde, go preache
ye the Goſpell through the whole worlde. It might ſeeme at the
firſt ſight, that heere was ſome chaunge and contrarietie, in that S.
Paule was ſent on the one ſyde, and Saint Peter on the other. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe,
both of them do ſtande verie well togither, forſomuch
as our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſpake not ſeuerally to any one of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
Thou Peter ſhalt go ouer all the worlde, thou ſhalt go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the whole earth to preach my Goſpell, or thou Iohn ſhalt do
the lyke, and ſo conſequently to the others: but he ſayeth, All you
whom I haue ordeyned, go ſpread abrode my Goſpell euery where.
And his giuing of Commiſsion after that ſort in generall termes, is
<pb facs="tcp:23060:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
no let but that one might go one way, and another another, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
of them imploy himſelfe whereſoeuer God made him way,
or gaue him enterance, according alſo as they laboured to ſpende
themſelues thereaboutes, as well in death as in lyfe. But beſydes
this, there was a ſpeciall commiſsion giuen to Saint Paule to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Countreys further off, where there was not ſuch a multitude of
Iewes. True it is that whereſoeuer Paule came, hee did put foorth
the doctrine of the Goſpell throughout all the Sinagoges of the
Iewes, ſo as he was rightly their Apoſtle alſo. Howbeeit, this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him not to be ordeyned for the Gentiles, and to carie abrode
the Goſpell throughe the whole worlde, euen where God had
not bin knowne afore, and where there had not beene any light of
good doctrine, any lawe, or any Religion. S. Paule then was ſente
cheefly vnto them. And ſeeing it is ſo: what tytle of ſupremacie can
the Pope now pretende, vnder colour that S. Peter (as he himſelfe
ſayth) was Biſhop of Rome? Surely the ſaying that Peter was at
Rome, and lyued as Biſhop there, is but a fable and flatte mockerie.
But let vs put the cace it were ſo. Yet according to that which I haue
ſayde alreadie, Peters calling was ſpecially for the Iewes. And
therefore if the Pope pretende too bee Saint Peters ſucceſſour, hee
muſt bee the Biſhop of the Iewes, and his ſupremacie muſt ſtretch
no further than too them. For as for Saint Paule, it is verie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that he was neuer Biſhop of Rome, nor neuer was there, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
when hee was brought priſoner thither: and it is not knowne
whither he continued there or no, howbeeit it is verie likely that he
anſwered for his life. The Pope then cannot bragge that he ſucce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
Saint Paule therin. And what warrant hath the Citie of Rome,
or what worthineſſe can it pretende to ſay that the Apoſtles of our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt were there: but that it is a denne of theeues, and
that Gods ſeruants haue bin murthered there? So then let vs mark
well this Text, where Saint Paule ſheweth, that Saint Peter was
appoynted for the Iewes, and himſelfe ſent too the Gentiles: for
in as muche as this leſſon ſerueth expreſſely for our turne, wee
ought too bee the more moued too profite by it. True it is that the
doctrine of the other Apoſtles belongeth to vs as well as this, for
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt will be heard when hee ſpeaketh to vs, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:23060:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it be by the mouth of Peter, or by the mouth of Iohn, for all
are inſtruments of his ſpirite, and wee muſt not make a difference
betwixt perſons. But howſoeuer the cace ſtande, for as much as S.
Paules doctrine concerneth vs, it ought too ſerue vs as a ſpurre to
pricke vs to the quicke. And foraſmuch as God choze him to bring
the wretched Gentiles vnto him, making him the meane to drawe
thoſe vntoo him which had bin cut off from his Church: ſurely it
ought to giue vs the more courage, ſeeing he did his indeuour to
drawe the wretched vnbeleeuers out of the darkneſſe of ignorance
wherein they were, (making that his onely marke to ſhoote at) that
is too wit, vs that come not of the race of the Iewes as concerning
the fleſh. Neuertheleſſe, let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider therewithall, that Ieſus Chriſt
will bee heard of vs in ſuch wiſe, as wee muſt not regarde eyther
Peter or Paule, or Iames or Iohn, or anye thing elſe but him. Let
vs holde vs contented with the maiſter that is giuen vs of God the
father too bring vs too all perfection and wiſedome, and let vs alſo
ſuffer our ſelues too bee taught by ſuch meanes as hee lyſteth, and
let the things that Saint Paule hath written ſerue vs, and likewyſe
the wrytings of Iohn and of Iames, and of the reſt of the Apoſtles:
ſo they leade vs too Ieſus Chriſt, let vs receyue whatſoeuer is
brought vs by them, and let vs ſhet our eies at all other things, and
not haue any other conſideration, than our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs by theyr meanes. And although wee followe the guiding
of the doctrine of Peter, Iohn, Iames, and Paule: yet let our
ſhooteanker alwayes bee too bee ioyned and vnited too oure
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, in whome wee ſhall finde the fulneſſe of all
welfare and ioy, ſo as wee ſhall haue where of too glorie through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in him.</p>
            <p>But let vs offer our ſelues before the maieſtie of our good God,
with acknowledging of our faults, praying him to make vs feele the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
more and more, that wee may bee ſorie for them, and aske hym
forgiueneſſe with true repentance, and fight agaynſt our luſtes all
the dayes of oure lyfe, tyll wee bee throughly ridde of them.
And for as muche as wee bee ſo wretched wyghtes, that wee can

that before the comming of Ieſus Chriſt, it was requiſite that
there ſhoulde bee certaine ſhadowes too bring the faythfull more
further forwarde, that is, that they might be confirmed in the hope
of the redeemer that was promiſed them. And therevpon wee may
well gather, that Gods inioyning of the Ceremonies, was not too

the ende they ſhoulde continue for euer, and ſtande alwayes in
theyr full and perfect ſtate: but to the intent they ſhould continue
for a time, to ſerue to keepe that people in the hope that was giuen
them of the things which wee now haue in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,
who is the verie bodie and ſubſtance of the ſhadowes that were in
the tyme of the lawe. Ye ſee then to what poynt we muſt come. And
yet cannot a man argue, that God is variable as ſome fantaſticall
perſons do, who haue alledged the ſame reaſon. For ſhall wee ſay
that God chaungeth his purpoſe, bycauſe hee maketh Sommer and
VVinter? VVee ſee the ſundrie ſeaſons of the yeare, wee ſee the
earth wexe greene, and the trees bud floures, and afterward bring
foorth frute, and we ſee all things as good as dead in the VVinter
time: All this varietie commeth ſurely of God: but yet doth it not
therefore follow, that he chaungeth his nature. So likewyſe (as I
ſayde afore) he gaue his lawe for mans behoofe, and it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
that the Iewes (who had not yet ſuch manifeſt knowledge as is
giuen vs by the Goſpell) ſhould be helped by another meane, that
is to wit, by the Ceremonies which no wadayes ſhould be needleſſe,
foraſmuch as we haue the performance of the things that God ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
them then a farre off, and our ſtate is in that reſpect better
than the ſtate of the Iewes. But nowe Saint Paule, to ſhewe that
his preaching of ſuch libertie, and that the law which God had layd
vpon the necks of the auncient fathers, was taken away at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, was not without cauſe: declareth
that he rebuked Peter for the ſame matter. Nowe if the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ought to haue bin hilde in like bondage as the Iewes had bin:
ſurely Peter woulde haue mainteyned the quarell to the vttermoſt.
But hee ſuffered himſelfe to bee reproued, and confeſſed his fault.
Seeing we haue ſuch a preſident in the perſon of Peter: it foloweth
that our cace is good, and that the Apoſtles knewe that all the olde
ſhadowes and figures ought to ceaſſe, and bee vtterly aboliſhed by
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Thus the thing that S. Paule
ſetteth downe heere, is that he rebuked Peter in the Citie of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oche
for beeing conuerſant with the Gentiles, not with the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
ſort, but with ſuch as had bin conuerted to the knowledge
of the Goſpell. He liued familiarly with them, accounting them as
<pb facs="tcp:23060:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
members of the Church. But beholde, aſſoone as certaine Iewes
came from Ieruſalem ſent of Iames: Peter fearing leaſt ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>report
might bee rayzed of him, ſhrunke away, and made counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
as though hee had no familiaritie nor acquaintance with the
Gentiles, and notwithſtanding that they had the ſame fayth of the
Goſpell which he had, yet did he vſe them as ſtraungers, bicauſe it
was taken to be a kinde of defyling, to bee in companie with them.
See here a wicked madneſſe: for by that meanes there was a diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
made in the Church.<note place="margin">Eph 2. c. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> For (as it is ſayde in another place) the
wall was broken downe when our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was appointed
to be a light from God, not only for the Iewes, but alſo for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of the whole world. VVherfore if it behoued thoſe that had
erſt bin ſeparated &amp; eſtraunged from the Church, to be called into
one flocke: then doth Peter diſanull Gods grace, whereas yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
we know there is not a more precious thing than the
vnion of the Church. Therefore he that varieth from it, cannot by
any meanes be excuſed. But beholde, the fault of Peter was, that he
brake this bonde of concord by ſeparating the Iewes from the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
notwithſtanding that all belonged too the bodie of our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt, and were the verie children of God. Againe they had
all one ſelfeſame head, and one ſelfeſame redeemer: and therefore
his deed was a diminiſhing of Gods houſe, forſomuch as we be all
gathered togither in his name, and do become his houſhold folke,
euen till we bee gathered vp into the heritage of heauen. But there
was yet one other fault: which is that the grace of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt was darkned. For what fare we the better by his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
we know that in him we haue the fulneſſe and performance of
the things that were figured to vs in old time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If we ſhould offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifize
nowadayes as they did in the time of the law: we ſhould not
know that we were clenzed by the bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
and that the ſame was a ſufficient payment for the ſatiſfaction of all
our ſinnes, and that we haue there a perfect righteouſneſſe purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
for vs. VVe ſhould know none of theſe things. Therfore S. Peter
offended groſly in hanging vp that veyle againe, which was as much
as to ſtop Chriſt from being knowne as he ought to be. Moreouer,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>there was alſo a third fault, which was, that [therby] the Iewes were
hardned in their error. True it is that we ought to beare with the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:23060:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
&amp; weak ones, &amp; not grieue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer much: &amp; although they
ouerſhoot themſelues, yet muſt they be brought back again by litle
&amp; little, rather than to break either bone or griſtle of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb
ſayth: but yet as for to nurriſh their ignorance by ſoothing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in it, or by giuing any toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of alowance or welliking, that is naught.
And Peter by withdrawing himſelf from the Gentiles to pleaſe his
own Countrimen, brought to paſſe that the Iewes might the better
make their brags, that they had won their ſpurs, forſomuch as Peter
had giuen an incling that the Gentiles were vnclean &amp; vnholy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and ſo his deed was an augmenting of the euill that was to great
alreadie. In reſpect wherof S. Paule ſayd, <hi>that Peter was blameworthy.</hi>
And it behoueth vs to marke this thing well and diligently, bicauſe
ſome haue thought in tymes paſt, that it was done by agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, &amp; that S. Peter was ſorie that ſome of his Countrimen
were to hard to be pleaſed, &amp; therfore had told S. Paul ſecretly, that
he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to be rebuked of him. But all this is but a flimflam.
For S. Paule ſayth expreſly, that Peter was worthie of blame, &amp; that
thervpon he had ſtepped vp when he ſaw he walked not aright. VVe
ſee then that there was not a ſecrete agreement or packing in this
cace: but rather that S. Paule vſed the libertie that was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him [of
God] &amp; rebuked Peter, &amp; would not bear with him in that cace, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he reuerenced him as the Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſt. And now
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this text we haue to gather for our owne inſtruction, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
this libertie is as I haue declared heretofore. For here the cace
ſtandeth not vpon the onely vſe of things: but vpon the hauing of
our conſciences quiet before God. If the debate had bin, whither
it were lawful to eate ſwines fleſh or no, which was a thing compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
vnder the ceremonies of the law: it had bin a trifling matter,
and it might well haue bin paſſed ouer, like as it may be nowadayes
when the like Ceremonies are talked of. But it behoued them too
come to the wel head, as I haue declared heretofore. For the figures
ſerued to holde the people of olde time as it were in wardſhip, lyke
yong children which are vnder gouernours, and do not yet inioy
their libertie. But at the comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, like as
fayth grew great, ſo it was meet that ſuch maner of teaching ſhould
no more take place among the Iewes. Then was not Saint Paules
<pb facs="tcp:23060:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtryuing, onely about the outwarde vſe of things, (for hee woulde
willingly haue forborne that:) but to the ende it might be knowne
to what purpoſe the Ceremonies of the lawe had ſerued: namely
how it was not a bondage that ſhould indure for euer, but that they
had ſtood in force, only to the comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.
And herevpon it may be gathered, that when the Iewes forbare the
eating of Swines fleſh, or obſerued any holy day, or did this thing or
that: they did not a ſeruice to God that was of neceſsitie in it ſelfe,
but vſed it for the continuall exerciſing of themſelues in the fayth
of Ieſus Chriſt. VVhereby wee ſee, that the Ceremonies had no
vertue of themſelues: but that when they were referred too their
due ende and ſpirituall paterne, then it was perceyued that God
had not ordeyned them, but to the benefite of the Church. Then let
Ieſus Chriſt be ſeparated from the Ceremonies, and they ſhalbe but
tryfles for little children to play with. But if the end be conſidered
wherevnto they ought too lead the faythfull, then will it be found
that they were profitable. Yea and euen we at this day may fare the
better by them. Although the vſe of them be aboliſhed, yet may we
by them gather the things that are ſhewed vs in the Goſpell. As
howe?<note place="margin">Exod. 30. b 10.</note> It was ſayde that the Prieſt ſhoulde enter alone intoo the
Sanctuarie, and not without ſacrifice. VVell then, therevppon wee
haue to gather,<note place="margin">Leu. 16. a. 2.</note> that there is neyther man nor Angell worthie too
come vnto God, but that we ſhoulde bee all of vs ſhet out, if there
were not a way opened for vs in the perſon of our lord Ieſus Chriſt.
Marke that for one poynt. Agayne we haue alſo to beare in minde,
that we can haue none attonement with God, nor boldeneſſe and
libertie to call vpon him, except bloud go with it: that is too ſay,
except the death and paſsion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt [go with vs]
to get vs grace and fauour. And all our prayers muſt be offered vp
by that meane, or elſe they ſhall be refuſed at Gods hade. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it is ſayde,<note place="margin">Exo. 24. c. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> that the booke of the law was ſprinckled with bloud
as well as the Sanctuarie.<note place="margin">Heb. 9. c. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> VVe ſee then that all things ſhoulde bee
vnholy, if they were not hallowed by the bloud of our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt on all ſydes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and alſo that we ſhoulde haue no aſſuredneſſe
of Gods promiſes, nor be able to apply them to our welfare, vnleſſe
they had ſeales continually at them. Beſides this, when as it is ſayd
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23060:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that God is our father, and that our ſinnes are forgiuen vs and wee
accepted of him as righteous and giltleſſe: none of theſe promiſes
ſhould be of any force, neither could they boot vs at all, except the
bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt went before our eyes, ſo as all the
word of God were (after a ſort) written vnto vs in red letters of the
bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Thus ye ſee how we ſhould profite
our ſelues by the Ceremonies of the law. But howſoeuer we fare,
the vſe of them is aboliſhed, and if they continued ſtill, wee ſhoulde
not haue ſo good teaching by them as we haue, for we ſhoulde reſt
vpon theſe bace and corruptible things. But in as much as we haue
the heauenly pattern that was ſpoken of vnto Moſes,<note place="margin">Exod. 25. d. 40.</note> according alſo
as the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle too the Hebrewes, and Saint Steuen
in the Acts do ſhew right well:<note place="margin">Heb. 8. b. 5.</note> now we vnderſtand wherefore God
ordeyned ſuch Ceremonies.<note place="margin">Act. 7. f. 44<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> The thing then which wee haue too
marke for one poynt, is that we muſt vnderſtand, howe here is no
ſpeaking of matters of ſmall importance, but in knowing wherein the
Ceremonies profited the fathers of old tyme, and why it was Gods
will to haue them aboliſhed at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
And herewithal we ſee alſo, that Saint Paul ſpared not Peter though
he were his fellowe, and were in as worthie and excellent an office
as he was, and ſeemed that of dutie he ſhould haue bin borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
Howſoeuer the cace ſtood with him, he rebuked him ſharply for
that matter. VVe may much better deeme, that if it were a ſmal &amp;
light thing, S. Paule woulde not haue moued ſuch debate and ſtrife
for it. Needes therefore muſt it bee a matter of great importaunce.
But by the way we be warned, that whenſoeuer Gods truth is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced,
or that any man turneth away from the pure ſimplicity of the
Goſpell, we muſt not in any wiſe ſpare him, but although the whole
worlde ſhoulde ſet it ſelfe agaynſt vs, yet muſt we mainteyne the
cace with inuincible conſtancie, without bending for any creature.
For if any man ought to be borne with, the ſame was Peter: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt had beſtowed ſuch giftes of grace
vpon him, as to giue him that name, Saint Paule ſhould haue yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſomewhat vnto him: yea, but that matter was not to bee borne
with. Then ye ſee heere an example, which ſheweth vs that when
the authoritie of men tendeth to the defacing of the truthe of the
<pb facs="tcp:23060:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Goſpell, wee muſt fall too ſtryuing and not regarde any creature.
And this is greatly for our profite nowadayes. For there are many
that woulde fayne rowe betweene twoo ſtreames, and althoughe
they perceyue the abuſes and corruptions, yet would they beare on
both ſydes, and all to purchace peace as they themſelues ſay, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the ende there muſt needes followe great confuzion when
men doo ſo heaue one at another. Therefore too appeaſe all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde,
they woulde fayne haue a parting of ſtakes and a mingle-mangle
made, and that euery man ſhoulde bowe on his ſyde. But
in the meane while, will God gyue ouer his right at the pleaſure of
men? Or may wee confederate our ſelues too his preiudice? So
then, ſeeing that wee nowadayes haue too incounter agaynſt the
wilfull Papiſtes, who haue peruerted, corrupted, and falſified all the
truth of the Goſpell: although they face vs with theſe honourable
tytles of holy Catholike Churche, holy Sea Apoſtolike, Prelacie,
Chriſtendome, and holy Supremacie (which yet notwithſtanding
are but vizors in verie deede:) let vs not be abaſhed awhit at them.
For why? wee haue God on our ſide: and beſides that the truth
of the Goſpell is ſo precious in his ſight, as hee will not haue any
creature to bee ſpared for it: according as we haue ſeene how Saint
Paule himſelfe telleth vs, that if it were poſsible for the Angelles
to turne vs away from the pure doctrine, wee ſhoulde holde them
accurſed, and refuze and abhorre them. And why then ſhall wee
ſeeke too pleaſe mortall men, when they woulde diſguize the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Goſpell, and mingle their owne inuentions wyth it,
and in ſo dooing make our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt their vnderling, that
they mighte ſtill keepe poſſeſsion of theyr errours? Is it meete
that wee ſhoulde yeelde vp our places to them? A miſchiefe light
vpon ſuch concorde: for it ſhall alwayes be curſed of God. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs haue ſuch ſtoutneſſe and conſtancie of minde, that when
we be once ſure that the quarell which we mainteyne is Gods, wee
ſtagger not for any greatneſſe or loftineſſe of the worlde. Thus ye
ſee in effect what we haue to beare in minde. And heere withall we
ſee alſo what the fondneſſe of the Papiſtes is, and howe ſhameleſſe
that vilane [the Pope] hath bin in exempting himſelfe from all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
VVhen the Pope intendeth to magnifie himſelf greatly, he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:23060:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
calleth himſelfe the Succeſſor of Peter: and yet in the meane while,
hee will by no meanes ſubmit himſelfe too any chaſtizements. Hee
ſayth that it belongeth to him to correct all the world, and that it is
not lawfull for any man to meddle with him. And whence commeth
that exemption? For if he pretend to hold the place of Peter, we ſee
here the contrarie. Peter was rebuked and bare it, yea and hee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
graunted himſelf to be giltie when he ſaw he was ouercome.
Seeing it is ſo, wee muſt needes conclude that there is no dignitie
in this worlde (how much ſo euer men colour it) which ſhoulde not
alwayes bee ſubiect too Gods worde. For what a thing were it if it
were otherwiſe, ſo as our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſhoulde haue ſette vp
dumbe Idols in his Church vnder the title and ſhadow of ſhepherds,
and that it ſhould be lawfull for them to finde fault and rebuke, yea
and too marre and falſifie all things, and in the meane while no man
ſhoulde open his lyppes agaynſt them? Gods Churche ſhoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as it were a Swynes ſtye, infected with all filthineſſe, and
there ſhoulde bee no remedie to helpe it. Let vs marke well then,
that God will not haue any ſuch preeminence to bee in his Church,
as ſhoulde hinder the continuall courſe of his worde, ſo as it ſhould
not be able to bridle all ſuch as are in any ſuperioritie aboue others.
For it behoueth vs to giue eare to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and hee
muſt haue the mayſterſhip that is gyuen him of God his father, ſo
as euery man muſt yeelde himſelfe therevntoo, and none of vs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to haue any exemption. That is the thing which is ſhewed vs in
the perſon of Saint Peter. On the other part, we ſee alſo after what
ſort the faultes that are committed ought to be rebuked: that is to
ſay, openly before all men, and not only in ſecrete: which thing is
well worthie too bee marked. For there are many that can fynde
in theyr heartes too giue cauſe of offence, who after they haue ſet
all in a broile, woulde haue a man do no more to them, but tel them
ſoftly in their eare that they haue done am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſe. For the common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie
is this.<note place="margin">Math. 18. b. 15.</note> VVhat I pray you? Is it not ſayde that eche ſhoulde
reproue other ſecretely? Is it meete that a man ſhoulde bee ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed
when hee hath done amiſſe? No verily, if hee haue not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
in ſuche wize, as hys faulte ingendereth trouble in the
whole Church. For euen our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt doth expreſſely ſet
<pb facs="tcp:23060:95"/>
downe the ſame differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſo that if any man haue done amiſſe and I
knowe it, I muſt rebuke him betwixt him and me. But if the fault
be notorious and open, and an occaſion too bring in euill example,
if hee were not tolde of it: then muſt I not any more keepe that
order of rowning him ſecretely in the eare, but condemne the
fault as it deſerueth, that others may take warning by it. And this
is ment, not onely of priuate perſons, but alſo of ſuche as are in
higheſt degree: for it becommeth them too leade the waye, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
alſo as in another place too Timothie,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. d. 20.</note> Paule commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
expreſſely, that ſuche as haue done amyſſe (thoughe they
bee the Sheepeheardes whiche haue the charge too teache and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
the flocke) ſhoulde bee rebuked openly. The ſame thing
hath hee put preſently in practize in the perſon of Peter. For in
as muche as the fault was ouergreate, and too farre out of ſquare,
and might ingender greater trouble in the Churche, bicauſe it
was (as yee woulde ſay) an ouerthrowing of the Goſpell) for that
there was as yet ſome infirmitie in manie men: Saint Paule ſawe
well it was requiſyte that Peter ſhoulde bee rebuked, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon
did it.</p>
            <p>That therfore is the thing which we haue to remember concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that proceſſe. On the otherſide we ſee alſo the mildnes of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
It had bin ſaid vnto him by the mouth of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
that beſides his ordinarie name of Simon,<note place="margin">Math. 16. c. 18.</note> he ſhould be called Peter
for the ſteddineſſe of his fayth. He was excellent among the reſt of
the Apoſtles: and yet neuertheleſſe he ſtoupeth with his head, and
boweth downe his necke when he ſeeth that he hath done amiſſe,
and maketh no buckler of the honourable ſtate wherein he was, but
onely conſidereth, that ſith Gods worde is giuen vs too correct vs,
it becommeth vs to ſubmit our ſelues too it, except we will bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
againſt him, who in the ende will beate downe all the pride of
the world. Therefore S. Peter perceyuing that nothing is better for
a man, than to receiue chaſtizements when hee hath done amiſſe:
yeeldeth to that which was told him by S. Paule. Now if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all theſe things well: wee haue heere a verie profitable ſtorie.
For on the one ſyde wee ſee howe euerie man deſyreth too holde
in with the worlde: and that is an occaſion too blinde vs continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:23060:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in our miſdoings. For there is nothing with vs but flattering,
and (to our ſeeming) we cannot be friends, except euery of vs beare
with his fellowe. Surely there is a maner of bearing with things,
which is commendable, as I haue ſaid alreadie: which is, to be gentle
in rebuking ſuch as haue done amiſſe, ſo as we labour to win them,
and drawe them backe againe by freendlineſſe, and bee not too fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhe
and haſtie with them. For there are faults that may be borne
with, and which are not to be ſearched to the bottom, for it doth but
ſharpen men when they ſee an ouereagerneſſe of fault fynding, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as yee ſhall ſee diuers whiche keepe as it were continuall
watche, too ſee if they can fynde anye thing too carpe at in ſome
man or other: all theyr holyneſſe conſiſteth in taunting of one
man, and in rayling vppon an other: and too bee ſhort, they bee
the greateſt Correcters of the worlde. But our deſyre [of rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king]
muſt be ſo brydeled, as wee ſeeke not to finde fault with men.
And yet on the other ſide, the flattering that reigneth nowadayes to
much in the worlde, is a vice which we ought to ſhunne as a deadly
plague. Therefore according as euerie of vs loueth his neighbour,
ſo let him lerne to vſe the freeneſſe of ſpeach which S. Paule ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vs heere. And ſpecially when Gods truthe is in hande, let no
man be ſpared, let the zeale of God get the vpper hande in vs, and
although we ſhoulde purchaſe diſpleaſure, and runne in daunger
of many ſlaunders and backbytings, yet ought wee neuertheleſſe to
vndertake the chalenge. For there is no excuſe for vs if wee play
the traytours, by diſſembling when the truthe of the Goſpell is
falſified. Wherefore wee muſt followe the thing that Saint Paule
ſheweth vs heere: and the deede which hee did too his fellow Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
muſte ſerue vs for a lawe and rule, ſo as wee may ſhewe that
wee deſyre nothing more, than that God ſhoulde bee hearde, that
his truth ſhoulde not bee turned intoo a lye, and that there ſhould
not be any thing ſhuffled too it, nor any Leuen or Darnell ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with it, but that it ſhoulde continue alwayes in hys owne pure
ſingleneſſe. And on the other ſyde, the greate ones are warned
heere, too ſubmit themſelues meekely, and too yeelde themſelues
plyable too the correction that is offered them, knowing that God
ſurrendered not his owne right when hee aduaunced them too that
<pb facs="tcp:23060:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtate, but muſte ſtill keepe his ſoueraigne dominion, execute
hys iuriſdiction by hys woorde, in ſuche wyſe as they whiche
are moſte highly aduaunced, muſte bowe downe theyr neckes,
and vnderſtande that it were a diueliſhe confuzion too pretende
a priuiledge too receyue no chaſtizement. For by that meanes
Gods woorde ſhoulde bee as good as thruſt out of doores, and hee
bee bereft of the ſoueraintie which he hath ouer vs: and therefore
after that maner muſt wee put that doctrine in vre. And ſpecially
nowadayes when wee ſee men ſo bolde too bende themſelues af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that faſhion agaynſt God, let vs bee fenced aforehande agaynſt
them, and let nothing abaſh vs, ſeeing we knowe what the quarell is
wherein we fight agaynſt them: but let vs hardily defie all that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
dungeon, that is to wit, the Pope and his Cleargie, and let vs
not paſſe a whit for theſe ſtinking vermin, when we ſee them bend
their hornes at our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and that vnder his ſhadowe
and by pretending his name, they go about too thruſt his Goſpell
vnder foote, yea and too burie it vtterly, or elſe too make ſuche a
confuzed mingling of it, as men may not knowe who is mayſter.
Then ſithe wee ſee that the Diuell poſſeſſeth them after that ſort,
let vs not ſticke too arme our ſelues too the battell, and too ſtande
out agaynſt them too the vttermoſt: ſpecially ſeeing that among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, the quarell is more fauourable too vs in theſe dayes,
than it coulde ſeeme to bee in the tyme that Saint Paule maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it. True it is that the reaſon is alyke, and ſpringeth all out of
one fountaine: but yet was Saint Paule faine too fight agaynſt the
Ceremonyes that God had commaunded by his owne mouth. And
why did hee ſo? Bycauſe that thereby the Goſpell was darkened,
the grace of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was after a ſort beaten downe,
mennes merites were ſtabliſhed, and finally men knewe not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
God had amed in his lawe. And nowadayes the ſelfe ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
moue vs, to fight agaynſt all the abhominations that haue bin
ſet vp in the Popedome. But we haue this for an aduantage, that
all theſe things were forged in the ſhoppes of Sathan and of men.
Nowe wee knowe there is nothing but vanitie in men, ſo long as
they bee ruled by their owne fancie, and ſubmit not themſelues too
the obeying of God. For as much as the cace ſtandeth ſo, let vs fight
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23060:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo much the more manfully, ſeeing that our Lorde doth in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
giue vs wherewith to keepe vs from being diſmayed at the
titles that are ſet afore vs to outface vs with, which are nought elſe
but illuſions of Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ye ſee in effect what we haue to beare in mind.
But it behoueth vs alſo too marke well howe Saint Paule addeth
<hi>that his rebuking of Peter was bycauſe hee and his companyons walked not
the right way in the truthe of the Gospell:</hi> and beſides that, his rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of them was, bycauſe hee ſawe that the miſchiefe was alreadie
ſpread farre and wyde, and that if he had forborne any longer, the
remedie woulde haue come out of ſeaſon. Beholde here twoo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
which it ſtandeth vs on hande too marke well. As touching
the truth of the Goſpell, I haue ſhewed you alreadie howe it is the
pureneſſe which it behoueth vs to ſticke vnto. He might well haue
ſayd, that they walke not the right way in the Goſpell: but he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of the truth [of the Goſpell,] according as hee had vſed the
ſame worde once afore. The reaſon why he doth ſo, is for that men
woulde haue a halfe faced Goſpell, and be are themſelues in hande,
that they bee diſcharged before God, ſo the name of Chriſtianitie
runne roundly in theyr mouthes. Like as at this day the woorde
<hi>Goſpell</hi> is taken to bee meetely honourable among the Papiſts: but
yet the Goſpel which they haue is but a baſtardgoſpell, bicauſe they
haue put their owne collups and gobbets to it. They haue turkined
all things after their owne pleaſure, and they haue taken ſuche a
ſcope, that Ieſus Chriſt is but an vnderling in compariſon of them.
For they haue giuen determinate ſentence as it were from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
And in good ſooth they haue not beene aſhamed too ſay,
that the Contentes of the Goſpell are but as an Apſie of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
or as it were an introduction: and that the greate Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes
and principall matters, haue beene reuealed too them ſince,
ſo as they muſte come from Councels, and from the Sea of Rome.
Thus is our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte mocked, as thoughe they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in hande too crucifie him newe agayne. For men coulde not
deuyze too offer hym a greater villanye, than too ſaye that he was
but as an Vſher of a Schoole to teach folke theyr Apſie, and that the
Pope is come in aboue hym, to bring in the ſtate of perfection: and
yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it is ſene how the Pope maketh a minglemangle
<pb facs="tcp:23060:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or hotchpotch (as men terme it) of al things. Then is the word Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
villanouſly vnhalowed among the Papiſtes, and theſe ſticklers
which would haue men to agree vnto many ſuperſtitions, and too
content themſelues with a little of the Goſpell, and in the meane
while let many abuſes and errors continue ſtill: do likewiſe darken
the pure doctrine of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. That is the cauſe why S.
Paule ſpeaketh expreſly of the truth of the Goſpell, to ſhew that we
muſt go to it roundly, and not by halues, and that there muſt be no
adding nor diminiſhing of the things which the ſonne of God hath
taught vs, but that euery man muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to heare him ſpeak,
and too let him haue his mouth open. Let vs on our ſide open our
eares and be heedfull to receiue whatſoeuer hee ſayth: and let no
man preſume to haue an ore in that boat, to ſay this would be good,
or this or that ſhould be done. VVherefore let vs ſo reuerence the
pure doctrine of the Goſpell, as none of vs preſume too chaunge
ought of it, but all of vs yeeld to it without exception. Thus much
concerning the firſt reaſon that is ſet downe heere. So (to be ſhort)
let vs keepe our ſelues true ſchollers vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,
and if any man go about to make vs ſwarue neuer ſo little fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him,
or to gad after the doctrines &amp; inuentions of men: let vs withſtande
them ſtoutly. And why? For Saint Paule had none other reſpect,
but that the Goſpell might abide in his pure &amp; vncorrupted ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
VVherefore let vs followe him in the ſame nowadayes, and
we can neuer do amiſſe. Marke that for one poynt. Another is, that
we muſt alſo marke well, that if an inconuenience ſhould increaſe,
and ſpread abrode by our ſilence and forbearing, wee muſt prouide
for it aforehande. For it were to late to ſhet the ſtable doore when
the Steed is ſtolne. Therefore when we ſee that ſuch as labour too
intangle Gods truth, or too mingle their owne fancies with it doo
drawe folke to them, and begin too haue ſome traine and tayle fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
them: then is it high time for vs too bee firie in fighting. For
if we beare it: it is certaine that wee bee guiltie of the decay of the
Church, that ſhall come vpon it, and whereas we thinke too ſhift it
off, God will not graunt vs that grace, for as much as wee haue bin
too colde and retchleſſe. Therfore when the miſcheefe increaſeth,
and that there breedeth any infection of it, (that is to ſay, when one
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:23060:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
beginnes too marre another,) let vs bethinke vs too ſet our ſelues
luſtely agaynſt it, and not ſuffer the ſhrewd weedes too growe ſo
farre as to choke the corne, but let vs plucke them vp bytimes. And
this is too bee done, not onely in the errours that marre the pure
doctrine of the Goſpell, but alſo in all vices and corruptions [of
manners]. Truely if there bee any Hereſies and wicked opinions
which might ſet all things in a broyle, it is all one as if a man ſhould
haue a ſtroke with a ſwoord or a dagger in his breſt or in his throte.
For wherein is the lyfe and welfare of the Churche, but in the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Gods woord? If a man would come and put poyſon in our
meate whereof wee ſhould take nurriſhment, ſhould wee holde our
peace at it? No: but wee ſhould rather ſtorme at it? Now the ſelf-ſame
reaſon holdeth in the doctrine of the Goſpell, and wee muſte
haue our handes alwayes lift vp too maynteyne the pure doctrine,
and not ſuffer it in any wyſe to be corrupted. Alſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſee vices
reygne, wee muſt prouide for them and redreſſe them in due ſeaſon.
For if wee beare with it and doo as moſt men doo, whiche doo but
laugh at it and prouide for it at leyzure: wee ſhall afterward bee at
our wittes end, too ſee how God hath ſhet the gate, and how Satan
hath wonne the goale out of all krie. And ſure it is a iuſt reward of
our rechleſneſſe and coldneſſe, when wee bee not heedefull to cure
the diſeaſes as ſoone as wee ſee them infect and marre the bodie of
the Churche after that ſort. Thus yee ſee what wee haue in effect
too remember heere: namely that wee muſt not bee ſo fooliſh and
lightminded, as too receyue the things that theſe Newters or dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blehanded
men doo put vnto vs, as who ſhould ſay, that if the great
abuſes bee amended, it ought to ſuffyze vs. But let vs neuer leaue
till the Goſpell bee ſet agayne in his pure ſoundneſſe, and that wee
haue it in the ſelf ſame wyze which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt deliuered
it too vs, without any mingling put thereto by men. And ſecondly
agayne, thereafter as wee ſee the miſchiefe preuayle, let vs bryng
theſe backe vnto God which are gone aſtray, and labour too ſtoppe
thoſe that leade their neighbours after that faſhion too deſtruction,
and ſeeke nothing but too turne all vpſide downe: let ſuch men be
repreſſed, and let euery one that hath the zeale of God ſhewe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
their deadly enemie, breaking aſunder what ſoeuer may holde
<pb facs="tcp:23060:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vs backe: and whither there bee frendſhip or kinred betwixte vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
or any other of the ſtreyghteſt bondes in the worlde: lette vs burie
euerywhit of it in forgetfulneſſe, when wee ſee the foules that were
bought with the bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſo led to ruine and
deſtruction: or when wee ſee things that were well ſettled, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen,
and nothing elſe ſought but confuſion, ſo as menne might
not know any more what Ieſus Chriſt is, and that by little and little
the Diuell getteth full ſcope, and carieth vs away headlong, as
though the brydle were layd looce in our necke. VVhen wee ſee
the miſchiefe tende too this poynt: let euery of vs ſtreyne himſelf
too ſtop it, and ſhewe that wee had leuer too haue deadly foode for
the ſeruing of God, than too haue all the friendſhip in the worlde
for pleaſing and pleaſuring of mortall creatures. VVherfore let vs
not play the blind men or blinkardes when wee ſee God offended,
but let vs ſet ſo muche ſtore by his truthe and glorie, that all other
things may be nothing too vs in compariſon thereof. Thus ye ſee in
effect how we ought to put this doctrine in vre. The reſidue ſhall be
reſerued till the afternoone.</p>
            <p>Then let vs nowe fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good
God with acknowledgement of our faultes, praying him to make vs
feele them more and more, and that therewithall for aſmuch as hee
will haue vs to come to him with true repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, it may pleaſe him
to draw vs by his holy ſpirite, and to beare with our infirmities till
he haue quyte and cleane purged and rid vs of them, and brought vs
to the perfection wherevnto he calleth and incourageth vs. And ſo
let vs all ſay, Almightie God our heauenly father. &amp;c.</p>

what Law a man layeth vpon others, he ought
too keepe the ſame himſelfe. For it is nother
right nor reaſon, that a man ſhould go ſcotfree
himſelf, and lay the burthen vpon other folkes
ſhoulders. And for that cauſe doth our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt vpbrayd the Scribes and Phariſies,<note place="margin">Math. 23. a. 4.</note>
that they paſſed not to lay heauy burthens vpon the poore people, &amp;
in the meane while tooke leaue to do what they liſted themſelues.
And commonly it falleth out through hipocriſie, that he which is
rough &amp; extreme in all rigour towards his neybours, would haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men to forbeare him and to diſpence with him. But if wee will
needes preſſe our neighbours to do their duetie, the true &amp; naturall
order requireth, that euery of vs ſhould firſt begin at himſelf. Ye ſee
then how it is a moſt manifeſt hipocriſie, when a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will not a whit

&amp; in the meane while offendeth groſly himſelf, &amp; will not ſuffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yea &amp; ſomtimes alſo it falleth out, that we would play
the good fellowes at other mens coſt. Euen ſo fell it out heere in S.
Peter. For his inforcing of the Gentyles to keepe the Ceremoniall
lawe, came not of the foreſayde hypocriſie of taking leaue too doo
what he liſted, and of deſiring too go quite and cleere before God
for his conſtreyning of other menne too ſuch a poynt: but of dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe,
for that hee was too deſirouſe too pleaſure his owne
countrymen. He had already taken leaue too liue after the maner
<pb facs="tcp:23060:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Gentyles, that is to ſay, too giue ouer the vſing of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Lawe. For (as I haue earſt touched) S. Paule ſpeaketh
not heere of the vnbeleeuers, nor of the deſpyzers of God: but of
thoſe Gentyles that had bin conuerted too the knowledge of the
Goſpell, and were deſirous to ſerue God, yea euen without the old
Ceremonies. Now S. Peter had faſhioned himſelf to their common
trade, and yet notwithſtanding he was a Iewe: and therfore he did
the Gentyles too much wrong, to put a ſtreyter brydle vpon them,
than he receyued to himſelf, as I ſayd afore. He did it not in reſpect
of himſelfe, but playde on both handes, as they doo whiche would
feyne keepe fauour with all parties, and are loth too miſlike any
man. So wee ſee there was rightfull reaſon to rebuke him, and too
ſhame him before all the Church. Now remayneth that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
his faulte, by which example wee muſte learne mildeneſſe.
That is to ſay, for aſmuch as there is none of vs all but he may ſtep
awry, as they that haue not ſuch perfect wiſedome but that we may
fall euen into groſſe faultes: and although we perceyue it not, yet
now and then we happen to ſwarue through infirmitie: at leaſtwyze
let vs not ieere at it when we be reformed, as many proude &amp; ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
folke do, who eyther ſpew out their poyſon, or elſe rancle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
in their hartes when they bee rebuked. Let vs learne firſt
of all by S. Peters example, that there is none of vs all ſo farre fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in holineſſe, wiſedome and vertue, which may not ouerſhoote
himſelf. And therfore let vs patiently heare what is tolde vs, that
wee may fare the better by it: and let vs not bee aſhamed too caſte
downe our heades when we ſee our ſelues iuſtly accuzed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
Thus yee ſee what we haue to remember vppon the firſt
part of this Text. Truely we haue ſeene already this mornyng, how
S. Peter had this honorable title, to be called a chiefe piller in Gods
Churche, and in the ſpirituall Temple that was too bee buylded. He
was honored, he and his fellowes had receyued the holy Ghoſt, and
although he had ſtumbled once afore, yet had Ieſus Chriſte ſet him
vp againe, and wiped away the remembrance of that fall, in ſaying to
him,<note place="margin">Iohn. 22. c. 15.</note> feede my Sheepe, haue a care of my Lambes. And yet for all
this, he walketh not the right way, but ſteppeth aſide. VVherefore
it behoueth vs too bee ſo much the warer that noman deceyue vs,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:23060:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as though wee had profited ſo well in Gods ſchoole, that wee were
no more in daunger of doyng amiſſe. Let vs beware of ſuche ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening,
and keepe continuall watch, that wee bee not miſledde by
the wyles and traynes of Satan: yea let it bee a ſuſpicious matter
with vs too deſire too pleaſe men, ſeyng that S. Peter fell intoo that
extremitie. True it is that his meening was too the contrarie, and
that his intent was too imploy himſelf wholly too the glorifying of
Gods name. He had ſtoutly withſtoode it when he was forbidden
too preache any more in the name of Ieſus Chriſt. It was the voyce
of an Angelicall ſtoutneſſe when he anſwered,<note place="margin">Act. 4. d. 19 &amp; 5. c. 29.</note> God muſt be obeyed
and not men. For he ſawe there the rulers of his countrie, he ſawe
them aſſembled with their pompe, and there was the ſtatelineſſe of
Magiſtrates, which had bin able too amaze a poore man of no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
as he and his fellow Iohn were. But not withſtanding his ſtout
anſwering that he woulde obey God maugre all thoſe that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
too haue preheminence ouer him, yet he was deceyued in this
cace whereof mention is made heere. Therefore whenſoeuer men
doo the thing that may thruſt vs out of the way, and wee haue ſome
fayre cloke, ſo as it ſhall ſeeme too vs that wee doo not amiſſe too
pleaſe them: Let vs bethinke vs of this example, that is ſet vs down
heere, and which is tolde vs too make vs euery of vs looke aboute
him what his calling will beare, and what God commaundeth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
caſting of our eye aſide too purchace fauour in the worlde. Let
vs ſhet our eyes agaynſt all that is about vs, and looke onely at this
marke, that wee muſt in all caces and all reſpectes faſhion our ſelues
too the will of God. And when wee ſhall haue looked rightfoorth
too Gods ordinances, and asked counſell at his mouth, and prayed
him too guyde and gouerne vs by his holy ſpirite, and finally well
conſidered the boundes of our vocation, ſo as wee attempt not any
thing otherwiſe than becommeth vs: then ſhall wee bee able too
eſchew the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lightes and allurementes of Satan and the worlde, ſo as
wee ſhall not paſſe too pleaſure creatures ouermuch. But without
that, wee ſhall bee beguyled at euery turne as it happened vnto Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For if wee compare our ſelues with him: it is certaine that hee
was much better able too keepe himſelf than wee bee. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he was caſt downe afterward, too the end that his doyng might
<pb facs="tcp:23060:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſerue for our learning, and wee bee rid of all pryde, ſo as wee might
not thruſt foorth our owne opinions to bee ouerwyze in our owne
brayne and fancie, but that all our wiſedome might bee too rule our
ſelues according to Gods pure woord. But now let vs come to that
which S. Paule addeth. He entereth further intoo the matter and
ſayeth, <hi>wee bee Iewes by nature and not ſinners</hi> (that is too ſay, damnable
men, defiled, and miſerable wretches) <hi>of the Gentyles. And yet
notwithstanding for aſmuch as we know that wee cannot bee iustified by
the deedes of the law,</hi> and that there is none other meanes to make vs
acceptable to God, than by comming too him with the grace of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſte: wee haue renounced the rightuouſneſſe of the
lawe; and aſſured our ſelues, that Gods accepting of vs muſte bee of
his owne free goodneſſe for his ſonnes ſake. Seyng then that wee
Iewes haue renounced our owne worthineſſe, what ſhall the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyles
now do? muſt not all be reconciled to God, through his owne
meere goodneſſe without bringing any thing of their owne, and
without pretending to haue any maner of deſert or worthineſſe of
themſelues? Heere (as I haue touched afore) S. Paule entereth into
the principall poynt of his diſputation; agaynſt ſuche as mingled the
Ceremonies of the lawe with the Goſpell. Howbeit S. Peter was
none of that number. For it is certayne that he knew well ynough,
that there was none other meane too come vntoo God, than by his
mercie as it is ſhewed vs in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Sainct Paule had
communed ſufficiently with him afore of that matter, as wee haue
ſeene. He agreed fully with S. Paule as touching doctrine. Then
was not Sainct Peter wrapped in that errour: for it had bin a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
that had vtterly defaced the death and paſsion of our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſte. Therefore S. Peter would haue abhorred that. But
the diſsimulation that I treated of this morning, was an occaſion to
harden the Iewes in the fond dotage which they had conceyued of
their owne meritorious woorkes. Not that he intended it: nother
is it a ſufficient excuſe for vs though wee proteſt a hundred tymes,
that wee meene not too mayntayne euill: but if wee make any
countenance at all of it, ſurely wee are alwayes woorthie too bee
condemned bothe before God and the worlde. Sainct Peter then
agreed very well with Sainct Paule as concerning doctrine, namely
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:23060:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that there is none other meane too come before God too obtayne
grace, than by renouncing all creatures, and by confeſsing that there
is nothing but curſedneſſe in vs, and that God muſte receyue vs of
his owne meere mercie for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſtes ſake. S. Peter
knew this, and taught it without any gayne ſaying. And moreouer he
wiſt well it was lawfull for him to giue ouer the vſe of Ceremonies.
For he would not haue graunted too any ſuche libertie, vnleſſe he
had knowen that the ſame had bin purchaced for vs by the death
and paſsion of the Sonne of God. Neuertheleſſe he ſwarued a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
too much, too the intent too keepe ſtill his owne Countriemen,
bicauſe he knew that the Iewes were ſomewhat too wilfull &amp; way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and therfore he ment no more but to beare with their nature.
But S. Paule reſpecteth not the perſon of his fellow S. Peter, nother
reaſoneth he with him, as if he ſhoulde ſay, thou arte an abuzer of
men, thou knoweſt not what the Goſpell meeneth, but hee ſayeth
vntoo him, bethinke thee well what is like too befall of thy doyng,
and what inconuenience it will draw with it. For whereat ame they
that would haue men too keepe the Ceremonies of the Lawe? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
too get ſome holyneſſe by them, or to binde men ſo too them,
as they ſhould vſe them vpon neceſsitie of ſaluation, and to deſerue
fauour by them at Gods hand, and finally to obtayne forgiueneſſe of
ſinnes by keeping of circumciſion and all other ſuch things. But in
ſo doing they be hild downe in this errour, that they renounce the
death and paſsion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and yet notwithſtanding
thou intendeſt too feede them in that fondneſſe, and what a thing
were that?</p>
            <p>Therfore let vs marke wel how S. Paule paſſeth not what Peters
opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in this behalf, but dealeth with the matter it ſelf, to the end
that all cloking might be taken away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch as did ſhet the Goſpel
out of dores, beſides that they did alſo rende the Church aſunder as
we ſaw this morning. Howbeit for aſmuch as it is a matter that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not
be [fully] diſcourſed in a day [or twayne,] no nor in fower: we muſt
take the things in order as they lie, to the end we may know why S.
Paule ſtroue ſo ſharply for the aboliſhing of Ceremonies. For the
cace concerneth the ſaluation of our Soules, and it is the chief point
that we muſt learne in gods ſchole, next after the glorifying of him,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For if wee fall too compariſons, it is certaine that the ſeruing of
God dooth alwayes go in order and degree before the ſaluation of
our ſoules. True it is that they bee things inſeparable: for God
ſheweth his infinite loue which he beareth vs, in this that neuer any
thing ſerueth too his glorie, but that the ſame is immediately fitte
and profitable for our ſaluation. Howbeit for aſmuch as God hath
loued vs ſo greately, and continueth ſtill his fauour towardes vs:
wee on our ſide are bound vntoo him, bothe too forget our ſelues
and to giue ſelues wholly vnto him. But how ſoeuer we fare,
wee ſee heere the twoo groundes of all our Religion: namely too
know how God ought too be honored and ſerued, and alſo how we
may ſo offer our ſelues before him, as he may accept vs and auow
vs for his children, and wee holde him for our father, and by that
meanes be fully aſſured of our ſaluation. And theſe twoo poynts
are contayned in the diſcourſe that S. Paule handleth heere. For the
cace is, after what maner God wil be ſerued: according as the cheef
ſacrifize that he demaundeth, is the confeſsion of humilitie: I ſay
humilitie: not by making demure countenances, but by beyng
touched with ſuch remorſe, as wee ſuffer our ſelues too bee vtterly
condemned before God, and all the truſt of our owne woorkes and
merites be thruſt vnder foote. Marke that for one poynt. And more
ouer, when God commaunded the Ceremonies, it was not for that
he paſſed vpon theſe outward things: but for that he amed at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end: which was, that [on the one ſide] the Iewes ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured
to patience, by continuall perceyuing of their owne wantes and
miſeries, and therevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rid themſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al corruptions of the fleſh:
and on the other ſide be led to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to repoſe their
truſt in him, &amp; to reſt wholly there. So then, as touching thoſe that
would haue the ceremonies of the Law kept, as if it were of neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be preciſely bound to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon paine of [deadly]
ſinne as they terme it: it is certayne that their meening was to ſet
vp a ſeruis of God contrarie too his will and meening, and that they
were as good as Couſiners: for why, they peruerted the naturall
meening of the Law. Marke that for one ſchoole poynt. Another is,
that they taught men to ſet vp their briſtles, &amp; to glory in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues,
&amp; that was an aboliſhing of Gods glory: for we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dge aught
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:23060:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(be it neuer ſo little) to ourſelues, but we rob and rende away that
which belongeth vnto him. Ye ſee then how it is a diueliſh trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſſe
when men preſume vpon their owne power, as though
they had any ſparke of righteouſneſſe in themſelues. And beſydes
that, it is an entering into the gulfe of hell, when we weene to get
ſaluation by our owne workes. For we renounce the death and
paſsion of our Lord Ieſus Chryſte, where we ſhould ſeeke all our
righteouſneſſe. Agayne the Diuell maketh vs to beleeue wonders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
howbeit, it is but to make vs to fall into deſtruction. VVherefore
let vs marke well, that S. Paule treateth heere of the manner of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
before God, that is to ſay, of the meane whereby we bee
brought into his fauour, bycauſe it is the principall poynt whiche
we ought to learne, and without that, all the religion [or deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on]
that can be named, is but ſmoke and leazings. And it is not for
naught that Sainct Paule entereth into that queſtion. For manye
men make this allegation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How now? The cace concerned the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of the law: and why then doth Sainct Paule (as ye would
ſaye) fling himſelfe ouerthwart the feelds? VVhy ſpeaketh hee of
righteouſneſſe, of mans ſaluation, of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and
fynally of all the whole lawe? Nowe on the one part, it behoued
hym too deale wyth all thoſe thynges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for example, when
we in theſe dayes teache, that men muſt not keepe the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Papiſts, nor any of the thyngs that haue bin ſo deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the witte of man: wee ſhall not only debate whither fleſhe
may be eaten vppon frydayes, or whyther ſuche a wake, vigil, or
Sainctes euen bee too be kept, or whyther thys thyng or that
thing be to be done: but we ſhall treate generally whither it bee
lawfull for a mortall man to make lawes to bring mennes conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
into tyrannicall bondage.<note place="margin">Eſa. 33. d. 22</note> For God hathe reſerued to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
alone the authoritie and prerogatiue to be called the lawma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
to the intent that no man ſhould vſurp any ſuch preheminence
in the Church. Then ſeeing that the ſpirituall gouernement of our
ſoules ought to be taken out of Gods pure word: we may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude,
that nother Pope, nor any other man of what calling ſoeuer he be,
hath power to burthen vs with any lawes, or ought to attempt any
thing that is againſt the doctrine whiche we haue of God. Then
<pb facs="tcp:23060:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
may we well enter into that generall diſcourſe: and that is bycauſe
the reaſon of them is alike in all points. If we ſhould diſpute onely
about the eating of fiſh or fleſh, it would be but a fond diſputation.
For euery man muſt eate according as is for his health, or as hee
can get: and therefore ſuch diſputation ſhoulde not concerne the
health of mens ſoules, or the matter that were requiſite for them to
reſt their conſcience vpon. But when we take in hand too ſhewe
that it is not for any liuing creature to aduance himſelfe ſo hygh,
as to lay lawes vppon mennes necks: the other diſputation is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſolued and diſpatched. Againe when as men ſay, that in bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
paternoſters to buy out their ſinnes, and in gadding on pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage
to get there the things which in poperie are tearmed the
workes of ſupererogation (that is to ſaye, workes of ouerplus that
men do more than God commaundeth them) they raunſome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
and make him ſome recompence for the faultes that they
haue committed: If we ſpeake ſimply of pilgrimages, and go not
to the ground and welſpring of the matter: it will be a cold and ſle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
diſcourſe. But if we declare how all our ſatisfaction is in the
things that are purchaced for vs by the death and paſsion of oure
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and therewithall that God vtterly miſliketh all
that is of our owne inuention, and that he will be ſerued with obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
then do we lay foorthe the cace as it ought to be, and may
bring it to a ſure and certaine concluſion. After that manner did S.
Paule. For he regarded not only what the Iewes ſayd, how it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them to forbeare the eating of ſwines fleſh, and to keepe ſuche
a feaſt or ſuch a feaſt, and all the reſidue of the Ceremonies: but he
marked to what end they ſaid it: namely how they went about too
ſhew, that the keeping of the law was of neceſsitie of ſaluation and
that was a yoke of bondage vpon mens conſciences, that could not
be borne. Againe he ſaw how the libertie that was purchaced vs by
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was taken away, and that was another point
that compelled him to enter into that diſcourſe. But the cheefe
point that he treateth of heere, is that ſuch as would haue had men
to keepe the Ceremonies, had a ſecret meening that the ſame was
an acceptable ſeruis vnto God, and of ſuch importance as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhuld
purchace righteouſneſſe and ſoulehealth by it, and (to be ſhort) that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:23060:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it was a meritorious thing. But S. Paule ſheweth, that it is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to purchace righteouſneſſe before God by their works.
Now therefore we ſee for what cauſe S. Paule treated generally of
our iuſtification, when as notwithſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ding hys aduerſaries preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no more, but the keeping of the Ceremoniall lawe, and the
continuing thereof ſtill as before the comming of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, ſo as men ſhould ſtill offer ſacrifiſe, and do the reſt of the
ſhadowes and auncient figures. And heereby we ſee alſo what a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
it is for the Papiſts to thinke themſelues eſcaped, in ſaying that
S. Paule ſpeaketh heere but of the works of the law, and not of the
morall works. True it is that they be not the firſt founders of that
dotage. For the Diuell hath always had his miniſters to couſin the
people. But we muſt not reſt vpon the authoritie of men, ſpecially
of ſuch as haue nother religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor feare of God in them. Although
that many of the Monkes haue bin reported to be men of greate
skill: yet notwithſtanding they haue bin but fantaſticall fellowes,
and neuer had any taſt of the feare of God. Euen thoſe that were
called the auncient doctors, haue peruerted the kindly ſenſe of the
holy ſcripture, and were as vtterly bewitched by Satan, and yet
the wretched world hath bin ſo blynde, that it could not perceyue
it. Theſe kinde of men haue expounded this ſaying, that wee bee
not iuſtifyed by the deedes of the law, to import that wee bee not
iuſtifyed by the deedes of the law, to import that we be not iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
by circumciſion, or by abſteyning from any certaine kynds of
meates, or by keeping ſuch a holyday or ſuch a feaſt, whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
S. Paule treateth of none of all thoſe things. He mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
Gods grace againſt all our workes, and finally ſheweth that
we cannot bring aught vnto God, but that we muſt be faine to be
admitted freely of him. That is S. Paules drift. And if we ſhould not
ſet the ſame marke before our eyes, ſurely all the doctrine that is
conteined in this Epiſtle, would be but fond matter. Furthermore
let vs marke,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. d. 27</note> that S. Paule doth oftentimes ſay ſimply and without
addition, that wee bee iuſtified without workes: like as in the
thirde Chapter too the Romanes, he ſayth we haue a cleere and
ſure proofe of our righteouſneſſe, namely that we bee rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
before God through the remiſsion of our ſinnes, and not by
our workes. Hee ſaythe not there, by the workes of the lawe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but he ſetteth it downe ſingle [without addition,] to the ende that
all mouthes ſhould be ſtopped, and all ſtartingholes be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Yet is it not without cauſe that he ſpeaketh of the workes of the
law, to bring to nothing all the ſeruices that men can alledge too
bind God withall, as though they were able to become righteouſe
of themſelues. For as we ſhall ſee hereafter, although we were as
perfect as Angells, yet could not that bind God at all, if it were not
for that he of his owne good will hath made this promis in hys
law,<note place="margin">Leui. 18. a. 5</note> he that doth theſe thinges ſhall liue in them. Then if we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to get fauour at Gods hand for our owne works ſakes, we
muſt not diſpute philoſopherlike, that God oweth vs any wages
or recompence for the ſeruis that we haue done him: for we be his,
and we cannot bind him by aught that we can do. How then may
our works be recompenced as though they were auaylable before
God? Euen bycauſe he hath promiſed ſo to do. It is the couenant
whiche he hath made with vs in ſaying, he that doth theſe thynges
ſhal liue in them. So then, if we could performe the law to the full,
ſurely we ſhould be righteous before God, and deſerue ſaluation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
howbeit not for any worthineſſe that ſhould be in our ſelues, but
by reaſon of the couenant that God hath made with vs. For we ſee
that all the deſert which can be alledged on mannes behalfe, depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
wholly vpon the ſaid promis. And that is the cauſe why ſainct
Paule ſaith always, the works of the law, the works of the law. For
there are none other workes that deſerue to be accepted of God
and to haue any recompence. Therefore let that ſerue for one
point. And we ſhall ſee heereafter, how we be vtterly excluded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that righteouſneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bycauſe we come ſhort of it: and that Goddes
telling of vs that we ſhall be ſaued by keeping of the lawe, is all
one as if hee had ſayde, that we be all of vs damned. And why?
For there is not any manne that diſchargeth himſelfe of it, but
all of vs are tranſgreſſers. Ye ſee then that the lawe can bryng
vs nothyng but deathe, by reaſon of our infirmitie. But thys
ſhall bee layde foorth more at length in his order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is ynough
for thys tyme that we knowe how Sainct Paules ſetting downe
of thys doctrine, is agaynſt the Iewes which boaſted themſelues
and were puffed up with pride, as though God had bin bounde
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:23060:103"/>
vnto them for their obſeruing of the Ceremonies of the lawe. No
no, (ſaith he) it is nothing worth: and we ſhall ſee the reaſon of it
afterwarde. Furthermore S. Paules debating of the caſe of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
is bycauſe theſe hypocrites which tooke vpon them to match
themſelues with God, and too haue the praiſe of their ſaluation
themſelues, did always buzie their heads about ſmall trifles, and
came not to the cheefe point, which is to enter into their owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.
Like as at this day in the Popedome, they that do ſo much
preach their owne merites, and ſay that we muſt purchace Paradice
by our owne works, and that although we be ſinners, yet we haue
a way to diſcharge ourſelues to Godward by ſatiſfactions: what al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
they? VVhen thoſe great Rabines go about to ſet men after
that maner vpon the ſtage to be honored as Idolls, and when they
haue made their great prefaces of free will, of their owne vertues,
of their ſatisfactions, and of their merites or deſeruings: what bring
they? Exhort they men to liue chaſtly, without doing other men
wrong, or without any couetous deſire, ſo as euery of vs ſhoulde
content hymſelfe with that he hath, be patient in aduerſitie, beare
wrongs and reproches, and in all thynges ſhewe ourſelues to bee
the Diſciples of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte by forſaking ourſelues?
There is not one word with them of theſe things. But the good
workes which they ſet afore vs are, that we muſt go deuoutely too
Maſſe, take holywater before we enter into the Church, be croſſe
ourſelues, kneele downe before a ſtocke, worſhip a puppet, gad on
pilgrimages, keepe ſuche a feaſtfull daye, found a Trentall, deale
doales for the dead, and do this and that. So then, all theſe hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
which will needes become righteous by their owne workes,
haue nothing but gewgawes and dotages: and yet for all that, they
thinke themſelues ſo holy and perfect, that nothing is amiſſe in
them. They thinke that God ought to content himſelfe wyth the
great number of murlimewes and countenances which they make.
But that is not the coyne wherewith he muſt be paied: for his lawe
is ſpirituall. He looketh not vpon the outward geſture, nor vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
things that carrie a faire gloſſe before men, in ſomuch that if men
ſet their minds too much vpon his owne Ceremonies, he reiecteth
it vtterly: And that is a thing well worthy the marking. For
<pb facs="tcp:23060:104"/>
men ſeeke ſtill ſome ſtartinghole, that they might not yeeld them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to the obeying of God: and they beare themſelues in hand,
that when they haue once diſpatched their fond deuotions, then
they be well diſcharged, and all the reſt of their ſinnes muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
bycauſe they raunſome them by that meanes. The thyng
therefore whiche we haue to marke heere, is that Sainct Paule
ſtroue heere againſt ſuche men, as neuer wiſt what it was too ſerue
God in good earneſt, nor neuer entered into their owne conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And euen ſuch are theſe Shauelings in the Popedome, and thoſe
naughtipacks that haue their full ſcope there: I meene not only the
Cardinalls and theſe horned beaſts the Byſhops, (for men knowe
that they be the filthineſſe whiche infecteth the whole world) but I
ſpeake alſo of thoſe that are called doctors, the vpholders of their
Catholike faith. It is certaine that they be but mockers of God,
they neuer entered into their conſciences to examin themſelues
earneſtly, nother had they euer any remorſe of conſcience. Surely
all their ſtudy hath bin to holde folke as it were vppon the racke,
and to put many hartgripes into them, to the intent they myghte
ſeeme to be ſharpwitted. But as for themſelues, they neuer felt any
thing. And that is the cauſe why they prate ſo much at their caſe
concerning merites, and yet in the meane while haue no regarde
of them themſelues. Only they do ſome ſmall trifles, like rittlerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
that men giue to little children, wherewith they beare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in hande that they can appeaſe God. Now for thys cauſe
Sainct Paule diſputeth of the Ceremonies of the lawe, as they
were put vntoo hym: and yet dothe hee neuertheleſſe cut home
to the bottome, that is too witte, [hee prooueth] that men are
ſtripped ſtarke naked from all righteouſneſſe, and cannot bryng
any thyng vntoo GOD, but muſt beg at hys hande, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing
that there is nothyng in them but vtter beggerie and
penurie. And furthermore let vs marke alſo, that the Iewes did
alwayes peruert the nature and vſe of the Sacramentes, in that
they made meritorious workes of them, and that was cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the vſe that they ſhould haue put them too. For God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
not the Sacramentes to the end that by indeuoring to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
them, men ſhould purchace any vertue that might be imputed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:23060:104"/>
to them for righteouſneſſe: but rather to teach them that it ſtoode
them in hand to ſeeke all at Gods hand. As for example, when the
Iewes were circumciſed, thereby God ſhewed to the eye, that all
that euer commeth of man is but corruption, and that it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vs
on hand to haue it cut away. So, the thing which the Iewes had too
conſider in that viſible Sacrament, was that mans nature was cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
before God, and that we may well ſeeke but neuer fynde ſo
much as one drop of cleanneſſe in it. And on the other ſyde they
had a token and recorde, that God neuertheleſſe woulde ſuccour
them by meanes of the Redeemer, which ſhould come of the race
of men: for he was borne of the linage of Dauid. God therfore ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
that thing viſibly. And ſo the Iewes were caſt downe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and ought to haue conſidered that there was nothing but
curſedneſſe in them, and therevpon ſhould haue come to ſeeke the
thing in our Lord Ieſus Chryſt whiche wanted in themſelues. As
much is to be thought of their waſhings. As oft as the Iewes waſhed
themſelues, it was a putting of them in minde, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but vnclenneſſe in them. And wherein was that waſhing? was
it in the water? No: but in the bloud of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte.
VVhen the brute beaſts were ſlayne, there they behild that they
had deſerued death. The beaſtes were giltleſſe, and yet they were
ſacrifiſed for mennes ſakes, to beare their ſinnes. Thus ye ſee a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
which ſheweth that all men are curſed of God. And yet in ſo
doing men humbled themſelues, calling vpon God, and proteſting
that they were redeemed by the ſacrifiſe: Howbeit not by thoſe
ſhadowing ſacrifiſes, but by the true ſacrifiſe whiche was not yet
come into the world. But what did the Iewes? VVhen they were
once circumciſed, they thought that God was bound vnto them
for it. And when they had offered ſacrifiſe, they thought there was
great holineſſe in ſo doing, and made their boaſt thereof. But the
Prophets rebuked thoſe hipocrites dubble. For firſt they told them
that when they had kept al the Ceremonies of the lawe, their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
were nothing,<note place="margin">Oſee. 6. b. 6.</note> all was but vanitie. For behold, God ſaith, I wil
haue mercy and not ſacrifice: and again, I wil ſhew thee ô man how
thou ſhalt pleaſe God: be thou hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled truly, &amp; imagin not to bring
him many ſheepe &amp; Oxen,<note place="margin">Micheas. 6. b. 8.</note> for that is nothing: but deale thou iuſtly
<pb facs="tcp:23060:105"/>
and vprightly, and when thou haſt worſhipped him, liue honeſtly
and vncorruptly with thy neighbours. Alſo we ſee what oure Lord
ſayth in Ieremy.<note place="margin">Ier. 7. e. 22.</note> Did I ſpeake to your fathers (ſaith he) of offering
ſacrifice vnto me? No, (ſayth he) but I willed them to obey me, and
to herken to my voyce, and to ſerue me with a ſound hart. Agayne
in another place it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Ier. 1. e. 23.</note> Lord thou loueſt faithfulneſſe. Thus we
ſee how the prophets rebuke the Hypocrites for being hild backe
by the Ceremonies, which are nothing of themſelues, except men
walke in a cleere conſcience towards God, and in faithfulneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
men. And after that the Prophets haue ſpoken ſo: they adde
ſecondly that when men haue done all that they can, yet ceaſſe
they not to be ſtil in Goddes dette,<note place="margin">Ier. 31. f. 34</note> and that the Ceremonies ſerue
to bring them ſtill neerer, that is to witte, to make them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that God calleth them to him, promiſing them to ſhew them
mercie, and too forget and burie all their miſdeedes, howbeit by
meane of the Redeemer that was promiſed them. But now Sainct
Paule leaueth the firſt point, namely that the Ceremonies are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without the principall, which is that we walke without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any man wrong, and without doing any hurt or harme to other
men, that we liue chaſt and pure, and that we haue a cleane and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
conſcience. S. Paule letteth that diſcourſe alone: and why? For
it would not ſerue the purpoſe. And therefore he ſheweth that the
ſhadowes of the law were nother profitable nor needefull, bicauſe
they were nothing if a man looked vpon them in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but that the end of them was to be conſidered, which was that
for aſmuche as they were a witneſſe of the grace that is giuen vs
now finally in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: it behoued them to reſt who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
therevpon. And the ſame ought to be well printed at this daye
both in our hart and in our remembrance. For wee ſhall haue
profyted greatly, if we once know how to apply to oure vſe the
Sacramentes that are ordeyned by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſpecially
for aſmuch as we haue to receiue the Lords ſupper the next Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
For although we ought to haue bin exhorted this day to put
ourſelues in a reddines to it, yet was it not touched this morning.
But let vs beare well in mind, that if we thinke to be made rygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
by baptim, we defyle the thing which God hath apointed to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:23060:105"/>
our ſaluation. And why? Baptiſme dothe but teache vs that there
is nothing but filthe and vncleanneſſe in vs. For wherefore do wee
waſhe our handes, faces, and bodies, but to make them cleane from
the ſpottes that are in them? Nowe it is ſayde that Baptiſme is a
waſhing of vs: and therefore it followeth that when wee come to
Baptiſme, or when any of vs bringeth his children [to be baptized]
we declare that the children are alreadie damned and forlorne eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
from their mothers wombe, and that they be a curſed ſeede, ſo as
they muſt be fayne to breake clenneſſe, not by their own purchace,
but by receyuing it, for as muche as it is offred them in our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt. Nowe if children be alreadie full of infections at their
comming into the world:<note place="margin">Iob. 15. b. 16</note> what are we who neuer ceaſſe to offend
our God, and do drinke wickedneſſe as a fiſhe drinketh water, as
it is ſayde in the booke of Iob? Agayne, when wee come too the
Lords ſupper, what come we to doo? Come we to get any thing
of God by our owne deſert? No: but to confeſſe that we be like
wretched dead men, which come to ſeeke our life out of our ſelues,
and therefore muſt be fayne to haue the fleſhe of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt for our meate, and his bloud for our drinke, and all things
in him which we want in our ſelues. Yee ſee then that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſerue not to puffe vs vp with any preſumption, but to make
vs walke in humbleneſſe, to the ende that beeing voyde of all ſelfe-truſt,
our whole ſeeking may be to be ſuccoured by Gods infinite
goodneſſe, and by his pouring out of the treaſures of his grace
vpon vs according to our neede. And our comming to them is,
that God ſhould warne vs of our ſinnes, to be touched with them
in good earneſt. And wee muſte not acknowledge our ſelues ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with the mouth onely, or ſlightly and by way of ceremonies:
but wee muſt haue our hartes wounded inwardly with griefe that
wee haue offended, and feele howe dreadfull Gods wrath is, too
the ende wee may be ſorie in our ſelues, and not haue any reſt till
he haue ſhewed vs where wee ſhall finde it, that is too wit in our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And when we come to this holy table, let euer,
of vs looke well that he be ſo grounded in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,
as that he hauing forſaken all the fonde illuſions of Satan, and all
the deceiptes that he ſetteth afore vs too turne vs away from the
<pb facs="tcp:23060:106"/>
grace of God, and may imbrace our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte with the
merites of his death and paſsion, aſſuring our ſelues that it is he in
whom we haue the full performance of righteouſneſſe and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Moreouer foraſmuche as our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath called

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue ſeene alredie and declared heretofore,
why S. Paule hauing to treate of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and ſhadowes that were before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
that men could not attaine righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
before God to ſtand in his fauour, but by
keeping the whole lawe. Nowe a man mighte
deeme at the firſt ſight, that theſe were diuers matters. Howbeit (as
I haue ſayde afore) it behoued Paule to come to the pure vſe [of
ceremonies] to ſhew that men do but beguyle them ſelues, when
they thinke to obteine fauour at Gods hand by their own merites.
Secondly, alſo I declared why S. Paul doth expreſly adde the word
Law. For although it haue alwayes bin a common opinion in the
world, that by liuing well men might binde God to be good vnto
them, yet did they fowlly deceyue them ſelues therein. For doo
what we can, God ſhall not be any whit at all beholden vnto vs,
bicauſe wee owe vnto him what ſoeuer wee be able to doo. Then
is there not any deſerte (if there might bee any deſeruing at all)
but by the couenant which God hath made,<note place="margin">Leu. 18. a. 5.</note> in ſaying, that he which
fulfilleth the law ſhall obteine life and ſaluation. For as muche as
God hath ſpoken that worde, no doubt but he accepteth the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
that is yeelded vnto him, as if it deſerued ſaluation: but
yet is not that as muche too ſay as that wee can deſerue oughte.
For there is none of vs all that diſchargeth hys duetie, as wee
ſhall ſee heereafter. That promiſe woulde bee too no purpoſe,
or at leaſt wyſe it woulde bee vnauaylable, ſo as it ſhoulde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
take effecte, vnleſſe God gaue vs another remedie, that is
too witte, vnleſſe hee forgaue our offences, and accepted vs for
righteous, althoughe wee bee not ſo. But howe ſo euer the cace
ſtande, when S. Paule ſayth that wee bee not iuſtifyed by the
workes of the Lawe, hys meanyng is, that if wee intende too
<pb facs="tcp:23060:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
clayme fauour and ſaluation, bicauſe God hath promiſed that ſuch
as keepe his lawe ſhall be righteous, and ſo taken to bee: that will
not ſerue our turne, bicauſe none of vs fulfilleth the Lawe, but wee
are all of vs gyltie before God, and muſt receyue ſentence of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
vpon our heads. And for the better expreſsing heereof he
maketh a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon betweene the Iewes &amp; the Gentiles. <hi>Although</hi>
(ſayth he) <hi>that we be Iewes by nature, and not Heathen men:</hi> yet doo
we knowe that we ſhall not otherwiſe obteyne Gods fauour, than
by beleeuing in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Nowe it maye peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſeeme, that although men beeing corrupted in Adam can not
deſerue ought: yet notwithſtanding the Iewes had a ſpeciall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
bicauſe God had adopted them as it were for his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and accompted them to bee as his houſholde. And that was
the thing wherein the Iewes deceyued them ſelues. For when the
Scripture ſpeaketh of vncircumciſion, it meaneth the vnclenneſſe
wherewith wee be compaſſed about in Adam, in ſo muche as there
is not any man which is not damned alreadie from his mothers
wombe. But the Iewes thought that God had ſet them free from
that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon curſe, and they made their boaſt therof. Surely Gods
choſing of them after that ſort for his own people &amp; heritage, was
a great dignitie, and worthy too bee eſteemed aboue all worldly
goodes. But yet neuertheleſſe it became them to haue acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with all humbleneſſe, that there was not any excellencie at
all in their owne perſons. For according to our wonted maner of
drawing Gods gracious giftes too muche to vayne ouerweening,
the Iewes did commonly ouerſhoote them ſelues, by bearing them
ſelues in hand that they were aboue all the reſt of the worlde: Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
as who ſhould ſay, that God had founde any thing in them,
why he ſhould preferre them before thoſe whom he had forſaken.
Therefore that dooing of theirs was a great pride, whiche caried
with it a ſhamefull thankleſneſſe, in that they imputed not to Gods
meere goodneſſe, the things which they had of his free gifte, but
were puffed vp with ouerweening, as thoughe God had knowne
them to be better or worthyer of euerlaſting ſaluation, than the
Gentiles. But nowe S. Paule to diſpatche all ouerweening, ſayth:
Go too, wee be Iewes by nature. As if he had ſayde, It is true that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:23060:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wee haue ſome fauour aboue the Gentiles; whome God hath not
vouchſafed to receiue into his Church. VVhen he ſpeaketh after
that faſhion, it is not to giue the Iewes occaſion to waxe proude:
but to lay before them the things which they had receiued frely of
God, wherin they had no cauſe at all to brag of them ſelues, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as we ſee how that in the Epiſtle to the Romanes, he vttereth
two ſayings, whiche at the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>luſhe might ſeeme contrarie. For
on the one ſide, Haue wee then (ſayth hee) no priuiledge aboue
the Gentiles? Yes verily, for God hath choſen vs for hys people,
he hathe giuen vs the ſeale of Circumciſion too ſhewe that hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoweth
vs for his children, hee hathe alyed him ſelfe vntoo vs,
hee hathe promiſed vs the Redeemer of the worlde, and (too bee
ſhorte) he hath ſanctified vs in ſuche wyſe, that if wee conſider the
fauour whiche he hathe vttered towards vs, there hath beene well
wherwith to aduance and exalte vs aboue the reſidue of the whole
worlde. Thus on the one ſide Paule dothe there magnifie the
goodneſſe of God: and afterwarde he falleth too queſtioning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,
and asketh, what aduauntage haue wee then? None at all
(ſayth he) for all men are ſhutte vp vnder Gods curſe. If the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
bee too bee condemned, wee bee too bee condemned dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
for there may be yet ſome likelyhoode that ignorance ſhall
ſerue to excuſe them. But yet can they make no defence of that
before God, but ſhall periſhe althoughe they neuer had any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
or teaching. Needes then muſt wee bee condemned by
the lawe (ſayth he) ſeeing that God hathe taughte vs, and yet for
all that wee ceaſe not too ſinne ſtill, and too tranſgreſſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements,
in ſo muche that we be plunged in greater and dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
curſedneſſe, than the Heathen folk and vnbeleeuers. Now then
he ſayth that the Iewes are in deede ſeparated after a ſort from the
Gentiles, not that the Iewes are of more worthineſſe, or that they
haue any righteouſneſſe in them ſelues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but bicauſe God of his
own meere goodneſſe voutſafed to choſe them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like as at this day
the children that are borne of beleeuing pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, are not better than
the children that are borne of Paynims &amp; Turkes, if a man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider
them both in their owne nature. For we be all of a corrupted and
curſed lumpe and God hathe ſo condemned vs, as no man can
<pb facs="tcp:23060:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
iuſtly ſet vp his briſtles, to thinke him ſelfe of more value than his
fellowes.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. c. 14.</note> But yet neuertheleſſe, S. Paule ſheweth that they be ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
and that they be not vncleane, as thoſe are which are borne
of vnbeleeuers or Heathen folke. Heere ſhoulde ſeeme to be ſome
contrarietie: neuertheleſſe, all agreeth very well togither. For
there is nothing but vncleanneſſe and filthineſſe in vs all without
exception, and that commeth of nature. Howbeit, there is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
gifte, that is to ſay, a remedie that God giueth: whiche is,
that the children of the faythfull are dedicated vnto him, and he
acknowledgeth &amp; auoweth them for his. Then like as now a dayes
the children that are borne of the Churche, are reckned too bee of
the number of Gods people, and of the companie of the choſen:
euen ſo vnder the lawe, the Iewes were ſeparated from the reſt of
the world. And that is the cauſe why S. Paule ſayth, <hi>Wee bee I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>wes,
and not ſinners of the Gentiles.</hi> VVhereas he ſpeaketh of Sinners,
he meaneth ſuche as continue in their filthyneſſe, and are not
clenſed by the grace of God. For Circumciſion was a token and
witneſſe that God accepted Abrahams iſſue and ofſpring for hys
owne houſholde and peculiar people. The thing then wherein
the Iewes differed in olde tyme from the vnbeleeuers, was that
althoughe they were all of one ſute, for as muche as they were
all indifferently the children of Adam: yet notwythſtandyng
God had choſen the one ſort, and left the other ſort ſtill ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
from his houſe. If a man aske why he dyd ſo: there was none
other cauſe than his owne meere grace, and yet were not the Iewes
in the meane whyle the more excellent. But nowe let vs followe
the matter that S. Paule handleth heere, <hi>Wee knowe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that
wee can not bee iustified by the deedes of the Lawe, but by beleefe in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Christ.</hi> In ſo ſaying he ſheweth, that the Iewes them ſelues (what
grace ſoeuer they had receyued) coulde not grounde them ſelues
vpon other men, nor vpon them ſelues, as thoughe they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
aught at Gods hande, but muſt bee fayne to flee to his free
goodneſſe, acknowledging that there is no ſaluation but in Ieſus
Chriſte, who is come to finde out the thing that was alreadie loſte.
And herein is fulfilled that which he ſayth in another place, howe
that aſwel they which were nere hande,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. d. 17</note> as they that were farre off,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:23060:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were all gathered togither into one Ieſus Chriſt is the peacemaker
to cauſe God to loue vs, and to receyue vs too mercy: not onely
thoſe that were earſt farre of, as the Gentiles: but alſo the children
of Abraham, what nobleneſſe or dignitie ſoeuer were in them, for
that came not of their owne nature. And let vs marke, that when
S. Paule ſaythe, that the Iewes whiche were conuerted to the
Chriſten fayth, knewe they coulde not bee iuſtified by the works
of the lawe, but by beleefe in Ieſus Chriſt: he maketh a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
betweene fayth and the Lawe, to ſhewe that wee can not bee
iuſtified by grace, excepte wee forſake all our owne merites: and
that is a thing well worthy too bee marked. For the Papiſtes will
well inoughe confeſſe that wee bee iuſtifyed by faythe, howebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
they adde that it is but partely. But that gloſe marreth all. For
heere it is proued that wee can not bee founde righteous before
God, but by the meanes of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
vpon the ſaluation which he hathe purchaſed for vs. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
ſee this well inough: and therefore for faſhion ſake, they ſay
we be iuſtified by fayth, but not by fayth onely: they will none of
that. That is the thing that they fighte agaynſt: and it is the chiefe
poynte that is in controuerſie betwixte them and vs. But S. Paule
bewrayeth heere their beaſtlyneſſe, when he ſayth, but by beleefe.
For that word betokeneth that all that euer men preſume to bring
vnto God to winne his fauour with, is quite cut off. Yee ſee then
that the doore is ſhut agaynſt all deſeruing, when S. Paule auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
that there is none other meane than by fayth. VVee ſhall
ſee more playnly hereafter why fayth is ſo compared with the law,
as a thing ful but agaynſt it. For the lawe preſuppoſeth that if wee
haue once fulfilled Gods commaundements, we ſhall be taken for
good ſeruants, and that he wil pay vs the wages which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed:
and faith preſuppoſeth vs to be wretched, da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, &amp; forlorne
folke, and that we muſt be fayne to ſeeke the things that we wante
in Ieſus Chriſt. As for example. There are two men that deſire to
bee boorded and lodged: whereof the one bringeth money with
him, and lookes to be wel interteined for his wel paying: and both
of them require meate &amp; drinke howſoeuer the cace ſtandeth, but
the ſecond man is poore, &amp; hath neither penny nor pennies worth,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and he deſireth almes. Thus do both twayne of them matche iuſte
in one poynt, for they deſire foode as the thing whereof they haue
bothe neede. But the firſt hath money to content his hoſt, and lyke
as he ſhall haue fared well, and bin well and curteouſly intertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
ſo ſhall his hoſte receyue money of him, and holde him ſelfe
contented with it, and not thinke his gueſt beholden or bounde
vnto him: For why, he is recompenced, yea and he hathe gayned
by him. But as for the poore man that craueth almes, he thinks him
ſelfe beholden for his life to him that fedde him, and lodged him:
for he bringeth him nothing but a charge. So then, if wee will bee
iuſtified before God by the Lawe, we muſt deſerue it, ſo as he may
receyue of vs, and we of him, and there may be as it were an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge
betwixte vs. And is that poſsible? No: as wee ſhall ſee
more at large heereafter. Therefore wee muſt conclude, that wee
bee excluded from the righteouſneſſe of the Lawe, and that if wee
thinke to bring any thing to binde God withall, we doo but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
his wrath. Then is there none other ſhifte, but to go to hym
like poore beggers, and ſo to be iuſtified by fayth: not as by a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
that is of our ſelues, but bicauſe we confeſſe with all lowlineſſe,
that we can not obteyne ſaluation but by his free gifte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus yee
ſee howe the lawe is ſet heere full but agaynſt fayth, as if S. Paule
ſhould tell vs, that all they which go about to winne Gods fauour
by their owne merites, forſake the grace of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.
as ſhall be declared more at length hereafter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But now if any man
ſay, that the lawe was giuen of God, ſo as it can not haue any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie
agaynſt fayth, whereof God is the author alſo: the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
therevnto is eaſie. For God made bothe day and nighte, fire
and water, colde and heate. Now it is certayne that the day is not
contrarie to the night: but we ſee the wonderfull order of Gods
goodneſſe and wiſdome, in that men haue the lighte of the ſunne
to doo then worke in by day, and [the darkneſſe] as it were a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
to reſt in by night: So then although the day differ from the
night: yet is there no contrarietie betwixte them, neither is there
any betweene fire and water, ſo eche creature bee put to his owne
proper vſe: but wee ſee that God hathe very well agreed the fire
and the water, and yet notwithſtanding if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> beholde them
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:23060:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fighting togither, then is there greate contrarietie. Euen ſo is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the lawe and the Goſpell. And if any bodie will haue a man
to be iuſtified bothe by the lawe and by the Goſpell to, he doth but
turmoyle and mingle things togither, and it is all one as if he ſhould
ſet heauen and earth togither by the eares. To be ſhort, it were much
eaſier too mingle fire and water togither, than too ſay, that wee can
purchace any grace at Gods hand by our own deſeruings, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
alſo haue neede to bee ſuccored by our Lord Ieſus Chriſte.
But if a man conſider what the lawe is, and too what purpoſe it was
giuen: he ſhall find that it is not whit at all repugnant too the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
nor conſequently vntoo fayth, but that they agree very well.
Thus ye ſee how this difficultie is diſpatched: ſo that if it be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
that fayth commeth of God as well as the Law: it is true. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
it is to be conſidered (as wee ſhall ſay hereafter) to what
end God gaue as well the one as the other. But let vs returne too
that which S. Paule ſayeth. He ſayeth that <hi>wee bee not iustified but
by the fayth of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte.</hi> VVhen he ſpeaketh of beyng
iuſtified, lette vs marke that it is all one with beyng reckened or
taken for rightuous before God. And that woorde had neede too
bee well vnderſtoode: for the cace ſtandeth vppon knowing after
what maner wee bee ſaued. But are wee not wretched caytifes, if
after wee haue liued long in the world, a man aske vs whiche is the
meane too bee ſaued, and wee cannot tell him? VVee ſhall ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
beaſtly wretches, whiche haue deuoured Gods breade, and yet
notwithſtanding cannot tell howe they ſhoulde offer themſelues
before him. And therefore it behoueth vs to take ſo much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
heede to the things which are taught vs here by S. Paule. He ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that we be iuſtified: and how? Is it that wee bee rightuous, and
that there is nothing amiſſe in vs? No: but it is for that God acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pteth
vs. Then is the woorde <hi>Rightuouſneſſe</hi> put for the fauour
whiche God ſheweth vs, in that he voutchſafeth too bee our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and too take vs for his children. If a man demaunde why the
Scripture vſeth the woorde <hi>Iustifie,</hi> ſith it ſeemeth too make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpoſe: for it might well be ſayd, God loueth vs, God
pitieth vs, God vouchſafeth to become our father and Sauiour: [and
therfore] why ſhould not men rather vſe that maner of ſpeach, than
<pb facs="tcp:23060:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſay that he vouchſafeth to iuſtifie vs? [I anſwer,] it is not without
cauſe that the ſcripture ſpeaketh ſo. For if we take the woord <hi>Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
rawly, &amp; ſay [no more but] that we be ſaued by the grace of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt: we ſhall not well perceyue what our owne ſtate
is, nor how wretched it is, nor alſo the remedie which wee muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
too it. For to the intent we may put our truſt in our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, wee muſt vnderſtand that wee be vtterly forlorne as well by
reaſon of the ſinne of Adam, as by reaſon of the infinite number of
iniquities wherein we be ſaped: yea and wee muſt fully beleeue it.
But we ſhould neuer perceyue that our ſinnes condemne vs &amp; curſe
vs before God, except wee knew that wee haue neede of rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
And on the otherſide wee ſhould not know Gods rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
if we ſhould ſingly ſay that we be ſaued by faith and by grace.
For God cannot once renounce himſelf, bycauſe he is the ſoueraine
rightuouſneſſe, and there is nothing in him but pureneſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
by reaſon whereof he muſt needes hate euill. Now it is ſo
that wee be full of corruption, there is nothing but euill in vs: and
therefore God muſt needes hate vs. And if he hate vs, wo woorth
vs: for then are we damned. Then ſtandeth it vs on hand to be made
rightuous, before we can be in Gods fauour. That is to ſay, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs to be purged of our faults and miſdeedes, for elſe (as I ſayd)
wee ſhall neuer be able to conceyue, that God intendeth too ſhewe
vs mercie. But in acknowledging our ſelues too be ſinners, wee
perceyue by and by that God muſte needes hate ſinne, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he hate ſinne, yet not withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he findeth meanes to ſaue
vs, which is by forgetting our offences, and by clenzing and purging
them with the bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who is our ſpirituall
waſhing. God then purgeth vs in that wize, too the ende wee ſhould
bee receyued of him, and being made parttakers of his loue, bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
of our ſaluation. Thus yee ſee why the Scripture vſeth the
woorde <hi>Iustifie:</hi> But the Papiſtes deſcant vppon it like blinde buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardes.
VVhat, ſay they? ſhoulde wee bee iuſtified by fayth?
Fayth is no ſuch vertue as maketh men perfect: and how then ſhall
it make vs rightuous? They conſider not that this rightuouſneſſe
whereof the Scripture ſpeaketh, is Gods couering of our ſinnes (as
I declared afore) and his taking of them quyte and cleane away for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:23060:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſake and by the meane of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, and by the
vertue of the Sacrifize of his death and Paſsion. How ſoeuer the
cace ſtandeth, it is ſayd that wee be counted rightuous before God,
bycauſe he releaſeth and forgiueth our ſinnes.<note place="margin">Rom. 4. a. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

him, wee might be taken for rightuous, bycauſe there was ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſſe
in his obedience, that our ſinnes were buried and rid quite
and cleane away. Thus much concerning the woord <hi>Iuſtifie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Now as
touching the woord <hi>Fayth</hi> [or <hi>beleefe,]</hi> S. Paule addeth for a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>that they had beleeued in Ieſus Christ.</hi> If a man aske an vnlearned
perſone what <hi>Fayth</hi> is: he will perchaunce anſwere that it is too <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue:</hi>
but he ſhall not be able too tell what is ment or imported by
any of them both. VVill wee then haue the vnderſtanding of them
according too the rawe capacitie of the vnskilfulleſt ſorte? VVee
muſt alwayes marke, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſte is ſet too bee the
butte of our fayth and beleefe. Do wee obtayne ſaluation by fayth?
It is aſmuche too ſay, as wee beleeue in our Lord Ieſus Chriſte. But
let vs now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider why our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is ſet before our eyes
for our fayth too ame at, and too reſte wholly vppon. It is bycauſe
wee ſhall finde in him what ſoeuer belongeth too the making of vs
rightuous. I haue tolde you already, that wee bee taken for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
before God when he forgiueth our ſinnes, and calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not
too account any more. And how ſhall wee obtayne that, but by the
bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt which was ſhed to waſh vs withall?
For in aſmuch as he hath made full amendes for vs by his death and
paſsion: therefore God is appeazed towardes vs, condicionally that
we ſeeke not to pay him with any other thing, than with the ſacrifize
that was offered vp to him by his only ſonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who is called Gods wel beloued ſonne,<note place="margin">Math. 3. d. 17.</note> too the ende that wee ſhould
be beloued in him: and the rightuous, to the end we ſhould be made
parttakers of his rightuouſneſſe:<note place="margin">Eſay. 53. d. 11.</note> and the holy, too the end we ſhould
be made holie in him. Thus then yee ſee why wee muſte haue an
eye to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luke. 1. d. 35.</note> when wee intend too know what the
woorde <hi>Fayth</hi> importeth. But the Papiſtes ſtande wilfully in their
owne conceyt, bycauſe they neuer taſted what it is to beleeue: and
that do they ſhew well ynough by their allegacions. How is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
(ſay they) that a man ſhould bee iuſtified by beleeuing, ſeyng
that the very Diuels doo beleeue?<note place="margin">Iames. 2. d. 20.</note> It is true, and S. Iames vſeth the
ſame reaſon. How beit in that place he mocketh at ſuche as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a vayne and fonde cloke of Chriſtianitie and fayth, and in the
meane whyle ſhewe no frutes at all of it. But the Papiſtes beguyle
themſelues yet much more groſly, in ſaying that <hi>Fayth</hi> is too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in God, and that God is the marke that fayth ameth at, ſo as
it ſeemeth too them, that too make vp beleefe, there needeth no
more but to imagine that there is ſome one certayne God that made
the worlde, and which gouerneth all things. And ſo they fall faſte a
ſleepe in their ignorance, and yet ceaſſe not too take themſelues for
good Chriſtians and Catholikes (as they themſelues bable) although
they be altogither dulled in deede. But it is no woonder that they
fight ſo agaynſt the doctrine of the holy Scripture, and with ſuche
vnamendable wilfulneſſe denie that a man can bee ſaued by fayth,
ſeyng they haue nother diſcretion nor vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding: for they wote
not what the matter meeneth. So muche the more therefore doth
it ſtande vs vppon, too marke well what Sainct Paule telleth vs
heere: that is too witte, that if wee looke not vntoo Ieſus Chriſte,
wee knowe not what fayth is. And the reaſon thereof is, for that
we know not what it is too haue forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, to be able to put our truſt in him, and to call vpon him: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do we know any more what it is to haue our conſciences quiet,
and to hope for the euerlaſting life. All theſe things we want till Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt be ſet afore vs, and till wee haue caſt our looke vpon him,
ſo as all our ſenſes be ſettled vppon him, and as it were ſhet vp there.
Yee ſee then that the fayth whereby wee obtayne grace, is that after
we once know our ſelues to be wretched creatures, and that there is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:23060:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nothing but loth ſomneſſe in vs, wee ſeeke the remedie of it in our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and vnderſtand that he was offered vp for vs to
redeeme vs from the curſe wherein we were plundged, that he hath
made vs cleane by his bloud, that by his obedience he hath put away
all our offences, and that for the ſame we bee aſſured that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
and receiueth vs for his children. Thus ye ſee how this text
is to be vnderſtoode. And whereas S. Paule ſayeth, that he himſelfe
and all the Iewes that were conuerted vnto Chriſtianitie, did looke
too bee ſaued by the fayth of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: he addeth alſo
the reaſon why: namely, bycauſe <hi>no fleſh ſhall be iustified by the works
of the Lawe.</hi> He had well vſed that woord, if he had applied it but to
his owne countrymen: but heere he ſpeaketh of all men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
And whereas he ſayeth <hi>no fleſhe</hi> at all: firſt he betokeneth that
the Iewes differ nothing at all from the Gentyles in the meane of
obtayning ſaluation. VVherfore although the Iewes beyng circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyzed,
were taken as it were for Gods heritage, and ſanctified vnto
him: yet not withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they could not haue any hope of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but by his mere grace. Lo how they be matched with the Gentyles
and raunged in like degree with them. Again, S. Paule ment heere to
deface vtterly all the ouer weening that men conceyue of their own
vertues. There are many which know they haue ouerſhot the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
ſo farre, that they cannot chalendge any glorie too them as though
they had deſerued aught at Gods hand. VVretched drunkardes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thriftes,
and ſuch as haue giuen themſelues ouer to all naughtineſſe,
will be aſhamed to auaunce themſelues, and too brag that they can
bind God by their deſerts and well doings, for euen before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
be fayne too hide themſelues bicauſe of their leudneſſe. But as for
thoſe that haue ſome cloke of hipocriſie, and ſhew ſome ſigne of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
before men: they by &amp; by become drunken with it, &amp; ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
themſelues, that they beleeue they deſerue Paradyſe, and that
God is greatly bound vnto them. Of which ſute are theſe Popeholy
ones, who although they be ful of al filthineſſe, ſo as there is nothing
in them but ambition, couetouſneſſe, crueltie, and ſuche other like
things: yet how ſoeuer the world go, for aſmuch as they haue good
ſtore of their Churchſtuffe &amp; other counterfettings, they beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in hand that God ſeeth not a whit intoo their leudneſſe, but
<pb facs="tcp:23060:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perſwade themſelues that God ought to accept them for their owne
merites ſakes. Alſo, ſuch as heare Maſſe deuoutly, ſuch as ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne from
the Tauerne [or from the Alehouſe] to the Chappell, ſpecially ſuch
as buy pardons and ſuch other like ſtuffe, and ſuch as keepe faſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
and holydayes, wil be puffed vp with ſuch an ouer weening, as
to thinke they haue bound God vnto them. But S. Paule, in naming
all fleſh, ſheweth that men muſt not ſhole out themſelues aſunder,
as though one were righteous, though another were not ſo: but
muſt all ſtoupe and humble themſelues and paſſe condemnation, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
themſelues that all their vertues, (yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the excellenteſt
men of all) are but filthineſſe before God. For although a man bee
perfectly rightuous to our opinion, ſo as he doth noman harme, but
hath ſtedfaſtneſſe in himſelf to withſtand all vices, and is chaſte and
ſobre, and (to be ſhort) is taken and eſteemed to be as an Angell: yet
not withſtanding he hath nothing in him but corruption. And how
can that bee? Bycauſe wee may not reſte vppon the outward appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
for (as the Prouerbe ſayeth) all is not golde that gliſtereth.
It is not for vs to iudge what is vice, and what is vertue, except wee
could enter into a man. For if a man yeeld not vnto God that which
belongeth vnto him, what is to be ſayd of it? He robbeth not men,
but he robbeth God of his honour. Agayne though men giue him
neuer ſo great prayſe &amp; clap their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds at him: yet ſhall he but burſt
for vaynglorie and pride, and nothing ſhalbe able too frame him too
humilitie, ſaue the knowing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. So then, they
which make a goodly outward ſhow in their life, ſhall neuertheleſſe
be ſtill conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned before God. This is the thing whereby S. Paule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
to foreſtall all the vaine truſt that men can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyue or nurriſh
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning their own deſeruings. But there is yet more. For he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not only of ſuch men as were after a fort forſaken of God, and
were not renewed by his holy ſpirit: but when he ſayeth <hi>All fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> he
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehendeth the faithfull alſo. For although Gods holy ſpirit dwell
in vs after he haue drawen vs to the knowledge of his Goſpell and
greffed vs into the bodie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: although (ſay I)
that Gods ſpirit dwell in vs: yet are we al comprehended vnder the
woorde <hi>Fleſh,</hi> in reſpect of that which we haue of our owne: S. Paule
then giueth ſentence heere, that no fleſh ſhall bee iuſtified, bycauſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:23060:112"/>
the faythleſſe are condemned in Adam, and abide in their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and the faithfull are alwayes vnperfect, ſo as they haue many
vices and blemiſhes: by meanes whereof they bee condemned as
well as the other, and ſo this conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation is generall, That he which
will bee iuſtified by the woorkes of the lawe, ſhall alwayes be found
giltie, yea euen the holieſt men that euer were. Let vs take Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
who was a mirrour of all perfection: let vs take Dauid who
excelled in all vertue:<note place="margin">1 Ezech. 14. b. 14.</note> Let vs take Noë, Iob, and Daniell who are
reckened vp for three rightuous men by the Prophete Ezechiell:
and let vs take ſuch other like: and yet neuertheleſſe, euen they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
are raunged in the ſame aray, that is too wit, that they could not
obtayne rightuouſneſſe before God, but by Grace. Nowe then I
pray you what ſhall wee doo? muſte not the Diuell needes driue
them headlong intoo terrible pryde, which at this day doo ſtay ſtill,
that they may bee iuſtified by their owne deſertes or meritorious
woorkes as they terme them? For who is hee that can matche ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Dauid, Noë, Abraham, or Daniell? Had not men neede too
haue profited well in Gods ſchoole, and to bee inflamed with a true
zele of giuing themſelues wholly vntoo him, that they may bee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
conuicted, that they bee yet very farre of from beyng come to
the poynt whiche wee ſee Dauid, Noe, and Daniell too haue bin at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
For aſmuch then as wee knowe this: lette vs marke, that heere the
holy Ghoſte beateth downe ſuche as mount vp too highe, too the
ende wee ſhould bee the more aſhamed that wee haue not one drop
of deſerte of glorie: and ſeeke all that pertayneth too our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the meere grace of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. Thus yee ſee
that this ſaying where Sainct Paule auoweth that no fleſhe ſhall bee
iuſtified, ought too bee vnderſtoode as though hee had ſayde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If
men looke vppon themſelues in their owne nature, they ſhall finde
nothing but euill, notwithſtanding all the fayre ſhewes that they
can haue. They may well bee highly prayſed and eſteemed in the
worlde, and they may well beguyle themſelues by vayne ſelfe ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things:
but vntill ſuche time as God haue wrought in them too
chaunge them, it is certaine that there ſhall bee nothing in them but
filthineſſe, &amp; al the vertues that men make account of, ſhalbe ſtarke
vice, too leade them too deſtruction and too plundge them in Hell.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For although that they which are renewed by Gods grace and haue
already profited in his obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, haue ſome vertues which he loueth
and eſteemeth: yet are they not able to bring aught that may paſſe
account before him: for they ſhall alwayes finde themſelues in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerages.
And that goodneſſe whiche is in them, they haue it of him,
and yet is that goodneſſe alſo corrupted with their ſinnes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities:
by reaſon whereof they are vtterly bereft of all truſt in
their owne rightuouſneſſe: and ſo if wee now ſeeke our rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the law, we be beguyled, wee ſhall not find it there, we be al
of vs condemned from the greateſt too the leaſt. But heere wee ſee
much better that which I touched afore: namely that when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
and find by experience, that we want all that euer pertayneth
to the life of our ſoules: we muſt reſort to Ieſus Chriſt as to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
ſo that the true preparatiue to make vs beleue in Ieſus Chriſt,
is to be touched with a liuely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyt and feeling of our own ſinnes.
And for the ſame cauſe alſo he ſayeth,<note place="margin">Math. 11. d. 28.</note> Come vnto me all ye that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and are heauie loden &amp; I will refreſh you, and you ſhal find reſt
to your ſoules.<note place="margin">Eſai. 61. a. 2</note> Again it is ſayd expreſly, that he is ſent to preach the
meſſage of gladneſſe to the poore, to ſet free ſuch as are in priſon, &amp;
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort ſuch as are vtterly oppreſſed and as it were ouerwhelmed.
Thoſe then which take pleaſure in their ſinnes, will neuer come at
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. True it is that they wil boaſt ynough of faith,
according as many skorners of God do vnhallow that worde as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
as it is. Euery man will be counted a Chriſtian, and they that bee
furtheſt out of ſquare in all wickedneſſe, will ſay they beleeue as
much as any other man. But when a man ſpeaketh after that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
it is a token that he hath not one droppe of fayth. For the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
will ſurely ſay, I beleeue, howbeit with ſo greate weakeneſſe,
that I ſee well if my God ſhould not pitie mee, that little whiche I
haue would ſoone vaniſh away vtterly. Therfore they that vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with
full mouth that they haue a perfect fayth, are but dogges and ſwine
which neuer taſted what the feare of God or what religion is. But
how ſoeuer the world go, the name of fayth ſhall be ſhamefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
by thoſe dogges, which doo nothing elſe but mocke God. For
they haue no skill too diſcerne betweene good and euill. They
bee ſo blockiſh, that they doo as it were welter in their filthineſſe:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:23060:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inſomuch that a groſſe drunkarde that is paſt all ſhame, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
hath ouerglutted himſelfe alſo, woulde faine continue ſtill
in his diſordinateneſſe. Beſydes this, the whoremongers, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurers,
the blaſphemers, and ſuch other like will proteſt welynough
that they haue fayth: but yet for all that, it is certaine that they were
neuer in any towardneſſe to come to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And
why ſo? For they haue not conſidered that they cannot be iuſtified
but by grace. Howbeit let vs marke, that to be throughly peſwaded,
that we cannot be iuſtified by the lawe, we muſt ſet God before vs
in his iudgement ſeate, and euery of vs ſummon our ſelues before
him, and morning and euening bethinke vs that we muſt yeelde vp
an account of our whole life. Therevpon let vs vnderſtande, that we
ſhoulde be ouerwhelmed a hundred thouſand tymes, if God ſhould
not pitie vs, and beare with vs of his infinite mercie. That is the
way for vs to knowe that wee cannot bee iuſtified by the lawe: for
we bee as good as damned, ſo oft as we appeare before God. It is
meete for vs to be put in ſuch feare, as wee may haue neyther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leace
nor reſt, till our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt haue ſuccoured vs. Ye ſee
then howe it behoueth vs to be loden and fortrauelled, that is too
ſay, to miſlyke of our ſinnes, and to bee greeued with ſuch anguiſh,
as we may be pinched with the ſorrowes of death, to the ende wee
may ſeeke all our eaſe in God, aſſuring our ſelues that wee cannot
otherwiſe obtaine ſaluation, neyther whole nor in part, but muſt be
faine to haue it giuen vs. For S. Paule doth not ſet down any meane
way heere, as though he ſayde that we ſhoulde finde that which we
want, in Ieſus Chriſt, and be able to haue the reſt of our ſelues. But
he ſayth that foraſmuch as we knowe once that we cannot bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as righteous for our owne deſertes, nor for our owne workes,
onely fayth muſt content and ſuffize vs. VVherefore let vs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande,
that there is not one whitte of our ſaluation out of Ieſus
Chriſt, but that we haue there both the beginning and the end of it,
that is to ſay euery whit of it: and let vs abyde continually in that
lowlineſſe, knowing that we bring nothing with vs but damnation,
and that all that euer perteyneth to our ſaluation muſt be receyued
of Gods onely free mercie, ſo as we may ſay that it is by fayth that
we be ſaued, that is too ſay, bycauſe God the father hath appoynted
<pb facs="tcp:23060:114"/>
his ſonne our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt for vs to reſt vpon, that he might
both begin and finiſhe our ſaluation, in ſuch wiſe as the whole muſt
be fathered vpon him, and we learne to renounce our ſelues, and to
giue our ſelues fully and wholy vnto him.</p>
            <p>And now let vs fall downe before the maieſtie of our good God
with acknowledgement of our ſinnes, praying him too make vs ſo
to feele them, as we may miſlike more &amp; more of them, and grow
and go forwarde in the amendment wherein wee ought too ſpende
our whole life, and learne too magnifie his goodneſſe in ſuch wiſe,
as it hath bin ſhewed to vs in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, ſo as wee may
be wholy rauiſhed with it: and that the ſame may be, not a glorying
of it with our mouth onely, but a putting of our whole truſt in him,
ſo as we may be ſettled in it more and more, till we be gathered vp
intoo the euerlaſting life, where we ſhall haue the rewarde of our
fayth. That it may pleaſe him to graunt this grace, not onely to vs,

reſpect of themſelues alone without Chriſt, might after a ſort haue
bin iuſtified before God: otherwiſe it ſhoulde ſeeme that the lawe
was ſuperfluous. But when they come too our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,
there they perceyue themſelues to bee wretched ſinners, forlorne,
and damned. It ſhould ſeeme then, that Ieſus Chriſt bringeth ſinne:
for before his comming, the Iewes were reckened for Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.<note place="margin">Deu. 7. a. 6.</note>
They bare the badge of holineſſe in their bodies, &amp; moreouer
it was ſayd vnto them, that they were the holy and choſen people of
their God. Now then ſeeing they become fellowlike with wretched
ſinners, and there is nothing but curſedneſſe to bee found in them,
ſo as they be faine to flee for refuge to the mere grace of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt: it ſeemeth that Ieſus Chriſt brought ſinne intoo the
worlde. Truly ſo will men iudge of him after their owne opinion,
howbeeit fooliſhly. For it behoueth vs to marke, that our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt doth not bring ſinne, but bewray ſinne. For although the
Iewes exerciſed themſelues in the keeping of the law: yet did that
ſerue but to proue vnto them ſtill more and more, that God would
neuer ſhewe them mercie, but by the meane of the Redemer. No
doubt but that in liuing chaſtly &amp; ſoberly, &amp; therwithall in walking
in obedience to god, they had ſome ſhow of righteouſneſſe: but that
came wholy of grace, and we muſt not father that thing vpon men,
which belongeth vnto God, for by that meanes God ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded
of his honour. Then if the Iewes being gouerned by Gods
ſpirite, had ſome willingneſſe and deſire to lead a holy life: it muſt
not come in account, as who ſhould ſay, that God were beholden to
them for it: for contrariwiſe they be ſo much the more bound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God. But on the otherſide, wee haue too marke (as wee ſhall ſee
more fully in due time and place) that there was neuer yet any man
ſo perfect, but there was alwayes much to be blamed in him. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we haue to conclude, that the Iewes could not be ſo well taken
and accepted at Gods hand, but that they had neede of his mercie,
and that their ſaluation muſt needes be grounded wholy vpon the
forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes. Alſo as in reſpect of Ceremonyes, they
bare themſelues on hande that there was great holineſſe in them,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as whereof hypocrites haue alwayes made their cloke. But howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
they fared, it is certaine that the Iewes were more damnable
than all other men. And why? For (as Saint Paule ſayth) without
the lawe ſinne doth not vpbrayde men:<note place="margin">Ro. 5. b. 13.</note> inſomuch that men fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe
and flatter themſelues in their vices, when they haue not that
Sumner to cyte them before Gods iudgement ſeate. Then whereas
the wretched Gentiles might haue ſome defence and excuſe, at leaſt
wiſe that they bee not ſo giltie before God: the Iewes in offering
their ſacrifizes had it witneſſed too their face, that all of them were
worthie of eternal death, and ſo conſequently double giltie in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of the Gentiles. And therefore in the ſecond to the Colloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians
S. Paule vſeth this ſimilitude,<note place="margin">Col. 2. c. 14.</note> that the Ceremonies of the law
were as euidences to binde a man the more. Truly like as although
a detter be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned by order of law, nor haue bound himſelfe
before a notarie nor giuen aſſurance in wryting vnder his hande and
ſeale: yet ceaſſeth he not for all that, to be bounde [in conſcience]
too pay his debt: euen ſo although the Gentyles had not any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall
matter of recorde whereby to bee condemned: yet ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
they not too bee ſtill worthie of death. But as for the man that
hath paſſed bondes by order of lawe, and entered his debt in the
common recordes: what ſhall he ſay more? There is no ſhift for
him: he muſt be fayne too anſwere [the debt] out of hande. Now
the Iewes were in the like plight. For their waſhing of themſelues
when they went intoo the Temple, and in their owne houſes, and
euery where elſe, was a confeſsing that there was nothing but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe
in them. Againe, when they killed the beaſtes, and ſawe
them ſlain before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſurely the ſame was as a liuely picture of their
owne death and curſed ſtate. And yet coulde not the brute beaſtes
nor the ſhedding of their bloud ſet them cleare: nor likewiſe the
water, which is a corruptible element, and cannot come at the ſoule.
So then, the waſhing which they vſed had bin a fonde thing, if it had
not directed them to the ſpirituall waſhing which wee haue in our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Likewiſe in baptiſme at theſe dayes, if we think
our ſelues to be made cleane by the water: what an abuſe is it? All
theſe things muſt ſerue to leade vs to the bloud of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt. VVherefore I conclude, that whereas the Iewes were exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyſed
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:23060:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the lawe, the ſame was a greater euidence agaynſt them,
and bounde them ſtraightlier to ſubiection vnto Gods iudgement,
and eternall death, than the Gentiles were. And ſo wee ſee howe
Ieſus Chriſt was not a bringer in of ſinne, but a diſcouerer of ſinne.
For the Iewes thought themſelues well ſhrowded vnder the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and made a ſheelde of them to fence themſelues from gods
diſpleaſure, eſteeming all other Nations vnholy, vpon opinion that
there was nothing but vncleanneſſe in all the worlde beſydes, and
that all holineſſe was in themſelues. Lo what their brauerie was.
Yea, but when Ieſus Chriſt came and put them in order: he ſhewed
them that they ſhoulde be faine too ſhew other men by their owne
example, that their ſaluation was too bee ſought elſewhere than in
their owne merites, and that it behoued them to come to him with
ſuch humilitie, as too confeſſe that they on their part brought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
with them but vtter curſedneſſe. And by that meanes oure
Lord Ieſus Chriſt diſcouered the miſchief that had bin hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before,
like as diſeaſed perſons ſhall oftentimes not perceyue the feſtering
of ſome ſore that will breede ſome deadly diſeaſe, till the Surgeon
finde it out, who cannot do his dutie in curing it, till hee haue ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the ſore to the bottome which was vnknowne before. Euen
ſo was our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt fayne too bewray the wretchedneſſe
that was in the Iewes, to the intent they ſhoulde returne vnto him,
and confeſſe that they had not any thing in them worthie of Gods
fauour, nor any other refuge than vnto his mere mercie. Thus ye
ſee in effect what wee haue to conſider for the ſolution of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
and doubt which Saint Paule putteth forth heere. Likewiſe in
theſe dayes, if a man ſpeake of the Goſpell too ſuch as thinke they
ſerue God, and hope to winne heauen by their owne deſertes: they
be greeued at it, bicauſe that that gate is ſhet agaynſt them by the
preſumptuouſneſſe which they haue conceyued afore hande, ſaying:
VVhat I pray? Shall I haue loſt my time when I haue bin ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout
all my life long? As for the man that ſhall haue heard a Maſſe
or twaine, or mumbled vp a ſort of prayers, or gone on pilgrimage,
or laſhed out his money and ſubſtance (without ſparing) vpon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,
indulgences, and ſuch other things: if one tell him that wee
bee all wretched, and that there is none other thing for vs too leane
<pb facs="tcp:23060:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnto but the mere grace of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and that all that
euer we are able to bring vnto God is but filthie and lothly, he will
ſtorme and replie, Is it poſsible that God ſhould haue no regarde of
ſo greate paynes as I take to ſerue him? Muſte not all of it paſſe
in myne accounte, and bee allowed mee too my ſaluation? They
woulde faine accuze God, yea and wee ſhall ſee many that will not
ſticke to rayle vpon him with open mouth, bycauſe they bee lothe
to loſe that which they haue done. Although the Hypocrites per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
much lewdneſſe in themſelues: yet woulde they fayne hyde
all vnder theyr cowles. For they breake out after this maner. One
ſayes I haue gone woolwarde: another, I haue riſen at midnight to
ſerue God: the thirde, I haue forborne the eating of fleſhe: and
another, I haue bin ſhette vp in a Cloyſter as in a pryſon, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I haue bin dead to the worldwarde, and ſhall all this be vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
too mee, ſo as God will haue no regarde of it? Such murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
as theſe we ſhall heare dayly. But let vs ſee if they can make
their cace the better for all their replying? For when they haue wel
examined what is in them, they ſhall finde that all their doings are
but as a paynting to ouercaſt things withall, like as a man that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendeth
not too repayre his houſe, leaueth the holes vnmended
within, and doth but dawb them ouer on the outſide too the ende
they be not ſeene, and afterwarde whytelymes them, ſo that final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is nothing elſe but a pargetting or whitelyming, according alſo
as our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt vſeth the ſame ſimilitude agaynſt the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
that did no more but blaunche things.<note place="margin">Math. 23. c. 27.</note> Howbeeit in the
meane while God regardeth not the outwarde appearance, as it is
ſayde in the firſt of Samuell,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

truth, and [layeth open] the things that were hidden afore, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
alſo as it is ſayd in Ieremie.<note place="margin">Ierem. 5. a. 3</note> Sith it is ſo: then all ſuch as alledge
or ſet foorth their owne deuotions, may peraduenture haue ſome
fayre ſhew before men: but ſurely, before God all is but leaſing. And
aſſoone as God doth but blowe vppon their painting and ſtarche, it
ſhall ſcale off lyke the painting of harlots that take great paine too
ſtarch their faces, and yet the Sunne doth no ſooner ſhine vppon
them, but a man ſhall ſee the filthie ſcales fal off, and their foulneſſe
is diſcouered to their ſhame. In like taking are all hypocrites when
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23060:116"/>
they will needes colour things after that maner before God: their
ſhamefull leudneſſe muſt needes bee brought too light. VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs marke, that our Lorde Ieſus Chryſte in condemning the
whole worlde, by ſhewing that none can bee ſaued but by the free
goodneſſe of God his father, the which hee offereth and imparteth
vntoo vs: bringeth not ſinne, (for wee haue that alreadie in vs,) but
vttereth and bewrayeth it, too the ende wee ſhould bee conuicted
of it, and all the pryde wherewith wee were made drunken afore be
layde downe, and nothing remayne in vs but lowlyneſſe too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
vnfeynedly that wee bee vndoone, and that there is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhifte for vs, but that God vtter the infinite treaſures of hys
mercy vpon vs. Yee ſee then that all mouthes ſhall bee ſtopped, and
men muſt not beguile themſelues any more by ſurmyzing to find
any rightuouſneſſe in themſelues. And furthermore S. Paule vſeth
heere a dubble anſwere, too ſhew that it is nothing ſo. Howbeit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he anſwer, he ſetteth downe a precyze woord, ſaying: <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</hi>
As if he ſhould ſay, it is an horrible blaſphemie too intend to lay
the blame of our ſinnes vpon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Eor</hi> (ſayth he)
<hi>if I pull downe the thing that I haue buylded vp, there ſhal be contrarietie</hi>
[in mee.] And in ſpeaking ſo, he bringeth vs backe to the common
doctrine of the Goſpell. For our preaching of the end wherevnto
God hath ſent his onely ſonne, is too ſhew that he hath brought vs
rightuouſneſſe, and is come too put away ſinne, which holds vs as it
were vnder Tyrannie, till wee bee deliuered and ſet free from it by
the grace whiche was purchaced for vs in the death and paſsion of
the Sonne of God. Now then ſeing it is ſo, wee ſee that our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt is not the bringer in of ſinne,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3. a. 8.</note> but is come too deſtroy
ſinne (as S. Iohn ſayeth in his Canonicall Epiſtle) and we alſo do ſee
it to bee ſo. For what elſe dothe the Goſpell teach vs, but that wee
bee full of all wickedneſſe, and muſt bee fayne to bee made cleane
by him that is made the Lambe without ſpot, and alſo that he hath
brought vs the ſpirit of holineſſe? For aſmuch then as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo long as
they be cut off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt, haue nothing in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but curſedneſſe, ſo as
they be vtterly rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſaped in their ſins, &amp; that Ieſus Chriſt is the
partie that maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pure and cleane by the ſheading of his bloud
to waſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> withall, and by bringing vs the ſpirit [of regeneration.]
<pb facs="tcp:23060:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to renue vs with, that we might giue our ſelues too the ſeruing of
God, haue his Image repayred in vs, and walke in truth and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe:
foraſmuch (ſay I) as it is ſayde ſo: we ſee that our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt is not the bringer in of ſinne. And why ſo? For let vs
conſider what we bee, and wee ſhall finde that there is a gulfe of all
maner of wickedneſſe in euery one of vs, and in all mankinde. But
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt commeth to remedie it. Ye ſee then that the
ſinne was in vs before: but our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is faine to vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it. VVhat harme doth a Phiſition by letting bloud? Beholde, a
wretched man hath a diſeaſe that is not perceyued: his bloud is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither
corrupted, and yet it is not ſeene to be ſo as long as it lieth
within the veynes. But be he once let bloud, it will appeare that it
was no bloud, but filthie corrupt matter. Againe what filthineſſe
voydeth out of a mans bodie when hee is purged for ſome diſeaſe?
Now ſhall the Phiſition be blamed for it, or the medicine that was
giuen him? It is well knowne that the purgation ſerueth to deliuer
the bodie that was halfe rotten afore. So then if our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt do by the light of his Goſpell bewray the ſpirituall diſeaſes
that were in vs, and the filthie vnclenneſſe which is lothly before
God, and ſhamefull before men, and do purge vs quite and cleane
thereof: ought he to be charged with any blame or reproch for his
labour? VVhat an vnthankfulneſſe were that? therefore heere is
a ſufficient anſwere to beate backe the blaſphemies and grudgings
of the enimies of the Goſpell, which burſt for pride and cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to be tamed. Let them alledge what they can too proue that
they haue ſome righteouſneſſe and holineſſe: and yet ſhall it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
bee founde that there is nothing but vncleanneſſe in them,
which they wyſt not of, and yet it ſheweth it ſelfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually. Marke
that for one poynt. And ſecondly Saint Paule addeth a more large
and eaſie declaration, when hee ſayth, <hi>that he is dead too the lawwarde
by the lawe it ſelfe: and that he was crucified with Ieſus Chriſt, to liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God.</hi> Nowe when as he ſayth that he was dead to the lawwarde
by the lawe: it is in way of mocking ſuche as pretende too bee
iuſtified by keeping of the lawe. For I haue told you alreadie how
all his diſputing and ſtryuing was agaynſt ſuch kinde of folke. They
were but deceyuers which went about to mingle Ieſus Chriſt with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:23060:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the lawe of Moyſes, yea euen too get righteouſneſſe. For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is not contrarie too the law, but
rather his Goſpell taketh witneſſe of the lawe, as it is ſhewed in
the firſt chapter too the Romanes.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. a. 2.</note> Neuertheleſſe, when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
concerneth Iuſtification, that is too ſay, when men come too
ſcanning, too knowe howe and by what meanes God taketh and
accepteth them for innocent, pure, and without ſpotte, then muſt
the lawe bee ſeparated from Ieſus Chriſt. And why? For the lawe
bringeth nothing in it but curſing: and Ieſus Chriſte bringeth the
remedie of it. Therefore the enimies of the Goſpell agaynſt whom
S. Paule dothe nowe diſpute, would haue mingled the law with it,
and haue made men beleeue, that althoughe they were iuſtified by
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, yet notwithſtanding they ſhoulde mingle
the Ceremonies with him as a parte of their ſaluation, and that by
meanes of them they ſhould purchaſe grace &amp; fauour before God.
But S. Paule cutteth off all this geare, and ſayth that there is none
but onely Ieſus Chriſt [that can do that] and that men muſt ſeeke
none other helpes in that cace eyther one way or other, but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
content them ſelues with his grace, and not gyue the lawe any
roome in that behalfe. For he ſaythe, as for mee I am not deade
through the Goſpell. As if he ſhould ſay, will yee make mee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that I can get Gods fauour by meanes of the law? Nay, I tell
you contrariwyſe, that it is not the Goſpell whiche hath condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
mee, it is not the Goſpell that hath ſhewed me my filthineſſe,
to make me aſhamed of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not the Goſpell that hath berefte
me of all hope of ſaluation: but it is the Lawe, which hath ſhewed
me that I am ſtarke dead, that I am dampnable before God, that
I am vndone and damned: This commeth not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> elſewhere than
from the lawe. And would yee haue mee too ſeeke righteouſneſſe
there? It is all one as if yee would giue mee a poyſon to eate, to
the ende I ſhoulde take nouriſhment of it. Howbeit (to ſay truthe)
that inconuenience is not to be wyted vpon the Law, for it ſhould
redounde to the diſhonour of God, from the Lawe came.
But howſoeuer the caſe ſtande,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. b. 7</note> conſidering the corruption that is
in vs, the Lawe can not but kill vs, as wee haue ſeene in the ſecond
too the Corinthians,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. b. 9</note> and as S. Paule declareth more fully in the
<pb facs="tcp:23060:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſeuenth to the Romanes. For he ſayth, that when men beleue them
ſelues too haue lyfe: that is too ſaye, when they beleeue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to be righteous, and to ſtande in the grace &amp; fauour of God:
it is a ſigne that the lawe is dead to them, that is to ſaye, that it hath
not the power and ſtrength to ſhew them that which elſe it ſhould
do. For to what ende was the law giuen? Too ſet the rule of good
life before our eyes, &amp; that rule is called the righteouſneſſe which
God alloweth. Marke that for one poynt. Secondly the law ought
to be as a looking glaſſe to vs, wherein too beholde our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities,
blemiſhes, fouleneſſe, filthineſſe, and iniquities, ſo farre
out of all order, as wee may bee as it were ſwalowed vp in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre
at the ſighte of them. Nowe before wee haue the lawe, wee
ſee none of all theſe things: that is too ſay, wee knowe not what
maner of ones we bee, nor what euill is in vs. But when God ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his demaundes before vs, and we perceyue the ſame through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
then are wee at our wittes ende, and vtterly out of hope. The
Lawe then is dead: that is to ſay, it is as it were thruſt vnder foote
and as good as buryed, ſo long as wee thinke our ſelues to be aliue,
and conceyue any fooliſhe imagination of beeing righteous, and of
obteyning heauen by our owne good workes. But when the lawe
liueth: that is too ſay, when God giueth it power to touch vs, then
are wee dead, then is it as a ſworde to thruſt vs too the hart. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee muſt needes receyue a deadly wounde, ſo ſoone as wee
haue perceyued what the Lawe conteyneth. After that maner
ſpeaketh S. Paule in the texte whiche I haue alleaged. And nowe
following the ſame matter, he ſayth, <hi>that he is dead too the Lawe by
the Lawe:</hi> as if he had ſayde, Come not hyther too ſlaunder the
Goſpell, as thoughe it were the cauſe of our damnation, or an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
vnto vs too bee curſed before God, too haue the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the grace of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt in vs. No no. But it
is certayne that the Lawe (when it dooth his office, and wee reade
it in ſuche wyſe as becommeth vs) dooth alwayes kill vs, and wee
lye as it were plunged in diſpayre, tyll oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte
haue reached vs his hande too lifte vs out of it. Thus then am I
dead vnto the lawe, that is too ſay, I can haue no lyfe, I can haue
no aſſurance of ſoule health, I can haue no comforte, reſt nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:23060:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
&amp; to be ſhort, there: is nothing in the law wherby I may
come vnto God: but cleane contrariwiſe, it ſhaketh me off, it thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
me backe, it baniſheth me from the kingdome of heauen, it
cutteth me quite off from the hope of ſaluation, it maketh me a
poore, curſed, and wretched creature, and to be ſhorte, it ſendeth
me to the bottome of hell. Yee ſee then what I haue wonne by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byding
in the lawe. And S. Paule ſpeaketh of him ſelfe rather than
of any other body, to the ende that the things which he ſpeaketh,
may bee the better receyued, as of a man of experience. And it is
after the ſame maner that he ſpeaketh in the fore alleaged ſeuenth
Chapter too the Romanes.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. b. 9</note> For there he ſetteth not foorth thys
man or that man for an example, but ſaythe, I my ſelfe was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
alyue: that is too ſaye, at ſuche time as he was a Phariſie,
and accounted an holy man, yea euen for one of the excellenteſt
in all Iewry, in ſo muche that he was a myrrour of all perfection,
and as a lyttle Angell: then (ſaythe he) I was alyue, howebeeit
but by hypocriſie. For he made him ſelfe too beleeue wonders,
and he was ſo puffed vp with pride,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. b. 8</note> that he hilde ſcorne of Ieſus
Chriſte. Lo in what blindneſſe Sainct Paule acknowledgeth hym,
ſelfe too haue beene. And he addeth anone after, that he wyſt not
what was ment by, Thou ſhalte not couet. It might bee thoughte
ſtraunge that a man whiche had not onely bin at ſchoole, but alſo
bin a great teacher of others, and thereto a very zealous man as he
him ſelfe affirmeth, ſhould bee ſo dulled as not to knowe his owne
faultes. But S. Paule ſheweth the reaſon of it. For (ſayth he) I loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
no further than to the outwarde honeſtie, that there might no
faulte bee founde in me before the worlde, nor any man know any
euill by me. But when I vnderſtoode what this ſaying, Thou ſhalt
not luſte ment, and perceyued that God condemneth all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
&amp; thoughts of men: then I perceyued that the worſt was
behind, as the common Prouerbe ſayth: for it is the laſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the law, wherein God maketh ſo liuely, and deepe a ſearche
as nothing can be excepted from it.<note place="margin">Exo. 20. a. 3</note> VVheras it is ſayd in the lawe.
Thou ſhalte not haue any ſtraunge goddes: Thou ſhalt not make
any image too worſhip it: Thou ſhalte not take the name of the
Lorde thy God in vayne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou ſhalt keepe holy the day of reſt:
<pb facs="tcp:23060:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thou ſhalt honor thy father &amp; mother: Thou ſhalt not kil: Thou
ſhalte not commit aduoutrie: Thou ſhalte not ſteale: All this is
well (will we thinke) we muſt abſteyne from all whordome, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and extortion: we muſt abſteyne from deceipt and robberie:
we muſt liue ſoberly. Heretoo, we muſt abſteyne from blaſphemie,
and we muſt honor God. All this will eaſily be graunted. But there
is a backenooke that we perceyued not, whiche is, Thou ſhalt not
couet or luſte: that is a priuie nipper. Truely it ſeemeth not too
bee very bigge or greate: but yet for all that, it is ſuche a ſtinger,
as paſſeth all the reſt in byting. For by the ende and wynding vp
of hys Lawe, God ſearcheth out all that euer is in man. Hee ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
downe that commaundement, too trie out the things that
were hidden: and when he ſayth, thou ſhalte not couet, it is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
euen into the marie of mens bones. So then S. Paule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
that he knewe not what ſinne mente, till he vnderſtoode
what was mente by the commaundement that forbiddeth men too
couet or luſte. And therfore in this texte he chargeth not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
but the Lawe with it. VVherefore let vs remember vpon this
text, that all they whiche deceyue them ſelues by any opinion of
their owne merites, neuer taſted what the Law of God is, nor what
it meaneth: I ſpeake of the greateſt doctors that are in moſte eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
as (in good fayth) it is too bee ſeene in the Popedome.
For euen thoſe that are taken too bee the pillers of the Churche,
(notwithſtanding that they profeſſe Diuinitie) knowe not one
worde of Gods lawe, too apply the ſame too his true and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
vſe. For they haue nothing in them but hypocriſie, and they
beare them ſelues in hande, that they ſhall pleaſe God with a rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
as if he were a little babe. They doo but toye with him, and yet
yee ſhall ſee them ſtande ſo muche in their owne conceites, as they
can not abide to be condemned. And if a man tell them that wee
muſt ſeeke our ſaluation in Ieſus Chriſt: yea ſay they? and what
ſhall become then of our freewill? what ſhould become of our
owne merites and ſatisfactions? Too their ſeeming it were much
better too plucke the ſunne out of the sky, yea and God out of his
ſeate too, than too bereeue man of that prerogatiue, or of the thing
that he can bring of him ſelfe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pound with God and yet for all
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:23060:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that, it is certayne that there is nothing in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but ſtarke filthineſſe.
For men ſee that there is neyther feare of God, nor vprightneſſe,
nor equitie, nor ought elſe [that good is] in their lyfe. They be ſo
full of pride that they be readie to burſt agayne, and they be full of
enuy, rancour, and all maner of looceneſſe. And yet for all this,
they will needes holde God bound vnto them: but that is bicauſe
they neuer knewe the law. So then, when our Lorde teacheth vs,
and ſheweth vs how we ought to walke in this world, let vs learne
to lay the doctrine that he ſetteth foorth and our life togither, and
there we ſhall finde the right perfection of the law, and that in our
ſelues there is nothing but horrible confuſion: wee ſhall ſee hell
readie prepared for vs. By that meanes it will be eaſie for vs to
giue ouer all the deſeruing whiche wee ſhall haue fancied in our
ſelues, ſo as it ſhall be ſoone beaten downe, and our mouthes ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and we become like poore dead folke without any breath, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we ſhall perceyue well inough, that we can not come vnto
God, but muſt needes thunder agaynſt vs, if wee bring any
fooliſhe imagination of our owne deſeruings. Lo howe the lawe
ſleaeth vs. But when we haue paſſed through ſuche death, that is
to ſay, when we be alreadie rightly humbled and vtterly diſmayde:
then here is a remedie, which S. Paule ſetteth downe, ſaying: <hi>I was
crucified with Ieſus Chriſt, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue vnto God.</hi> Now he ſheweth here
that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt not only bringeth vs remiſsion of our
ſinnes, but alſo ſanctifieth and regenerateth vs by his holy ſpirite,
in ſo muche that whereas there was nothing but ſtubborneſſe in vs
before, now we be giuen to ſerue God, and to pleaſe him. And for
the better vnderſtanding of that which S. Paule telleth vs, let vs
marke that we receyue two principall graces of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt: The one is the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, whereby we are
aſſured of our ſaluation, and haue our conſciences quieted, and
wherevpon it behoueth vs to be grounded, ſo as we cal vpon God
as our father. VVho giueth vs the boldneſſe to lift vp our heads to
heauen, and to call God our father? Agayne, what maketh vs ſo
bolde as to glory that we be companions and brothers to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels?
It is bicauſe our ſinnes come not to account: for we muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
haue recourſe to the waſhing of them away, which was done
<pb facs="tcp:23060:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the deathe and paſsion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Yee ſee then
that our righteouſneſſe is that God accepteth vs, howebeit not in
reſpecte of our owne worthyneſſe, but in reſpect of the obedience
of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, whereby all our miſdooings are wyped
out. That is the firſt benefite which wee haue by our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſte. The ſeconde is, that whereas wee bee frowarde of our
owne nature, and al that the Papiſts terme by the name of freewill
is but frenzie, and that howe great accompte ſo euer men make
of them ſelues, all is but naughtineſſe, and wee bee full of vyce
and corruption: in ſteade of beeing ſo, our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs the grace to be ſory for our ſinnes, &amp; to labour to do good:
for ſo long as we abide in our owne nature, euery of vs ſootheth
and flattereth him ſelfe in his euill. But when we haue once taſted
the ineſtimable loue of our God, and perceyued what our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt is: then we be ſo touched by his holy ſpirite, that wee
condemne the euill, and deſire to drawe neere vnto God, and too
frame our ſelues to his holy will. VVee be ſure of that once, and
although wee go halting, yet doo wee continually ſigh to ſee our
owne imperfections and infirmities, and perceyue full well how it
is the ſpirite of God that moueth vs thervnto, when our chiefe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
is to forſake the ſinfulneſſe that is in vs, and commeth of our
fleſhe, ſo as we wiſhe nothing elſe but that God ſhould be glorified
in all our lyfe, and faythfully obeyed in all things. That is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
benefite which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt bringeth vs: and they
be two things knit togither by vnſeparable bande, ſo that like as
the light of the ſunne can not be ſeparated from his heate: ſo theſe
two graces (that is to wit our righteouſneſſe, and the remiſsion of
our ſinnes) are vnſeparably matched with our renewment, which
is done by the ſpirit of ſanctification. Thus ye ſee two graces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable:
and like as when we ſay that the Sunne is whot, it ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
not to ſhine alſo, &amp; yet notwithſtanding the light of the ſunne
is not heate: ſo when we ſay that wee be iuſtified by the remiſsion
of our ſinnes, it is not ment that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt doth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth
ſuffer him ſelfe too bee mocked and deſpiſed, but that wee
haue neede to be throughly clenſed, ſo as wee may learne too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
the world, and our ſelues, too the ende to ſticke vnto him
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:23060:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with true obedience. Howſoeuer the worlde go, the thing that S.
Paule ſpeaketh in this text, ſhall alwayes be founde true, namely
that he was crucified with Ieſus Chriſt, to liue vnto God. Then if
any man accuſe the Goſpell that it giueth libertie to doo euill and
too ſinne: wee may alwayes anſwere, howe ſo? By the lawe wee
bee alwayes dead, for there wee ſee our owne curſedneſſe whiche
will leaue vs diſmayde in diſpayre. But in the Goſpell, although
wee bee crucified, that is too ſaye, althoughe there bee a ſpice of
death in the Goſpell, yet is that death a quickening deathe, and
the cauſe of lyfe. For ſo long as men lyue too them ſelues, they
bee dead vnto God: they bee wretched carkaſſes full of rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
But when they dye in them ſelues, they lyue vntoo God.
And for that cauſe Sainct Paule in the twelfth too the Romanes
calleth vs lyuing ſacrifices,<note place="margin">Rom. 12. a. 1</note> where hee telleth vs that wee muſte
bee tranſformed, and vtterly gyue ouer our owne reaſon and
our owne wyll, too yeelde God ſuche ſeruice as is meete for him
too haue. He ſaythe, Offer vp your ſelues as lyuing ſacrifices.
So then, in the Lawe there muſte needes bee a deadly deathe, a
deathe that leaueth vs vtterly ouerwhelmed and ſunken euen
downe intoo hell. But in the Goſpell there is a quickening
deathe. And why? For wee bee crucified wyth Ieſus Chriſt, too
lyue vnto God, that is too ſaye,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. a. 4</note> our olde man (as Sainct Paule
termeth it in the ſixth too the Romanes) and that whiche wee
haue of our owne nature, is doone awaye, howebeeit not at
the firſt daye, but by little and little. But howe ſoeuer the cace
ſtande, wee ſhall perceyue that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
all that was in vs of our owne, or of the worlde, ſo as wee
bee not ſo greatly giuen too neſtle heere bylowe, bycauſe wee
ſee it is a myſerable ſtate too lyue heere, and oure very care is
too ſtycke vntoo God. Thus yee ſee howe wee may bee cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
with our Lorde Ieſus Chryſte. But what is mente by that
crucifying? Verily it is a certayne kynde of deathe. Howebeeit,
that deathe bryngeth vs too lyfe, whiche thing the death whiche
the Lawe bringeth dooth not. Nowe then wee ſee the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente
of Sainct Paule, and the naturall meanyng of this
texte. Therefore nowe a dayes when the enimies of the truthe
<pb facs="tcp:23060:121"/>
blaſpheme the Goſpell, we haue heere an anſwere to ſtoppe their
mouthes. And if they holde on ſtill, let them barke lyke dogges,
but they ſhall not bee able too byte, doo what they can. See heere
what the Papiſtes fluſhe foorth when wee preache that men are
iuſtified throughe Gods free goodneſſe. O (ſay they) are they ſo?
That were the nexte waye to giue euery man the brydle too lyue
after his owne lyking, and too cauſe that there mighte be no more
remorſe nor ſcruple of conſcience, ſo as euery man myghte
haue leaue too doo what he lyſted. That is the common blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
of the Papiſtes. Agayne when wee ſhewe them that they can
not bynde vs by their traditions, and that it is but a tyrannie
whiche they haue vſurped in robbing God of his righte, and that
the libertie was purchaſed for vs by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, to the
ende that wee ſhoulde not bee tyde too the things whiche men
woulde lay vpon vs of lawe and neceſsitie in matters concerning
the ſpirituall gouernment of our ſoules. O (ſaye they) ſee what
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes of it: their deſire is nothing elſe but too wallowe in all
pleaſure, and too leade a looſe lyfe. Surely wee maye eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere
too all this. For the doctrine that wee bring, ſerueth not to
ſtirre vp mens luſtes, nor to giue them too greate and lawleſſe a
libertie: but too the cleane contrarie. But howſoeuer the cace
ſtande, it oughte too ſuffice vs, that if wee ſhoulde abyde in the
quamyre of the Papiſtes, ſurely there woulde bee nothyng but
deathe for vs. For were they not too faſte aſleepe and vtterly
dulled, vndoubtedly they ſhoulde bee toſſed wyth ſuche vnqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe
and hartebytings, as they ſhould needes ſee that that is not
the thing wherevpon wee muſte reſte. But beholde, they bee ſo
rotted in their ignoraunce, that they haue not anye feelyng of
Gods iuſtice at all. But as for oure partes, for as muche as wee
knowe wee haue ſuche a freedome purchaſed vs by our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, and are ſure of our ſaluation bicauſe God dothe freely
forgiue all our faultes, and doo feele alreadie by the working of
Gods holy ſpirite, that he draweth vs to him, and are mortifyed to
liue vnto him: Let vs go forwarde with a chearefull heart. And
althoughe there bee neuer ſo many infirmities in our nature, yet
notwithſtanding let vs not doubt but God accepteth vs, for all
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:23060:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our imperfections. But the Papiſts cannot haue ſo muche as one
good purpoſe to ſerue God, ſauing that they be vtterly bewitched
[to beleeue ſo] through vayne ſelftruſt. And why? For they ground
themſelues vpon their owne merites, and (to their ſeeming) that is
the meane to purchace grace. But now what is it that they can do?
Put the cace that they brought a hundred times more with them
than they haue to bring, and that God gouerned them by his holy
ſpirit, ſo as they had ſome manner of feeling of the Goſpel, though
it were but halfe a feeling: yet ſhould they come farre ſhort of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
their dutie, yea or of the hundred parte of it towardes
God. But in the meane ſeaſon, it is well knowen that all that euer
they do is but pelting traſh: and as for the law of God, it is nought
worth with them, and yet in the meane while they buſie theyr
heads about their owne inuentions. Howbeit let vs ſtill put the
cace that they indeuored to walke in the feare of God, and that
they had learned aright to do the things that God commaundeth
them: yet for all that, they coulde not make their boaſt that they
were come to the perfection of that righteouſneſſe which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
of vs. And when they had tormented themſelues neuer ſo
much, how ſhould they be able to ſerue God with a cheereful cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
vnleſſe they knew themſelues to be in his fauour, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that they be ſo blameworthy before him? But as for vs, we on
our ſide are able to ſerue God with a free hart, notwithſtanding
that our conſciences find fault with vs, and we know that there are
many ſinnes in vs. And why? For we ground not ourſelues vppon
our owne merites, but vpon Goddes meere mercie: and thereby
we be taught, that God receiueth our workes though there bee
muche faultineſſe in them, and that we be in his fauoure although
there be many vices and blemiſhes in vs. And that is the cauſe why
he ſaith by his prophet,<note place="margin">Mala. 1. b. 6</note> that he will accept the ſeruis which we do
vnto him, as a father accepteth the ſeruis of his child. Yee ſee that
a child is willing to obey his father: and when his father ſayth too
him, do this: his father taketh his doing in good worth, though the
child know not what he doth, yea and ſometimes though he marre
a thing, yet his father is contented to loſe the thing when he ſeeth
that the child was willing and deſirous to ſerue him. But if a man
<pb facs="tcp:23060:122"/>
take a ſeruant for wages, hee will looke to haue him do his taske.
And why? For he looketh for his wages: and a man will not abide
to haue him marre the worke that is put into his hands: yea and if
it be not well done, he wil not be contented with it. Now our Lord
ſpeaking of the grace of the Goſpell, ſayth he wil receiue our ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as a father receiueth the obedience of his child, though all that
euer he doth be nothing worth: that is to ſay, he paſſeth not awhit
for the perfection that is in them, for he ſhall find none at all in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
but he beareth with vs of his goodneſſe. He ſheweth himſelfe ſo
kind and freeharted towards vs, that whatſoeuer we do, he taketh
it in good part, although it be not worthy, ne do deſerue it. Ye ſee
then that the way for vs to haue a free courage to ſerue God, is too
aſſure ourſelues that he bliſſeth all our works, bycauſe that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
ſpottineſſe is in them, is clenzed away by the bloud of oure
Lord Ieſus Chriſt. To be ſhort, whereas God ſheweth himſelfe
pitifull towards vs, and vſeth ineſtimable mercie: let vs vnderſtand
that he doth it not to the end that euery of vs ſhould runne a ſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terloping,
and take the bridle in his teeth, and play the horſe that is
broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> looce: no no, but contrariwiſe it is to the end, that the ſword
of Gods word ſhoulde ſtrike vs to the hart, and make ſuch a ſerch
there, as we might be rightly humbled to craue pardon at Goddes
hand. Not that we ſhould haue the hartbiting whiche the Papiſts
haue, which would plucke vs backe and hinder vs from comming
vnto God, making vs to ſay, wretched creature what doſt thou?
VVhat canſt thou tell whither God loue thee or no? Let vs haue
no ſuch nippes, but let vs be fully reſolued that God beholdeth
vs with pitie, and taketh our works in good woorth: not for any
deſert or worthineſſe that he findeth in them, but bycauſe we bee
ioyned to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Now therefore we ſee what Saint
Paule meant to ſay. Alſo we ſee how that doctrine ſerued not for
that tyme only: but that the ſame is as profitable and needefull
for vs at this day, as euer it was [for any heeretofore.] For in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as Gods enimies ſight againſt the Goſpell, and ſpew out
their blaſphemies: it ſtandeth vs on hand to haue wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
them: and not only them, but alſo Satan, who hath at all tymes
had the ſlight to make vs beleeue men, that they coulde liue of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:23060:122"/>
themſelues and by their owne deſeruings: but that is but to lulle
vs aſleepe in death. And therefore let vs aſſure ourſelues, that it is
better for vs to die to the law, than to liue to it: that is to ſay, let
vs aſſure ourſelues, that if God ſhould enter into account with vs,
we ſhould be vtterly vndone and damned. And being ſo diſmayed,
let vs ſuffer ourſelues to be crucifyed with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:
and ſith we know that he hath reconcyled vs to God his father by
the ſacrifiſe which he offered, let vs alſo ſuffer ourſelues to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
by his holy ſpirit, and to be renued by him in ſuch wiſe, as
being dead in ourſelues we may liue truly vnto God, giuing ouer
all ouerweening of our owne righteouſneſſe, and fighting agaynſt
all the luſts of our fleſh, and withdrawing ourſelues from the
world.</p>
            <p>And now let vs caſt ourſelues downe before the maieſtie of our
good God with acknowledgement of our ſinnes, praying him too
make vs ſo to feele them, as it may be to plucke vs backe from the
filthineſſe wherein we be plunged, and to ioyne vs ſo vnto oure
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as he may draw vs to God his father, and make
vs come ſtill neerer and neerer vnto him, till we bee fully ioyned
vntoo him. And ſo let vs all ſay, Almightye God heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

offered vp in Sacrifiſe vnto God, when oure
Lord Ieſus Chriſt knitteth vs togither in hys
body. It is not to the ende we ſhould lye ſtill
in death, wherein we bee plunged already by
nature: but rather to make vs partakers of the
heauenly lyfe. Nowe the Apoſtle hauing ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
after that manner, magnifyeth Gods grace, ſaying <hi>that he hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
lyueth not any more, but Ieſus Christ in him:</hi> which is aſmuch as if
he had ſayd, that all of vs by nature haue nothing in vs but curſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and therefore that looke what good ſoeuer God beſtoweth
vpon vs, it becommeth vs to acknowledge and confeſſe the ſame
to come of him, and to do him ſeruis for it. For faith bringeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
this humilitie with it, that men imbace themſelues too gyue
all prayſe vnto God. But by the way it may ſeeme ſtraunge, that a
faithfull man ſhould boaſt that Ieſus Chriſt liueth in him, and yet
be mortall ſtill. So long as we liue in this world, we be ſubiect too
many infirmities: and therefore this ſaying ſhoulde ſeeme to bee a
vayne ſpeculation or [fantaſticall conceit,] that Ieſus Chriſt liueth
in vs. But S. Paule bringeth vs backe to faith, and telleth vs that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
our life be corruptible to outward apparance, and we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to all the aduerſities of the world: yet doth faith quicken vs, ſo
as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ceaſſeth not to make vs partakers of his
heauenly life, yea and in very deede we poſſeſſe it, in ſomuch as we
muſt no more conſider the ſtate of the faithfull according too that
which may be iudged of it by our naturall wit, but mount vp high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
For the life which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt imparteth vnto vs, is a
hidden treaſure which we attaine not too but by faith which moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
aboue the whole world. Now it behoueth vs to hope for the
things which we ſee not, and which are hidden from vs: and God is
then highly honored of vs, when we make ſuche account of hys
worde and promiſes, as that all the thinges whiche we ſee in the
worlde, cannot hold vs backe from ſeeking him continually, and
from going to him, and from imploying all our wits about hym.
Now then, firſt we haue to gather vpon this text, that a man hathe
neuer profited well in the Goſpell, till he father all his welfare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:23060:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For if we reſerue neuer ſo little to our
ſelues, we be vnthankfull to God out of hand: and his grace cannot
be darkned by vs, but that we be bereft of it as we are worthy. And
therein it appeereth, that all ſuch as truſt in their owne merits, are
ſtill full of pride, and as it were mortall enimies to Gods glory. It is
true that they will not profeſſe it with their mouthes: but yet for
all that, the hypocrites which hope to be righteous by their owne
worthineſſe, do decke themſelues with Gods fethers. Humilitie is
the principall vertue among all others. For what are all their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites?
Contrariwiſe, when the faithfull humble themſelues, it is not
to purchace grace in Gods ſight as though they were worthy of it:
but to confeſſe as truth is, that they haue not aught whereof too
boaſt, but muſt receiue all things of Gods meere liberalitie. At
leaſtwiſe it ſerueth to make vs acknowledge how greatly wee bee
bound vnto him, ſeing he hath ſhewed himſelf ſo kind towards vs,
as to ſpare nothing from vs. That therefore is the thing that Sainct
Paule ſheweth vs heere. And it behoueth vs to wey well the ſecond
point where he ſaith, <hi>that we liue in the fleſh, howbeit by the faith of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> This word <hi>liue in the fleſh,</hi> doth in this text ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
as much as to be a wayfarer heere vpon earth, and too paſſe
through this tranſitorie life.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. c. <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> For when he ſpeaketh of liuing in the
fleſh in the eight to the Romanes, he meeneth to be giuen to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
luſts, as they be which haue no feare of God, who giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to do what they liſt. Therefore ſuche as follow their owne
ſwindge like brute beaſts, do liue in the fleſh. But in this place ſaint
Paule compareth this outward life with the heauenly life which we
poſſeſſe by faith. For how ſhal a man put a difference betweene the
faithfull and the faithleſſe? As well the one ſort as the other do
eate and drinke. Surely the faithfull do eate and drinke ſoberly. Yea
and ye ſhall ſee of the faithleſſe ſort very well ſtayed, and not gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to any drunkenneſſe or exceſſe. But howſoeuer they fare, a
man would deeme at the firſt ſight, that this life is common to all
men. Neuertheleſſe, the faithfull do oftentimes drag their wings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, and nothing elſe but droope in this world, and finally dye
as well as all other men. Then if a man looke but vppon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſhew, there is no diuerſitie betwixt them. To be ſhort, a man
<pb facs="tcp:23060:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might ſay it is but loſt labour to beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt. For we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
not heere the reward of our faith: and although God call vs
to a further thing, yet haue we all one common and like life, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
that all of vs muſt come to death. How then doth Ieſus Chriſt
liue in vs? For his liuing is hidden. S. Paule bringeth vs backe vnto
faith. Now remayneth to know what the nature of faith is: It is to
behold the things that are incomprehenſible to our ſenſes to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the worlde, and to ſeeke the kingdome of God: and to holde
ourſelues to the pure &amp; ſimple word that proceedeth out of Gods
mouth, without reſpect of any thing that we can perceiue heere. If
we haue not this groundworke, we ſhall neuer vnderſtand what S.
Paule telleth vs in this text. For when men haue red it a hundred
times, yet ſhall they not know what difference there is betweene
liuing in the fleſh, and liuing in the faith of our Lord Ieſus Chryſt.
Then is there an outward ſtate: in reſpect where of S. Paule dothe
(vnder that ſaying) comprehend all things that concerne this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory
life. There is alſo an inward ſtate whiche is hidden from vs,
that is to wit, the ſtate which is promiſed vs, and which we wait for
[by hope.] For the outward man muſt needes be defaced, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
by little and little, til it be vtterly done away. According wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,
although it be promiſed to Gods children that God wil giue
them new liuelineſſe,<note place="margin">Pſa. 103 a 5</note> and make them as it were to caſt their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
yet notwithſtanding ye ſhall diuers times ſee them ſo diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
as it is pitie, and the ſtrongeſt men of the world waxe old and
come to death. Seeing it is ſo: what preferment haue they aboue
the vnbeleeuers? [Great:] howbeit that the ſame cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by eyſight. For we haue an inward man whiche lies hidden
within vs: and what ment Sainct Paule by that? he ment that God
worketh in ſuch wiſe in vs by his holy ſpirit, as we be always aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the heauenly life that is prepared for vs, and that although
we do but glide away here below,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. d. 16.</note> and be as ſtraungers, yet there is
an euerlaſting heritage which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not fayle vs. According as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man decayeth (ſaith S. Paule) ſo the inward man renueth. For
the more that the faithfull ſee themſelues decay, the more are they
warned and prouoked to looke vpward. For we know that ſuch as
are ſtrong and luſty, do beſot and forget themſelues, and therefore
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:23060:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our Lorde is faine to tame vs in ſuch wiſe, as we may renue by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying:
I ſay in ſuch wiſe as we may be (as ye wold ſay) new caſt in a
mould again, to the end that the hope of the heauenly life may be
ſtabliſhed in vs, and we haue our ſight cleered to behold the thyng
which otherwiſe would be wrapped vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. Marke how gold and
ſiluer do greatly waſt when men make them to paſſe the furnace.
VVhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is caſt into the fire, it is a great maſſe of metall: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it
is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out again, ther is but a ſmall quantitie of it. And yet the gold
(if it were not ſo fined) would neuer ſerue to any purpoſe, no more
would ſiluer nother. Euen ſo is it with vs: we could neuer be renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to come to the kingdome of heauen, except we dyed firſt. VVe
muſt euer go forward to that vtter defacement, and not reſt by the
way vpon any thing that we ſee with our eyes. For this earthly life
is but a ſhadow, and a ſmoke that ſlideth and vaniſheth away: &amp; yet
neuertheleſſe we be renued thereby within. Not that all men haue
that benefit: For the faithleſſe do well ynough finde their owne
weakneſſe, and are inforced to feele the ſummonings of death, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when they be growen old, for then they perceiue that any
little blaſt is ynough to caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe: and therevpon they fall to
ſtorming, and could find in their harts to fall out with God &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Howſoeuer the world go, though they rotte, yet are they not
renued.<note place="margin">Iohn. 12. d. 24.</note> For one graine of corne may well rotte, and yet not take
roote to ſpring againe and to bring foorth frute: and another grain
ſhal rot likewiſe, howbeit for aſmuch as it is in good earth, &amp; hathe
take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> roote, it will bring foorth frute in ſeaſonable time. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
faithful come to decay, and the rewithal are renued and gather new
force: and why? For they rot in this world, to the end to be reſtored
and renued againe in the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly heritage. The faithleſſe alſo do go
away to, they rot likewiſe, they ſlip aſide, &amp; they vaniſh quite away:
but they haue no vauntage by it, bycauſe they be not reſtored to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life. So then let vs marke well, that whereas S. Paul ſayth we
liue by the faith of Ieſus Chriſt: it is to wake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs ſo as nothing in the
world may keepe vs from reſting co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually vpon Gods promiſes.
VVhen we looke vpon al the things that are about vs, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but death. But what for that? God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs his word, that
being dead in our own nature, we haue our life elſewhere, namely in
<pb facs="tcp:23060:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in aſmuch as he was purpoſely ſent to bring
vs from death to life. Seing then that we haue that promiſe of god,
ye ſee how he may be honored at our hands. And for aſmuch as
the cace ſtandeth ſo, that only ſaying ought to ſuffiſe vs. And if wee
ſetle and reſolue ourſelues fully therevpon: it is a token that we ſet
our handes to Gods truth as faithfull witneſſes thereof,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. d. 33</note> as ſayeth
Sainct Iohn. Contrariwiſe when we doubt or be in a mamering,
then hath Gods word no authoritie nor reuerence among vs. For
if we looke no further than to the things that are before vs, and
to the things that are neare at hand: we cannot acknowldge that
God is faithfull, and that the things which God hath vttered wyth
his owne mouth are vnfallible. Moreouer, in ſo doing we turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is the pledge
of all that is conteined in Gods word. Seeing we haue the worde,
we muſt no more aske (as Moſes ſaith) who ſhall climb vp aboue
the Cloudes?<note place="margin">Deu. 30. c. 12</note> or who ſhall go downe into the deepe? or who ſhall
go ouer the Sea?<note place="margin">Ro. 10. a. 6.</note> The word (ſayth he) is in thy mouth, and in thy
hart: and we muſt content ourſelues with it. And moreouer ſeeing
that we haue our Lord Ieſus Chriſt for a larger confirmation: we
know that he went downe into the hells, that is to ſaye, bare the
curſe that was due to vs for our ſinnes, and anſwered as our pledge
and ſuretie before the iudgement ſeate of his father: and afterward
went vp into heauen, and in our behalfe tooke poſſeſsion of the
heritage that he had purchaced for vs. For he was exalted vp in our
fleſh and nature. Seeing that we haue ſuch an aſſurance, muſt wee
not needes be tootoo wretched, if we cannot hold ourſelues too
it?<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. d. 18.</note> Agayne, the matter willeth vs to looke ſtill backe to that whych
hath bin ſaid: namely, that we hope, not for thinges that are open
and manifeſt, but for the thinges that are vnknowen to worldly
perceiuerance. Then ſith it is ſo, let vs learne to liue by the faith of
Ieſus Chriſt: that is to ſay, although we be miſerable in this worlde
and be faine to indure neuer ſo many hartbitings, greefes, angui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,
troubles, and diſtreſſes: yet notwithſtanding let vs continue
in this conſtancie, of beleeuing that there is nothing but ſingular
happineſſe in all our miſeries, bycauſe God bliſſeth and halloweth
them for our Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake, and all is turned to our helpe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:23060:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and welfare as it is ſaid in the .viij. to the Rom.<note place="margin">Ro. 8. e. 27.</note> Therfore as we haue
ſeene in another text,<note place="margin">2. Co. 12. c. 9</note> God muſt vtter the perfectneſſe of his ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
in our weakeneſſe, and we ſuffer him to make vs to ſtoupe, in ſuch
ſort as this world may not keepe vs backe from hauing the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of the Goſpell throughly printed in our heartes, nor hinder vs to
be glad and cheerfull in the mids of our miſeries and afflictions, nor
boldly too diſpyze all the ſlaunderings and mockages of the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
when they offer vs reproch, ſaying? Godes, you ſilly wretches,
thinke your ſelues to be princes when you beleeue the Goſpell. But
alack poore ſoules, where is the ioy and happineſſe which you ſay is
promiſed you of God? VVhere is the ineſtimable benefit which you
make ſo great account of? For ye haue no more than thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you
call Gods enimies, reprobates, and curſed kaytifs. But (as I ſayde)
all this geere muſt not thruſt vs out of the way: for we muſt come
backe vntoo fayth. Although then that heere beneath we perceiue
not the things that are promiſed vs in the Goſpell: yet let vs aſſure
our ſelues of them out of all doubt. For (as ſayth S. Paule) our life is
hidden,<note place="margin">Col. 3. a. 3.</note> and the time of the diſcouerie thereof is not yet come. And
where is our life but in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt? Now the kingdome
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is apparant inough: howbeeit, that is but in
part: we haue but a taſt of it: and things are ſo troubled &amp; diſordered
in this world, that if we will iudge of our ſaluation by the outwarde
apparance, what would become of it? Therfore let vs ſuffer our life
to be hid till our Lord Ieſus Chriſt come, and then ſhall we perceiue
that we haue not bin beguiled in putting our truſt in him, and in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the doctrine of his Goſpell. Yee ſee then after what maner
we muſt liue by fayth: that is to ſay, wee muſt not be ſo nyce as to
ſeeke a quiet life heere, and too haue all our commodities and eaſe
here. For in ſo doing we ſhould forgo the thing that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
vs, we ſhoulde forget him, and it woulde be an vtter deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our fayth. But let vs take the myrrour of Gods worde, and
there looke vpon the things that furmount all our wit, and are ſet
far out of this world, and are vtterly inuiſible: and let vs lift vp our
eies thither, not ſo far forth as our own reaſon &amp; skill ſhalbe able to
guide vs, (for that is not inough) but ſo as we may climbe aboue the
world, and forſake the preſent things, to the end to holde our ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:23060:126"/>
faſt in Gods promiſes, and to be pacient in all afflictions and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
wherby we ſhal be exercized, and againſt which we muſt befain
to fight, till we receyue the frute of our victorie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyed
vp into the reſt of heauen. Thus ye ſee what haue we to gather vpon
this ſaying of S. Paule, which might ſeme darke at the firſt ſight: but
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue on the one ſide marked wel what our ſtate is while we
bee in this worlde, and on the other ſide conſidered what the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of fayth is, we ſhall eaſily perceyue that there is no darkneſſe
at all in it. And now Saint Paule addeth expreſſely, <hi>that Ieſus Chriſt
loued him, and gaue himſelfe to the death for him.</hi> This is an expoſition
of that which we ſawe erewhiles. For men do oftentimes miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
the woorde <hi>Fayth,</hi> bycauſe they conſider not what the pithe of
of it is. And in deede euerie man will bee called faythfull, and yet
euen among thoſe that make profeſsion of Chriſtianitie, yee ſhall
ſcarce finde one of a hundred that hathe ſo muche as one droppe
of fayth. For (as I ſayde afore) it is neuer ſought what is ment
by fayth. The worde is verie ſhort, but it draweth a long tayle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it, as wee ſee by the addition that is ſet downe heere. For Saint
Paule declareth that hee liueth by fayth, bycauſe Ieſus Chriſt had
loued him, and deliuered himſelfe to death for him. As much muſt
we do. For inaſmuch as wee ſee that the Sonne of God; the Lorde
of glorie, the heade of the Angels, hee by whome all things were
made, and by whome all things are ſtill mainteyned, yeeldeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to death,<note place="margin">Deu. 21. d. 23</note> yea and too ſo vile a death, that hee tooke our curſe
vppon him, and not onely was hanged vpon a Croſſe, which was
an yrkſome thing to all the worlde, but alſo was pronounced accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by Gods owne mouth: ſeeing (ſay I) that wee haue ſuch a price
to raunſome vs from death, and too purchaſe vs life and ſaluation:
haue we not cauſe (if we thinke well vppon it) to ouerleape all the
lettes that Satan can caſt in our wayes to make vs turne head or to
retyre backe, that wee might not continue in the certaintie of our
fayth? Surely the victorie will bee eaſie ynough for vs agaynſt all,
remptations, if we can conſider of what value the death and paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is, and what it importeth. So then S.
Paule armeth vs heere, too the ende wee might holde out wyth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
conſtancie, agaynſt all the ſtoppes that Satan laboureth too
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:23060:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lay afore vs, to hinder vs from keeping on our courſe. VVhen the
faythfull are pinched with hunger or thirſt, they bee troubled with
looking heere and there for the promiſe that they ſhall be heyres
of the worlde, and in the meane while do well neare ſtarue for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
and penurie. But if they looke to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, that
will diſpatche them of all their trouble, and ſweeten all the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that might haue put the promiſes of ſaluation out of taſt with
them. Therefore whenſoeuer the faythfull are in any perill, or bee
perſecuted, ſo as they haue many wrongs and iniuries done them,
and yet are not ſuccoured of all that while:<note place="margin">Exo. 25. b. 8</note> they might thinke thus
with themſelues:<note place="margin">Pſal. 17. b. 8</note> VVhere is God? Hee hath promiſed to dwell in
vs, to keepe vs as the Apple of his eie, and to be our ſheeld and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe:
and yet in the meane while wee bee caſt vp too the ſpoyle,
wherefore it is certaine that we ſhall be vndone at euery blow. But
when we come to the death and paſsion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,
wee muſt conclude that the Sonne of God was not offered vp in
vaine. Seeing then that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſpared not himſelf,
but abaced himſelfe ſo farre as too ſuffer ſo ſlaunderous, yea and
curſed a death, and afterwarde alſo the paynes of Hell, howbeeit
but for a while, too the ende too ſet vs free and cleare, and too pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace
vs grace before the iudgement ſeate of God his father: ſhould
that dooing of his bee vnauaylable? Is it poſsible that it ſhoulde
bee? No: For if Heauen and earth were turned vpſyde downe,
it were not ſo great a confuſion, as too imagine that the Sonne of
God hath ſuffered in vaine. Then ſee wee nowe why Saint Paule
telleth vs that hee liued by fayth. For it behoueth vs to be ſettled
vppon the death and paſsion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, aſſuring
our ſelues that it is able ynough too drawe vs out of the dungeons
of death.</p>
            <p>And furthermore it behoueth vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> too looke vppon our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, not onely as deade in the infirmitie of his fleſhe, but alſo
as ryzen againe through his diuine and heauenly power,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. a. 4</note> as is ſaide
of him in another Text. And therefore when there is any ſpeaking
of the death of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, it ſtandeth vs on hande too
conſider what the ſame importeth: that is too wit, that it is a ſacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to make an attonement of Reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation betwene God &amp; man,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:127" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an obedience too couer all the naughtineſſe that is in vs, and a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
too ſcoure away all our vnclenneſſe and filthineſſe. For aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
then as wee knowe that there is ſuch power in the death and
paſsion of the ſonne of God, and that therevpon wee marche fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that is to wit, too the glorie wherevntoo it leadeth vs: let vs
not any more imagine, that man ought hereafter to continue ſtill in
hys owne nature, but that hee ought too liue in the fayth of the
Goſpell, aſſuring himſelfe that he ſhall not be diſappoynted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
vppon the promiſes that are conteyned there. Thus ye ſee in
effect wherevnto we ſhould referre this ſaying, where Saint Paule
telleth vs expreſſely, that the Sonne of God gaue himſelfe. And
hee contenteth not himſelfe too ſay, that Chriſt gaue himſelfe for
the worlde in common, for that had bin but a ſlender ſaying: but
[ſheweth that] euerie of vs muſt applie too himſelfe particularly,
the vertue of the death and paſsion of oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.
VVhereas it is ſayde that the Sonne of God was crucified, we muſt
not onely thinke that the ſame was done for the Redemption of
the worlde: but alſo euerie of vs muſt on his owne behalfe ioyne
himſelfe too our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and conclude, It is for me that
hee hath ſuffered. Likewiſe when wee bee baptized, as it is not
for any one man alone, ſo is not the water ſprinckled vppon all men
in common: but euerie man is baptized ſeuerally in his owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
too the ende that euerie of vs may applie it particularly too
himſelfe, too ſaye that wee bee all members of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt. Alſo when wee receyue the holy Supper, euery man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
his owne portion, too ſhewe vs that oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſt
is communicated vntoo vs, yea euen to euerie one of vs. S. Paule
therefore dooth purpoſely vſe that maner of ſpeech, too the ende
wee ſhoulde not haue any colde imagination, after the maner of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
ignorant perſons, which take themſelues too bee Chriſtians,
and yet in the meane while are as wretched beaſtes. But when we
once knowe that the thing which was done for the redemption of
the whole worlde, perteyneth to euery of vs ſeuerally: it behoueth
euery of vs to ſay alſo on his owne behalfe, The ſonne of God hath
loued me ſo deerly, that he hath giuen himſelf to death for me. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
the worde <hi>Loue</hi> is not ſuperfluous here: for Saint Paules
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:23060:127"/>
intent is too magnifie the gracious goodneſſe of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt: as if he ſhoulde ſay, that we be verie wretches if we accept
not ſuch a benefite when it is offered vs, ſeeing that God in ſending
vs his ſonne, had none other reſpect but to our miſeries which hee
intended too relieue. Alſo our Lord Ieſus Chriſt did ſo neglect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
that he ſpared not his life for our welfare. And what was the
cauſe of it? The loue that he bare vs. Seeing it is ſo: muſt wee not
needes be worſe than out of our wittes, if we accept not ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite?<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. b. 16</note>
But it is a verie common doctrine in the holy Scripture, that
God ſo loued the worlde, that hee ſpared not his onely ſonne, but
gaue him too death for vs: and alſo that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, at
ſuch time as wee were his deadly enimies as ſayth Saint Paule,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. a. 8</note> did
confirme a maruellous loue towardes vs, in that he offered himſelf
in ſacrifice to make attonement betweene God and vs, and too doo
away all our ſinnes, ſo as they might no more come to account. Lo
heere a warrant of our ſaluation, ſo as wee ought to thinke our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
throughly aſſured of it. Howbeit S. Paule ment purpoſely here,
too rebuke mens vnthankefulneſſe, in that they accept not the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
which God graunteth them ſo bountifully, yea and of hys
owne free goodneſſe.<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4. d. 19.</note> For it behoueth vs too call to minde, howe
Saint Iohn in his Canonicall Epiſtle ſayeth, that we loued not God
firſt: (as if ſhoulde ſaye, wee did not preuent him, as thoſe
thinke they doo which ſay, I haue done him ſuche ſeruice and ſuch.
For alas what is it that wee can do too him?) but that he loued vs,
[yea euen] at ſuch time as we were his deadly enimies,) and came
euen then to ſeeke vs out in the verie deepeſt of the bottomleſſe
Dungeons. And therevppon Saint Paule addeth, <hi>that hee dooth not
diſpize</hi> or ſhake off <hi>the grace of God.</hi> This is the knitting vppe of
the things that wee haue hythertoo ſeene. For heere he ment too
ſhewe, that the Diuell muſt needes poſſeſſe thoſe that make none
accounte of Gods mercie, that is vttered in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,
and dayly offered vs in his Goſpell. For looke howe oft the death
and paſsion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is preached vntoo vs, and the
infinite goodneſſe of our God talked of: ſo oft is this meſſage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
vntoo vs, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt calleth vs vntoo hym,
to the ende we ſhould forſake the worlde and being out of all hope
<pb facs="tcp:23060:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in our ſelues, faſten and ſettle our whole truſt in him. Sith it is ſo: it
is good reaſon that we ſhould not reiect the grace of God. And S.
Paule in ſaying ſo, ment to call backe ſuche as had gone aſtray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and too ſhewe them the way, as if he had ſayde, whereas the
poore ignorant ſoules that neuer heard worde of the Goſpel might
be excuzed: we muſt needes be worſe than damnable, ſeeing we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuze
the grace of God when it is offered vs: for it ſmelleth of ſuch
an vnthankefulneſſe, as can by no meanes be excuſed. Saint Paule
therefore dooth heere make mention of thoſe whome our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt calleth too the hope of ſaluation by his Goſpell, and
yet doo ſtill welter in their owne wretchedneſſe, and become bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhe,
not knowing whither there bee a better lyfe or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or elſe of
ſuche as are ſufficiently tormented wyth inwarde heartbyting, and
yet ſeeke no remedie nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. Yet notwithſtanding, all they too
whome our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath not preached his Goſpell, ſhall
not fayle to periſhe without mercie, They cannot defende them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
by ignorance: I ſay that all the heathen folke and Idolaters
that euer were, muſt haue their mouthes ſtopped. And what ſhal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of vs then, which haue had our eares beaten dayly with the
meſſage that God ſendeth vs: which is that hee requireth nothing
but that we ſhould be drawne vnto him, wherevnto he incourageth,
yea and beſeecheth vs, as we haue ſeene in the ſecond to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians?<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. d. 20.</note>
It is not a great ſhame for vs, that God ſhould ſo farre abace
himſelfe in the perſon of his onely ſonne, that he ſhould beſeech vs?
Let vs fall to attonement, ſayth he. And what hath he done on hys
ſide? VVhat hath hee offended vs? Nay contrariwiſe, wee ceaſſe
not to prouoke him dayly agaynſt vs, and yet he commeth too ſay
vnto vs, I will fall too attonement with you, whereas notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
there is nothing but ſpitefulneſſe in vs, we be like little feends,
and to be ſhort, we bee damned and forlorne, and yet commeth he
to ſeeke vnto vs, and deſireth nothing but too haue th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> attonement
made. After that maner ſpeaketh Saint Paule woorde for woorde.
But nowe what will become of vs, if wee reiect ſuch grace, ſeing
that God offereth it, vs ſo freely? This is it which is ment by that
ſaying. And therevppon hee concludeth in the ende, <hi>that if wee
ſeeke rightuouſneſſe in the Lawe, Ieſus Chryſt dyed in vayne.</hi> As if hee
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:23060:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhoulde ſay, that if wee iutende to inioy the grace that is conteyned
in the Goſpell, wee muſte vtterly gyue ouer the fonde opinion of
our owne merites. For men are deceyued by bearing themſelues in
hand, that there is euer ſomwhat of value in them: and to be ſhort,
they cannot finde in their heartes to come as poore beggers before
God, but wyll alwayes bring ſome preſent with them. And
yet notwithſtanding all that euer wee thinke our ſelues too haue, is
but abhomination. Therefore Saint Paule ſheweth vs, that there
is none other meanes for vs too receyue lyfe at our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſtes hande, and too bee made partakers of his death and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and ſo to attaine too the heritage of heauen by his meanes,
than to be vtterly voyded of all the fooliſhe ouerweenings, which
the children of this world conceyue, when they imagin with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
ô as for mee, I haue ſome vertue in mee, I haue ſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe:
and to lay it all downe and caſt it quite away. For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
wee haue forgotten our owne deſertes, ſurely wee ſhall neuer
be able to conceyue the grace of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Do wee
then come vntoo him? Let vs come vtterly emptie. For if wee
make any countenaunce of hauing aught, it is nothing elſe but
winde. Truely whenſoeuer men are puffed vp with pryde: they
become ſo full that they are readie too burſt, howbeeit all of it is
but wynde. But yet howe ſo euer wee fare, that wynde holdeth
vs backe from receyuing the benefites that are purchaced and
brought vntoo vs by the Sonne of God, and which he communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to vs by his Goſpell. Thus ye ſee wherevnto the concluſion
tendeth which Saint Paule maketh heere. Now the Papiſtes will
graunt well inough that wee bee not able to purchaſe ſaluation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we bee helped by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: howbeeit they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
that men may halfe ſaue themſelues, and that looke what wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
is ſupplied by the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp;c ſo they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to haue a good &amp; auailable ſtartinghole. But in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo, they ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues deadly enimies of the grace of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, and vpholders of the cace and quarell of the falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and deceyuers that had corrupted, defloured, and falſfied the
pure truth in the Church of Galatia. For thoſe ſort of men coulde
well inough confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſt was the Sauour of the world,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and they would haue bin aſhamed too ſay that Ieſus Chriſt was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nay rather they profeſſed Chriſtianitie. And what deemed
they of Ieſus Chriſt? That he came too help mens infirmities, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were not able to diſcharge the lawe too the full, and that
for aſmuch as they could not haue ſo great and large perfection as
was requiſite, therefore it behoued them too bee helped by Ieſus
Chriſt: and euen as much doo the Papiſtes ſay at this day. But S.
Paule concludeth on the contrarie part, that then Ieſus Chriſt had
died in vayne. If any man replie, no not ſo: for there ſhould come
ſome frute of his death and paſsion, by helping vs too the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of our ſinnes: and although we haue meanes to ſatisfie God
withall, yet would not the ſame ſuffyze, vnleſſe Ieſus Chriſt ſhould
worke therewith. I ſay if any man make ſuch replie: let vs marke
that S. Paule hild this for a certaine and vndeceyuable principle,
that doo the beſt we can, there is nothing but curſedneſſe in vs, till
God haue receyued vs of his meere grace. Lo wherein the Papiſts
beguile themſelues, and not they onely: for it hath bin a common
errour among the Turkes and among all the Heathen men that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
were. The Turkes can confeſſe well ynough that they haue
neede of Gods mercie, &amp; that hath alwayes bin an opinion through
the whole world: but they haue intermingled their own ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with Gods grace, as if they ſhould ſay, although God be pitifull
towardes vs, yet muſte we procure fauour in his ſight by our owne
deſeruings. After that maner were the Heathen folke woont too
ſpeake. And what ſay the Papiſtes now adayes? All one thing. For
after they haue once graunted themſelues too be wretched ſinners,
and to haue neede to be ſuccored by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and that
his death and paſsion are auayleable to make them way vnto God:
they interlace their owne freewill, and their preparations, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
ſay that they deſerue on their ſide, and that although Ieſus
Chriſt help them, yet he dooth not all himſelfe. And in very deede
that is the flat doctrine of the Papiſtes woord for woord. For they
ſay wee cannot deſerue aught except Ieſus Chriſt go before vs and
ſhewe vs the way, for they ſay that he hath purchaced vs the firſte
grace, and that it lieth in vs to follow on and too attayne to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
And if a man aske them what is ment by that firſt grace they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:23060:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſay it is the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of meriting or deſeruing: for that is their terming
of it, and their maner of ſpeache. And this occaſion of meriting is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe with them, but that men are able of themſelues too binde
God too them by their owne ſatisfactions. But S. Paule telleth vs
that it is to outrageous, yea and too Diueliſh a trayterouſneſſe too
haue ſuch pride: and therefore he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould
haue died in vayne, if wee ſhould ſeeke rightuouſneſſe in the lawe.
VVill wee then poſſeſſe our Lord Ieſus Chriſt? It behoueth vs too
know wherefore wee come vnto him: namely bycauſe that by the
Lawe we are already condemned, curſed of God, cut off from hope
of life, and full of all corruption, ſo as God muſt be fayne too clenze
vs by his holy ſpirit, and for aſmuch as there are many infirmities in
vs, we muſt alwayes come to our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, and to confeſſe
that there is nothing in vs but all curſedneſſe and miſerie: wee
muſt needes come too this concluſion of S. Paules, that Chriſt had
died in vaine, if it behoued vs to obtayne rightuouſneſſe by the law,
whither it were wholly or partly. VVee muſt needes confeſſe that,
and the verieſt idiotes are able to perceyue it, in ſo much that if we
receyue not Ieſus Chriſt with that condition, it is certayne that his
comming ſhall profite vs nothing at all. It will be but as a winde to
blow vs away together, ſo as wee ſhall be no more able to take hold
of Gods mercie that is offered vs in Ieſus Chriſt. Now ſeyng it is ſo:
let vs learne to leaue ſuch maner of mingling, and acknowledge our
ſelues beholden too our Lord Ieſus Chriſte for all things: for when
we go about too interlace our owne merites with the free remiſsion
of our ſinnes, it is but a falſifying of Gods truth. Beſides this, when
we haue learned to reſt our ſelues after that maner vppon him: let
vs bee taken in loue with the ſpirituall benefites which he bringeth
vs, and let not the afflictions and aduerſities of this world hinder vs
from holding on our courſe, and from the ouer comming of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
and diſtreſſes, but that we may haue full ioy in the middes
of all our ſorrowes and troubles, aſſuring our ſelues that al that euer
wee can ſuffer in this world, is nothing in compariſon of that which
is prepared for vs in the kingdome of heauen. And that is the thing
whervnto S. Paule leadeth vs. For firſt of all he exhorteth vs to a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and well ruled lyfe, and to be lowly as becommeth vs, to giue our
<pb facs="tcp:23060:130"/>
ſelues wholly to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And ſecondly he exhorteth
vs to arme our ſelues with patience, that we may ouercome all the
aſſaultes and diſtreſſes that come vpon vs, and walke in ſuch wiſe in
this world, as we may alwayes go foreward to the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly heritage,
which we ſee not, and which paſſeth all our vnderſtanding, not ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
for all that to aſſure our ſelues of it, ſith we haue ſo good a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis
of it made vnto vs. And further ſeing we haue the earneſtpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie
and pledge of it giuen vnto vs in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: let the ſame
ſerue vs for a full aſſurance, to ſhew vs that wee neede not runne at
randon, but haue a perfect fayth &amp; a firme and ſubſtantiall hope, for
aſmuch as wee haue already in the perſone of the Sonne of God, a
full performance of all things that we can wiſh.</p>
            <p>But now let vs fall downe before the maieſtie of our good God,
with acknowledgement of our ſinnes, praying him to make vs feele
them more and more, and to touch vs in ſuch wiſe with true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
as the ſame may prouoke vs more and more to ſeeke forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and mercie at Gods hand, &amp; therewithall alſo to beſeech him
to gouerne vs ſo by his holy ſpirit, as we may be incoraged more &amp;
more to forſake all the luſtes of our owne fleſh, and all that is of our
old Adam, till we be come to the perfection wherevnto he allureth
vs, &amp; from which we be ſo farre off as yet. That it may pleaſe him to
graunt this grace not only to vs, but alſo to all people &amp;c.</p>

the whole doctrine of the Goſpell, God doth as
it were ſtretch out his armes to bring vs in vnto
him and to receyue vs in his fatherly loue: or rather (as he likeneth
himſelf by Moyſes) he is as a Hen that ſpreadeth out hir wings too

of ſuch our frowardneſſe, he had neede to vſe roughneſſe, and
to ſhewe vs our vnthankfulneſſe, too the end wee may learne to be
aſhamed of it. And that is the cauſe why S. Paule hauing ſhewed that
all our welfare lieth in Ieſus Chriſt, and that if wee will bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of his rightuouſneſſe and of the benefites that he is willing too
impart vntoo vs, we muſt vtterly renounce ourſelues, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that there is nothing but ſinne and corruption in vs: doth now
ſharply rebuke ſuch as would mingle their owne deuotions with the
grace that is offered them in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: for they had bin
inſtructed faithfully before. If S. Paule had begonne in ſome place
where men had neuer heard one woorde of the Goſpell afore, he
would not haue vſed ſuch roughneſſe: for he would haue pitied the
blinde and ignorant wretches. But for aſmuche as the Galathians
had bin taught faythfully by him, and he had taken paynes to treine
them too the Goſpell accordingly, and they therevppon had ſhrunk
backe and ſuffered themſelues too bee turmoyled with falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:
therfore is he ſo rough with them, according alſo as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſheweth, that the reaſon thereof was, for that <hi>Ieſus Christ had
bin crucified among them,</hi> and that they hauing ſeene the treaſures of
Gods infinite goodneſſe layd foorth after that maner before them,
had none excuze to returne againe to their pelting traſh, in hope to
bee iuſtified and too purchace ſaluation by the Ceremonies of the
Lawe. Thus ye ſee in effect that the thing which wee haue to gather
vpon this text, is that if wee deſire too find a pleaſant taſte in Gods
<pb facs="tcp:23060:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
woord,<note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> wee on our ſide muſte be teachable and not ſtubborne. For
we muſt call too minde howe it is written in the eighttenth Pſalme,
that God wil alwayes deale meeldly with ſuch as be of a meeld ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,<note place="margin">Pſ. 18. d. 26</note>
and that he will bee rough and ſharp towardes ſuch as vſe ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe,
and cannot abide to ſubmit themſelues vnto him. Al they
then which haue a necke of braſſe, and cannot finde in their heartes
too ſtoupe vnder the obedience of God, ſhall finde themſelues to
be matched with too ſtrong an aduerſarie, &amp; that they muſt needes
be broozed and broken in peeces if they will not bow. Furthermore
let vs marke that when God correcteth our vyces, wee muſte not
chafe and ſtorme as many doo, who do nothing elſe but gnaſh their
teeth when they bee rebuked, ſaying that they will not bee handled
after ſuch a faſhion, and that their nature requireth to be taught by
gentleneſſe: yea verely, but that their ſturdineſſe ſheweth the clean
contrarie. For they that ſpeake after that maner, would very fayne
bee flattered. And although they ouerſhoote themſelues into all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
yet will they not abide too haue their galled backes rubbed, but
rather that men ſhould winke at them and conceale their naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
But if their faultes bee layd afore them, by and by they rancle
agaynſt the Goſpell: and whereas they ſhewed ſome good ſigne of
zeale afore, they vtter ſuche ſpitefulneſſe afterwarde, as a man may
perceyue there was nothing but venim and bitterneſſe in their hart,
and it is a ſure token that ſuch folke neuer wiſt what it is too profite
in Gods ſchoole, at leaſtwize purely, as S. Paule ſayeth in another
place.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. d. 16.</note> Gods woord (ſayeth he) is good, not only to teach, to the end
we may know what is for our behoofe, and bee able to diſcerne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
good and euill: but alſo to rebuke and correct vs. For there
are many negligent folke, which haue neede to be pricked foreward

how all of vs muſt ſuffer patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly when our Lord vſeth ſuch rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
acknowledging the ſame to be greatly to our behoof. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
let euery of vs examine his life well, and there is none of vs but
he ſhall finde that he prouoketh God too vſe ſuche ſharpeneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes

               </gap>eude and froward,
he ſhall bee prouoked after ſuche a faſhion, that he ſhall as it were
chaunge his nature, bycauſe he knoweth not at what end too begin
with them, and is fayne after a ſort too transforme himſelfe. Euen
ſo is it with vs. For we haue a father which in goodneſſe ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
all that can bee ſeene among men: but we on our ſide (as I ſayd
afore) in ſteede of yeelding obediently vnto him as we ought to do,
and in ſteede of offering our ſelues redily to walke as he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
ſo ſoone as he doth but ſpeake the woord: do nothing but ſtray.
VVe haue our luſtes alwayes inordinate and boyling, wee haue our
replies alwayes readie coyned: and although our mouth ſpeake not,
yet it appeereth that there is no ſuch calmneſſe in our hartes, as too
be contented to ſubmit our ſelues to God as we ought to do. Seyng
then that we be conuicted to our faces by experience, that God had
neede to be ſo rough and ſharp towardes vs: let vs ſuffer him to do
whatſoeuer he knoweth too be for our welfare. And no doubt but
the Galathians were as nyce as wee, and had as itching eares as wee
haue: and yet were they fayne too be rebuked ſo ſharply by reaſon
of their vnthankfulneſſe. As for S. Paule, we know he indeuered by
all humilitie and meeldneſſe, too drawe all ſuch to the obedience of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as were committed and appoynted too his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip.
He likeneth himſelf (and not without cauſe) too a nurce,
which will beare with hir nurſe childe, and not ſpare any thing too
ſhew the loue that ſhee beareth it. VVee ſhall ſee hereafter that he
will ſay,<note place="margin">Hereafter. 4. b. 12.</note> Be yee as I am, for I am as you bee. I ſeeke nothing but too
faſhion my ſelfe vnto you, and to bring to paſſe that wee may agree
in one. And yet notwithſtanding, neceſsitie hath conſtreyned him
too crie out as you heare now, <hi>Yee vnwize, yee fooles, yee vndiſcreete</hi>
or witleſſe as beaſts, <hi>who hath bewitched you after that ſorte? muſt you
not needes bee poſſeſſed with the Diuell?</hi> Here are very harde woordes,
and no doubt but the Galathians were greeued at them at the firſte
ſight. Yet neuertheleſſe it was meete for them to feele, that S. Paule
vſed not that maner of ſpeach and language without cauſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whenſoeuer we bee rebuked, let vs blame our owne faultes for
it, and yeeld our ſelues giltie: for wee ſhall gayne nothing by chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
againe. VVhen we haue diſputed what we can, wee may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
<pb facs="tcp:23060:132" rendition="simple:additions"/>
iuſtifie our cace afore men: but wee ſhall alwayes be giltie
before God. Moreouer it behoueth vs too marke well the reaſon
that is added heere by S. Paule, when he ſayeth, <hi>yee muste needes bee
bewitched, if yee obey not the truth, ſeyng that our Lorde Ieſus Christe
hath bin as it were peynted out liuely before you, yea and euen crucified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you.</hi> In ſpeaking after that faſhion, S. Paule ſheweth with
what force and effectualneſſe he had preached the Goſpell. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he likneth the doctrine which he had brought, vnto a picture: &amp;
therevnto inlargeth it yet better, ſaying that the matter which hee
had preached among the Galathians, ought too auayle aſmuch as if
they had ſeene the Sonne of God crucified among them, and his
bloud ſheaded out for the ſpirituall waſhing of their ſoules. For ſo
much then as they had bin taught ſo faythfully, they could no more
excuſe themſelues of their backeſliding. But firſt of all we ſee here
whiche is the true maner of preaching the Goſpell: namely to giue
knowledge of Gods loue towardes vs, in that he ſpared not his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sonne, but gaue him too the death for vs: according as in very
deede all the treaſures of wiſedome and vnderſtanding are layed vp
in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Coloſs. 2. b. 9.</note> as it is ſayd in another place too the Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.
Sith it is ſo, if we bee deſirous to profite well in the Goſpell,
lette vs learne too acknowledge the grace that is purchaced for vs
by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte: for without that, all that wee haue is
nothing. Many will brag that they bee well learned in Gods word:
but the true triall too knowe whither it bee ſo or no, is if wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
howe greate neede wee haue, that God ſhoulde poure out
his mercie vpon vs, too ſuccour vs by drawing vs out of the gulf of
Hell, and therevpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that wee cannot be clenzed and waſhed
from any of all our ſpottes, but by the bloud of Gods ſonne nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
rightuouſneſſe but by the obedience that he hath yeelded: nor
haue any ſatisfaction for vs but by the ſacrifize that he hath offered:
nor come in Gods fauour but by his meanes: nor open our mouthes
too call vppon him but by his interceſsion. Therefore when wee
bee throughly perſuaded of the gracious benefites that are brought
vs by the ſonne of God: then may wee ſay wee haue ſome vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in the Goſpell: but without that, wee haue nothing but
imagination and follie. Marke that for one poynt. And therewith
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:23060:132"/>
let vs marke, that it is not ynough for vs too know ſlightly that our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath bought vs ſo deerely: but that we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ſtill in the doctrine of the Goſpell, till it bee throughly prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in our hartes, as though his bloud guſhed downe, too apply the
frute that commeth of it too our vſe: and that is too the end to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vs out of our drowſineſſe. For we ſhal ſee many that take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
too bee very great Clerkes, if they vnderſtande but three
or foure woordes of the Goſpell at a glaunce. And yet the ſame
ſhall ſoone bee defaced and put out of rememberance, bycauſe that
whereas wee ought too ſeeke too bee filled with the benefites that
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath brought vs, they holde themſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with a taſt of them. God then puniſheth the vnthankfulneſſe
of ſuch folke, and their deſpizing of his goodneſſe. And therfore it
ſtandeth vs ſo much the more on hand, to put forth &amp; apply all our
indeuer to be well ſettled in the foreſayd doctrine, that is too wit, of
knowing whervnto the death and paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods ſonne, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable
benefites which we haue receyued, do auayle vs. Again on
the other ſide we be warned, that our ſins are the heynouſer before
God, if after wee haue bin taught his will, wee turne head backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and ſin, not through ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but through contempt and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.
For if we ſhake off his yoke, it is a ſure proofe that wee bee
loth to be ſubiect to him, and play the wilde beaſts. True it is that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the ignoranteſt folk in the world are reproued by their own ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
for aſmuch as hypocriſie reigneth in all men: but yet if co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
bee made betweene thoſe that neuer heard one woord of the
truth, and vs that haue our eares beaten with it, and are prouoked
without end or ceaſsing to come vntoo God: wee bee muche more
faultie than they. Beholde, the Turkes beleeue that they woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the God that made heauen and earth: how beit for aſmuch as
they refuze our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, they haue but an Idoll. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
alſo are deceyued in theyr fond deuotions. And yet for all
that, they bee not a whit the leſſe giltie before God. But what for
that? If wee that knowe the way of ſaluation, whiche heare Gods

the ſunne of rightuouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Mala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:23060:133"/>
good and euill: muſt it not needes bee that we are (as ye would ſay)
bewitched? For ſeing that God is ſo gratious vntoo vs, as too come
to vs and to teach vs ſo familiarly: ſurely he hath iuſt cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne
of vs as he alſo dothe: My people (ſayeth he by his Prophet

God pleade agaynſt vs, and charge vs with all the meanes whiche he
hath giuen vs to make vs wholly his, that he might inioy vs without

to bow downe our neckes to receyue his yoke, or elſe be ficklemin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and fleeting too forſake all agayne too day or too morrow, and

to bee guyded by the truth which is certaine: muſt it not needes be
that we are as monſters, that is to ſay folke, that make vtter defiance
too nature? Therfore let vs learne to looke better vpon our ſelues
heere: for looke what was once ſayd too the Galathians, is ſpoken
ſtill at this day vntoo vs. For it was not for that peoples ſake alone
that S. Paule wrate: but the holy Ghoſt quickeneth vs vp ſtill now,
and telleth vs that if wee haue once receyued the doctrine of the
Goſpell, and afterward ſtart away from it, ſo as if a man trace vs he
ſhall find no conſtancie nor ſtedineſſe of fayth in vs: we be ſo much
the more damnable, and cannot ſheeld our ſelues with any thing: for
when we ſhall haue taken all the couerts in the world, we ſhall abide
conuicted of ſuch leudneſſe, as in the end we muſt needes haue our
mouthes ſtopped, and God muſte ſet vs foorth as an example of all
vnthankfulneſſe, in ſomuch that wee ſhall become odious both too
men and Angels,<note place="margin">Math. 13. c. 19.</note> bicauſe we made no better account of the doctrine
of ſaluation, which is ſo precious a ſeede as wee ſee that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſpeaketh of it. Yee ſee then that the thing which we haue too
beare in minde, is not that the onely Galathians are rebuked heere
by S. Paule, but that we be taught in their perſones, to walke in feare
and awe when God ſhall haue bin ſo gracious too vs, as too call vs
vnto him, and too ſhewe vs what his will is. And it is not for nought
that he vſeth ſo ſharp and rigorous woordes, as too call them <hi>fooles
and witleſſe,</hi> and conſequently too ſay, <hi>who hath bewitched you?</hi> But
we heare how that in the fourth too the Epheſians,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. c. 14</note> concerning the
vſing of the Goſpell, he ſayeth that when wee haue once bin taught
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:23060:133"/>
it, we muſt not be as little babes that are led too and fro, and made
to beleeue that the Crow is white: but we muſt be ſo ſettled in it,
that although the Diuell ſtirre vp neuer ſo many troubles, falſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
and lies, yet we may ſtill hold our owne, and keepe on our
pace, aſſuring ourſelues that Gods truth is infallible. Thus ye ſee
that the end whereto the Goſpell ought to ſerue vs, is not only to
ſhew vs what is good for vs, but alſo to arme and fence vs agaynſt
all incounters, and againſt all Satans ſlights, ſo that if there riſe vp
any hereſies or other corruptions, we may ſtill mainteine the battel
valiantly, and get the vpper hand by our faith, and not be pyped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more into the fowlers ſnare, according to the ſimilitude whych
S. Paule vſeth. Now then ſeing it is ſo: it muſt needes be that we be
bewitched and poſſeſſed with the Diuell, if ſuche a remedie ſuffiſe
vs not, after that God hath manifeſted himſelfe vnto vs, and wee
knowe (yea euen fully and aſſuredly) that it is he which ſpeaketh.
If we be not moued by his authoritie, what will become of it? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
whereas we haue our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhyning vpon vs as
it were at high none days: muſt it not needes be that we are at defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with nature as I ſayde afore, if wee ſeeke heere and there for
by ways, when the right way is layd before our eyes? So then it is
not without cauſe that Sainct Paule ſpeaketh ſo roughly too that
people, which had chaunged the doctrine, after that God had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them the grace to haue his truth ſhewd vnto them. But we muſt
call to mind alſo, how God vpbraideth his people of olde tyme
by hys Prophet Ieremy.<note place="margin">Iere. 2. c. 10.</note> Go your wayes ouer the ſea (ſaythe hee)

worſhip his owne Idolls without chaunging. And wherefore
then are you ſo variable? As for thoſe, they know not wherevppon
they be grounded. They haue but a certayne opinion, which carieth
them away and beguileth them: and yet notwithſtanding they hold
on ſtill without turning aſide, and ſticke wholly to it: and why then
ſhould you which know what God ye obey, be ſo fleeting? Nowe
therfore let vs marke well, that if we be lightly turned and thruſt
aſide from the doctrine of the Goſpel: there ſhall neede none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

which follow their owne ſuperſtitions: for we ſee they be wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:23060:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to them. Looke vpon the Turkes and Painims, looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
Iewes and Papiſts. They wote not what God they worſhip, they
haue but a weening in ſted of fayth: and yet not withſtanding a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
cannot plucke them from theyr falſe fancies, and they bee ſo giuen
vnto them as a man can neuer remoue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then if wee on our ſide
knowing that it is the liuing God which calleth &amp; teacheth vs day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and that the thing which is vttered by men commeth of him and
of his holy ſpirit, and hauing record of the law &amp; the Goſpel which
cannot fayle, if we (I ſay) hauing ſuch a reſting ſtock for our faith, be
afterward vnconſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſo as our eares itch to receiue euery new toy,
and men make vs to alter our mind in leſſe than the turning of a
hand, what elſe betokeneth it, but that we wilfully refuſe Goddes
grace, as if we wold ſhet the gate againſt him that he might not com
in vnto vs? Or elſe, if after we haue once knowen, that he offereth
vs ſo in eſtimable a benefite in his Goſpell, wee caſt it downe and
trample it vnder our feete: thinke we that God wil ſuffer his grace
too be ſo lightly eſteemed and hild skorne of? No. For wee cannot
deſpiſe the doctrine of the Goſpel, but we muſt vnhalow the bloud
of Gods ſonne, which he did ſhead for our redemption: for the one
cannot bee ſeparated from the other. VVhenſoeuer and how often
ſoeuer God ſpeaketh to vs, and offereth vs forgiueneſſe of oure
ſinnes, ſhewing himſelfe readie to receiue vs to mercie: ſo often is
the bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte ſprinkled vpon vs. All the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
in the world cannot do vs any good, except our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt be with it, to apply the ſheading of his bloud vnto vs. And if
we deſpiſe the doctrine of the Goſpel, it is all one as if wee did ſpit
at the holy bloud of Goddes ſonne, which thing is an intolerable
trayterouſneſſe. Therfore let vs looke narowlier to our ſelues, and
wey wel this text, to the intent we ſtand ſtedfaſt: and for aſmuch as
God hath called vs to ſo great a good turne, and we do now know
that is not by haphazard that the Goſpel hath bin preached, but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was Gods will to vtter the infinite riches of his goodneſſe
towardes vs: let vs ſtand in it, and ſo ſticke too it, as nothing may
thruſt vs from it, nor by any meanes euer ſhake vs down. Lo in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
what we haue to beare away in this text. Moreouer we be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
alſo, which are the true pictures or peintings to leade vs too
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:23060:134"/>
God. The Papiſts ſay we muſt haue rememberances to teache vs,
and that images are the bookes of the vnlearned which are not apt
to conceiue higher doctrine: but hath Sainct Paule ſpoken heere
but to three or four folke? No: It is generally, and to all Chriſtians
without exception, as well to great as ſmall, that he ſayth that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the Goſpell is preached, then Ieſus Chriſt is peinted out liuely, and
we muſt looke vpon him, not with the fleſhly eyes of our bodyes,
but with the ſpirituall eyes of our faith. Then ſeeing it is ſo, let vs
learne that we haue no neede of Images and puppets to teach vs
what is neceſſarie for our ſaluation, nother neede wee a peece of
wood, ſtone or other ſuche pelting ſtuffe, too put vs in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance
of God, (for in all thoſe things there is nothing but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and leaſing:) but we haue neede to haue Gods word preached,
and to indeuer and trauell to make the ſame familiar too vs, that
wee may there beholde God in his liuely image, that is to ſaye in
the perſon of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt his only ſonne,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. a. 3.</note> according alſo
as Sainct Paule ſayeth in the ſecond too the Corinthians, where
he proteſteth that the doctrine which he brought vntoo them, was
not hidden from anie but the vnbeleeuers, ſuche as periſh, whome
the Diuell poſſeſſeth, and which haue their eyes ſealed vp. And no
wonder though they ſee not awhit in the open light. But yet in the
meane while the doctrine is ſo manifeſt vntoo vs, as we may eaſly
perceyue Gods will. For he ſheweth vs it familiarly ynough as oft
as the Goſpell is preached, in ſomuch that wee neede not to make
much running vp and downe,<note place="margin">Deute. 30. c. 12.</note> not too fetch farre wyndlaſſes: wee
neede no more to ſay, who ſhall ſtie vp aboue the Cloudes? who
ſhall go beyond ſea? who ſhall go downe intoo the deepe? Haue
we Gods word? at leaſtwiſe haue wee it preached purely? Then
is Ieſus Chriſt as it it were in the middes of vs, and ſheweth himſelf
as it were hanging vppon the Croſſe, witneſsing what hee dyd
for vs, when he ſuffered death to reconcyle vs to God his father.
There hee ſetteth vs downe a ſure and vndeceyuable pledge
or warrant, and let vs content our ſelues with it. For when we
haue pleaded neuer ſo muche, it will not excuſe vs: oure cace
wyll alwayes go againſte vs, if wee bee not well aſſured in oure
conſciences, that wee haue whollye leaned vntoo Goddes
<pb facs="tcp:23060:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
word, which (as I ſayd) bringeth vs ſo neere vnto God, that it is
the very vnion itſelfe, whiche we haue with him in the perſon of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And in good ſooth, we ſee how God dothe
as it were ſtoup to our rudeneſſe and infirmitie. For doth he ſpeak
in ſo loftie and darke a ſtile as we can vnderſtand nothing? No: but
contrariwiſe he abaceth hymſelfe, and therto thinkes it not ynough
to haue ſpoken, but alſo addeth Sacramentes to his worde, whyche
are the true pictures that we ought to haue. Like as when we ſee
the water of baptim, it is a picture which ſheweth vs that we be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ull
of filth and vncleanneſſe, till we be waſhed: and by whome? VVe
muſt ſeeke our waſhing from aboue. Beſides this, it ſheweth vs that
we muſt be renued by the holy Ghoſt of God. That then is a good
picture. And why? Bycauſe it beareth Gods marke, and is matched
wyth hys worde. As much is to bee ſayde of the Lordes ſupper.
VVhen we ſee the morſells of bread and the droppes of wyne.
Very well, they bee the Creatures whereof wee haue bin wont
too take nurriſhmeute and ſuſtenaunce for our bodies: but the
ſame do leade vs to the lyfe of our ſoules, and gyue vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that we haue no lyfe but in our Lorde Ieſus Chryſte. And
the cauſe why the wyne is added, is to ſhew that he hath ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in him, as we neede not to ſeeke any part of the thynges that
we want, any otherwhere: but that he ſerueth vs for meate and
drinke and all. Theſe (I ſay) are the good images that God hath ſet
afore vs: and now if we bee ſtill ſoring in the aire, and gadding after
our owne luſts, to ſay I would fayne haue more: it is a diſdeyning
of the grace that is offered vs. So much the more therefore doth it
ſtande vs on hand to marke well this ſtreine, where Sainct Paule
by the poewr and in the name of God condemneth, yea and with
the power of the holy Ghoſt thundereth, againſt all ſuche as haue
bin taught the Goſpell faithfully, and afterward do turne aſide and
ſlip away from it. And therevpon he addeth, that he woulde fayne
haue it knowen by what meane the holy Ghoſt is receyued. For if
they had receiued the holy Ghoſt by the works of the law: Sainct
Paule would haue graunted that there was ſome righteouſneſſe
to be had by it. But foraſmuch as they had receiued him by the
Goſpell: it muſt needes be concluded, that they ought to haue
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:23060:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reſted vppon the record that God gaue them ſo apparantly. And
for the better vnderſtanding of the thing that he meant too ſaye
heere: let vs marke that Gods ſpirit is giuen in common to all the
faithfull, for ſomuch as they be regenerated and made new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Beſides this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there are ſpiritual gifts, which God deſtributeth
according to ſuch meaſure and portion as hee thinketh good, but
yet they redound all to the common welfare of the Church. If we
bee Chriſtians, we muſt needes haue Gods ſpirit, as wee ſhall ſee
heereafter.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. d. 22.</note> For hee is called the earneſtpenny, and the Seale
of the heritage that is promiſed vs,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. c. 14</note> and whyche wee looke for.
Yee ſee then that Gods ſpirit muſt dwell in vs, if wee bee hys chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
But beſides this, there are alſo gracious giftes: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
there was in olde time the gift of Tungs, the gyfte of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying,
the gift of healing, and ſuche other lyke. And euen
ſtill at thys day, God ſheweth well that hee hath not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forſaken hys Church. For although viſible gyftes reygne not
now as they did then: yet notwithſtanding we may ſee ſtill, that
God doth by ſome meane or other vtter his operation among vs.
Furthermore Sainct Paule ſpeaketh heere to all men. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(according to the common and ordinarie meening of it) wee
wil take this word Spirit, for the renewme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which God worketh in
his children,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. a. 6.</note> as it is ſayd in the third Chapter of Sainct Iohn. For
in aſmuch as we be borne of fleſh, there is nothing in vs but vtter
corruption, and we tend always towards the earth. No doubt but
men glory in their owne wiſdome, and moreouer thinke that they
haue a free choyce and will of their owne, to take the good and
[leaue] the euil, but thoſe are but dreames. For it is certayne that
ſo long as we bee let alone in our owne nature, wee tende
euermore vntoo euill, and the ſcripture alſo condemneth vs of
it,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. a. 5.</note> ſaying that there is not any thought conceyued in mannes
mynde,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. b. 7</note> but the ſame is leawd, and all our affections are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
and rebells againſt God. Therefore let vs not beguile our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
any more with vayne flatteries, but acknowledge ourſelues
too be vtterly marred in Adam, ſo as there is nothing but ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in vs. Notwithſtanding, God prouideth for that miſcheefe,
when he toucheth vs too the quicke by hys holy ſpirite, and ſo
<pb facs="tcp:23060:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
purgeth our harts as we deſire to obey him, and although we bee
not ſo perfect as were requiſite, yet we fight againſt ourſelues, and
go forward ſtill to goodneſſe. And ſurely when Gods ſpirit is as a
bridle to vs to hold vs backe in his obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, it is a ſure token that
God dwelleth in vs, and gouerneth vs as his flocke, and holdeth
vs for his children. For we cannot bee counted Chriſtians, without
this record, that God warranteth himſelfe to bee our father, and
that his holy ſpirit is as a ſeale thereof, according as I haue already
alledged the record of Sainct Paule,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 14.</note> out of the firſt to the Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
And now he ſayth, <hi>that the Galathians had receyued the ſpirite of
God by the preaching of the Goſpell.</hi> Then ſeeing it is ſo, it was for too
be concluded, that the workes of the law could not iuſtifye them.
And why? For we muſt always come backe to thys principle which
we haue treated of, namely that in the Goſpell we be vtterly ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
out of all the goodneſſe and vertue whiche we thought our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to haue, and that God doth vs ſuch ſhame, as we be fayne
to come to him as quite confounded. For although God ſet oure
curſedneſſe afore vs in the law: yet we perceiue it not ſo well there,
as in the Goſpell. And we ſee how the hipocrites do always flatter
themſelues, and thinke too performe the thynges that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
them. But in the Goſpell there are two things. For God
ſheweth that there is nothing in vs but pouertie, ſo as we muſt bee
fayne to come to begge his grace, with vtter acknowledgement of
our baceneſſe, how that we haue done amiſſe, and haue not one
ſparke of vertue in vs woorthy of commendation. Now then, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is ſo, Sainct Paule doth not without cauſe tell vs heere, that
ſuch as receiue Gods ſpirit by the preaching of the Goſpell, muſt
be voyd of all truſt in their owne merites, and acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
beholden all wholly to Gods meere and free mercie for
their whole ſaluation. And why ſo? For they be thinges that can no
more match togither than fyre and water, that we ſhould be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed
by the Goſpell, and alſo iuſtifyed by the law. VVhat then? Is
the Goſpell contrary to the law? No: for (as I haue declared alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)
God is author as well of the one as of the other, and there is
no contrariworking in hym, but the queſtion heere concerneth
the cace of our ſaluation. God hath gyuen men hys lawe too
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:23060:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhewe them the way too lyue well, and thereby intended to bring
them to ſuche condemnation, as if hee ſhoulde preferre an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement
agaynſt them, and put a halter about theyr neckes: For
truly in the law we ſee nothing but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hell gaping open vppon vs,
that Gods vengeance is ready afore hand to incounter vs, and that
he is armed againſt vs as our enimie. Thoſe are the thynges whych
the law ſetteth afore vs. But now is the Goſpell gyuen vs for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
to the end that when we be ſo in deſpaire, we ſhould flee to
the grace that is offered vs in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that there is none other way [to do vs good] than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe
of our ſinnes, whereby God doth ſo put away and wype
out our offences, as they come no more to account before him.
The thing then wherein our righteouſneſſe conſiſteth, is that hee
burdeneth vs not any more with the euil that is in vs. And althogh
we ſee Gods intent and determination to be ſuch, both in the law
and in the Goſpell: yet are we ſure that there is no contrarietie in
it. Beſydes this alſo, if we be not iuſtifyed by the Goſpell, howe
can wee attayne ſaluation by the lawe? It is true that the lawe
is a preparatiue too bryng vs to the Goſpell: for ſo long as men
bee puffed vp wyth pryde, Gods grace hath no enterance intoo
them. If a veſſell be full of wind, let a man labour to put what li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
hee will into it, and he ſhall not get it in, bycauſe the wynde
beateth it backe, and hindereth the putting of it in. And we may
perceyue it euen in mannes body: for we muſt bee fayne too take
ſimilitudes of worldly things too leade vs to higher thinges. If a
man be hungrie, and yet notwithſtanding haue hys ſtomacke ſo
puffed vp as it cannot abide any thyng: hee may well bee full: but
what for that? All is but wind, he hath neuer the more nurriſhment
within for all that, but rather the wind hindereth the entering in of
any, good ſuſtenance to nurriſh and mainteine him. Euen ſo is it
with the fooliſh preſumpteouſneſſe that is in vs. VVe beare our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in hand, that we be well furniſhed with all thinges that wee
haue neede of: howbeit, that is but wind howſoeuer we fare, and
that wynd ſhetteth out Gods grace fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> entering in. But by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
our Lord bringeth vs low, &amp; ſheweth vs our wretchednes. And
therefore it behoueth vs to come to it with a conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that our
<pb facs="tcp:23060:137"/>
Lord Ieſus Chriſt is ſet foorth vnto vs there, to the end that we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there is not one drop of goodneſſe in vs, ſhould ſeeke it in
him, yea euen al wholy and not by peeces. Thus then ye ſee why
S. Paule reaſoneth, that for aſmuch as we haue receiued Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
by meanes of the Goſpell, it behoueth vs to hold vs therevnto,
and not go to the Ceremonies of the law, nor to any other thyng
one or other, but be contented with that perfection, ſeing it is gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs and we may enioy it without geinſaying. For although thys
matter was written to the Galathians: yet is it common to vs alſo
at this day, as well as to them. Let vs marke (I ſay) how our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt wrought in vs. And firſt of all let vs practiſe that which
is ſhewed vs in the ſecond to the Corinthians:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. d. 18.</note> whiche is, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth
vs to be wholly new faſhioned againe, and to haue Goddes
ſpirit dwelling in vs. So then the true marke whereby we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
whither we bee Gods children or no, is Gods ſpirit. But
bring we that ſpirit with vs from our mothers womb? Alas no. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commeth it any whit the more by our owne deſeruings, as I
haue told you already: but bycauſe it pleaſeth God of his graciouſe
goodneſſe to giue vs it, thereby to draw vs to him. If we haue any
deſire or willingneſſe to walke in the feare of our God, or if wee
would fayne be able to call vpon him with a pure conſcience: it is a
token that Gods ſpirit dwelleth in vs. VVe neede not to ſeeke any
other witneſſe, nor to make any longer ſcanning of the matter.
But nowe, haue wee gotten and obteyned this ſpirit by our owne
merites? No ſurely. Then muſt we needes conclude, that ſeeyng
wee haue it of gyft, it was gyuen vs by meanes of the Goſpell.
For in the Goſpell God vttereth hys myghtye power and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
too the ſaluation of men, as it is ſayde in the firſte too
the Romanes.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. b. 16</note> Now if the Goſpell bee the inſtrumente whereby
we receyue Goddes ſpirite, ſhall we go ſeeke other meanes?
VVere not that a renouncing of the power whyche is apparantly
knowen too vs? It is all one as if we would wilfully leaue the
way that is ſhewed vs of our God, too ſeeke bywayes after
our owne fancie. And if the Galathians were without excuce
for theyr turning away from the Goſpell too the lawe: what
ſhall wee bee in theſe dayes, if wee will needes bee wrapped
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:23060:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the ſuperſtitions that men haue forged in their owne ſhoppes?
As for example, the Papiſtes thinke too bee iuſtified, not by the
Ceremonies that God had commaunded in olde time, but by the
dotages and gewgawes that they them ſelues haue deuiſed. For as
for the thing whiche they doo nowe a dayes terme Gods ſeruice,
what elſe is it than a certayne hotchpotche, whereinto euery man
hath caſt his owne peece and collop? Seeing then that the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
ſtandeth ſo, it is not a deſpiſing of God, and a withdrawing of our
ſelues from him, by reiecting of his grace, too the ende he ſhoulde
not haue any acceſſe at all vnto vs, when wee will needes mingle
mens inuentions with the pureneſſe of the Goſpell? Muſt we not
needes be worſe than mad in ſo dooing? Then let vs know at one
worde, that wee can not bee Chriſtians, but the holy Ghoſt muſte
holde vs in ſuch humilitie, as to make vs confeſſe, that al our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
commeth of Gods meere grace, and ſo cleaue to our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, as wee not onely take him for a peece or portion of our
truſt, but bee fully ſatiſfied with him as hauing drawne of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
aſſuring our ſelues that he is the full perfection, not only of
all wiſedome, but alſo of all righteouſneſſe and happineſſe, &amp; that
in him lieth and conſiſteth all our welfare, which welfare wee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
when wee haue the Goſpell and the preaching of faythe,
and when wee be caſt downe in our ſelues, and vtterly bereft of all
preſumpteouſneſſe, which keepeth vs backe from comming vnto
God. Furthermore let vs be ſo rauiſhed, ſeeing that our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt hath ſo bountifully giuen vs all that was requiſite for our
ſaluation, I ſay let vs bee ſo rauiſhed with it, as all things elſe that
can be layde before vs, may be but as ſmoke too vs, and we vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſpiſe and abhorre them, too ſhewe how well we haue profited
in the Goſpell, and therewithall bee ſo conſtant and ſtedfaſt in our
ſelues, as neuer to bee thruſt out of the way, whatſoeuer the diuell
whiſper in oure care. And moreouer, for as muche as wee bee
ſo weake, groſſe and heauie, that although God doo daily prouoke
euery of vs to come vnto him, wee come but as it were halting and
creeping: let vs inforce our ſelues more and more to beſeech God
too ſtrengthen vs with his holy ſpirite, and too make vs profite

therein wee ſee howe he voutſafeth right well (as yee would ſay)
too make him ſelfe lowe, too the ende wee ſhoulde not haue any
excuſe, to ſay wee were not able to mount vp to ſuche a heighth.
But howe ſoeuer the cace ſtande, if wee looke well vpon the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
wee ſhall finde that the marke whereat it ameth, is to bereeue
vs of our ſelues, and of all that belongeth too our fleſh, to the ende
wee ſhould come vnto him. But on the contrarie ſide, men abuſe
the fauour that God ſheweth them in ſetting ſuche viſible ſignes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, by bearing them ſelues in hande, that the whole perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their holyneſſe is to bee founde there, and that that is the
thing whervnto they muſt hold them. And the ſame is not a vyce
of two dayes or yeſterdays breeding: but it hath reigned from the
beginning of the world, and continueth yet ſtill, and (which worſe
is) men thinke it not inough to ouerthrow the thing that God had
ſet vp to draw them vnto him: but they doo alſo forge and frame
many hinderances to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues aloofe from him. This would
be darke if it were not declared by example. God had in his lawe
ordeyned Sacrifices, ſhadowes, and figures for a time: yet did he
it not for any pleaſure that he had in thoſe bare things: but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the rudeneſſe of the people (who were as then like little
children) whom he ment to trayne ſtill forwarde too a ſpirituall
ſeruice, by meanes agreeable too their rawneſſe. That is the cauſe
why the Ceremonies of the Lawe are ſaide to be as it were fleſhly.
For why? God intended too teache his people groſly too come
thither as they ought to doo. But howe ſoeuer they fared, the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
that was ſhewed vnto Moyſes in the mount was heauenly.
Then were there two things in all the Ceremonies of the Lawe.
For when men waſhed them ſelues at their entring into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when they offered the Sacrifices, when they vſed lightes and
perfumes, and when the Prieſt clothed him ſelfe with his ſpeciall
apparell: all thoſe things (as in reſpecte of the outwarde ſhewe)
<pb facs="tcp:23060:139"/>
might well bee called fleſhly and temporall: but (as in reſpecte of
their ende) they were ſpirituall. But what did the Iewes? They ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
vpon the figures, without conſidering wherfore God had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
them, and bare them ſelues in hand, that they had very well
diſcharged their duetie, in comming to Churche, and in dooing the
things that were commaunded them outwardly. But truely they
diſguiſed God after their owne fancie, as he himſelfe mocketh
them for it by his Prophets,<note place="margin">Eſa. 66. a. 1</note> ſaying that he dwelleth not in houſes
made with mens hands, and that the very heauen is not able too
comprehende his maieſtie, which is infinite. Furthermore the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
at this day, thinking it not inough to abuſe the things that are
conteyned in Gods lawe, haue ſo put too peece after peece, as
there is none end at al of their follie: and yet notwithſtanding they
intitle them to bee the ſeruice of God. But whatſoeuer they ſaye,
they bee nothing elſe than ingling trickes and masking toyes.
But nowe let vs come to that which is ſpoken heere. S. Paule com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth
the ſpirite with the fleſhe. VVhat meaneth he by the ſpirite?
All the doctrine which God ſetteth foorth too vs in his Goſpell.
For there is a ſpirituall guyding, ſo as wee bee no more hilde vnder
the olde ſhadowes as the Iewes were. Yee ſee then that God in
theſe dayes reuealeth him ſelfe fully vnto vs, and hauing beaten
downe and diſanulled all the ſhadowes of the Lawe, ſheweth vs
that he will haue vs to come right foorth vnto him, and not haue
any thing remayne to hold vs backe heere beneath any more. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the lawe onely the Prieſt preaced neere vnto God, and all the
people kepte them ſelues a farre off. But wee haue our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, who is our Prieſt, by whome the waye is opened vs in
his bloud, to make vs to come vnto God his father, as the Apoſtle
ſpeaketh of him in the Epiſtle to the Hebrues.<note place="margin">Heb. 9. c. 11</note> Then if wee receiue
the Goſpell as it becommeth vs, God will deale with vs after ſuch
ſorte, as if wee were meete to come neere vnto him, and will leaue
all the things whiche he had ordeyned in olde time for ſuche as
were more rude and groſſe. Thus yee ſee why S. Paule vpbray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the Galathians with their beginning in the ſpirite, that is too
ſay, for that they had had the doctrine of the Goſpell, whiche had
ſhewed them the things that had bin hidden from the Iewes, or at
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:23060:139" rendition="simple:additions"/>
leaſtwiſe had bin ſhewed them but aloofe vnder darke ſhadowes.
Therevpon he vpbraydeth them, that they intended too ende in
the fleſhe, that is too ſay, with theſe lower things. And it is all one
as if he had ſayde, God hath beene ſo gracious too you, as to haue
taught you his will out of hande, and you will needes be hilde ſtill
in your Apſie, and in your firſt principles. He hathe giuen you a
highe and perfect knowledge, whereby yee haue perceyued the
ineſtimable loue which he beareth you in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt:
and will you nowe returne agayne too your Apſie, and forget the
things that haue bin taught you? VVere not that a peruerting of
all order, and a putting away of the grace that he had offered you?
But we know that naturally when men intend to learne any thing
they begin at the ſmalleſt poynts, and afterwarde in all crafts and
all trades, proceede by little and little through experience. For if
a man ſhould teache a childe highe ſciences, without teaching him
firſt his Apſie, and to write and reade, and afterwarde his grammer
to guide him foorthe by degrees: what a thing were it? Agayne,
when a childe is well forwarde, and come to mans age, if he ſhould
bee ſet backe agayne too his Apſie after he hathe well profited: it
would bee a playne mockerie. In like wyſe is it with handicraftes.
For it is well knowen, that he which commeth newly into a ſhop,
ſhall not bee of skill too vnderſtand as much at the firſt day, as he
ſhall bee at the ende of a yeere or twayne: but firſt he muſt bee
taught his principles, and afterwarde growe more and more in
cunning. But if that he which hath learned his crafte, doo at the
foure yeares ende turne backe ageine too that which he ought too
haue knowen the firſt day: in ſo dooyng he ſhall ſhewe himſelfe
to bee a beaſt, and that he hath loſt his tyme. But nowe let vs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
this leſſon too our ſelues. Truely for as muche as we bee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
and earthy, wee had neede to haue the things chawed vnto vs,
which wee bee not able too digeſt: yet notwithſtanding God is ſo
gracious and charie too vs, as too teache vs ſpiritually: that is too
ſay, after a higher and excellenter maner than he taught the fathers
vnder the Lawe. VVe ſee that Abraham had not this priuiledge;
and yet neuertheleſſe he is the father of the faythfull, and it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs to be faſhioned like vnto him, as we ſhall ſee a while after.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:140"/>
VVee ſee that Dauid was an excellent King and Prophet, and yet
notwithſtanding he ſawe not the things whiche wee ſee nowe, but
onely in a ſhadowe. As muche is to bee ſayde of all thoſe whome
God guided vnder the auncient figures. And for that cauſe oure
Lorde Ieſus Chriſte ſayth,<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th. 13. b 16.</note> that the eyes are happie whiche ſee the
things that wee ſee ſince his ſhewing of him ſelfe to the worlde, and
that the eares are happie which heare the doctrine of the Goſpel as
it is preached vnto vs. Seeing then that God commeth after that
ſort vnto vs, and becommeth ſo familiar with vs: if wee ſhrinke
backe, and take Ceremonies and figures in ſteade of the good doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine,
as though we might not come at him: is it not a kicking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
him as it were in ſpite of him? And dooth not that rebelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
ſhewe vs to bee vnwilling that God ſhould bee mercyfull
and bountifull to wards vs, as he ſheweth him ſelfe to bee? Nowe
then we may eaſily vnderſtande what S. Paule meaneth heere. For
he vpbraydeth the Galathians with their going backward like Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crabbes,
in that whereas they had bin trayned in the ſpirituall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of the Goſpell, they turned backe agayne to the ſhadowes of
the Lawe. Likewiſe if wee in oure time, after wee haue once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaynted
our ſelues with ſuche order as is according too the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and be inured with ſuch ſeruice of God as is ruled by his pure
worde, would needes afterward be mingling of fancies with it, and
ſay, it will be good to doo thus and thus yet: it were a turning
backe agayne to the fleſh, that is to ſay, whereas God hath aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
vs on high, wee woulde drawe downe: and that is a manyfeſt
fighting agaynſt him. VVherefore let vs learne to apply this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
to our owne profite, and for as muche as God hath giuen vs
his worde purely preached among vs, if we once know how he wil
be honored and ſerued, let vs not ſwarue from it, neyther too the
right hand nor to the left, but let vs ſo profite in the worde that is
preached faythfully vnto vs in the name of God, as it may appeare
that we deſire to make it auaylable. And ſurely the further forward
that wee ſhall haue bin in it, the leſſe excuce ſhall wee haue if wee
turne backe afterwarde, as wee ſee many doo, whiche waxe cold or
elſe woulde fayne rowe betweene two ſtreames, and whereas it
were to be looked for that they ſhould haue gone continually for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:23060:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and haue come neerer &amp; neerer vnto God, they be ſtil mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
vpon a ſorte of ſeely toyes. And now a dayes they that would
ſhun perſecution, finde ſuche ſhifts as theſe: They diſguiſe and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifie
Gods worde by mingling and turmoyling mens inuentions
with it. So much the more therfore doth it behoue vs to take heed
to this doctrine, where S. Paule telleth vs, that if God haue once
ſet vs forwarde, we muſt no more returne backe to our Apſie lyke
little babes. For it is a ſhame for vs, when we haue once profited in
the Goſpell, or at leaſtwiſe haue had leaſure long inoughe for too
profite, and yet notwithſtanding it ſhall ſeeme that wee neuer herd
one worde of it,<note place="margin">He. 5. d. 12.</note> according as the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues
vpbraydeth the Iewes, ſaying: Yee ought all of you too bee
teachers in reſpect of the time that you haue bin taughte, and yet
notwithſtanding you bee ſtill like yong beginners. Thus ye ſee the
firſt poynt that we haue to marke vpon this text. Nowe he addeth
conſequently, <hi>Haue yee ſuffred ſo many things in vayne? If at leastwiſe
it be in vayne.</hi> Here he wakeneth vp the Galathians, by telling them
that God had done them the honor to make them as witneſſes of
his Goſpell, and yet notwithſtanding that afterwarde they had
ſwarued from it. And this is a thing well worth the marking. For
ſometimes God doth vs ſo great honor as to ſerue his turne by vs,
ſo that his worde is by our meanes maynteined before men. Nowe
if therevpon we ſwarue aſide, and holde not out to the end in ſuch
conſtancie as appeared to be in vs, it is a double ſhame, and alſo it
is to be taken for the greater crime, bicauſe the occaſion of offence
is double: and moreouer it is a vilanous vnthankfulneſſe if wee
continue not in the ſeruing of oure God, when he hathe reached
vs hys hande after that maner. And this is ſo muche the more too
bee noted, bicauſe wee ſee many men bragge and boaſt them ſelues
too haue wrought wonders, if oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſt haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
his turne by them in any thing. VVhat ſaye they? haue not
I doone this and that? They wyll alleage their owne abilities: in
ſo muche that (if yee beleeue them) God is greatly bounde vnto
them. But put the cace they had doone a hundred fold more than
they ſpeake of: yet are they euen therfore ſo muche the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
to God. For it came not of their owne good towardneſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but of God who gouerned them by his holy ſpirite: and if they
ouerſhoote them ſelues afterwarde, their faulte and offence is ſo
muche the worſe. And why ſo? Bicauſe they oughte too go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
and they go backwarde. And moreouer they cauſe many
mo too ſtumble, than they ſhould haue done if they had not bin
ſet foorth too the vewe. For when God lifted them vp as it were
vpon the ſtage, it was too haue them ſeene a farre off. By meanes
whereof they trouble an infinite multitude of people, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their faulte is ſo much the haynouſer. But yet is that vice too
common. For nowe a dayes, ſuche as thinke them ſelues too haue
done any thing for the Goſpell, will needes bee exempted from
all lawe and rule: in ſo muche that if a man blame them for doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amiſſe, what (ſay they?) ought I not to bee borne withall? For
I haue doone this and that. To bee ſhort, men will diſpence with
them ſelues after that maner, and (which is worſe) they aduaunce
them ſelues proudly agaynſt God, when he dooth them the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
too imploy them about his ſeruice. But let vs marke howe
S. Paule ſayth heere, <hi>Haue yee ſuffered ſo muche in vayne?</hi> He taketh
occaſion too blame the Galathians ſo muche the ſorer, bicauſe
they had alreadie ſuffered for the Goſpels ſake, and beene perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
and indured many troubles bothe in their goodes and in
their perſons. Howe nowe (ſaythe he?) what is to bee ſayde of all
that you haue ſuffered? Is it not a recorde that God had called
you too the magnifying of hys name? For in good faythe the
things that wee ſuffer for the Goſpels ſake, oughte too ſerue vs
for a badge, as if God did ſet vs in ſome honorable office. The
greateſt honor that wee can haue, is too bee witneſſes of Gods
truthe, ſo that althoughe we be ſubiect to lying, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
he iuſtifieth his eternal truthe which proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſelfe,
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by vs which are wretched creatures, which are but wind, ſmoke
ſhadowes, and leſſe than nothing. Seeing then that God appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and ordeineth vs to be lawful witneſſes for the aduancing &amp;
in larging of his Goſpel by vs: hath he not iuſt cauſe to complayne,
if wee ſwarue aſide from it after wee haue ſuffered for it?
Therefore let all ſuche looke narrowly to them ſelues, as haue had
any good beginning. And there is not any warning better worthie
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:23060:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>
too bee taken heede vnto, than this. For ſeyng that the leaſt of the
Church haue ynough too bind them to Godward for his chozing of
them from out of the world, &amp; for his directing of his Goſpell vnto
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in ſomuch that he hath left the great ones &amp; ſuch as take highly
vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by reaſon of their great excellencie, &amp; preferred the
leſſer ſort &amp; ſuch as are deſpized too the worldward, and ſhall ſurely
haue the harder accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make, if they ſhrink away afterward: what
ſhall become of thoſe whom God vouchſafed to haue to be his ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd
bearers, and whom he perferred in ſuch wize, as they ought too
haue bin an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple and looking glaſſe to others? what excuſe ſhall
there be for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they giue the ſlip? And ſpecially if they that haue
ſuffered for the name of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; for the doctrine of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell,
ſo farre forth as to haue bin kepte in pryſon and too haue bin
torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, yea and to haue bin brought euen vnto deaths dore, do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
ſtart aſide: is it not an aboliſhing of Gods grace ſo far forth
as in them lieth? So little then ought any mans ſuffering for the
Goſpell, ſerue to excuze him or cauſe him to be borne withall: that
ſuch as haue ſuffered moſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ought too brydle themſelues ſhorteſt,
knowing that the honour which God doth them, holdeth them ſo
much the more bound vnto him, and that it behoueth them to bee
the more watchfull and warer, that they giue none occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
to any bodie. For when folke ſhall ſay, how commeth this too
paſſe? ſuch a one ſhould haue bin a Martir of God, he hath indured
much for the mayntenance of the truth, and now beholde he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a renegate: it is a putting of the Goſpell to ſhame &amp; reproch,
and what a thing is that? By that meanes the name of God ſhall be
greatly miſreported. And therfore let vs marke well, that if we haue
for a time ſerued God, and he hath made our labour frutefull, ſo as
the Church hath bin profited and edified by it: wee muſte walke in
the greater carefulneſſe, and take good heede that wee play not the
ſhrewd Cow, that giues a good deale of milke, and when ſhee hath
done, ſtrikes downe the payle and ſpilles it. For if we doo a hundred
times more harme than wee did good: what can we alledge for our
defence? how can wee ſay that wee haue ſuffered for the Goſpell?
VVherfore if we purpoſe that God ſhoulde allow of our ſeruis, let
vs learne to be conſtant, firme and faſt ſettled, that we neuer ſwarue
<pb facs="tcp:23060:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aſide from our callyng, but continue and go foreward in it more and
more. Howbeit for aſmuch as this vpbrayding was very rigorous, S.
Paule mitigateth it, ſaying: <hi>If at leastwize it be in vayne.</hi> VVherin he
giueth the Galathians an incling, that he hopeth much better of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and that although they were ſtart aſide for a tyme, yet it would not
indure long, but that vpon warning and exhortation they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
againe into the right way. And in this text wee ſee, that when
wee bee rebuked by Gods ſpirit, it is not too make vs fumiſh, nor to
driue vs too ſuch a deſperateneſſe that wee ſhoulde take the brydle
in our teeth and fall too chafing: but rather too drawe vs to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
God then intendeth not to make vs ſo diſmayed, as too leaue
vs in the briers: but after he hath ſhewed vs our faultes, he calleth
vs alwayes home againe too him, and calleth vs to repentance, and
ſheweth vs that he is readie too receyue and take vs too mercie, as
oft as wee bee touched with true lowlineſſe to be ſorie for our ſins,
and too acknowledge them vnfaynedly and freely. Sith it is ſo, let vs
on our ſide be well aduized, that when we be told of the faultes that
wee haue done, wee play not the mad Bedlems, nor go about to win
any thing by ſtarting aſide or dragging backe: but yeeld our ſelues
giltie, and bee ſo meeke and patient minded, as too ſuffer our ſelues
too bee blamed after as wee haue neede. And when rebukings ſhall
ſeeme ſomewhat with the ſharpeſt &amp; pricking to vs: let vs alwayes
beare in minde, too conſider too what end they tend, and what frute
followeth them, and that although God rebuke vs throughly, yet he
is readie too forget all our faultes afterward. Yee ſee then what wee
haue to remember: as if S. Paule ſhould ſay, that although we to the
vttermoſt of our power haue aboliſhed the grace of God: yet not
withſtanding he on his part is loth they ſhould periſh &amp; would faine
make them to proſper. And therevnto he rebuketh vs, to the intent
we ſhould not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue vnamendable. Therfore whenſoeuer we ſhall
haue bin ſo far ouerſeene as to ſtray from the right way: yet let vs
know that our Lord calleth vs backe too him, and giueth vs a meane
to returne againe, if our fault be not matched with wilfulneſſe. Now
after that S. Paule hath ſpoken ſo, he addeth againe, that God had
delt foorth the giftes of his holy ſpirit among the Galathians, yea &amp;
that by meanes of the goſpel, in ſomuch that the ſame ought to haue
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:23060:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bin ynough to hold them to the doctrine which they had receyued,
without turning aſide or wandering away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. VVhereas he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
here of Gods ſpirit, he meeneth not the grace that was treated
of this morning, which is common to all the faythfull: but vſeth an
other kinde of reaſoning (as we ſhall ſee by the ſequele:) namely that
beſides Gods ſhewing of himſelfe generally too all the Galathians,
that he had adopted them for his children: he had alſo ordeyned
Prophetes among them, and men indewed, ſome with the gifte of
Tunges, ſome with the gift of healing, &amp; otherſome with ſuch other
like. But all this came to them by meanes of the Goſpell: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their turning backe againe to the Ceremonies of the law, was a
burying of all the operacions of Gods ſpirit. I haue told you already
how we muſt beare in minde, that God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municateth his ſpirit to all
[his]: for without that, we could not be Chriſtians, bicauſe there is
nothing but euill in our nature. God muſt be fayne to reforme vs &amp;
bring vs backe to himſelf, ſo as we may become as it were new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Yee ſee then that God doth make vs generally all parttakers
of his holy ſpirit, by meanes wherof we be touched with the feare of
him, inlightened with fayth to ſeeke our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Ieſus Chriſt, and
cheered vp to reſort vnto God, to cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; to yeeld our ſelues
obediently to his will: &amp; to be ſhort, ſo ye ſee that Gods ſpirit is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all the faithfull, &amp; to all his children. But yet doth he graunt
vs other ſpeciall graces beſides, as when he giueth vs men that teach
vs his woord faythfully, or that gouerne the common welth wiſely,
or whiche haue other giftes: for in ſo doing he giueth vs certayne
tokens that he dwelleth among vs, and thereby alſo he bindeth vs
ſo much the more vntoo him. Let vs marke the reaſon that S. Paule
ſetteth downe heere. He blameth the vnthankfulneſſe of the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
for that they conſidered not how it came vnto them by the
preachyng of the Goſpell. And he ſayeth it purpoſely, bicauſe men
will alwayes make fayre proteſtations ynow, that they meene not
to reiect Gods grace, and yet doo ſhew the cleane contrarie in their
dooyngs. As howe? They that are loth too ſuffer themſelues too
be taught, and would driue away all the miniſters of Gods woord if
they could, &amp; they which through enuie &amp; ſpitefulneſſe, could find
in their harts to aboliſh the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of al thoſe whom God hath
<pb facs="tcp:23060:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtabliſhed too maynteyne the welfare of his people, they (ſay I) doo
ſhew well ynough, that they would haue God too holde himſelfe a
farre off from them: and that they bee loth to come at him. For he
ſetteth before them the meanes to come too him, and they voutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
not too take it, but do thruſt it from them. So then, whereas S.
Paule findeth fault with the Galathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, it was not for that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
openly with full mouth that they woulde none of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
or that they hild skorne of his giftes: but too ſhewe them that
they had very ill regarded Gods vttering of the giftes of his ſpirite
in their Churche. VVhat ought wee then too gather vppon this
Text. That if God giue vs meanes too come vntoo him, wee muſt
take them awoorth, euen by faſhioning of our ſelues vnto them. For
if the Goſpell bee preached among vs, and wee wilfully forget what
is told vs: it is all one as if wee reiected God, and turned our backe
vppon him, of purpoſe too ſtray away from him. VVherefore if wee
intend that God ſhould continue his grace towardes vs: let vs hold
vs too the meanes that he hath ordeyned for vs: that is to ſay, let vs
ſuffer our ſelues to be taught by ſuch as he ſendeth vnto vs, let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of vs exercyze himſelf alone alſo in reading the holy ſcripture, let
ſuch as haue done good in edifying the Church haue roome &amp; place
among vs, and let vs not ſhet the gate againſt the holy Ghoſt. This
in effect is the thing that wee haue to beare in minde. Furthermore
for aſmuch as S. Paules intent here, is to bring backe the faithfull to
the Goſpell: let vs aſſure our ſelues that if we ſwarue neuer ſo litle
from it, we be ſtreyght in the high way to deſtruction. And ſo there
is none other knitting of God vnto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than by meanes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell
which muſt go as a chayne that cannot bee broken betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And Paule doth purpoſely once againe call it the preaching of faith,
to ſhewe vs how great neede wee haue that God ſhould preuent vs.
For vntil ſuch time as he haue reached vs his hand in our Lord Ieſus
Chriſte, and drawne vs out of the gulfe of confuſion wherein wee
bee by nature, what are wee? Moreouer wee ſee howe bountifull
he ſheweth himſelfe towardes vs, in that he giueth himſelfe fully
to vs in the perſone of his only Sonne: ſurely it is much more than
if he gaue vs heauen and earth, and all the goodes that are in them.
For what are all other things in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt?
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:23060:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
VVherfore let vs marke, that ſeing that God hauing declared vntoo
vs that wee bee vtterly vnfurniſhed of all goodneſſe, addeth that he
will not keepe backe any thing from vs, nor ſhew himſelfe a nigard
towards vs, if wee ſeeke too him for all things that wee want: wee
muſt be contented with it, and if wee ſwarue neuer ſo little one way
or other, we deſerue well to bee vtterly bereft and diſpoſſeſſed, euen
of that which wee haue receyued alreadie. And therevppon S. Paule
bringeth vs backe too the example of Abraham, bycauſe he is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all the faythfull, and moreouer bycauſe that in his perſon it
pleazed god to ſhew how we may become rightuous to be ſaued: for
there is none other way to bring vs to the kingdome of heauen than
the ſame that he went. There is but onely one way, and that is ſet
foorth too vs in the example of Abraham. S. Paule therefore ſayeth
<hi>that Abraham beleeued God, and the ſame was reckened too him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe:</hi>
and therefore that if we will be Abrahams children, wee
muſt beleeue. Heere we haue too call too rememberance the thing
that hath bin declared alreadie heretofore: that is too ſay, what this
woorde <hi>fayth</hi> or <hi>be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eefe</hi> importeth. It is not a ſingle beleeuing that
there is but one God which gouerneth the worlde: but an aſſuring
of our ſelues that he taketh vs for his children, and that wee may
fully and freely call vppon him as our father, bycauſe he accepteth
vs for our Lord Ieſus Chriſtes ſake. Then if wee bee ſure of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and fatherly loue of our God, and take ſuche warrantize of it
by his promiſes, that wee haue our looke wholly faſtened vppon
our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, in whom wee finde meanes too come vnto
God, and too go freely vntoo him: that is the very thing whiche S.
Paule ment by that woord <hi>Fayth.</hi> And ſo, when he ſayeth that too
bee Ahrahams children wee muſt bee faythfull: it is all one as if he
ſayd, that wee cannot bee faythfull Chriſtians nor members of the
Church, but by fayth: that is to ſay, except we be bereft of all opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of our owne deſeruings, &amp; moreouer ſo beaten downe and diſmayed
in our ſelues, as we may not wote where too become, nor ſeeke any
other meanes of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than in the free goodneſſe which God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
vs, when he telleth vs that wee be fordone &amp; damned in our
ſinnes, and yet notwithſtanding, that we muſt not ceaſſe to haue full
hope and truſt of ſaluation, in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus yee ſee what it is for a man to bee a Chriſtian: that is too
wit, to be vtterly out of hart in himſelf, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration that he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
nothing with him but ſin and curſedneſſe: and yet vpon the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of himſelf to be ſo vtterly voyde of all well deſeruing: to come
vnto God to be clothed with the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For
it is not ynough for vs to be out of hart in our ſelues, as we ſee that
Cain was, who beyng as it were vpon the racke confeſſeth his fault:
(howbeit, that was but through deſpayre, and ſo conſequently there
was nothing in him but murmuring and blaſphemie againſt God: &amp;
in like cace is it with all reprobates or caſt awayes) but wee muſt ſo
taſte of the loue of our God, as wee may be able to ſettle our ſelues
vpon it, and be out of all doubt that he will receyue vs if we come to
the Goſpell, at leaſtwize if wee come in ſuche wiſe as our hope bee
grounded, not vpon our owne ſelfweening or imaginacion, but vpon
Gods promis, &amp; for that we cannot bee diſapoynted in wayting vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him and in holding our ſelues aſſured of his woord. Thus ye ſee in
effect what it is too be faithfull: for wee muſt alwayes haue an eye
to the diſputation that S. Paule vndertaketh. He ſtriueth agaynſt
ſuch as pretended too purchace rightuouſneſſe before God by the
workes of the Lawe. If there were no more but this ſaying <hi>too bee of
the fayth,</hi> without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering what matter S. Paule treateth of here:
that maner of ſpeache were but darke, But when wee ſee how S.
Paule declareth expreſly, that all ſuch as go aboute too purchace fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
at Gods hand by their owne deſeruinges, are puffed vp with
pryde, and that their preſumptuouſneſſe ſhetteth the gate of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe
agaynſt them, and that God vouchſafeth not to heare them, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they defraude him of his due honour, and woulde fayne as it
were decke themſelues with his fethers, and that they be traytors in
robbing him of his rightuouſneſſe: for aſmuch as S. Paule handleth
that poynt: there is now no doubt but he taketh all thoſe too bee of
the fayth, which diſtruſt themſelues, and are vtterly out of all hope
in themſelues, and yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding do returne vnto Ieſus Chriſt,
reſting, leanyng, and truſting wholly vnto him. Thoſe therefore are
the true children of Abraham. But now let vs ſee how few Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
there are in the worlde. True it is that the woorde <hi>Christian</hi>
runneth roundly in euery mannes mouth: but in the meane while
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:23060:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is fouly defiled, and God muſt needes diſclayme all ſuche as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
after that faſhion too bee his: like as in the Popedome euery
man groundeth himſelf vppon his baptiſme or chriſtendome. And
ſurely in baptiſme wee haue on Gods behalf an infallible pledge of
our ſaluation. But what for that? they take but the viſible ſigne, and
ſeparate it from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And in very deede the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
know nought at all of that which is told vs heere by S. Paule:
but (which worſe is) they haue their freewill, their merites, and their
ſatisfactions: in ſteede of Gods ſeruis, which they thruſt vnder foote
and falſifie, they haue gewgawes yea and abhominations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
owne forging: and therefore they be ſufficiently conuicted too
haue no chriſtianitie in them. And for our part, although wee haue
not the Idolatries and ſuperſtitions that reygne among the Papiſtes:
yet are we not ſo grounded in the Goſpell, that euery of vs can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
himſelfe frankly vnto God, and fully and freely call vppon him,
quietly ſuffering him too guyde vs: but wee ſhall ſee many that are
but wretched beaſtes. True it is that they will well ynough proteſt
themſelues too hold nothing at all of the Popes abuſes and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
but if a man talke too them of the groundes and principles of
the goſpell, they wote not what thing it is. Otherſome which weene
themſelues too bee great Clerkes, when it commeth too the tryall,
doo ſhew that all was but a countenance, and that they did but prate
lyke pyes in a Cage. So much the more therefore dooth it behoue
vs too beare well in minde, howe Sainct Paule telleth vs heere, that
wee cannot bee Abrahams children nor members of the Churche,
except wee come thither with beleefe of the Goſpell, ſo as euery of
vs renounce his foreconceyued opinions of his owne merites, and
aſſure our ſelues that wee bee vtterly damned and drowned in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpayre,
and therevppon reſort too the meere grace of God, and too
the mercie which he offereth vs in our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, ſo as wee
fall too dipping of our ſelues in the bloud whiche he hath ſhed too
clenze vs withall, aſſuring our ſelues that there all our dettes are
releaſed, and Gods wrath and vengeance ſo appeazed, as wee cannot
fayle but too finde him fauourable. Howbeeit for the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandyng
hereof, lette vs marke alſo after what maner Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
beleeued God. And it behoueth vs too haue the definition of
<pb facs="tcp:23060:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this woord <hi>Fayth:</hi> for without that, all this doctrine would bee to no
purpoſe. I haue told you already that whereas the Papiſtes ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
vs: they know nother why nor wherfore they do it, nor wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
they bend themſelues, but ruſh forth ouerth wart, awry, and at all
adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture. For they neuer wiſt what faith ment, &amp; that do they ſhew
well ynough, I meene euen the greateſt doctors of them, for all that
they will ſay is that faith is to beleeue in God: and if they beleeue in
God, ſo doo the Diuels too. But when as S. Paule ſpeaketh heere of
fayth, he meeneth not that wee ſhould haue but onely ſome geſſe
that there is a God which reigneth in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but that we muſt take
him to be our father, aſſuring our ſelues throughly of it by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
which he giueth vs, and ſo linke our ſelues too our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, as wee doubt not but that all that euer he hath is proper and
belonging to vs, bycauſe we be members of his bodie. But when the
Papiſts talke of faith, they ſay it is a confuzed thing, and that it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
not to make vs good men ſo as we might bee ſaued by it. VVe
ſee then that the Papiſts go brutiſhly to worke, as folke vtterly dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Satan. And it is a iuſt puniſhment of God vpon their pryde,
bicauſe they cannot finde in their hartes too humble themſelues, by
confeſsing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to owe all vnto God, and that there is nothing
in them woorthie to be accepted at his hand, but that they muſt bee
fayne to receyue the meere grace that is offered them. Thus ye ſee
after what maner wee muſte take the woord <hi>Fayth.</hi> But heere is yet
one poynt more which ſerueth greatly too that purpoſe: which is,
too know after what maner Abraham beleeued God, and that ſhall
bee the concluſion. If Abraham had beleeued no more but that
there was a God in heauen: that woulde not haue ſerued too haue
iuſtified him, for the Heathenfolke beleeued as much. Againe, if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
had beleeued that God was iudge of the world: that would
not haue ſerued his turne nother. But when as God ſayeth vntoo
him,<note place="margin">Gen. 15. a. 1. &amp; 17. a. 7.</note> I am thy plentifull reward, and I will bee thy God and the God
of thy ſeede after thee, and moreouer all nacions ſhall bee bliſſed
in thee: by accepting ſuch promiſes wherein God acquainted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with him, and witneſſed too him that he tooke him for one of
his houſehold and as his owne childe, and became his father: Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
was iuſtified by accepting that promis. And why? For as ſoone
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23060:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as God offered him his goodneſſe and grace, he beleeued the word
and receyued it: and then was he full ſure of his ſaluation. Nowe
may we much better iudge what it is to be iuſtified by faith: namely
that it is not a confuſed opinion of beleeuing that there is a God,
but a holding of him for our father and Sauiour, and that bicauſe he
ſheweth himſelfe to be ſo by his worde, and alſo giueth vs a good
pledge and earneſt pennie of it in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, inſomuch
that there he ſheweth himſelf to be ioyned and vnited with vs, and
that although we be wretched creatures and haue nothing in vs but
all miſcheefe, yet he fayleth not too take vs for his owne, and too
admit vs into his fauour: the reaſon whereof is, bycauſe our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt is the meane betwixt him and vs. Therefore when wee
haue that promiſe, and reſt wholy vppon it, and doubt not but that
God doth and will ſhewe himſelfe gracious to vs vnto the ende, and
therewithall call vpon him and reſort onely vnto him, giuing ouer
this worlde, and continuing in the hope of the heauenly life: then
bee we ſure that we haue fayth, and are iuſtified: and that was the
maner of our father Abrahams beleeuing: and without that, let vs
aſſure our ſelues there is no Chriſtianitie at all in vs. For (as Saint
Paule ſayth in the tenth to the Romaimes) vntill wee knowe what
the Goſpell is,<note place="margin">Ro. 10. c. 14</note> wee cannot call God our father. VVee cannot call
vpon God (ſayth he) except wee knewe him,<note place="margin">Ro. 10. c. 17</note> and beleeued in him.
And howe is it poſsible for vs to knowe him, till hee bee reuealed
vnto vs? Therefore fayth muſte needes go before. And whereof
commeth fayth? Of hearing, ſayth Saint Paule. Then muſt wee
bee trayned in the Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pell, or elſe we can haue no fayth. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we ſee yet better, that all that euer is termed fayth in Poperie, is
but ſtarke dotage. And why ſo? For there Gods worde is hidden,
and the greateſt brutiſhneſſe that can bee, is taken for greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion.
VVhen men babble they wote not what, when they gad on
pilgrimage and neuer come at God, when they buſie their heades
about fonde Ceremonies and heare not ſo much as one woorde of
good doctrine: ô, that is great deuotion and holineſſe. But wee ſee
howe there is no Chriſtianitie without fayth, nor fayth without
teaching of the Goſpell: and ſo conſequently we cannot bee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
till God haue giuen vs the grace to taſte of his goodneſſe and
<pb facs="tcp:23060:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mercie, as it is dayly ſet afore vs in the Goſpell: aſſuring our ſelues
that he accepteth vs in the number of his children, ſo as we may be
bolde too call vppon him, and continue therein too the ende, at
leaſtwiſe in wayting for the full performance of the things which
hee reuealeth vntoo vs nowe by hys mouth, that is to ſay by hys
woorde.</p>
            <p>But nowe let vs fall downe before the maieſtie of our good
God with acknowledgement of our ſinnes, praying him to make vs
feele them more and more, and that the ſame feeling of them may
drawe vs vnto him with true repentance, ſo as wee may not onely
aske him forgiueneſſe of them, but alſo ſo reforme and chaunge our
ſelues, as we may truely beare the marke of his children, when wee
ſhall appeare before his iudgement ſeat, and as oure Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt alſo may repayre the Image of his father in vs, in ſuch wiſe
as hee may acknowledge vs for his members. And in the meane
while, let vs beſeech him to beare with our infirmities, till he haue
vtterly clenzed vs of them. That it may pleaſe him too graunt this
grace not onely to vs, but alſo to all people. &amp;c.</p>

that is to wit, if we were Chriſtians: we ſhould
be well acquainted with this maner of ſpeech
of being iuſtified by faith. But there are verie
few to be found euen among thoſe that boaſt
themſelues too haue profited in the Goſpell,
which knowe what is ment by the rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
whereof the Scripture ſpeaketh ſo much. Howſoeuer the cace
ſtande, either we muſt haue skill of that article, or elſe we can neuer
haue any aſſurance of our ſaluation, nor reſort vntoo God at our
neede to call freely vppon him. And that is the cauſe why S. Paule
ſtandeth ſo much vppon that matter. The laſt Sunday wee ſawe
howe Abraham was counted righteous bycauſe hee had beleeued
God: and I tolde you that thereby is ſhewed vs, that no man can
bring any woorthineſſe of his owne, wherewith to winne Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
but that we muſt bee fayne to receyue it [of his free gift.] For
the woorde <hi>beleeuing,</hi> hath a reſpect too the promiſe, inſomuche
that Gods free offering of himſelfe vntoo Abraham, was the cauſe
that Abraham was counted righteous, bycauſe hee accepted the
fauour that was offered him of free gyft, beeing well aſſured
that of hymſelfe hee had nothing but all iniquitie and curſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
And therevppon Saint Paule concludeth, <hi>that ſuch as are of
fayth are the children of Abraham.</hi> It is certayne that Abraham is the
father of all the faythfull, and of all Gods children: and therefore
it followeth, that eyther wee muſte bee faſhioned after hys ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
or elſe the gate of life and ſaluation is ſhette agaynſt vs,
and wee bee quite and cleane baniſhed oute of Gods kingdome.
Heere Saint Paule ſheweth vs the waye: For wee come not of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
as concerning the fleſhe, neither belong wee aught at all
vntoo him: and yet notwithſtanding it behoueth vs too bee of his
race: the onely way whereof, is to be partners of the promiſe that
was giuen vnto him, and to receyue it as he did, (heere ye ſee what
it is too bee of fayth) ſo that when wee once knowe and fynde by
proofe that we cannot deſerue any fauour at Gods hande, nor bee
allowed for our owne workes &amp; merits, we repoze our whole truſt
in his goodneſſe, &amp; apply this promiſe to our ſelues, which is that he
<pb facs="tcp:23060:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
adopteth vs for his children. Thus ye ſee Saint Paules Text made
plaine ynough. Howbeit he addeth, that that [promiſe] ſerued not
for the Iewes alone, but rather that all men in generall are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in it. For without that addition, the doctrine that wee haue
treated of would ſerue vs to no purpoſe. God choze Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and his
ofſpring: So then, are wee ſhet out from the hope of ſaluation: for
his choozing importeth a forſaking of all thoſe whom he choozeth
not: but he hath choſen the linage of Abraham, and ſo by that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
it ſeemeth that all of vs are forſaken. But the promiſe which
Saint Paule rehearſeth conſiſteth of two partes. The one is, that
God woulde be the protector of Abrahams lynage, and ſhole it out
from the reſt of the worlde.<note place="margin">Gen. 12. a. 3</note> The other is, that all nations ſhoulde
bee bleſſed in Abraham and in his ſeede. Nowe if God had placed
his Church in the onely houſeholde of Abraham, then ſhoulde wee
at this day bee miſerable. But for aſmuch as in the ſeconde part we
alſo are ioyned in it, and God inlargeth his goodneſſe and mercie
further, which hee had appoynted too one certaine linage: by that
meanes we become parttakers of ſaluation: And that is the thing
which Saint Paule treateth of heere, [when he telleth vs] that the
Scripture foreſeeing that God not onely iuſtifieth the Iewes, but
alſo vſeth the lyke mercie towardes the Gentiles, whiche were as
good as cut off from the houſe, ſayth, All Nations ſhall bee bleſſed
in thee. Then is there no ſpeaking here of ſome handfull of men, or
of ſome certaine people: but without any exception, God openeth
the gate to all ſuch as had earſt bin quite and cleane paſt hope. And
therevpon alſo Saint Paule concludeth, <hi>that they which are of fayth
ſhall be bleſſed with faythfull Abraham</hi> As if hee ſhoulde ſay, when
God iuſtified Abraham, he had not reſpect neither to Circumciſion,
nor to any thing that he had wherewith too winne fauour after the
opinion of men: but receyued him in another kew, that is to wit, as
a beleeuing man. God therefore contented himſelfe with Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams
fayth onely. And in that reſpect alſo it was his will too make
him the father of the whole Church. Seeing then that God made
none account of any thing elſe in Abraham but of his fayth:<note place="margin">Ge. 17. a. 4</note> let vs
conclude that God doth nowe ſtill receyue vs to him in likewiſe, if
we haue the like fayth that Abraham had, though not in like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:23060:147"/>
and that God taketh it in good worth, though we do but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him aloofe. Then belongeth not this bleſsing to Abrahams
fleſhly ofſpring onely, but alſo too thoſe that were ſtraungers too
him, ſo there bee the like ſubſtaunce and faſhion of fayth in them.
Howebeeit too the ende wee take profite by this doctrine, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what I haue touched alreadie, that is to wit, what it is too
be of faith: namely that it is a repoſing of our ſelues wholy in Gods
mere mercie. But Saint Paule ſetteth down a compariſon of things
contrarie, and which can no more agree than fire and water: that is
to wit, of beeing of the lawe, and of beeing of fatyh. Yet followeth
it not that the lawe commeth not of God: inſomuch that if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
it, at whom doth ſuch contempt poynt? Is not Gods authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
impeached thereby? But in theſe wordes of <hi>Lawe</hi> and <hi>Fayth,</hi> S.
Paule reſpecteth not ſimplie the doctrine of eyther of them, but the
hope of ſaluation that men may conceyue of them. For the rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
of fayth hath his recorde of the lawe and the Prophetes,
as Saint Paule ſayth in the third to the Romanes.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. c. 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> They be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
things: but the diuerſitie of them is in this, that ſuch as miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowe
themſelues, and are blinded with hypocriſie, thinke too pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaze
fauour in Gods ſight by keeping the Lawe, whiche thing is
impoſsible. Thoſe therefore are of the lawe, whiche holde of
the Lawe, as though they were able too earne the heritage of the
heauenly life at Gods hande. On the contrarie part, they that are
needie, yea or rather vtterly emptie of themſelues, acknowledging
that they haue not ſo muche as one droppe of grace in them: they
are of fayth. For why, they forſake themſelues, and ſeeke theyr
rightuouſneſſe elſewhere. They come and offer them ſelues lyke
poore beggers vnto God, to the ende he ſhoulde fill them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they were vtterly emptie before. Therfore marke it for a ſchole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt,
that by the force of fayth we muſt be quite ridde of all ſelfe-truſt,
and of all ouerweening of our owne merites, and haue oure
whole refuge to Gods mere goodneſſe. But truly we cannot come
right forth vnto God, without ſome meane: our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt
muſt be faine too make vs way thither: and all this is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vnder the worde fayth. For fayth is not an imagination of mens
owne forging: it is an aſſuredneſſe which wee conceyue of Gods
<pb facs="tcp:23060:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
goodneſſe, when he commeth to vs and vttereth familiarly the loue
that he beareth vs. Then muſt the promiſe go before, or elſe there
ſhall be no following of fayth. To be ſhort, whoſoeuer hath not bin
trayned in the Goſpell, can haue no fayth at all. For God muſt firſt
haue told vs that he loueth vs, or elſe we cannot reſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
nor call vpon him as our father. Now let vs ſee what this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
is. God not only ſaith that he wil haue pitie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, but alſo tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs that although we be wretched ſinners, yet he will not ceaſſe
to accept vs, bycauſe he buryeth all our ſinnes, namely by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: for that ſacrifize muſt needes come
forth euery where, where any mention is made of the forgiuing of
ſinnes. Neuer can there be any pardon gotten at Gods hand, except
there be bloudſheding with it for a ſatiſfaction. So then the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this promiſe where God ſayth that he wil be merciful to vs,
is Chriſtes ſheading of his bloud to waſh away our ſpots, and his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
vp of himſelfe for a full amends, to pacifie the wrath of God
his father. Thus ye ſee how that if we be of fayth, we haue our eies
faſtened vpon Ieſus Chriſt, and our reſt and quietneſſe is altogither
in his death and paſsion, which is the onely meane too reconcile vs
vnto God. Alſo let vs marke, that to bee <hi>bleſſed,</hi> and to be <hi>iustified,</hi>
are al one thing, accordingly as S. Paule declareth heere. Hardly ſhal
a man finde one among thirtie of ſuch as are called Chriſtians, that
can skill to define this worde <hi>iuſtifie.</hi> And ſurely it is a foule ſhame
that we ſhoulde haue our eares dayly beaten with the Goſpell, and
yet notwithſtanding bee ignorant of the cheefe article of our fayth.
Then to be iuſtified, is not too haue any rightuouſneſſe in a mans
ſelfe, but to be admitted for rightuous at Gods hande though we be
not ſo. And here ye ſee why I ſayd that we haue a good opening of
this doctrine, in that Saint Paule ſetteth downe the worde <hi>Bleſſe,</hi>
in ſtead of the worde <hi>Iustifie,</hi> which he had vſed afore, according to
the fourth of the Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. a. 5.</note> where hee ſayeth that the rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of fayth, is that our ſinnes are forgiuen vs. Forſomuch then
as God is fauourable and louing to vs, and receyueth vs as his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
therefore it is ſayde that wee bee iuſtified before him. And
why iuſtified? Bycauſe he cannot loue ſinners, till hee haue forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
their ſinnes, and put them quite away. VVe knowe that foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:23060:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as God is rightuous, hee cannot agree with ſinne, but muſte
needes alwayes hate it. Then ſith the cace ſtandeth ſo: if we intend
to haue his fauour, we muſt needes be firſt clenzed of our offences.
For ſo long as they come to reckening, God muſt needes hate vs,
and curſe vs. But contrariwize when he wipeth away all our ſinnes,
then receyueth he vs to mercie. And by that meanes do we begin to
be bleſſed of him. Are wee then bleſſed, that is to ſay, be loued of
God? Verely we are therewithall iuſtified alſo: that is to ſay, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
there was nothing but ſin in vs, God maketh vs parteners of the
rightuouſneſſe of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and all the obedience that
hee yeelded is conueyed ouer vnto vs. As for example: If I owe a
ſumme of money, and another pay it for me, although I lay out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
out of mine owne purſe, yet am I quitte. I had not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to pay, but I found one that diſcharged me. Euen ſo is it with
vs: who beeing deſtitute of rightuouſneſſe, haue Ieſus Chriſt for
our ſuretie, and he hath ſatiſfied God his father for vs. By meanes
whereof our ſinnes are quite wyped out, ſo as they come not any
more to account or remembrance before God, and therefore wee
be iuſtified or bleſſed, that is to ſay, where as God muſt heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
haue hilde vs as accurſed and damnable, now he holdeth vs for
his children. And herein alſo we ſee the fondneſſe of the Papiſtes,
who cannot finde in their heartes to be perſwaded that we be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by fayth, bycauſe that (too their ſeeming) fayth is not ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a vertue as ſome other are. For a man ſhall not bee perceyued
to doo much in holding himſelfe too Gods promiſes, and in reſting
vpon them. Men will ſay, verie well ſuch a one is a wretched ſinner,
and knoweth that hee had neede in deed to bee ſuccoured by Gods
goodneſſe, and that is the cauſe why he reſteth therevpon. But the
man whoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſation beares a goodly ſhow, &amp; is magnified euery
where, ſhall be counted the rightuouſer. As for example, if a man be
liberall and deale freely of his goods, and alſo ſhewe himſelfe well
diſpozed in all other partes of his life, ſuch a one ſhall be counted
more excellent than a beleeuer.<note place="margin">1. Co. 13. d. 13</note> Beſides this, they doo alſo alledge
S. Paules ſaying in another place, howe that Charitie is aboue Fayth
and Hope. Yea truly: but the queſtion is not here, whether of them
is the greater, higher, or nobler vertue.

VVhen we ſay we be iuſtified by fayth, it is not ment that there
is any worthineſſe or deſert in our fayth, as who ſhoulde ſay, that
God were bounde vnto vs, and therefore receyued vs for it: but
that bicauſe God hath ſhewed himſelfe mercifull towardes vs, and
promiſed to bee our Sauiour, wee beeing firſt bereft of all truſt in
our vertues, doo come vnto him by fayth, knowing well that if hee
conſider vs in our ſelues, he muſt needes curſe and abhorre vs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then that fayth bringeth not any thing on mans behalfe, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth
all things of Gods mere and free goodneſſe: there is no
queſtioning what woorthineſſe is in vs. And ſo wee ſee that fayth
not onely helpeth vs too the attainment of our ſaluation, but alſo
bringeth vs all perfection. Nowe after that Saint Paule hath ſayde,
that all the heathen are bleſſed in Abraham: he addeth that it is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
with the faythfull Abraham. As if he ſhould ſay, there is none
other meanes to make vs finde fauour in Gods ſight, than onely
fayth. There is no ſeeking of helpe elſe where in that behalfe. For
that is yet too groſſe an error wherewith the Papiſts are intangled.
For although they wote not what fayth meaneth, nor what it is to
be iuſtified: yet are they inforced to ſay that fayth helpeth to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
Howbeit they adde, that it is but partly, and that charitie, and al
other vertues worke together with it, and that if men purpoſe to be
allowed of God, they muſte deſerue well at his hand, ſo that all is
nought worth, without obedience and holineſſe of lyfe. It is true
that fayth cannot be ſeparated from the feare of God: but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
heere is nothing elſe but too knowe by what meanes God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
vs for his children. But if hee haue reſpect too oure
woorkes, wo bee to vs. Therefore he muſt bee fayne to turne away
his countenance from the conſidering of our perſons, and to receiue
vs alonely in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, or elſe (in his looking vpon vs)
to marke nothing but our miſeries, that he may be moued and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
to mercie. Ye ſee then that God hath a double reſpect in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
vs. The one is that he beholdeth our miſeries: for in aſmuch
as he ſeeth vs ſo plunged in all confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he is moued to pitie. Again,
to the intent he may no more be an enimie and take part agaynſt vs
which are ſinners, he muſt be faine to looke vpon our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, and vpon his rightuouſneſſe, that the ſame may doo away all
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:23060:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our offences. Now S. Paule ſayth heere, that we can not be bleſſed
but with faythfull Abraham. As if he ſhoulde ſaye that Abraham
though he were neuer ſo holy a man, brought nothing of his owne
with him when he obteyned righteouſneſſe before God. Fayth (as
I haue ſaide alreadie) doth vtterly bereeue a man of all the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
which he ſuppoſeth himſelf to haue. Seeing that Abraham had
none other helpe than fayth: it followeth that he renounced al his
own works, as which in very deede were nothing worth. Then ſith
it is ſo, let vs learne to leaue ſuch mingling, which bringeth nothing
but corruption before God: and let vs be contented that we be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
at Gods hand if he finde vs faythfull. If a man poze vs, and
ſay, had Abrahams vertues no fauour in Gods ſight? It is eaſie too
anſwere, that Abraham of his owne nature had nothing but all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of iniquitie. He had bin a caſtaway, if God had not plucked
him out of the dungeon wherein he was ſunken, according as he
him ſelfe ſheweth in the laſt chapter of Ioſua.<note place="margin">Ioſu. 22. a. 2</note> Conſider (ſayth he
to the Iewes) from whence I tooke your father Abraham. Did not
his fathers ſerue Idols? Then dyd I plucke him out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of hell. So, Abraham had not aughte whereof to boaſt. For
he coulde not haue done any good, if God had not preuented him
with his grace. But nowe after that God had giuen Abraham ſo
great and excellent vertues, that he is become as a patterne of all
holyneſſe: yet were not thoſe vertues able too iuſtifie him, for
there was alwayes ſome faulte too be founde in him, eyther more
or leſſe. Let a man inforce him ſelfe as muche as in poſsible too
obey God: and yet ſhall he always go limping. Now there can not
be ſo little a fault nor ſo ſmall a blemiſh in our works, but the ſame
is inoughe to make them foule and lothſome before God. Thus
all Abrahams vertues, if they had bin examined ſtrayghtly, coulde
not haue brought him ought but damnation. As muche is too bee
ſayde of Dauid, and of all others. Beſides this, when wee fall too
ſcanning whether God loue vs, and acknowledge vs for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
it muſt not bee thought he dooth it for two or three good
deedes, but for ſuch a perfect obedience as we faile not in any one
iote. But ſurely although Abraham had ſome perfection in parte of
his life, yet could he not be iuſtified by it. For he was continually a
<pb facs="tcp:23060:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man, that is to ſay, a ſinner: and God hild him ſo at the ſtaues end,
too the intent too humble him, as he doth all the reſt of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Then could not Abraham bring aught of him ſelfe, for looke
what goodneſſe ſo euer he had, he hild it of God and of hys free
goodneſſe. And moreouer, the ſame was yet ſtill vnſufficient too
ſaue him: for by nature he was vtterly loſt and damned, as all the
reſt of Adams lyne is. Therefore it ſtoode hym in hand, that God
ſhoulde receyue him through pardoning of his ſinnes, and looke
vpon him ſingly in his faythe. But let vs marke alſo, that Gods
iuſtifying of vs is by fayth, that is to ſay, by his owne meere and
alonely goodneſſe, and that thervpon it behoueth vs to reſt in his
promiſe, by the vertue wherof he alloweth and accepteth vs, yea
and our works alſo: not in reſpect that they come of our ſelues,
but for that we do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the grace of his holy ſpirite: and therfore
dooth he accept them and allowe them as righteous, yea euen ſo
farre foorth as to rewarde them as the whole ſcripture doth plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
witneſſe. And yet dooth all this alſo proceede of fayth. For
when wee bee iuſtified, that is too ſay, accepted for righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God: then alſo are our works iuſtified, that is to ſay, God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
them for rightfull, although there be not any worthineſſe
in them, nor any cauſe at al why he ſhould receiue them. Then like
as wee our ſelues are iuſtified by Gods onely free goodneſſe, when
wee receyue his promiſes by fayth: euen ſo bee our workes iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the ſelfe ſame meane. After that maner was Abraham iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in his perſon: and then likewiſe were his workes alſo iuſtified
before God. But howſoeuer the world go, if yee conſider the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
cauſe and welſpring of all: yee muſte needes conclude that
nothing elſe was made account of but onely fayth. For had God
liſted to ſift Abrahams life, he had bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned as all other mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
men are. But his intent was to take him for his owne, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
perſwaded or moued him thervnto but his own mere mercy.
Alſo, Abraham had his eyes ſhut agaynſt all vayne truſtes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
men deceyue them ſelues: he knewe there was nothing able
to bring him to lyfe, ſaue the onely mercy of God: To bee ſhort,
like as Abraham had no regarde but of Gods meere mercie: ſo
God had no regarde but onely of Abrahams fayth: and by that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:23060:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meanes was he iuſtified. So then let vs leaue all things that men
imagine to bring them ſelues in fauour with God by mingling this
and that with fayth: for they are all but falſhods and illuſions of
Satan: and let fayth haue ſuch foundation as this: that is too wit,
that with al humilitie we acknowledge our ſelues to bee then righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
when God forgiueth vs our ſinnes, and that by the ſame
meanes our works alſo are reckned for good and righteous, bicauſe
God liſteth not to ſifte them narrowly, but taketh them in good
worth of his fatherly goodneſſe. Thus yee ſee what wee haue too
gather vpon that text. Now, that the bleſſedneſſe of Abraham be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
vnto vs, and is ment vnto vs, it appeareth by that which I
haue touched alreadie, and by that S. Paule auoucheth, <hi>that all nati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons
ſhould be bleſſed in Abraham.</hi> And nowe remayneth too ſee the
reaſon that S. Paule addeth on the contrarie part. For men by their
good wils can neuer finde in their harts too giue ouer the opinion
which they haue of their owne righteouſneſſe, excepte they bee
compelled and inforced too it. For althoughe wee bee ſaped in ſo
many vices as is oughly to beholde: yet the worſt and deepeſt roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vice in our nature is pride or preſumptuouſneſſe, whiche is a
ſelfewilled weening that there is ſomewhat in vs: in ſo muche that
although God tell vs that we be right nought, and that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in vs but leaudneſſe, filthineſſe, and vnclenneſſe, and that all
the vertue which we dreame vpon is but vanitie &amp; leaſing: yet can
he not compaſſe to humble vs, til we our ſelues perceiue our owne
neede, and haue it proued to our faces. And therfore it behoueth vs
to marke well the reaſon which S. Paule addeth heere to drawe vs
to the pure fayth, and to turne vs away from all the vayne truſtes
which we can haue in our owne deſeruings. <hi>All they</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that
are of the law are accurſed. For it is written, Curſed be he that continueth
not in all the things that are written and conteyned in this booke, too doo
them.</hi> VVhen as S. Paule ſayth that all they which are of the lawe
are curſed: he meaneth that ſo long as men reſt and muſe vpon
their owne works, and thinke to obteyne grace by that meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God: they be curſed. For (as I haue declared heeretofore) like
as he that forſaketh him ſelfe, and renounceth al that he hath of his
owne, and groundeth him ſelfe vpon the only mercy of God, is of
<pb facs="tcp:23060:153"/>
fayth: ſo contrariwyſe, hee that thinketh too bring any ſeruice
wherewith too binde God vnto him, or imagineth to recompence
him with his merites, is of the Lawe. But ſainct Paule ſaythe that
ſuche are curſed. And why? He alleageth the ſaying of Moyſes:
<hi>Curſed bee hee that perfourmeth not all that is written heere.</hi> It had
beene ſayde afore,<note place="margin">Deu. 27. d. 26.</note> Curſed bee he that ſerueth ſtraunge Gods:
Curſed bee he that blaſphemeth God:<note place="margin">De. 27. c. 15</note> Curſed be he that breaketh
the Sabboth day: Curſed bee he that is ſtubborne agaynſt his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and mother: Curſed bee he that defileth another mans wyfe.
After the rehearſing of all theſe Curſes, and after the ſolemne vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of them, it behoued the people too anſwere Amen, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
as if there had paſſed ſome couenaunt, and that God on hys
ſide had made demaunde, ſaying: I wyll haue you too ſerue mee
after thys maner, yea euen without fayling in any poynte, and
in ſuche wiſe as yee keepe touche wyth mee through ſtitche in all
things that I commaunde you: and the people on theyr ſide
ſhoulde anſwere, Amen, yea Lord we be contented to be all dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
if we ſerue thee not: and then afterward God ſhould come
and conclude, Curſed bee he that performeth not all that euer is
conteyned in this booke, that is too ſay, which miſſeth in any one
poynt, and the people ſhould anſwere agayne, ſobeit. Nowe ſeeing
that the lawe curſeth all ſuche as performe it not to the full: let vs
ſee if there bee any one that dooth it. It is certayne that al men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the greateſt too the leaſt are gyltie. For why? let vs conſider
the ſumme of the Lawe, which is that wee ſhould loue God wyth
all our hart, with all our minde, with all our power, and with al our
ſtrength, and our neighbour as our ſelf and then let euery of vs try
his own life, &amp; he ſhal neede none other iudge than him ſelf to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
him. For although we loued God with an vncorrupted and
ſounde hart vnfaynedly: yet can it not bee, but that wee muſt bee
drawen diuerſly with many vanities. Yea put the cace that a man
were as perfect as an Angell: yet coulde he not loue God as he
ought to doo, for it would behoue all our wits to be imployed in
the loue of him. But now let vs marke if wee caſt not many vayne
lookes when wee open our eyes; or if that when wee open oure
eares, wee bee not giuen too their much fonde talke that tendeth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:23060:153"/>
not to the honor of God, or which is not vtterly voyde of ſinne if
at leaſtwyſe it bee not wicked. But howe ſoeuer the cace ſtande,
wee ſhoulde ſo dedicate our wittes wholly vnto God, as that wee
ſhould not thinke vpon any thing wherein he ſhould not bee glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.
And where ſhall one be founde that dooth ſo? [No where]
but (whiche worſe is) beſides that wee haue our wittes farre haled
and drawen away from the loue of God: wee ſee that they tickle
vs dayly vnto naughtineſſe, and that wee doo not ſo ſoone ſtirre a
hande but it is to put it too many things of no value. As muche is
to bee ſayd of our feete, of our eyes, and of our eares. Agayne, what
a dungeon is there in mans hart? what a number of croaked luſts
are there, ſo ſnarled one within another, as there is nothing to bee
founde among them but confuſion? In ſo muche that it is vpon
very good cauſe that Ieremie crieth out:<note place="margin">Ier. 17. b. 9</note> O what a maze is the
heart of man, wherein there is neyther ende nor meaſure to bee
ſeene, ſo that although a man ſhould ſounde and gage him ſelfe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo deepe, yet it is not poſsible that he ſhoulde attayne too the
knowledge of the hundreth part of his naughtineſſe. There is none
but onely God that can bee iudge of it. So then, let vs marke well,
that although God haue begotten vs agayn by his holy ſpirite, and
that we ſtrayne our ſelues to the vttermoſt to ſerue &amp; honor him:
yet muſt we needes come farre ſhort of the ende, and bee ſtill but
on our way thitherwarde, yea and go alwayes halting. And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
beſide oure ſlowneſſe, wee meete with many falles, and many
ſhrewde ruſhes, we limpe on the one foote, and ſtumble on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and diuers times we tumble ouer and ouer. Lo what our lyfe
is. Therefore by the Lawe we ſee we be all of vs accurſed, yea euen
when there is no many feſt ſinne in vs. For (as I haue declared al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie)
if there were no more but this, that no man diſchargeth
him ſelfe of the full performance of the Lawe: it were too be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
therevpon, that all of vs are condemned by the Lawe, and
therfore that it ſtandeth vs in hand to ſeeke our rightuouſneſſe elſe
where, that is to wit, in the mere mercie of God. Now then wee ſee
howe S. Paule ſheweth vs, that all ſuch as haue any vaine truſt in
their owne merites, are ranke traytors too God, and make warre
agaynſt hym. For he dooth as it were dragge them foorth by the
<pb facs="tcp:23060:154"/>
heare of their heads, and ſhewe them the diſtreſſe wherin they be,
and what a ſtubborneſſe is it if they will not come vnto him? Muſt
not the diuell needes haue dulled them? VVee ſee then that S.
Paules meaning heere, was too driue men too ſeeke their rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
and ſaluation in the only grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:
for without that, the other ſhould neuer befall vs, bicauſe wee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſurmize ſome valew to be in our ſelues, and that ſelfeſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or ouerweening doth ſo blind vs, that we can not glorifie God
in his rightuouſneſſe by keeping our owne mouthes ſhet till wee
bee conuicted, as wee ſee in this text. Furthermore let vs marke,
that S. Paule hath taken heere a principle which the Papiſtes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
finde in their hartes too agree vnto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For among other things,
they ſay, curſed and banned bee he which ſhall ſay that God hath
commaunded vs more than wee are able to doo. They excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
and accurſe all ſuch as are of opinion, that the rightuouſneſſe
of the Lawe ouerreacheth all the abilitie of man. For it ſeemeth to
them, that God ought not too commaund vs any impoſsibilitie, &amp;
that eyther wee muſt haue wherewith too performe the Lawe, or
elſe the Lawe ſhould bee too no purpoſe. So doo they thinke, and
ſo doo they ſay: but the holy Ghoſt ſaythe the flat contrarie: for
God is not bound to faſhion himſelfe to our abilitie. It becommeth
vs to regard what we our ſelues ought to do. VVho is he that dare
ſtep vp, and ſay that he ought not to loue God with al his hart? For
ſeeing that wee bee his, is it not reaſon that wee ſhould bee wholly
dedicated vntoo him? Yee ſee then that we bee indetted vnto him
of the perfect loue which he requireth. Ageine, if wee talke of our
owne ſtrength, it is not too bee ſayd that wee bee able to diſcharge
our ſelues of our dutie, as in reſpect of the loue which we owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our God. As for example, If a man haue waſted all his goods in
ryot, and haue not aught lefte wherwith too pay his creditors, ſhal
that diſcharge him of his dettes? If any man ſay, it is not through
our owne default: Yes ſurely is it. For in as much as wee bee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
in Adam, originall ſinne holdeth vs ſufficiently conuicted
and giltie before God, ſo as it is no excuſe too ſay, I am weake or
rather vtterly vntoward, and I can not ſo muche as thinke one
good thought,<note place="margin">2. Co. 3. a. 5</note> accordyng as Sainct Paule declareth. It is true that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:23060:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wee can not thinke ſo muche as one good thought, and that our
harts are full of ſturdineſſe and malice, ſo that al our affections are
enemies vntoo God. So ſpeaketh the Scripture: but howſoeuer
the worlde go, wee ceaſſe not too bee ſtill bound too our duetie.
VVherefore let vs marke, that the Law is commaunded vs, though
it be impoſsible for vs to fulfill and performe it.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. a. 3.</note> And if it were not
ſo, S. Paule would not haue ſayd in the eyght too the Romans, that
God performed that thing by the meanes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
which was impoſsible too the Lawe. In ſaying ſo he ſheweth well
that wee bee not able to performe all that God commaundeth vs.
For if wee could bring that to paſſe, ſurely wee ſhould be iuſtified
by it. For it is ſayde that all ſuche as fulfill the Lawe ſhall lyue
therein.<note place="margin">Leu. 18. a. 5.</note> If any man coulde bee founde that had perfourmed it, he
ſhould liue. But S. Paule taketh the ſame reaſon afterwarde too
ſhewe, that it is a follie to thinke to get righteouſneſſe by keeping
of the Lawe: for no man can bring it to paſſe as is required. Now
then as touching this text, let vs vnderſtande that S. Paule preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
that no man is able too perfourme the Lawe, thoughe he
ſtrayne himſelfe neuer ſo much: inſomuch that although he be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
by the holy Ghoſt, yet ſhall he neuer be able to bring it too
paſſe during this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ightfull life, bicauſe God giueth vs his grace by
meaſure. It is true that he could giue vs ſuch perfection as nothing
ſhould be amiſſe in all our life, but that wee ſhould haue a full and
more than angelicall conformitie too all his commaundementes.
Howbeit, although he holde vs in awe, although he chaunge vs
and faſhion vs newe agayne, althoughe he reyne vs backe to the
obedience of his will: yet is there no full perfection in vs. And
why? For he intendeth to holde vs ſtill vnder the bridle of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
he wil haue vs to know our owne weakneſſe, and to grone for
it before him: and he will haue vs to paſſe iudgement, and to know
that wee be alwayes in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etted vnto him. Foraſmuche then as God
doth not in this preſent life giue vs ſuch perfection as were requiſit
to the ful performance of his whole law: therfore we can neuer do
throughly the things that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vs. And foraſmuch as we be
not able to performe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore this iudgement is hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred down
vpon our heads, that he is curſed which fulfilleth not al the things.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It behoueth vs to marke well that ſaying: for it is not ſayd, Curſed
bee he that reiecteth the Lawe, or which keepeth no poynt at all
of it: but, Curſed be he that diſchargeth not himſelfe of it poynt by
poynt, and through ſtitche, as I ſayd afore. And for that cauſe alſo
S. Iames (too the ende too beate downe mens pride) ſayth that he
which fayleth in any one poynt,<note place="margin">Iam. 2. b. 10</note> is giltie of the whole. VVee will
think this to be very rough dealing at the firſt ſight. VVhat, ſay we?
will God forget al the good that a man hath done, for the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of ſome one onely fault? That would be counted crueltie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men. Yea, but S. Iames addeth a reaſon, ſaying: He that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
to murther, forbad alſo to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit whordome: and he that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
to ſteale, forbad al the reſidue too. Then if I thinke my ſelfe to
haue ſatiſfied God in forbearing thefte, and in the meane while am
a whoremaſter: haue I not offended the maieſtie of God? And
therfore wee muſt leaue all theſe peecings: for if wee bring God
ſome one peece, &amp; let all the reſt alone, what a dealing wil that be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
VVe ſee that one man is giuen to one vice, &amp; another to another,
and ſo euery man would bee priuiledged and diſpenſt with vnder
colour that he had done this or that, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that he miſſed
in ſome other poynt. But God hathe not ſeparated his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
aſunder. He hath not ſayde too one man, thou ſhalte not
ſteale, and to another, Thou ſhalte not commit aduoutry: but he
ſayth to al men without exception, Abſteyne yee from whordome;
abſteyne ye from theft, abſteyne yee from murther. Therefore wee
muſt examine our life, not by any one commaundement alone, but
by all the whole law togither. But now let vs ſee if we can find any
man that is faultleſſe. Yee ſee then that wee muſt needes bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
ſo long as we ſtande to be iudged by the law. For if Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
who was the excellenteſt that euer could be picked out amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
men, ſhould be driuen to enter into account by that: it is certayne
that he ſhoulde not miſſe too bee damned. Seeing it is ſo, let vs
beare well in minde that it is not for vs too diſpute any more: for
when the Papiſtes ſpeake of the righteouſneſſe of faythe, they
doo but dally and skoffe with God, as if he were a lyttle babe.
Let vs keepe our ſelues from ſuche ſcornfulneſſe: and when God
pronounceth this horrible ſentence, that all they bee curſed which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:23060:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>

            <p>Now let vs fall downe before the maieſtie of our good God

will ſoone be rid away. The Papiſtes will not in any wiſe graunte

they neuer felt throughly what it is to come before Goddes

ſhall haue perceiued neuer ſo many miſeries in ourſelues, God

gyuen that we cannot be iuſtifyed by the lawe, but by fayth
only.</p>
            <p>And nowe the Apoſtle going forward with his matter, vſeth
another reaſon, whiche is, that if wee ſeeke righteouſneſſe in the
law, the ſame will be a cleane contrary one to the rightuouſneſſe
which Gods children and choſen people obteyne by fayth. For
what manner of one is the rightuouſneſſe of the law ſayth hee?
[This it is.] He that doth thoſe things ſhall liue in them: that is to
ſay, whoſoeuer obeyeth God and doth his commaundements, ſhall
haue ſaluation for his labour. Lo heere a fayre promis: but what
good will it doe vs? If wee will aſſay to do the things thoroughly
which are commaunded vs, wee ſhall euery one of vs ſee that God
ſheweth vs our condemnation ſo much the greeuouſer, as if he had
ſet it downe before vs. VVhat would become of our ſaluation, if we
ſhould ſeeke it in ourſelues, and be fayne to earne it? Now therfore,
when we heere that God is ready to recompence all ſuche as ſhall
haue ſerued and honored him by keeping of his law: it ſeemeth to
vs before we go any further, that we haue gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a maruellous van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
Tuſh (ſay we:) beholde, God byndeth hymſelfe too vs, and
warranteth vs the heritage of heauen if wee ſerue him and fulfill
his will. [Yea:] but when wee haue compared our lyfe too hys
doctrine, we ſhall fynd that his ſhewing of himſelfe ſo liberall and
bountifull towards vs, too bind himſelfe to vs for our ſeruing of
him and for our keeping of his lawe, is a plunging of vs muche
deeper into the gulfe wherein wee were before. VVhat ſhall
we do then? VVe muſt reſort to the remedie which the Apoſtle
ſetteth downe heere before vs by the mouth of Abacucke: whyche
is <hi>that the rightuouſe ſhall liue by faith.</hi> Therefore let vs refuſe the
promis of the law bicauſe it is not for our behoof,<note place="margin">Abacuk. 2. a. 4.</note> &amp; take the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
goodnes of our god, who reacheth out his armes to receiue vs,
ſo we be cleere rid of al ſelfweening. That is the thing which is ſet
downe vnto vs here by S. Paule. And it is a reaſon that holdeth of
<pb facs="tcp:23060:157"/>
contraries as they tearme it. As for example, if a man ſhoulde ſay
that fire heateth: and another wilfull body ſhoulde holde the
contrarie it myght be ſayd vnto him, ſee if yee or froſt do heate or
no: doth it not appeere that they be things dyuerſe, repugnant, and
vnmatchable? Agayne, if it ſhould be demaunded whither the heate
of the Sunne is behooffull for this lyfe or no: what a thing were it
if there were no Sunne in the world? we ſhoulde de all of vs be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with the filthineſſe of the aire, all the corruption whereof is
clenzed away by the ſhyning of the Sunne. Then like as men
may reaſon vppon contraries in the order of nature: ſo the
Apoſtle ſayeth that wee cannot bee iuſtified both by the law, and
by the free fauour of God: that is too ſay, if we bee well lyked
at Gods hand, our comming into his fauour muſt be through his
owne freebeſtowed goodneſſe, bycauſe hee loueth vs in oure
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and not for any worthyneſſe that can be in our
ſelues. Howbeit, for the better vnderſtanding of this doctrine.
Let vs mark well how it is told vs heere, that the ryghteouſneſſe of
the law is the fulfilling of Goddes commaundementes. And heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it myght ſeeme to vs that the doctrine of the law were ſufficient
to ſaue vs, for aſmuch as God hauing reherſed the ten commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
that are conteyned in the law, hath finally tolde vs that
that is the thing whereby we ſhoulde liue, the thing whereby wee
ſhoulde direct our lyfe, the infallible rule, and that wee muſt not
ſeeke anie other perfection of righteouſneſſe than that. And that is
the very matter wherein we ſtryue ſo muche againſt the Papiſtes,
bycauſe that whereas God requireth obedience, they thinke to do
him as good ſeruis with the things that are of their owne deuizing.
VVherefore let vs marke that the full perfection of all holineſſe
is conteyned in the Lawe. Yea verely as in reſpect of doctrine.
For it is not lawfull to adde any thyng to it, and men do but
ouerlabour themſelues in vayne, when they bryng in I wote not
what deuotious of their owne deuyzing. But it is not ynough for
vs that the doctrine of the lawe dothe ſufficientlye ſhewe vs
what ryghtuouſeneſſe is: wee come too thys poynt alſo, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
whither wee be able to do the thynges that God hathe enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vs. I tolde you thys morning, that wee come farre ſhort of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:23060:157"/>
that. And ſo the promis of the law is nothing to our behoofe, and
the Papiſts do fowlly ouerſhoote the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in that behalfe. For they
hold ſtill this fantaſticall opinion, that God hath not commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
any thing which we be not able to performe. But we ſee the
cleane contrary by Sainct Paule. To confirme theyr error, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that then God mocketh men, in telling them that he which
doeth thoſe things ſhall liue in them. But this knot is eaſye too be
vntyed. For if God gaue men no remedye, it is certeine that they
ſhould be vtterly abaſhed when he ſayth, that he whych doth theſe
things ſhall lyue in them, that is to ſay, no man ſhal liue. At the firſt
bluſh (as I ſayd) we may ſeeme to haue wonne the goale, ſeing that
God hath told vs, that by keeping his law we ſhall obteine hys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
and that there is a crowne of glorie prepared for vs wherof
we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not fayle: but when we haue caſt our cardes, we muſt be fayn
to come to this poynt, that no man can atteyne to lyfe by his owne
purchace or earning: for why, no man performeth the law. It is not
ſayd, he that doeth but ſome one part or other of the lawe, ſhall
liue: but he that doeth all that is conteyned in it. VVhat manner of
thing then is the rightuouſeneſſe of the lawe? It is a ful and perfect
keeping of it, without miſsing or fayling in any point at al. But ſuch
a one is not to be found among men, and therefore it followeth
that all of vs are diſappointed, and ſhut out from the promis that
is giuen vs in the lawe. Yet is it not to be ſayd that God mocketh
vs, when he holdeth vs at the ſtaues ende, bycauſe men deceyue
themſelues through their owne pryde, by boaſting of their owne
deſeruings. He hath good reaſon to hold them ſo at the ſtaues end:
and if there were no law nor any ſuch promis, what would come of
it? VVe know that the heathen men would alwayes needes bee in
Gods fauour for their owne vertues ſake: and yet in the meane
while they knewe there were many faultes in them, and for that
cauſe they reteyned the vſe of ſacrifiſing. It is true that they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
not the end of them: yet neuertheleſſe, their ſacrifiſing was a
playne confeſsion that they were indaungered vnto God, and had
neede to be admitted into his fauour. Likewiſe the Papiſtes do at
this day packe togither a great deale of pelting traſh, to make at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement
with God. And ſo ye ſee that the heathen men did at all
<pb facs="tcp:23060:158"/>
times keepe the ſame trade which the Papiſtes keepe at this day.
But howſoeuer they fared, their intent was to bee ſaued at Gods
hand for their owne deſeruings. Howbeit God telleth vs that if we
thinke he oweth vs any thing of duetie, we deceyue ourſelues: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
he promiſeth of his owne free goodneſſe, that if we
keepe the law we ſhall be reckened for rightuous before him. But
now, do we keepe it? No, we come farre ſhort of it, in ſomuch that
if we conſider how much we fayle of it, we muſt needs be abaſhed
at it. Yee ſee then how it is not without cauſe that God hath giuen
vs that promis, though we reape no profit nor aduauntage by it.
For it hath a reſpect to the correcting of the pryde wherewith we
be ſo ſore infected, that wee muſt be clenzed of it by ſome violent
remedie, or elſe we ſhall burſt. And what remedie is that? Behold,
God talketh to vs thus: Go to, yee murmur at me, if I handle you
not after your own lyking: but I tell you, that I will not only poure
out my graciouſe giftes and benefits vpon you in this worlde: but
alſo do lay vp an euerlaſting heritage in ſtore for you, ſo yee ſerue
me. Serue me, and make me a good account, and then ſhall you be
ſure that I will recompence you, both in this life and in the lyfe to
come. Gods ſpeaking after that manner is to none other ende, but
to ſtoppe mennes mouthes, and to make them acknowledge, that
if God puniſh them and ſend them neuer ſo many afflictions, it is
ryghtly done in ſomuch that all ſuch as ſhall haue well ſifted their
owne liues, ſhal be driuen to confeſſe, yea euen vnfeynedly, Alas, if
we be not worthie to eate bread for the ſuſtenance of this tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
life vpon earth, how can we by our own deſerts get the heritage
of heauen, whiche is a glory that belongeth only vnto God? How
can we atteyne to it by our owne ſtrength? Yee ſee then that mens
combes are quite cut, by Gods giuing of this ſo large and liberall
promis vnto them. And therewithall wee haue too note, that the
ſame promis is free of itſelfe, and yet fare wee neuer awhit the
better for any peece of it, till we haue vtterly let go our hold of
it. This would be darke if it ſhoulde not bee layde foorthe more
at large. The heathenmen (as I haue ſayde alreadie) did fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
themſelues that they ſhould be recompenced at Gods hand,
if they liued after an honeſt and vnblamable faſhion among men.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:23060:158"/>
But that was great follie, or rather ſtarke madneſſe. For howe can
God become indetted vntoo vs, as it is tolde vs in the ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of Sainct Luke?<note place="margin">Lu. 17. c. 10</note> Though men could do better than the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles
of heauen, coulde they bynd God too them by it? No: for
they bee his aforehand by nature: accordingly alſo as our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſte alledgeth the ſimilitude of a ſeruant, not of ſuche
ſeruants as are now adayes, but ſuch ſlaues or bondmen as were in
thoſe dayes. If a bondſlaue had bin ſlayne a hundred tymes for
his maſter, yet was it at his mayſters will whither hee ſhoulde
liue or dye ſtill. Therfore our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt maketh his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation
in this wyſe. Go to, ye bee but poore mortall creatures
yourſelues: and yet if any of you haue a bondſlaue, hee will holde
him as an Aſſe or an Oxe: and when the ſeruant after ſore trauell
and labour with great payne all the day long, returneth home
at night, his maſter will not make him too ſit downe at the table
with him: for he hath done no more than his duetie and that which
he was bound to do. Now then, ſhall God be of leſſe authoritie or
in worſe cace than mortall me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? For ſomuch as you are his, although
you indeuer to walke in his obedience, yet can he not be any whit
beholden to you. And ſo (as I haue declared alreadie) wheras God
hathe ſayd in his law, that he which doth theſe things ſhall lyue in
them: what moued him to ſuch bountifulneſſe as to promis vs euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
lyfe? It was not for that he owed vs any thing. Kill we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
a hundred thouſand tymes to ſerue him, yet cannot that bind
him too yeeld vs any recompence. Howbeit, of his owne ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
goodneſſe he commeth and ſayth, Although I owe ye not
any thing at all, nor you be able to bring aught that may deſerue
any recompence, (for you be bound vnto mee in all poynts and all
reſpects:) yet will I rewarde you for your labour. Go to therfore; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
yourſelues to your duetie, and do the things that I commaund
you, and you ſhall not be diſapointed of your paiment. Thus ye ſee
in effect what wee haue too remember, as I muſt tell you yet
once agayne hereafter. Now the Papiſtes will welynough graunt
this in part, but not commonly. For the moſt part (I meene of thoſe
that are the Popes right champions) can no skil of thoſe principles
at this day. Yet wil ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> graunt, that wheras God hath in his
<pb facs="tcp:23060:159"/>
law promiſed the reward of lyfe to ſuch as ſerue him: it is to ſhewe
that works are not of ſuch value as to deſerue euerlaſting life, but
by reaſon of the promis. But preſuppoſe that God hath bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
as he hath done: and then they thinke that wee deſerue: and
why? For elſe (ſay they) Gods promiſing that he whiche doth thoſe
things ſhall liue in them, is in vayne. But they like wretched beaſtes
(as I ſayd afore,) conſider not that God ſayeth it not to ſhew that
men are able to purchace ſaluation by their owne deſerts: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to hold them conuicted, and to bring them to true humilitie,
which they ſhunne continually through their fooliſh ouerweening
and vain gloriouſneſſe. Now then we ſee that Paules meening is in
effect, that if we go about to be iuſtified by the law and by our own
works, we muſt not leaue any thing behynd nor forget any thing:
for it is ſayd, he that doth all thoſe things ſhall liue in them. But
now where is that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is ſo forward, that he can boaſt of the
full diſcharging of his dutie towards God? None but hipocrities
that are beſotted in their owne diueliſh pride, or heatheniſh folke
that skorne God and neuer were moued to true repentance, but
haue alwayes had their conſciences aſleepe or rather bewitched:
none (ſay I) but ſuch folks do thinke themſelues to deſerue aught,
and they beguyle themſelues. Then ſeing that the righteouſneſſe of
the law is ſhut away from vs, and we be vtterly barred from it: it
behoueth vs to go to another ryghtuouſneſſe, which is, that God
take vs into his fauour of his owne free goodneſſe, and in ſted of
receyuing any thing of our bringing, giue vs that thing for our pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is none of ours, that is to wit, the obedience of oure
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by deliuering vs from the condemnation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we were plunged, that is to wit by putting away all our offences
and ſinnes. As much is ſaid of it in another place, where Sainct Paul
treateth excellently well of the doctrine which we haue heere.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. c. 19</note> For
he doth alſo ſet downe the righteouſneſſe of the lawe. And it is a
wonder that the Papiſts haue bin and yet ſtill are ſo dulled, that
they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider not the warning that S. Paul giueth here, being ſo faire
and cleere as it is. For it is always at their tungs end to ſay, what?
that were a mocking out of al that God hath promiſed, concerning
the reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence that he wil veld to good works. And ſeing he hath ſo
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:23060:159"/>
often ſayd that we ſhalbe reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>penſed: muſt he not needes diſcharge
his promiſe? For elſe men might accuſe him of vntruth. But Saint
Paule telleth them alwayes thus: my freendes, if we thinke to ſtand
in Gods fauour for our owne deſertes: let vs conſider the promiſe
that is giuen vs. For when there is any controuerſie among men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for bying or ſelling or for any other like thing: they will ſay
here is the Indenture, let it bee looked vpon, I report me too that
which is conteyned in it. As ſoone as the deed is read, the cace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
plaine: and the ſeller will ſay, the ownerſhip [of this thing]
is thine, but yet vpon condition that thou haue payed for it. If thou
haue not payd, thou haſt nothing to do with it. Ye ſee then that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we fall to ſcanning for the inheritance of ſaluation, we muſt reſort
to the cheefe and originall deed or Indenture, that God made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
himſelfe and vs. Nowe, that deed or Indenture is the Law.
Therefore if men will needes bee payed theyr wages according too
their ſeruice, they ſhall finde themſelues rather to be baniſhed from
the euerlaſting life, than to come any thing neere it. God may ſay
to them that if they performe al that is commaunded them, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage
of ſaluation is readie for them. But nowe remayneth to bee
ſeene whether any man can performe all or no. I haue ſhewed you
alreadie that no man is able to doo it: and ſo are wee euerie one of
vs ſhet quite out of the doores. The Papiſts conſider not that: but
when they heare it ſayde that hee which doth thoſe things ſhal liue
in them: they beare themſelues in hand, that that there is no more
doubt of the doing thereof: it is ynough that God ſaith the worde.
In deede God ſpeaketh the worde, but hee requireth the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of it at our handes. After the ſame maner alſo do they take
this text of Saint Paules where he ſayth,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. b. 13</note> not the hearers of the law,
but the doers of it ſhalbe iuſtified. The Papiſts alledge that ſaying,
howbeit but to picke out their owne eies withall. For S. Paule pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth
thereby that we cannot be iuſtified but by performing all that
is commanded vs. The Iewes boaſted that the Lawe was giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, ſaying: Tuſhe, wee haue the Lawe whereby it is tolde vs
that we be Gods people. Yea, but it is with condition. And where is
[the performance of] that condition? VVill it be found in you? No.
But S. Paule ſaith that wee become not righteous by hearing of the
<pb facs="tcp:23060:160"/>
Law. For it were a fonde matter if we ſhoulde come to Church too
here what is tolde vs, and euery man returne home to do what hee
liſteth himſelf. It behoueth vs to performe whatſoeuer God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs: but none of vs performeth it, &amp; therfore all of vs are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
ſayth he. The Papiſtes conſider not this conſequence, but take
onely this ſaying broken off from the reſt, namely that ſuch as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the law ſhall be iuſtified. Yea verely, if there were any ſuch,
but where are they?<note place="margin">Rom. 8. a. 3.</note> Alſo in the ſame Epiſtle to the Romans he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
afterward that Gods promiſing of vs eternall life vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that we performe the Law, ſtandeth vs in no ſteed at all, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we ſhall neuer bring it to paſſe, foraſmuch as by nature we be
vtterly contrary to his rightuouſneſſe, and afterward when he hath
begotten vs again by his holy ſpirit, we be ſo much the more bound
vnto him: wee haue receyued all our goodneſſe at his hande: and
he ſhall but crowne his owne giftes in vs. Are theſe then merits or
deſeruings? [No.] Howbeeit wee muſt paſſe yet further, namely
that although our Lorde voutchſafe to crowne our woorkes when
they be good, yet they be but partly good, and there will alwayes be
matter ynough founde to condemne vs with. So then we bee quite
and cleane bereft of all truſt in our owne righteouſneſſe, not onely
bycauſe our workes are not of ſufficient worthineſſe before God:
but alſo bicauſe they be to be vtterly miſlyked if we ſhoulde fall to
entering into account, and that God liſted to iudge according to the
ſayde ſentence, He that doth theſe things ſhall liue in them: for it is
all one as if he ſhould ſay, you are all of you dead, damned and paſt
recouerie. For why, none of you performeth the things that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of him, and yet you owe them to me. And that is the cauſe
why I ſayd that we muſt go to the ſeconde remedie, that is to wit, to
liue by fayth. And S. Paule in the text by me euen now alledged, in
ſted of rehercing the ſaying of Abacucke which he had ſet downe in
the .xvij. verſe of the firſt chapter,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. c. 12</note> ſayeth that the rightuouſneſſe of
fayth hath good recorde in the Law. For the rightuouſneſſe of the
Lawe, that is too ſay, the rule that God giueth vs in his Lawe too
iuſtifie vs with all, is that wee ſhoulde keepe and performe all hys
commaundements. But the rightuouſneſſe of fayth ſpeaketh ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
maner of language. For it ſayth that it is not for men too ſeeke
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:23060:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in themſelues the meanes too make theyr lyfe allowable before
God, and ſo to receyue the hyre or crowne of it: but that they muſt
reſt wholly vppon Gods woorde, ſo as it may be both in their heart
and in their mouth. For hee that beleeueth with his heart that our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt dyed,<note place="margin">Ro. 10. b. 9.</note> and confeſſeth with his mouth that he is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
againe, ſhall by that meanes obteyn rightuouſneſſe before God.
VVe ſee then that Saint Paule vttereth himſelfe the more at large,
to the intent that we ſhould vnderſtande, that his ſeparating of the
rightuouſneſſe of the Lawe from the rightuouſneſſe of fayth, is too
ſhewe that they bee vnmatchable, and can no more bee ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
than fyre and water. True it is that there is no contrarietie
betwixt the Lawe and the Goſpell, as I haue ſayde afore: for wee
knowe that both twaine of them doo come of God. But heere it
behoueth vs too take Gods meening in ſuch wiſe as he declareth it
to vs: which is, that by ſetting the rightuouſneſſe of the Law before
vs, he intendeth to humble vs and to make vs condemne our ſelues
when we come before him, which thing wee woulde neuer do, if he
ſhould not bewray our wretchedneſſe. Therfore when he ſayth that
wee ſhall be iuſtifyed by keeping of the Lawe: it is all one as if hee
ſhould ſay, wretched wightes, what woorthineſſe or valure weene
you to be in your ſelues? VVey my commaundements, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what they import, and therewithall bethinke your ſelues how
euery of you hath liued: and ye ſhall be as good as drowned in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre.
VVhen God hath ſayd ſo, he addeth the remedie: Come (ſaith
he) to the doctrine of the Goſpell. And what a maner a one is that?
Saint Paule alledgeth heere the ſaying of Abacucke,<note place="margin">Abac. 2. a. 4</note> how that <hi>the
rightuous ſhall liue by fayth.</hi> And in the ſame place which I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
he openeth himſelfe, howe that it behoueth to reſort wholy
to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. For the worde that ought too bee in our
mouth, and in our heart, to bring vs vnto God, and too open vs the
kingdome of heauen, is not a worde that ſerueth to holde vs downe
heere beneath, nor too make men beleeue that God will allowe
of our owne deſertes, nor too puffe vs vp with pryde: no, but too
holde vs faſt to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore when we knowe
that our ſinnes are wyped out by the death and paſsion of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt: and that by his reſurrection ſuche rightuouſneſſe
<pb facs="tcp:23060:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is purchaſed for vs, that in ſtead of beeing damned too the gulfe of
hell, which is the heritage that belongeth to vs, and whereof we be
worthie, we be made heyres of the kingdome of heauen: and when
we know that in Ieſus Chriſt we recouer all that we had loſt in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
and the curſedneſſe wherein we be wrapped is taken from vs,
and God hathe ſette vs free: that is Gods iuſtifying of vs by
fayth.) And in good fayth, when wee haue well conſidered the
circumſtance of the text that Saint Paule alledgeth out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
Abacucke: wee ſhall ſee plainly that that is the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
the holy Ghoſt leadeth vs. For the Prophete had ſpoken of
the chaſtizements and corrections which God would ſend vpon the
people: ſo as (to looke vnto) all ſhoulde ſeeme too bee confounded.
Now therevpon hee ſayth, that the wicked ſhall but ſwell more and
more in their pride, howbeit that they ſhall haue no ſure footing, but
ſhal ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble with all their ſway, &amp; bicauſe they wil nedes exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
they ſhall the more caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues down, with ſo much the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
&amp; fouler fal. That the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the thing which the prophet vttereth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the wicked. And he addeth on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie part, <hi>but the rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſhal liue by faith.</hi> Now wheras he ſaith that the rightuous ſhal liue
it is all one as if he had ſaid, that gods children ſhal not find their life
neere at hand in themſelues, but that euen when they ſhall haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled
ouer all the world, vp &amp; down, it ſhal ſeme to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that there is
nowhere any thing elſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very dungeons of death, &amp; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
that miſsing of a preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t life, they ſhal find a life to come,
when they ſhall haue nurriſhed it in their harts &amp; mindes by fayth.
VVe ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Prophets intent is to draw Gods choſen both
from the world and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, to the end they may cleaue who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vnto him, and not ſeke any other meanes to be ſaued, than by his
only grace. But S. Paule hath ſpoken more breefly here, bycauſe he
was fully reſolued of all that I haue declared heretofore, and which
hee himſelfe hath diſcourſed, that is to witte, That fayth teacheth
vs too ſeeke all oure welfare in God. But the Lawe teacheth vs
the contrarie. I ſay it teacheth vs it, to the ende too ſhewe vs that
to ſeeke it throughly, wee muſt acknowledge that there is not ſo
much as one drop of lyfe in vs. The Lawe then ſayth vnto vs, go to,
take yee paynes, and do yee ſo much as ye may winne heauen by it.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:23060:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And why doth the Lawe ſay ſo? Not too feede men in their vaine
ſelf truſt, of weening ſtill that they can deſerue well at Gods ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, it
is not for that: but to prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to receyue the grace of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt with lowlineſſe. For (as I haue ſayd alreadie) when we
keepe our ſelues aloof from God, and euery man beares himſelfe in
hand that he is well worthie to be accepted of him: our Lorde will
ſurely be aduenged of ſuch preſumptuouſneſſe, and ſayth, Go to, let
me ſee what ye haue done: come on, and let vs fall to reckening: and
let him that oweth aught to other pay it. Ye ſhal not be diſappointed
by me: I haue your wages in my hande, it is readie for you, and if ye
ſhall haue done all that I haue commaunded you, feare not but you
ſhall be well payde for your labor. Therefore hie you apace, and let
me ſee how you will ſerue me. But (as I ſayd) our Lord in ſaying ſo,
prepareth and diſpozeth vs to know in what plight we be. For when
we once perceiue our owne neede, then will wee ſeeke our wantes
at his hand. Thus ye ſee how the Lawe leadeth vs to fayth: but it is
a ſtraunge kinde of leading. Howſoeuer the cace ſtand, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarietie which S. Paule ſetteth down here, namely that
we cannot be iuſtified by fayth, except we haue firſt knowne and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
vnfeynedly, that we be damned in our ſelues, and that
the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of our welfare is to know that there is nothing but dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
in vs. Now at the firſt ſight it might be ſayd that S. Paule hath
ſtretched this ſaying of Abacucks too farre, ſeing he ſpake there but
of the afflictions of this tranſitorie life. The rightuous ſhall liue, that
is to ſay, he ſhal holde out, and although God afflict him &amp; ſcourge
him, yet ſhall he not quayle if he ground himſelfe vpon Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.
And here the cace concerneth not Gods comforting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering
of vs from the miſeries wherevnto wee bee ſubiect in this
world: but it concerneth our euerlaſting ſaluation, which farre paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
all the ſtate of this tranſitorie life. It ſeemeth therefore that S.
Paule applyeth not this Text of the Prophete aright. Howbeeit let
vs marke, that if the Prophet had looked no further than too thys
worlde, that ſaying of his had bin very vaine, ſeeing that afflictions
are common both to good and bad. Againe, howe is it that we lyue
by fayth? Seeing we bee continually ſubiect to fall into the ſame
daunger whereoutof God hath deliuered me once, twice, or thrice
<pb facs="tcp:23060:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before, and that if God haue pitied me in ſome affliction to day, ſo
as I haue felt his fauor, he afflicteth me to morrow with ſome other
affliction: what were my life if I reſted vpon the worlde? So then,
the Prophet me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to declare, that although the faithful be miſerable
and do but pyne away in this worlde, yet notwithſtanding they be
bleſſed of God euen in this worlde, and all the miſerie which they
indure here ſhall turne to their welfare: for why they reſt themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
vpon their God. VVherfore we muſt vnderſtand that there is a
better heritage than this, and that we ſeeke the true and euerlaſting
happines, ſo as we may haue a ſtedfaſt continuance of our ſtate. But
the woorde <hi>Rightuouſneſſe,</hi> ought alſo to be well marked. For if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacucke
had ſayde, the wretched ſinners ſhall liue by fayth: it would
haue ſeemed that hee had ſpoken but to a fewe folke. For it wil well
ynough bee graunted that wretched ſinners ſhoulde flee for refuge
vnto God: but as for thoſe that excell in vertue, ought they not to
be exempted from the common aray, and to be exalted too a higher
degree at Gods hande, and finally too bee iuſtified by prerogatiue?
Accordingly as we ſee nowadayes that although there bee nothing
but al maner of filth in the Popiſh Ceremonies and Clergie as they
tearme it, ſo as they ought to be abhorred both of God and man:
yet notwithſtanding, vnder colour of their Coules, and all other
their trumperie, they ceaſſe not to chalenge God too bee greatly in
their det. And beſides this, when theſe dotardes haue made muche
babling, and trotted and ſcudded vp and downe from altar too altar,
and from Chappell to Chappell, and gadded on pilgrimage: to their
ſeeming, God ought not to forget any of theſe doings, but all of it
ought to paſſe for good payment in their account, beſides an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſande other Items which they haue too ſet downe before
him.<note place="margin">Math. 21. c. 31.</note> And that is the cauſe why our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſayth, that the
wretched loce liuers, yea euen the verie whooremongers ſhall much
ſooner come too the kingdome of heauen, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> any of all theſe
foule toades that are ſo puffed vp with the vaine truſt of their own
deſerts, that although their whole life be wicked, and they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
are full of all lothſomneſſe, yet they will nedes bind God vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
vnder the ſhadow of their hypociſie. Now to the ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to cut off all
occaſion of ſuch imaginations, the Prophet ſaith purpoſely, that the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:23060:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rightuous ſhall liue by faith. At the firſt ſight there ſhould ſeeme to
be ſome contrarietie in theſe two ſayings. How ſo? Muſt we to the
inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be rightuous liue by faith? [yea:] for if we liue not by faith,
we be not rightuous. For what is the rightuouſneſſe of the Goſpell?
It is Gods free giuing vs a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient remedie whereby to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and to be in his fauor through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, bicauſe
we cannot obteyne rightuouſneſſe by the law. Therfore whoſoeuer
liueth by fayth is out of doubt not rightuous of himſelfe. But the
Prophet ſaith, that thoſe notwithſtanding are rightuous, which are
ſaued by Gods only and free mercie. Therfore it is as much as if he
had ſayd, that although God giue vs the grace to imploy our ſelues
to his ſeruice, and haue by his holy ſpirit imprinted in our harts the
true feare and honor which we owe vnto him, ſo as we fight againſt
the luſts of our fleſh to the vttermoſt of our power, &amp; ſtriue againſt
the ſin that is in vs, and in our nature: yet muſt we ſhet our eies at
all the things which wee woulde fayne find in our ſelues too pleaſe
God with, and reſt wholy vpon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. If the rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
muſt be faine to be iuſtified by fayth: who ſhall bee iuſtified by
his owne deſeruings? None will take vpon them, but Diuels, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
wightes, and enimies of God. Ye ſee then that the Papiſtes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
at this day coulde not deuize to ſhewe betten that they intende
not to be rightuous, than by theyr ſtryuing for the rightuouſneſſe
of their owne woorkes and deſertes, as they doo. For it is an vtter
fighting euen with a ſpyte: agaynſt God and nature. You [Papiſts]
ſay you, ſeeke too bee rightuous: and howe? euen by your ſelues,
and by your owne workes and deſeruings. VVell, let vs conſider
what the Prophete ſayth: he ſayth not that the rightuous ſhall liue
by their workes, but that they ſhall bee ſaued by the onely grace of
God. Now if the righteous giue ouer all ſelfe truſt of their owne
merites, as of force they muſt needes do: it is certaine that ſuch as
thinke to make God indetted vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by bringing any vertue of
their own vnto him, do wipe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; raze the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues quite &amp; cleane out of
the regiſter of rightuouſneſſe. Thus ye ſee that the Papiſts, ſo long
as they dwell in theyr errour, are reiected of God, according to the
ſentence which hee gyueth vpon them heere by his Prophete. And
vndoubtedly when as Saint Paule alledgeth this ſaying of Dauid,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Happie is he to whome God imputeth not his ſinnes:<note place="margin">Ro. 4. a. 6.</note> hee ſheweth
well therby,<note place="margin">Pſal 32. a. 1.</note> that thoſe men are moſt righteous which do moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
themſelues, and are moſt ſtriken downe, yea and are vtterly
out of all hope of themſelues, till God haue ſuccoured them by his
goodneſſe. Now, when Dauid cryed out, happie is the man to whom
God imputeth not his ſinnes: he was not a naughtipacke, nor an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifte,
nor a diſpiſer of God, that had neuer taſted what it was too
enter into his owne conſcience, and too ranſacke his ſinnes too the
quicke: but contrariwiſe God had choſen him, and annoynted him
by Samuell, he was an excellent Prophete, his reigne was a figure of
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and finally God wrought ſo in him, that he
was as an Angell dwelling among men. And yet for all this, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
and acknowledgeth his ſinnes, and in confeſsing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth
ſorrow and mourne, and is in ſuch vnquietneſſe as if hee were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
vpon a racke or torture, till God was ſo gracious to him as
to make him taſte of his goodneſſe, and he knewe no eaſe till God
had receyued him to mercie. Then if God vouchſafe too forbeare
the examining of our workes, that is all our happineſſe: the onely
way for vs to become happie, is to haue our ſinnes couered, and too
be in Gods fauour, howbeeit not in reſpect of aught that is in our
ſelues, but by his turning away of his countenance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs damned
wretches, ſo as he conſider vs not as of our ſelues, but accept vs for
his onely ſonnes ſake, accordingly as wee ſee howe Dauid ſpeaketh
of it in another text,<note place="margin">Pſ. 143. a. 2.</note> ſaying: Lorde enter not intoo iudgement with
thy ſeruant, for I knowe that no man liuing ſhall bee found righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in thy ſight. VVherefore let vs marke well, that according as
eche man ſhall haue profited in the feare of God, ſo alſo will he be
the more abaſhed at his ſinnes, not for three or foure monethes,
but ſo as hee ſhall abhorre them all his life long, forſomuch as hee
ſeeth that hell is alwayes readie to ſwallow him vp at one chop, if
God ſupplyed not his wantes, and drewe him not as it were out of
the gulfe of death. And therefore it is ſayde that the righteous ſhall
liue by fayth, to the ende that the ſame ſhould ſerue as a leſſon, not
for a three or foure monethes onely, nor for thoſe onely whiche
are not of ſo perfect life as other men: but as a leſſon that God
ſpeaketh, euen to ſuch as are the moſt excellent. And ſurely, that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:23060:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alſo is the thing wherevnto wee muſt referre the woord <hi>Liue,</hi> ſo as
wee may liue not for a litle while, nor for a day, nor for two or three
monethes, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually in Gods free goodneſſe, &amp; ſeeke the ſame
from day too day,<note place="margin">Coloſs. 3. a. 3</note> euen to the end. And although our life be hidden
in this world (as S. Paule ſayeth) and wee ſee nothing but death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs: yet let vs not ceaſſe too repoſe our ſelues vppon this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,
that our life is ſure for aſmuch as God hath taken it intoo his
cuſtodie, and will keepe it ſafely, and therevnto hath left vs ſo good
a pledge of it,<note place="margin">Deut. 30. c. 12. &amp; Rom. 10. a. 6.</note> that is too wit, our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, who died and is
rizen againe for vs, and therefore wee ſhall not neede too ſay any
more, who ſhall go vp into heauen, or who ſhall go downe intoo the
deepe, or who ſhal paſſe ouer the ſea? For the woord is in our mouth
and in our hart, in aſmuch as wee know that our Lord Ieſus Chriſte
went downe too hell, that is too ſay (as wee ſhall ſee in the next ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
by Gods leaue) that he became accurſed for vs, whiche is the
thing that muſte content vs: and afterward went vp intoo heauen,
whereof the gate is opened vnto vs, euer ſince he entred in thither
in our behalfe. Therefore let vs take all our hold there, and ſuffer
our ſelues too be as poore dead men in this worlde, wayting for the
diſcouerie of the lyfe that is promiſed vs: for no doubte but God
will in due tyme diſcouer it and manifeſtly ſhewe it vntoo vs, in
ſuch wyze as wee ſhall fully inioy it as it is preached too vs by his

bycauſe wee bee all giltie before God
[in that wee are found] too haue tranſgreſſed

neuer yet any of the holieſt men ſo perfect,
but that there was alwayes ſome blemiſh, yea and ſtore of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

But now it ſtandeth vs on hand, too haue ſome meanes too ſcape

ſheweth vs here the meane, namely <hi>that Christ hath redeemed vs, euen

Chriſt was not hanged vppon tree in vayne: for he was fayne too

Yee ſee wee are all accurſed, as I haue declared alreadie: and
therefore was our Lorde fayne too receyue in his perſone, the thing
that was due vntoo vs. Now it was written in the Law of Moyſes,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:23060:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Curſed ſhall he bee hangeth on tree.</hi>

ſight too beholde a man ſo disfigured, [and therefore] let it bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
downe, ſayeth he. And at ſuche tyme as God pronounced the
ſayde ſentence, that he which ſhould bee hanged on tree ſhould bee
as it were accurſed and banned: he knew well ynough what he had
determined of his owne onely Sonne. For our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte
ſuffered not that kinde of death by chaunce, nor at mannes pleaſure
or appoyntment.<note place="margin">Act. 2. d. 23 &amp; 4. f. 28.</note> It is true that the vnbeleeuers crucified him: but
that was bycauſe God had ſo ordeyned it by his owne purpoſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it is ſayd,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3 b. 16</note> that God ſo loued the world, that he ſpared not
his onely begotten Sonne, but deliuered him too death for vs. And
in good ſooth, if onely Iudaſsis betraying of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt
had bin the cauſe of his death, and that he had bin haled to that kind
of death by onely violence: it could not bee the foundacion of our
welfare. It behoueth vs to note, that God had appoynted the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
after that ſorte aforehand:<note place="margin">Act. 4. d. 23.</note> according alſo as Sainct Peter trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
thereof more fully in the fourth chapter of the Actes, where
he ſayeth that our Lord Ieſus was ſo crucified by the wicked, as they
attempted not any thing, but that which had bin determined afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
in Gods purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Nowe then, whereas it is ſayde that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was
crucified, wee muſte come too this poynt, that all was done for our
ſaluation, bycauſe it was Gods will too reconcyle vs too himſelfe
by that meane: and that when he pronounced this ſentence, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
is he that hangeth on tree, ſo as it was his pleaſure to haue it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred
in the lawe of Moyſes: he was not ignorant what ſhoulde
happen afterwarde: for he had alreadie determined and ordeyned
it. Then muſte wee match theſe twoo things toogither: that is too
witte, that God with his owne mouth ſayd determinately that who
ſoeuer hung vppon tree ſhould be accurſed: and yet for all that, that
it was his will therewithall, that his owne Sonne ſhould bee hanged
on tree. And why ſo? Too the end he ſhoulde beare our burthen,
according as he is our pledge, &amp; ordeyned to be the principall detter
in our behalf. To the end then that wee might bee ſet free from the
curſe of the Lawe, Ieſus Chriſte became accurſed. Nowe at the firſt
<pb facs="tcp:23060:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fight it might ſeeme hard and ſtraunge that the Lord of glorie, he
that hath all ſoueraine dominion, and before whoſe maieſtie the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Angelles of heauen do tremble and are abaſhed, ſhould be ſubiect
too curſing. But wee muſte go backe too that whiche S. Paule hath
treated of in the firſt to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. c. 28. &amp; 23.</note> namely that the doctrine of
the Goſpell is fooliſhneſſe too mankind, yea euen too the wyzeſt of
them: and that it was Gods will too humble vs after that maner,
bycauſe of our vnthankfulneſſe. For we ſhould haue a good inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to leade vs vnto God, yea euen in wiſedome, if we could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
our ſelues by the things that are ſhewed vs in the whole order
of heauen &amp; earth. But for aſmuch as men are blinde and ſhet their
eyes agaynſt this wiſedome that God ſetteth afore them: therfore
he is fayne too take a new way to the woode, and too draw them to
him as it were by folie. So then let vs not iudge after our owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wit, of the thing that is declared heere, which is, that the ſonne
of God was put vnder the curſe: but rather let vs bee rauiſhed at
ſuch a ſecrete, and giue the glorie vntoo our God, ſeyng he hath ſo
loued our ſoules, as too pay ſo ineſtimable a pryce for the raunſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of them. And ſo little ought this thing to imbace the maieſtie
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, or to deface that which is giuen him in the
holy Scripture: as wee rather haue cauſe too glorifie him the more
for it.<note place="margin">Phil. 3. a. 6.</note> And for proofe thereof, our Lord Ieſus Chriſte (as ſayeth S.
Paule) committed no robberie when he ſhewed himſelfe in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
glorie. And yet notwithſtanding he abaced himſelfe willing,
and not onely clothed himſelf with our nature, and became a paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but alſo ſubmitted himſelf to a death that was both ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
before men, yea and accurſed before God. Then muſt it needes
bee that we were very deere vnto him, ſeing he yeelded himſelf too
ſuch extremitie for our redemption. If wee could taſte the meening
hereof: ſurely wee would giue our ſelues wholly too the magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of that grace, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſufficiently expreſſed by woordes,
and ſurpaſſeth all wiſedome of man. Seyng therefore that wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it not, nor can vtter the hundredth part of it: let vs yet be
as it were aſtoniſhed at it in conſidering ſo much of it as we be able
too comprehend. But heere we ſee ſtill the leudneſſe and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of men, in that whereas S. Paule ſayeth that our Lorde Ieſus
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:23060:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſt became accurſed for vs, it paſſeth and ſlippeth away from vs.
Yea and there are ſome ſo leud, that they take occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſtumbling
and of flinging out of the way, and of eſtraunging themſelues quite
and cleane from the Churche, when they heare this maner of our
reedeming ſet afore vs. VVhat (ſay they) was it of neceſsitie that the
ſonne of God who is the fountayne of all goodneſſe and ought too
make vs all holy, ſhould be curſed? It ſeemeth too them that God
in ſo doyng ment too peruert all order and reaſon. But (as I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
alreadie) it is certaine that God condemneth mens vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
by bringing them to ſuch a kinde of fooliſhneſſe, bycauſe they
came not too him by wiſedome when he ſhewed them that way.
Neuerthe later howſoeuer the cace ſtande, needes muſte our wittes
ſhrinke and our reaſon bee vtterly confounded, ſo as wee may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
Gods ſecretes and wonder at them though they bee hidden
from vs. And againe, whenſoeuer it is ſayd vnto vs that the ſonne of
God became accurſed for vs: it would become vs to enter into the
examinacion of our ſinnes. In ſo doing we ſhall perceyue how loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wee be before God, till our ſinnes and offences bee waſhed away
by the bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Had all the Angelles of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vndertaken for vs, it had bin no ſufficient bayle. Then was there
none other ſatisfaction than the perſone of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte.
And he came not into the world too diſcharge vs of the bonde of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting
death wherein we were bound, by his diuine and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power. How then? By weakeneſſe. And not onely ſo: but alſo he
was fayne to bee counted accurſed, or elſe we ſhould haue lien ſtill
ouerwhelmed with the burthen, and haue periſhed all of vs in that
gulf. Therefore when wee ſee that the ſonne of God who not only
is the vnſpotted Lambe, and the mirrour of all rightuouſneſſe, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and perfection, but alſo the very welſpring thereof, was hilde
accurſed for vs: ought wee not at the ſight thereof to conceyue ſuch
a terrour for our ſinnes, that wee ſhould be as good as ſwallowed vp
with deſpayre, till we be plucked backe againe by the infinite grace
and goodneſſe of our God? So then let vs marke well, that when it
is tolde vs that wee were raunſomed from the curſe of the Lawe,
God intendeth thereby to bryng vs to true humilitie. But that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee, vnleſſe men be vtterly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded in themſelues, ſo as they
<pb facs="tcp:23060:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be aſhamed too loke vpon themſelues, and therewithall alſo afrayd
and diſmayed, knowing that Gods wrath wayteth readie for them,
till our Lord Ieſus Chriſte doo remedie the matter. Thus yee ſee
that all our whole lyfe is lothſome before God, and there is no way
for vs too come too attonement with him, till our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
take vpon him the curſedneſſe that is in vs, and beare it in his owne
perſone. And therefore as oft as wee reade this text, let euery of
vs awake and ſet himſelfe before Gods iudgement ſeate, that wee
may feele there as it were a gulf to ſwallow vs vp quyte and cleane,
and thereat bee abaſhed for very ſhame of our ſelues: and [on the
other ſide] ſo much the more magnifie the grace that is purchaced
for vs in the perſone of the ſonne of God, and keepe our ſelues
warely from diminiſhing his dignitie, in that he is ſayd to be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
and rather thereby be the more prouoked to yeeld him his due
and deſerued prayſe, for that he hath ſhewed himſelf to eſteeme our
welfare ſo highly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Furthermore let vs make our profit of that pledge
of our ſaluation and of the loue that God beareth vs, ſo as we doubt
not but that God liketh well of vs when we come to him,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. c. 18</note> ſeyng he
hath bought vs ſo deere, that (as S. Peter telleth vs in his firſt cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
Epiſtle) it was nother golde nor ſiluer nor any corruptible
thing, but it was our Lord Ieſus Chriſt himſelf that was payd for our
raunſome. Therefore let vs not doubt but that mercie is readie for
vs, as oft as we ſeeke it in his name, for if we ſhould come with any
opinion of our owne deſeruings, what were that woorth? But when
we know how deerely the Sonne is beloued of the father, and how
precious his death was: that is the thing wherein we haue full cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie
that God will alwayes heare vs, and that wee ſhall finde him
mercifull and fauorable towards vs, namely if wee reſt wholly vpon
that which is tolde vs here: which is, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare
not euen to become accurſed for our ſakes. Here withall let vs
marke how S. Paule ſayeth, <hi>that by that meanes the promis of the ſpirit
came vntoo the Gentyles, as it had bin giuen vntoo Abraham.</hi> Nowe by
naming Abraham heere, he ſheweth that the promis belonged firſt
and formeſt too thoſe that came of his race. For the Iewes had as it
were a peculiar intereſt in the heritage of ſaluation, till ſuche tyme
as God opened the gate too the whole worlde, and publiſhed his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:23060:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Goſpell too the end that all men ſhould bee made parttakers of the
redemption that was purchaced by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. Now
then, although the ſayd promis belonged too the Iewes, and was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a ſort peculiar too them: yet was it after them made common
too the whole world. And why? For it conſiſteth in ſpirite, and
not in Ceremonies. By this woorde <hi>Spirite</hi> Sainct Paule ment too
deface all the falſe opinion of thoſe deceyuers, whiche mingled the
Lawe and the Goſpell toogither. He ſheweth that all theſe things,
namely the Sacrifices, Circumciſion, and ſuch other things are now
ſuperfluous. Not that there is no profite for vs too gather by the
Ceremonies in reading the Lawe: but bycauſe the vſe of them is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed.
Yee ſee then that the cauſe why the promis is at this day
called ſpirituall, is for that wee haue no more neede of the old ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
and figures, but are ſimply called and guyded to our God, ſo
as wee may call vppon him with full truſt, and beyng ſo adopted by
him reſt wholly vpon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as the only foundacion
of the Goſpell, and ſeeke all our wantes in him. That in effect is the
thing that S. Paule ment too ſay in this text. And herevpon he vſeth
another reaſon, too ſhewe that wee haue our ſaluation perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled
in the Goſpell, and neede not any other doctrine than that,
and alſo that we bee iuſtified by the free mercie of our God. For the
Lawe (ſayeth he) <hi>was giuen foure hundred and thirtie yeeres after the
promis of ſaluation.</hi> Now when any couenant is made, though it be but
betweene men, yet ought it too bee kepte, if it bee once through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agreed vppon. Therefore it foloweth, that the Lawe was not
giuen too diſanuall the couenant that God had made with Abraham,
chiefly in the behalfe of his linage, and finally in the behalfe of the
whole worlde. True it is that at the firſte bluſh this argument of
Sainct Paules may ſeeme very weake: for wee knowe that ſecond
couenantes do alwayes repeale former couenantes: in ſo much that
although men haue made any bargayne, yet they may aduyze them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
better, and therevppon chaunge their mindes, and ſo the firſt
bargaine ſhall be as good as buried. As much is to bee ſayd of Lawes
and Statutes. For a former Lawe may well bee repealed and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled
by a ſecond Lawe. But Sainct Paule preſuppoſeth the thing
that is too be conſidered in this matter: whiche is, that when a man
<pb facs="tcp:23060:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath once promiſed, yea and ſolemnly bound himſelf: he will not go
backe againe, but bee as good as his woord. Howbeit if bothe the
parties agree too chaunge the thing that they had conſented on, and
be bothe of one minde: then may it be ſo. But it were no fit ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
too take men that are fickleminded and chaungeable through
lightneſſe, or by better aduice: but S. Paule preſuppoſeth a couenant
too be made by a man that will ſtand to it, and not fall too skanning
afterward how to ſhift it off by any meanes at all. For if any of the
parties ſhould doo agaynſt the former couenant, it were a falſehood
that were not to bee borne with among men, bicauſe the things that
are inregiſtred ſo ſolemnly, ought to bee ſtood too and performed
without any gaynſaying. Now then ſhall there be leſſe ſtedfaſtneſſe
in God, than in men which are nothing but vanitie? The Goſpell
therefore muſte continue vnimpeached, notwithſtanding that the
lawe came in after the making of the free promis. This would bee
ſtill darke if it ſhould not be declared in order. I haue ſhewed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
what compariſon S. Paule maketh betweene the Lawe and
the Goſpell. For whereas God promiſeth ſaluation in his Lawe: it
is vpon condition that men ſerue him and doo their duetie towards
him. But that is not done: and therefore are wee ſhet out from all
hope of ſaluation as in reſpect of the Law, not that God is not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
on his ſide, but bycauſe wee keepe not touche with him in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
that which he requireth. It is all one as if a man ſhould ſay,
I am ready to ſell you this thing, ſo you bring mee monie. Now if a
man bring nother monie nor moneys woorth, he can not bee put in
poſſeſsion of the thing [that he would haue]: for the condition is
that he muſt firſt pay for it. So then, God promiſeth vs the heritage
of ſaluation, when wee ſhall haue ſerued him: but wee be neuer the
better for it, bycauſe it is but vpon condicion that we performe that
which he requireth of vs, and wee bee fraughted with all iniquitie,
and haue not any thing in vs but vncleanneſſe and filth, in ſomuche
that wee bee iuſtly odious vnto him. And ſo are wee all condemned
in the lawe: howbeit God receyueth vs of his free goodneſſe in our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in whom he offereth vs the forgiueneſſe of our
ſinnes, and will haue vs ſo too imbrace his offered goodneſſe, as wee
ſhould hold our ſelues wholly to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and vtterly
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:23060:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
renounce ourſelues. But now (ſayth Sainct Paul) let vs ſee whither
went before other in antiquitie: the free promis of ſaluation, or the
law. VVe know the diuerſitie that is betwixt them. Then if the law
were the auncienter, it might ſeeme that that ought to be ſticked
too, bycauſe God doth neuer vnſay his wordes nother is variable.
But if the free promis were the elder, and were made before the
law was publiſhed: it is to be concluded, that God repented hym
not, ne called backe his promis at that time, ne ment to diſanul the
ſayd couenant: for it were too great a diminiſhing of his bountie
and mercie, if we ſhould ſay that he had firſt bound himſelfe of hys
owne free goodneſſe, and promiſed men ſaluation without theyr
deſert: and afterward intended to reſtreyne it, as though he meant
to inrich himſelfe with our good works. It were an auk thing too
talke after that faſhion. For Sainct Paul ſheweth that the free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis
was giuen afore the law: and therefore it followeth that the
law came not in to diminiſh or alter any whit of it, but that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
ſtill in his owne fulneſſe, nature, and force. True it is that
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt had not yet ſhewed himſelfe to the worlde,
when the free promis was made to our father Abraham: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it ſuffiſeth that he was ordeyned to be our mediator, that by
hys meanes men might be reconciled to God. Now if any man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that it ſhould ſeeme then that the law was more than nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
or elſe that there was ſome change and variableneſſe in Gods
purpoſe, ſeeing the law came in: Sainct Paule diſcuſſeth the ſame in
place conuenient, and wee muſt not huddle vp thynges togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for all cannot be vttered at once, nother in an houre nor in
a day. Therefore it is ynough for vs at this tyme too haue thys
poynt made playne and cleere, that the promis whereby God
hath choſen vs intoo the number of his chyldren, was before
the lawe: and alſo that the ſame promis had not any reſpect to
our deſeruings, nor too any woorthineſſe that was in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
but too Gods meere goodneſſe and mercie, whych moued
hym therevnto without looking for any thing in vs, bycauſe hee
ſaw welynough there was nothyng in vs but vtter miſerie:
And finallye that the ſayde promis was grounded in our Lorde
Ieſus Chryſte, who had alreadye done the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ffice of a mediator to
<pb facs="tcp:23060:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make vs way vnto God his father. This being graunted, wee muſt
needes conclude that the promis hath abidden and ſhall abyde for
euer, euen to the worlds end. And that is ſayd expreſly bycauſe the
Iewes gloried of their auncetrie. But Sainct Paule telleth them
that their father Abraham had not the lawe, but was contented
though he vſed ſacrifiſes and ſuch other like thinges. And although
he was circumciſed in the end: yet when he receiued the promis,
there was not as yet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any law writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no nor any circumciſion at
all. For Abraham was vncircumciſed when he receiued the promis,
and yet neuertheleſſe was iuſtifyed before he was circumciſed, and
all that was by fayth. Sainct Paule therefore ſheweth that the
Iewes were greatly ouerſeene, too ſhole out themſelues after that
manner from the reſt of the whole wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld, and to reſt continually
vpon the figures of the law, ſeeing that Abraham their father and
the cheefe patriarch of the Church was iuſtifyed the ſefſame way
that we muſt be at this day, that is to ſaye, by Gods meere mercie,
bycauſe hee knew himſelfe to be a wretched ſinner, and therefore
accurſed and damned in Adam, and that there was no bliſſedneſſe
to be hoped for, other than that which was promiſed hym for our
Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake. Thus yee ſee what wee haue too beare in
mind. And for the ſame cauſe Sainct Paule exhorteth vs heere too
wey well theſe words when it was ſayd vnto Abraham, that all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the earth ſhould be bliſſed in his ſeede.<note place="margin">Gen. 12. a. 3.</note> Now there are
heere two principall poyntes. The one is, that the bliſſedneſſe is
promiſed, not only to Abrahams fleſhly ofſpring (as I haue told you
already) but alſo to all the world in generall. VVe therefore are
made partakers thereof, wee I ſay that are iſſued of the Gentiles,
that is to ſay, of ſuche as were heathenfolke and baniſhed from the
kingdome of heauen. Although then that we were not of that holy
linage whiche God had choſen at the beginning: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it behoued ſaluation to be extended vnto vs. And why ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For it had hin promiſed before, that all Nations ſhoulde be bliſſed.
Seeing it is ſo, ſhall we ſay that God hath cut off the greateſt parte
of his bounteouſneſſe, and will haue no more but the ſayde li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
of Abraham, conſidering that hee hath alreadye tolde vs
that he woulde bee the ſauiour of the whole worlde, and ſhewe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:23060:168"/>
himſelfe a father in time conuenient? Yee ſee then howe the firſte
poynt is, that the making of the ſayde promis vnto Abraham, was
not for his linage alone, but for all men: howbeit that it were not
fulfilled at the firſt daſh. For the time of fulneſſe was not yet come
as we ſhall ſee in the Chapter following. The ſecond point is, that
the bliſſedneſſe which was promiſed to Abraham was for his ſeedes
ſake. For Sainct Paule ſayth that God ſpake not of ſeedes in the
plurall number as of mo than one: but of one onely ſeede: whiche
muſt be concluded to be Ieſus Chriſt. Heere it myght be ſuppoſed
that Sainct Paule buzied his head about a needeleſſe matter. For
the word <hi>Seede</hi> importeth a linage or ofſpring, that is to witte, not
ſome one man or ten, or fortie, but a whole people. Therefore the
Seede of Abraham is the people that came of hym, whyche were
ſo many in number, that it was iuſtly ſayde of them, that they
ſhoulde bee as it were twelue Nations. For when mention is
made of a people: it will bee thought ynough to haue a hundred
thouſand of them togither: and there were many mo in the onely
tribe of Iuda. So then it ſhould ſeeme that Sainct Paule dyd not
ſufficiently conſider what God meant by the word ſeede, when
he ſayd that it is but one only man. But wee muſt wey well the
thyngs that Sainct Paule preſuppoſeth heere as fully certaine and
reſolute: and then ſhall wee perceyue his argumentes to be vtterly
infallible. Abraham had not one ſonne alone: but after Iſmaell, he
had Iſaac alſo. And what became of his eldeſt ſonne? Hee was cut
off from hys houſe, as we ſhall ſee within a whyle, that is to ſay in
the Chapter following. Beholde then, Iſmaell whiche had the
birthright in Abrahams houſe, is neuertheleſſe put out and made
an vtter ſtraunger,<note place="margin">Ge. 21. a. 10.</note> yea and as a rotten member, in ſomuch that it
is ſayd of hym,<note place="margin">Gen. 25. a. 1.</note> Caſt out the ſonne of the handſeruante, for hee
ſhall not inherit in my houſe. Afterwarde Abraham had other
children: but euery of them had their portions giuen vnto them,
and were ſent away.<note place="margin">Gen. 25. c. 22 23.</note> Thus was onely Iſaac left at home vntoo
hym. Anon after, Iſaac had a cupple of children, and they were
twinnes of one wombe. Eſau the firſtborne, whiche ought too
haue hadde the prefermente, was lykewiſe caſt off, ſo as hee
was not counted for the linage of Abraham, nor yet was made
<pb facs="tcp:23060:169"/>
partaker of the promiſed bliſsing. There was no mo left but Iacob.
Yea and although the father bliſſed his ſonne Iacob through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and miſtaking:<note place="margin">Ge. 27. f. 37</note> yet he declareth that it was not in him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke,
or chaunge the thing that hee had vttered with his mouth,
bycauſe he was the inſtrument of the holy Ghoſt. Now then if we
take the ſeede of Abraham for all thoſe that came of his race: The
Iſmaelites or Agarenes (as they be called) and ſuch other lyke, and
moreouer the Edomites alſo ſhould be of his houſhold. But the
heritage is taken quite and cleane from them. Therefore the ſeede
of Abraham muſt be conſidered after a peculiar faſhion. Let vs go
forward with the whole proceſſe. VVe ſee that without faith there
ſhould be no bond to knit any Church togither, nor any aſſurance
whereby to know which is the ſeede of Abraham, or to diſcerne it
from the reſt of the world, but by reſorting to the head, that is too
wit to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Ye ſee then that the vnion of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
dependeth vpon the head, that is to wit vppon the Redeemer.
Seeing it doth ſo, not without cauſe doth Sainct Paule ſay that it
was not ſpoken of many ſeedes, but that wee muſt come too one
man, if we will haue the ſpirituall people: that is to ſay, if wee will
haue the Churche of God, our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt muſt bee the
marke that we muſt begin to looke at, and wee muſt bee gathered
vnto him: and thoſe that are of his body and cleaue vntoo him by
fayth are the folke that are reckened for Gods children and houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
and are verily the ſeede of Abraham, as he diſcourſeth more
at large in the Epiſtle to the Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom 9. b. 6</note> where he ſayth that all they
which come of the ſeede of Iſraell after the fleſh, are not therefore
Iſraelites. And why? For there was but one promiſed chylde, which
was Iſaac.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2. b. 19.</note> So then wee muſt come to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, in
whome all Gods promiſes are Yea and Amen, and in whome they
haue theyr ſubſtance. For without him there is nothing elſe but
ſoattering. And therefore it is ſaid in the firſt Chapter, to the Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1. c. 20.</note>
that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſts office is, to gather togither all
things that were ſcattered, as well in heauen as in earthe, and that
without him al ſhould go to wrecke. But now we ſee more cleerely
how Sainct Paules meening is, that before the law was publiſhed
to the world, (wherevp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> was put and added this condition, that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:23060:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it behoued vs to fulfill all that is conteined therein) God had yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a record of his will before hand: whiche was, that bycauſe hee
ſaw mankind damned and forlorne, he inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to draw out a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
ſort to hymſelfe, and to be mercifull to them. And that was not
for one linage alone, but for all nations as the ſcripture expreſſeth.
And there of the foundation was layd in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For
aſmuch then as our Lord Ieſus Chriſte was already in the tyme of
Abraham, ordeyned to be a mediator to make attoneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t betweene
God and vs, ſo that if we go in his name to ſeeke fauour, it is ready
for vs, and we cannot be diſappointed of our hope: ſeeing it is ſo
ſtabliſhed, there is no chaunge, but wee muſt aſſure ourſelues that
God accepteth vs at this day, ſo we reſt wholly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, knowing that it was no vncerteine couenant whiche was ſo
ratifyed in his name, but that it ſhall endure for euer, and be always
of force. Ye ſee then that we may come freely before God and call
vpon him as our father, bycauſe he hath adopted vs for his chidre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
whiche thing he hath not done in reſpect of any worthineſſe that
was in vs, but of his owne meere mercie, and bycauſe we bee made
one with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt by faith. And by the way, like as we
muſt reiect all opinion and imagination of obteyning fauour at
Gods hand by our owne deſeruings, and of aſſuring our owne ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation:
ſo muſt we looke wel to that which is told vs heere, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that we cannot be partakers of ſuch a benefite but by faith. Now
(as I haue ſayd afore) faith importeth an imbracing of Gods mercy,
whiche thing cannot bee done except wee bee touched earneſtly
with our own wretchedneſſe: for it is not for naught that our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt ſetteth our curſedneſſe before vs as it were in a glaſſe,
by taking vpon him to be accurſed for vs. Faith therefore cannot
be without repentance, for it is vnpoſsible that we ſhoulde ſeeke
our welfare in God, or deſire mercie at his hand, till miſerie touch
vs to the quicke, and make vs to miſlike of it. And ſo theſe skoffers
whiche mocke God, weltring ſtill in their vyces, and beeing as it
were ſotted in them, muſt not looke that euer Ieſus Chriſt ſhoulde
recken them in the number of hys, for they cannot by any meanes
come at him, nother doth he call any other,<note place="margin">Mat. 11. d. 28.</note> than ſuche as are ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerloden
and forweeryed as they can no longer hold out, and
<pb facs="tcp:23060:170"/>
lye groning vnder the burthen of their ſinnes. Thus ye ſee how it
behoueth vs to reſort to our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, and that although
we cannot bring any deſert vnto him, and that all the Ceremonies
of the law, and all the profers that we can make vnto him, do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all further our ſaluation: yet we muſt be prepared to ſuche
lowlineſſe, as we may perceiue our ſtate to be right miſerable, till
God haue taken vs to his mercy: and we muſt be ſo beaten downe
in ourſelues, as wee may feele the curſe that ſhould light vpon vs,
if we were not raunſomed with ſo high and excellent a price, as I
haue declared heeretofore. Yee ſee then that by faythe wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the promis of the ſpirite, and thereby are linked to oure
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and too the ſpirituall ſeede of Abraham. For
although we be not borne of his linage: yet is it ynough that wee
be made atone with him by faith. For then are wee begotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
of that incorruptible ſeed wherof S. Peter ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Pet. 1. d.</note> that is to
wit of Gods word ſuch as it is conteyned in the Goſpell. And bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo begotten agayne, we know that God auoweth vs too be of
the body of his only ſonne. And although wee come of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:
yet fayle we not for all that to be ioyned to the Church, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vntoo
there needeth no more but only fayth: and as for all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
and vertues of men, they muſt vtterly ceaſſe in that behalfe,
and men muſt acknowledge that they cannot bring any thing but
confuſion, ſo as they muſt be faine to ſeeke all at Gods hande, and
that by the meanes whiche hee hymſelfe hath appointed. Now ſith
it is ſo, let vs learne to leaue our wandering heere and there as we
ſee lightheaded men do, whiche are neuer contented with that
which God telleth them, but are euer adding ſomewhat of theyr
owne deuice. Let vs beware of ſuch mingling as ſhall be treated of
more at large after dinner by Gods will. And let Ieſus Chryſte
alone ſuffiſe vs, ſeeyng that our welfare dependeth wholly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
hym alone, and wee ſhall want nothing if wee bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of hym, as we ſee how Sainct Paule bringeth vs backe too
that poynte. Furthermore let vs learne alſo too holde vs too
Gods truth, aſſuring ourſelues that hee cannot abyde too haue
any adding vntoo it, bycauſe that were a marring, reuerſing,
and falſifying of his couenant, wherein oure welfare conſiſteth.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:23060:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But when we haue once imbraced our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, let vs
abyde faſt in him, and let hym ſuffiſe vs for all: and then maye
wee call vppon GOD with full mouth, knowing well that
although wee bee of the race of curſed Adam, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
for aſmuch as wee bee bliſſed agayne in Ieſus Chryſte,
hee acknowledgeth vs alwayes for his Children, bycauſe wee be

            <p>But now let vs fal downe before the maieſtie of our good God

it to the full (for that is vnpoſsible conſidering our frailtie) that hee

For what compariſon is there betwixt his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,
and the ſtate of men which are but a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſhadow? And yet notwithſtanding it is an
ordinarie matter with men too preferre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
before God: which is ſo ougly a thyng,
that if the Sunne were matched with the darkneſſe of hell, it were
not ſo great a confuſion, as to exalt men aboue him to whome all
honor belongeth. But howſoeuer the cace ſtande, it is a vice (as I
ſayd) which hath euermore reigned and ſtil reigneth at this day too
much in the world. For looke what man ſpeaketh, it ſhall ſtrayght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be beleeued: and if folke be loth to do it of their owne good
will, yet muſt they be fayne to hold them to it in all matters that
are allowed by law. Behold, God ſpeaketh, yea and that right ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially,
ſo as he ouerſlippeth not any thing that may giue credite
and aſſuredneſſe to his word: and yet notwithſtanding we bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in a mamering, or elſe we fall to flat reaſoning againſt hym.
Muſt it not needes be then that we be out of our wittes, when wee
diminiſh Gods authoritie after that faſhion, and yeeld more credit
to creatures than to him that made both heauen and earth wyth
his only word, and mainteyneth all things by the ſame? That is the
cauſe why S. Paule in this text vſeth this preface: <hi>I ſpeake</hi> (ſayth he)
<hi>after the manner of men.</hi> For if hee had ſayd no more but thys:
Couenantes ſhall bee kept heere bylow without breaking or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing,
and therefore needes muſt Gods promis bee euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting:
that had bin true, but yet had he ſpoken too coldly of Gods
maieſtie, in raunging him ſo in aray among earthly creatures.
But whereas hee ſayth that hee ſpeaketh after the manner of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:23060:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men: it is all one as if he had ſayd that he vſeth not ſuch maner of
ſtile and ſpeech as might beſeeme to treate of the maieſtie of God.
For both the Sunne and Moone, ought too forgo their brightneſſe
when Gods glory commeth in preſence. All of it muſt needes bee
darkened: what ſhall then become of thoſe that are but as flyes &amp;
frogges crauling vpon the earth? For make men neuer ſo much of
their painted ſheath, yet are they leſſe than naught worthe before
God. Now when wee heere this, wee ſhould bee the more reſtrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that wee vſe no replying, but with all reuerence take in good
worth the thing that is tolde vs heere: that is too wit, that if God
haue voutſafed too giue them full aſſuredneſſe of their ſaluation,
which receiue the promiſe that is preached vntoo them: wee muſt
not take vpon vs to reaſon againſt him. For when a deede is paſſed
among men, if it bee entered of record, it ſhall be receyued and go
for good euidence: and what then ſhall bee done when God ſhall
haue opened his holy mouth to beare vs recorde of his good will?
Is there any ſolemnitie among men that commeth neere too the
glory of God, who will haue vs too ſticke too that which he hath
ſpoken and vttered? True it is (as I haue touched alreadie) that
we ought to fight agaynſt the lewdneſſe which is rooted in vs, too
yeelde credite vnto God: for wee bee ſo bent to miſtruſtfulneſſe
that not one worde of the things whiche God hathe vttered ſhall
euer haue ſetling in our harts, except wee haue fought agaynſt the
vice wherein wee bee ſo ſore intangled. So then, euery of vs when
he commeth too bee taught in Gods worde, muſt examine what
is in himſelfe: and when he ſeeth him ſelfe ſubiect ſtill too many
diſtruſtes and doubts, he muſt miſlike of it, and pray God to touch
all his ſenſes in ſuche wiſe too the quicke, that he may reſt wholly
vpon the thing which he heareth [at his hande] according alſo as
it is the office of the holy Ghoſt, to ſeale in our hearts the truthe
which is certayne inough of it ſelfe, howbeeit that it bee not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
vnto vs, till it be aſſured too vs from aboue. For if wee were
of our owne mouing inclined to beleeue God:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. d. 22.</note> the holy Ghoſte
ſhould not neede to worke in that behalfe.<note place="margin">Eph. 1. c. 13</note> But it is ſayde, that he

neuer be receyued. Yea and wee muſt alſo marke well, that Sainct
Paule ſetteth downe heere two wordes, namely that no man <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth</hi>
or <hi>diſanulleth</hi> the thing that is authorized among men
by lawfull and orderly meanes, nor alſo <hi>addeth</hi> any thing too it.
For althoughe wee bee not alwayes vtter rebels, yet are our
wittes ſtil tickling vs too make ſome additions and gloſes to Gods
worde, and we can not abide to holde vs to the ſimplicitie that is
conteyned there. Then if wee conſider well what wee bee without
ſelfe ſoothing, euery of vs ſhall finde two vices in vs. The one is,
that when God hath ſpoken vnto vs, wee can not throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to ſay Amen vnfaynedly, or to accept his promiſes, or to bee
moued at his threatnings. Men will alwayes vſe ſhiftes, and wee
neede not to ſeeke farre for example thereof: for (as I ſayde) wee
haue experience of it in our ſelues. The other is, that although we
yeelde God his due honor in beleeuing his worde too bee true
and infallible: yet wee will alwayes bee adding vnto it, and that
doo wee ſee too muche in the Papacie. VVhereof commeth that
confuſion or mazeworke whiche wee ſee too bee in the ſeruing of
God, the great number and diuerſitie of faſhions, and the great
ſtore of abuſes and falſehoods, but of that men haue not yeelded
too the things which God ſheweth them, but haue made additions
and confuſed medlies of things that came of their owne brayne?
In what maner doo the Papiſtes indeuer them ſelues too ſerue
God? Euery man hathe his ſeuerall deuotion by him ſelfe, and
therewithall an infinite number of gewgawes. Theyr ſaying is, that
the Churche hath commaunded all: but what ſoeuer it bee, it is all
of mans inuenting. And what a thing is that? Dyd not God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
foreſee what he woulde lyke of?<note place="margin">1. Sa. 15. e. 22.</note> He telleth vs that in
the Lawe wee haue all perfection, and that he will not haue vs too
holde any other rule.<note place="margin">Oſee. 6. b. 6.</note> Agayne he addeth that he had leuer haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedientneſſe
than all the ſacrifices in the world.<note place="margin">Mat. 9 b. 13. &amp; 12. a. 7.</note> His minde is too
holde men in awe, that they ſhoulde not preſume to mingle any
thing of their owne brayne and imagination. But what and if God
haue ſayde ſo? Yet will men beare him downe that this and that
were good, and they will needes adde a hundred times more than
he had ordeined. Yea and (which worſe is) they holde ſcorne of that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:23060:172"/>
which he requireth, and exacteth moſt ſtraightly, and in the meane
while magnifie fond toyes and pelting traſh, which not only are of
no value before him, but alſo lothſome to him, bicauſe he diſallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
all things that men thruſt vpon him after that faſhion to ſpite
him with. Now then we ſee hereby how eager and preſumptuous
alſo men haue always bin, in thruſting themſelues forward to ſerue
God after their own liking: howbeit that was but a peruerting of
all the holy ſcripture. For beholde, whereas God telleth vs that the
cheefe ſacrifice which he demaundeth of vs, is that we ſhould reſort
vnto him, and offer vp our requeſts after the maner which he hath
appoynted to be the meane for vs to come familiarly and boldly
vnto him, that is to wit, by making our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate:
Men will needes haue vs pray vnto Saincts deceaſſed, and
to make them our patrons and aduocates to be a meane betweene
God and vs, when wee go about too ſeeke his fauour. As muche is
to be ſayde of all the reſt of their doctrine. God hathe commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vs too pray one for another: and they ſay wee muſt pray for
the wretched ſoules that are in Purgatorie. And who hathe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
all this? Men haue ſurmiſed that ſo it ſhould be, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their ſurmiſing, ſo it muſt bee. Lo what their raſhneſſe
is. God hath ordeyned his ſacraments for vs too aſſure vs of his
promiſes by their meanes, and he will haue them to bee as Seales
of ouermeaſure, that our infirmitie may bee the better ſuccoured.
VVee haue Baptiſme, whereby God dooth vs to wit, that wee bee
waſhed and clenſed from all our ſpottes by the bloudſhed of hys
only ſonne, &amp; that therewithall he accepteth vs as his members of
his body, &amp; bringeth vs into his Church. Nowe, the Papiſts are not
contented with this ſimplicitie, but will needes haue ſpittle, and
taper lighte, and other gewgawes that are irkeſome to thinke of.
And whence come ſuche additions, but of this diueliſh boldneſſe,
that when God had ſtabliſhed all that was meete and conuenient
for the turne, and in ſuch wiſe as nothing was to be miſliked, men
coulde not finde in their hearts too take it in good worth, but (as
I ſayde afore) were inflamed with ſuch an ouer eagerneſſe and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
as they muſt needes bee adding, mingling, chaunging, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing,
and turmoyling without ende or meaſure. So muche the
<pb facs="tcp:23060:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more therefore doth it ſtand vs vpon, to hold faſt that which God
ſheweth vs by S. Paule: namely that for as muche as God hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
his worde, it is not lawfull for men to adde any thing too
it, but that all our wiſdome is to ioyne with him, and too receyu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
without ſcanning what ſoeuer commeth out of his mouth. And if
this be verified of the promiſe that was made vnto Abraham: much
more reaſon is it that we now a dayes ſhould keepe the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie,
ſeeing we haue much fuller inſtruction in the Goſpel. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſubſtance of the thing that is preached vnto vs now a dayes,
differeth not from that which Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heard of Gods owne mouth.
But what ſoeuer it be, we haue now a much more familiar maner
of teaching, bicauſe our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt who is the day ſunne of
righteouſneſſe, is manyfeſted vnto vs. Seeing then that there is
no hardneſſe at all vnto vs, if we liſt to giue eare: is it not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable
trayterouſneſſe, if our luſts be ſtill itching too adde one
thing or other? Howſoeuer wee fare, let vs learne to holde vs to
that which God hath taught vs. For we may not deale otherwiſe
than with ſuch modeſtie in that behalfe, bicauſe that if we ſwarue
neuer ſo little aſide from that rule, by and by wee bee in Satans
ſnares, readie to be caried one way or other to all confuſion. But
let vs bee well aduiſed: and ſeeing that S. Paule ſaythe heere,
that the lawe could not any whit impeache the promiſe which was
made before: what ſhall become of vs in theſe dayes, if wee wyll
needes haue the inuentions of mens fooliſhe heades, to impeache
the pureneſſe of the Goſpell, ſo as it may not bee perceyued whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God or his creatures bee more maſter? Thus yee ſee what
ought to holde vs in awe, that wee paſſe not our bounds, but that
our fayth bee alwayes wholly ruled and directed by the ſingle
worde of God, and that wee reiect what ſoeuer is added by man.
And that is in effect the thing whiche wee haue too gather heere.
Nowe as touching that S. Paule ſayth, <hi>that the couenant was establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
of God towarde Ieſus Christ foure hundred yeeres before the Lawe.</hi>
Heerein wee ſee the ſame thing whiche I touched this morning:
namely that when God vttered him ſelfe to be a father, whether it
were towards Abraham, or towards Noe, or towards any other, it
was not but by the meanes of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. For there is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:23060:173"/>
as it were a deadly foade betweene God and man, in reſpecte that
they be corrupted by originall ſinne, in ſo much that if God let vs
alone in our natural plight, ſurely al our thoughts are curſed, al our
affections are crooked, frowarde, and full of ſtubborneſſe, &amp; al our
wittes are beſtayned with vices, ſo that wee haue not one ſounde
and vninfected place in vs, from the crowne of our head to the ſole
of our foote. And for as much as we be ſo contrarie to God, and to
his will: it muſt needes be that wee are his enimies, for he can not
be vnlike him ſelfe. Then if God be our enimie, we can not come
to him to hope for any fauour or grace at his hande, excepte Ieſus
Chriſt be as a meane to reconcile vs agayne. Thus yee ſee that the
fathers of all ages preaced not vnto God, but by the guyding of
the mediator. And that is the cauſe why S. Paule in this texte
ſayth, that the couenant was made too Ieſus Chriſte. Truely Ieſus
Chriſt had no neede of any of the promiſes that were made to the
fathers of olde time, and are continued ſtill by God euen vnto
this day towards vs: but yet did he receyue them as head of the
Churche. So wee ſee that God had not an eye ſimply vnto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
nor too the worthineſſe that was in him, but that Abraham
was a member of the Churche, whereof Ieſus Chriſt was alwayes
the head.<note place="margin">Pſ. 89. c. 37.</note> Alſo when God choſe Dauid too bee King, and tolde
him that his ſeate ſhoulde endure as long as the Sunne and the
Moone in the skye: it was not for any woorthineſſe that was in
Dauids owne perſon, but it was all done in reſpect of our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt. And likewiſe at this day, when God telleth vs that he
will be fauorable too vs if wee ſeeke him, yea and that he will haue
vs come boldely vnto him: it is not in any other reſpect than for
that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath gathered vs togither to bee of his
body. And this ſerueth vs too two purpoſes. The one is too bring
vs to humilitie. For if euery of vs marke well what he is: wee bee
Gods enimies. By reaſon whereof the gate is ſhutte agaynſt vs,
ſo as wee can not hope for any fauour at his hande, but rather
feele and conceyue him too bee our iudge, alwayes readie too
thunder downe vpon our heades, and too ouerwhelme vs. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whereas it is ſayde that the promiſes are made vnto vs by the
meanes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: we muſt ſhrink down our heads,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:174"/>
and acknowledge that Gods only begotten ſonne is his only der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and that the fauour which we haue is only in him [and for his
ſake.] Let that ſerue for the one poynt. The other is, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
haue ſo much the more certentie in that reſpect. For if ſuche
troubles as theſe doo come in our minds [ſo as we think with our
ſelues] what art thou? thinkeſt thou that God voutſafeth too
ſtoupe downe vnto thee? Thou art but a worme of the earth, duſt,
cinder, and rottenneſſe. Moreouer thou haſt a Sea of vices in thee,
and therfore what a preſumptuouſneſſe were it for thee to thinke
thy ſelfe to be one of Gods children, till he come to ſeeke thee? If
wee bee tempted after this maner to diſtruſt, let vs bethinke vs of
that which is ſpoken to vs in this text: that is to wit, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
was made on the behalfe of Ieſus Chriſt. Although then that
there be nothing in vs but all wretchedneſſe, yet it ought to ſuffiſe
vs that there is worthineſſe, power, and righteouſneſſe inoughe in
the ſonne of God, and that he alſo is the perſon in whome wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the promiſes. Nowe remayneth for vs too knowe, by what
meanes wee come vnto God: namely by the [promiſed] ſeede,
which is but only one, as S. Paule addeth: For if men turne neuer
ſo little from our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, by and by they be cut off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the kingdome of heauen. And if this was ſpoken too beate downe
the pride and falſe preſumption that was among the fleſhly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Abraham: what is to be ſayde to vs, whiche are but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birthes
borne out of time in compariſon of them, as S. Paule ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vs in the tenth to the Romanes? VVherefore let vs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
that all ſuch as content not them ſelues with our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, do vtterly renounce al hope of their ſaluation. For there
are not two or three, but onely one Mediator (ſayth S. Paule) like
as it is not ſayde, that there is any more than one ſeede. I haue told
you alreadie, that many come of Abrahams linage, which yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
were not heires of the promiſe. Then if we come not
to Ieſus Chriſt to be gathered vnto him: ſurely God diſclaymeth
vs, and telleth vs that wee bee none of his, and that he will haue
none acquayntance at all with vs. Therfore although the world go
aſtray to be toſſed too and aad fro, according as we ſee how on the one
ſide the Papiſts haue infinite meanes to come vnto God, &amp; lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:23060:174"/>
on the other ſide the Turkes and the Iewes, all whiche haue
quite forſaken our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: yet let vs leane wholly vnto
him, and aſſure our ſelues that if we be once ingreffed into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
by fayth, and made one with him, the promiſes belong vnto vs.
VVhy ſo? For they were giuen vnto him, not for his owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie,
as I haue ſayd alreadie (for he had no neede of them) but for
our behoofe that we might be made partakers of them. Thus yee
ſee in effect how wee ought to make our profite of this texte. But
wee haue too marke alſo, concerning the antiquitie which S. Paule
treateth of heere, that the doctrine of the Goſpell is no new deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
thing, nor a thing that had bin vnknowen of before: but that
God hathe continually euer ſince Abrahams tyme vnto this day,
called vs to be his adopted children, &amp; proued him ſelfe to be our
father. Truely it was euen before Abraham was borne: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it muſt ſuffice vs, that as then there was made ſo full diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of it, as wee knowe that God did then beginne to publiſhe the
things that are conteyned in the Goſpell at this day, and that the
fathers had none other way wherby to come to ſaluation, than the
ſame that is ſhewed vs at this day. And this is very needefull for
vs. For many buſie bodies doo now vnskilfully imagine, that the
Goſpell was neuer heard of before: yea &amp; there are of theſe ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of God, and heatheniſhe felowes, who to imbrace the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of God, &amp; of his Goſpell, ſay it came vp within theſe ſixteene
hundred yeres, and that it was neuer heard of in the world before.
VVhat (ſay they)? had God forſaken the world quite and cleane?
As who ſhould ſay, we ſaw not with our eyes, and might not feele
with our fingers, that God neuer varied, but that euen at ſuch time
as it pleaſed him to adopt Abraham, then were we alſo included in
him, and the gate of ſaluation was opened vnto vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> howebeit that
the accompliſhment therof came not till the full time was expired,
as I haue declared this morning, and ſhall declare more at lengthe
in time conuenient.<note place="margin">Eph. 3 b. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> And heere yee ſee why S. Paule ſaythe that
the preaching of the Goſpell was a ſecrete that had bin kepte hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
from the beginning of the worlde. But yet had God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
it before, and made ſufficient promiſe of it, as wee haue
ſeene. Heere yee ſee alſo why wee bee called Abrahams ofſpring.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:175"/>
For wee belong no whit at all to him in reſpecte of the fleſhe. But
fayth is a ſufficient bonde too knit vs vnto him. Furthermore wee
ſee that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, who is the pledge of mens wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
is nowe reuealed vnto vs, too the ende that wee ſhoulde
haue the better aſſurance that wee bee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hys, and that hee wyll
holde vs for the members of hys body. And that is the cauſe why
Chriſt ſayde that Abraham ſawe his daye, and was glad of it. The
Iewes alledged the worthineſſe of the Patriarke: yea (ſaith Chriſt)
as though your father Abraham had not reſted vpon the things
that were ſpoken too him concerning mee.<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. g. 56</note> Therefore he ſawe my
day, and it was the thing wherein he tooke all his comforte, in ſo
muche that he had not any other hope of ſaluation, than by the
beleefe which he had in the doctrine which is preached vnto you
at this day by the Goſpell. That alſo is the very ſame thing that is
ſpoken of Iohn Baptiſt by the Prophet Malachie,<note place="margin">Mal. 4. b. 6.</note> namely that he
was ſent to knit the hearts and mindes of the fathers to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
And this is not ſpoken only of the perſon of Iohn Baptiſt, but
it belongeth alſo to the doctrine of the Goſpell. Yee ſee then that
the thing wherevnto our Lorde calleth vs, is that although Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
be rotten in the earth ſo long tyme ago: yet wee may aſſure our
ſelues, that there is none other promiſe than that for vs too truſt
vnto, ſo wee be knit vnto him by fayth, and doo ſo agree togither
as wee can call vpon God with the ſame minde wherewith he was
gouerned, according as in very deede he had his minde fixed vpon
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Nowe then for ſo muche as wee bee vnited
vnto Abraham, let vs tende to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and let him
be our aming marke, and our ſhoote anker, till wee be all aſſembled
togither, and gathered vp into the heauenly kingdome. Lo what
wee haue to conſider when mention is made of the promiſe that
was made before the lawe. Yea and wee ought to bee greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
to conſtancie, when wee perceyue that our father Abraham
did alwayes wayte for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, althoughe it were
ſo long ere he ſhould be diſcouered to the world, and it was tolde
hym that hys ſeede ſhoulde bee hilde priſoners in a ſtraunge
lande. After that God had tolde him that all the worlde ſhould bee
bliſſed in his ſeede: he addeth, and yet for all that, thinke not that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:23060:175"/>
this ſhall bee performed within theſe twoo or three dayes, or a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres hence: for thou thy ſelfe muſte firſt die, thou thy ſelfe
muſte firſte bee conueyed hence intoo a ſtraunge countrie, where
thyne ofſpring ſhall bee oppreſſed with all tyrannie and crueltie. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thy ſelfe I will be reuendged of it, but yet muſt thy ſeede ſmart
in the meane while. Abraham herde all this: Againe after that the
lawe was giuen, there paſſed other twoo thouſand yeeres more ere
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte came. Nowe coulde Abraham neuer haue
truſted too that which was ſpoken too him, if he had not bin armed
with heauenly power, for he himſelfe could not inioy the benefite
that was offered him, nother ſhould his children inioy it that were
too come. Yee ſee then that two thouſand and foure hundred yeeres
were then to paſſe,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11. b. 18.</note> and yet notwithſtanding Abraham repented him
not that he had forſaken his fathers houſe, (as the Apoſtle declareth
in the eleuenth too the Hebrewes) but hilde on his race ſtill, albeit
that God intended too trie his patience too the vttermoſte. Of
much more reaſon ought wee now adayes too go on ſtedfaſtly whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſoeuer God calleth vs, and too hold vp our heades till we come
too the crowne of glorie, not withſtandyng that as now it bee hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
from vs, and that wee muſt bee fayne too beleeue and hope for
things that ſurmount all our capacitie and which wee cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue.
Thus yee ſee how wee ought too put this text in vre. Nowe
herevpon S. Paule concludeth, <hi>that if the inheritance come by the lawe,
it ſhall not come by fayth.</hi> But God gaue Abraham all things in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of fayth: and therefore it is too bee concluded, that the Lawe
muſt needes ceaſſe when men go about to get fauour at Gods hand,
and the prayſe of our ſaluation muſte bee yeelded all wholly vntoo
him. S. Paule in ſpeaking here of inheritance, meeneth two things.
The one is that what ſoeuer God hath at any time promiſed vs, is of
his owne meere free goodneſſe: for an inheritance is not a wages
or hyre. True it is that a father in giuing his children their heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
may well ſay, See how I take paynes for you. Marke what ſhall
come of it. Yee ſhall haue my goodes among you. But yet howe
ſoeuer the father deale with them, he hath none other reſpect than
too his owne kinſhip. He laboreth and taketh great paynes too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
for ſuch as are ſo alied vnto him. Seing then that heritages are
<pb facs="tcp:23060:176"/>
things of free gifte among men: wee muſt not take eternall lyfe as
a deſerued wages or hyre at Gods hand. For why, it is an heritage.
Marke it for a ſure grounde, that heere all woorthineſſe of men is
excluded. For when a man makes his children his heires, he paſſeth
not whither they haue done any greate woorke or no, or whither
they bee fayre or foule, or whither they bee one thing or other:
but it is ynough for him that they bee his children, and that his
minde is too prouide for them. Another poynt is, that Sainct Paule
in ſo ſaying, giueth vs an incling that wee bee all of vs vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
of God, ſo as wee cannot (no not euen in this tranſitorie
lyfe) inioy any thing at all, but by the onely meere grace of God.
True it is that the Sunne ſhyneth as well vppon the faythleſſe as
vppon the faithfull, and all men are nurriſhed alike with the things
that God giueth and graunteth vnto them: but yet howſoeuer they
fare, the vnbeleeuers poſſeſſe not any thing by iuſt tytle. They are
but theeues, and muſte yeelde account of the benefites and goodes
whiche they haue receyued of God, euen too the laſt droppe of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
bycauſe they were not ſanctified, but defiled them aſmuche as
in them lay, bycauſe they had no fayth, whiche (as ſayeth Sainct
Paule) is the thing whereby the benefites that God giueth vntoo
vs are made cleane.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. b. 5.</note> That is the way for vs too vſe them lawfully:
but lette fayth bee away, and there ſhall be nothing elſe but vnclen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
For why, if my handes be foule, and I handle the preciouſeſt
things in the worlde with them, they ſhall bee rayed with the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
of my handes. Euen ſo is it when wee abuſe Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites.
The vnbeliefe that is in vs defileth all: and in the ende, all
creatures muſte crie out for vengeance vppon vs, bycauſe wee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed
them if we poſſeſſed them not with faith.</p>
            <p>Yee ſee then that wee cannot inioy any thing at all, vnleſſe wee
bee Gods children. And for the ſame cauſe alſo, Sainct Paule in
the fourth too the Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. c. 13.</note> thinkes it not ynough too ſet downe
the heauenly lyfe and euerlaſting ſaluation: but alſo nameth the
heritage of the worlde, and ſayeth that Abraham was made heire of
the worlde, and that the ſame was not for that man alone, but for
all menne in generall. Therefore whereas God adopteth vs and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs that he will be gracious vntoo vs, it is too the end that while
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:23060:176"/>
wee liue heere beneath, wee ſhould bee fedde by his hand, and he in
giuing vs foode make vs too taſte aforehand of the loue whiche he
beareth vs, and of the care that he hath ouer vs. Too bee ſhorte,
wee may and ought alſo too beholde Gods fatherly goodneſſe in
all his creatures. Doo wee open our eyes and looke vpon the light
of the Sunne? Euen there dooth God ſhewe himſelfe a father to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
vs. VVhen wee eate and receyue our ſuſtenance, God
reacheth out his hande too ſhewe, that wee bee alreadie fedde by
him as his owne children. Too bee ſhorte, in all things and by all
meanes he maketh vs too taſte his fatherly loue aforehand, too the
intent wee ſhoulde bee confirmed in the things that he ſheweth vs
in the Goſpell: that is too wit, that he hath reſerued a better heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
for vs, as for his children whom he hath adopted. Then muſt
all creatures direct vs vntoo heauenward. But ſurely wee doo the
cleane contrarie: for wee apply Gods creatures to our owne luſtes,
ſo as wee behilde downe ſtill by them heere. To bee ſhorte, looke
how many helpes God hath giuen vs too drawe vs too him: ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
lettes haue wee too holde vs backe in the worlde. For wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
paſſe too knowe howe wee ſhould bee reckened for Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
ſo wee may liue at our eaſe in this worlde: that is ynough for
vs. But yet for all that, it ſtandeth vs greatly on hande too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue,
that God dooth alreadie in this worlde ſhewe himſelfe a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
towardes vs, and intendeth too doo vs too wit what a care he
hath of vs, too the ende wee ſhoulde learne too referre our ſelues
wholly vntoo him, and there too reſte. Yee ſee then, that by this
woorde <hi>Heritage</hi> or <hi>Inheritance,</hi> God ſheweth, firſte that whatſoeuer
he offereth vs is of his owne meere free bounteouſneſſe: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
that wee bee ſo curſed, that wee haue no righte too any
thing, no not euen too a droppe of water: excepte God make vs
his heyres, and that muſte bee done all onely for our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſtes ſake. And therefore we muſt once againe call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance
how wee haue heretofore ſeene, that the promis was made
too Ieſus Chriſte. Then is not Abraham the ſtay and ſhoote anker
thereof.<note place="margin">Hebr. 1. a. 2.</note> And for that cauſe alſo is our Lord Ieſus named the heyre
of all things: and looke what he hath peculiar too himſelfe, that
doothe he communicate too vs, as too the members of his bodie.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:177"/>
In that reſpect alſo doth S. Paule ſay,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. d. 27.</note> that the ſaying whiche is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the ſeuenth verſe of the eyght Pſalme, (whiche is, that he is
made Lord of all things) ought too bee applied firſt of all to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone.
True it is that the ſayd text is ſpoken of all men, according as
wee ſee how God hath put all beaſtes of the earth in ſubiection to
man, ſo as they bee fayne too die too giue vs ſuſtenance, and too
clothe vs and keepe vs warme. Againe, we ſee how the earth yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs frutes. Therefore the lordſhip of the worlde is giuen vntoo
vs, how beit, that is but by the meanes of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte.
For (as I haue touched alreadie) if wee bee ſeparated from him, wee
bee forthwith ſo cut of from Gods houſe, that the inheritance of
them belongeth no more vntoo vs, than too the furtheſt ſtraungers
in the worlde. But nowe let vs come too the chiefe poynt that is
contayned heere. S. Paule ſayeth, <hi>that this heritage commeth not of the
Lawe, but of Fayth.</hi> VVhereas he vſeth theſe twoo ſpeaches, and cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleth
them toogither: they bee things flat contrarie as I haue tolde
you heretofore. Not that the lawe is contrarie too fayth: but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that too bee iuſtified before God, and too obtayne fauour and
mercie at his hand, cannot come too paſſe by the Lawe. The Lawe
was not giuen too that end, (as we ſhall ſee in the next Sermon) but
too the cleane contrarie. So then, ſeyng that the heritage commeth
by fayth: we muſt conclude that our woorkes can doo nothing, and
that wee muſt bee fayne too come to God vtterly emptie, as poore
beggers too craue too bee filled by him, bicauſe wee haue not one
drop of goodneſſe in our ſelues. Yee ſee then whereat S. Paule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
when he ſayeth that the inheritance co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of fayth and not
of the lawe, according alſo as God gaue it vntoo Abraham in reſpect
of fayth. And let vs marke, that if wee bee not able too deſerue any
nurriſhment in this worlde: what ſhall wee bee able too doo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
the poſſeſsing of the kingdome of heauen? VVhen there is
any talking of corruptible ſuſtenance, it is nothing in compariſon
of the heauenly glorie.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. d. 28.</note> For it is ſayde that wee ſhall bee made
parttakers of the glorie of our God, and that then wee ſhall bee
all in all things. But as now wee cannot deſerue ſo much as one bit
of bread: for the inheritance co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of fayth: that is to ſay, all that
euer God hath promiſed men, is of his owne meere free goodneſſe.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:23060:177"/>
And howe can wee then purchace the Realme of Paradice? what a
pryde is it for men to preſume to come to it by their own ſtrength?
muſt it not needes be that they are caried away with a terrible rage?
Moreouer, in ſaying that God gaue all things to our father Abraham
in reſpect of his fayth, S. Paule doth yet better expreſſe and ſhewe
that which I haue told you alreadie: namely that man is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
nothing of himſelf, and that he muſt bee fayne too haue all of
free gift. He had ſayd afore, (as we haue ſeene already) that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
were made and vttered: but here he vſeth the woord <hi>Giuing.</hi>
As if he ſhould ſay, here is not a bargayne betweene partie &amp; partie,
too ſay I will do this, and thou ſhalt do that: I wil ſell, and thou ſhalt
buy: but God doth freely giue, and man doth but onely receiue. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then that we muſt come vnto God to receyue that which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
vs, and that we haue not any other title to the things that we
looke for at his hand, than only by free gift: let vs forget all the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
which we imagine to be in our ſelues, and acknowledge that
we be nothing. And ſurely S. Paule vſeth one other maner of ſpeach,
which ſerueth to expreſſe better the thing that is ment here: which
is, that if the heritage came by the Law, the promis were diſanulled,
and ſo conſequently faith. Therefore to be ſure of the promis, the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage
muſt needes come by faith. And my alledging herof, is bicauſe
the thing that is ſpoken in this text, might ſeeme darkſome by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the ſhortneſſe of it: namely that the heritage of ſaluation, yea
and all the benefits that God beſtoweth vpon vs in this world, muſt
proceede of our fayth: that is too ſay, without bringing any thing at
all of our owne, but onely by receyuing all things of Gods free gift.
For why? Put the cace that wee ſhoulde hope too receyue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
too our woorkes, according to our owne woorthineſſe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
too our deſertes towardes God: how might wee bee ſure
of the promiſes? Truely wee ſhould hang alwayes in a mamering:
for it would behoue vs ſtill too conſider thus, verie well, how haſte
thou diſcharged thy ſelfe? what haſte thou done? And ſo ſhoulde
fayth bee vtterly daſhed. But fayth ought too aſſure vs fully of Gods
good will towardes vs: whiche thing it ſhoulde not doo, but wee
ſhould hang ſtill in doubte, and it ſhoulde bee but a bare opinion, and
that opinion ſhould bee but an illuſion of Satan. For all they which
<pb facs="tcp:23060:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thinke too haue any thing by their owne power, muſt needes be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
by the Diuell. Yee ſee then how it is too groſſe a mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
when wee thinke too deſerue aught at Gods hand. But howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
we go to woorke, though our eyes be ſeeled vp with hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
and we take our ſelues too be wonderfull fellowes: yet can wee
not haue any certaintie in vs without fayth. For hee that once done
away, by and by the promiſes fall to the ground: we can haue none
aſſurance of them. Therefore wee muſt conclude that the heritage
commeth by faith, too the end wee may haue no more pride in vs:
that is to wit, too the end wee hope not any more that wee can bee
able too do aught of our ſelues, or that we haue any free will to take
or refuze the grace that is offered vs. VVe muſt forget all the things
which men are woont to chalendge to themſelues: all muſt be layd
vnderfoote: we muſt come voide of all power, emptie, and hungrie,
and ſeeke at Gods hand the things that we want, and not doubt but
that he hath ynough in himſelf to ſuccour vs with, and that he hath
alſo put into our Lord Ieſus Chriſt all things that wee can wiſh, and
all that he knoweth to be for our behoofe and profite. Thus yee ſee

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee haue ſeene heretofore, that before the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of the Lawe, God had alreadie ſhewed his
goodneſſe, yea euen his free goodneſſe in the
linage of Abraham, too the end that the Iewes
ſhould not haue any other leaningſtocke for
their ſaluation, than the ſayd promis that God
would haue pitie vppon them and ſhewe them
mercie, in ſending them a Redeemer, by whom they ſhould obtaine
forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes. Herevppon S. Paule inferreth, that the
lawe which came after the promis, muſt not diſanul that which God
had already ordeyned and concluded: howbeit that in the meane
while it might ſeeme that the lawe was added too help the promis,
as though the promis had bin weake of it ſelfe. For after the ſame
maner doth the Apoſtle reaſon in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes:<note place="margin">Hebr. 8. b. 7.</note> and
bycauſe it is ſayd by the Prophet Ieremie, that God will giue a new
lawe, that is too wit the Goſpell: the Apoſtle inferreth, that then it
muſt needes followe that the lawe which was giuen by Moyſes was
weake and had no ſuch perfection in it as a man might truſt vntoo.
It may well ſeeme at the firſte bluſh, that a man might ſay as much
on the contrarie parte: namely that for aſmuch as the lawe was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
after the promis, it was done for ſome accompliſhment bycauſe
the promis was not ſufficient of it ſelf, vnleſſe it borowed perfection
elſe where, for otherwyſe the lawe might ſeeme too be needeleſſe.
But it were againſt all reaſon that God ſhoulde haue giuen a neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
doctrine. Therefore it ſtandeth vs on hande too knowe too
what purpoſe the lawe ſerueth, and too what ende it was giuen, or
elſe wee ſhall alwayes bee of opinion that the promis was vnſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and could not ſaue vs but in parte. Herevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. Paule declareth,
that God in giuing of his lawe had a farre other meenyng and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
than they imagine whiche ſeeke their rightuouſneſſe in it, and
make it the meanes of their ſaluation. For it was giuen (ſayeth he)
<pb facs="tcp:23060:179"/>
bicauſe of tranſgreſsion: not for that there needed a bridle bicauſe
the world was wicked and froward: for we know there were lawes
and ſtatutes made among menne, according too the vyces that had
neede too bee redreſſed. If all men were Angelles, ſo as there were
nothing out of ſquare, but euery man behaued himſelfe well of his
owne accord, ſo as there needed no amendment: then were Lawes
too no purpoſe at all. VVhat is the cauſe then that we haue neede
of ſo many lawes and ſtatutes? The naughtineſſe of men, bycauſe
they ceaſſe not too ruſh out intoo all euill, and therefore remedie is
fayne to bee prouided for it: like as if there were no diſeaſes, there
ſhould neede no phiſike: but mens vnrulineſſe cauſeth diſeaſes, and
therefore remedies muſt needes bee prouided. So then ſeyng that
men haue neede to be bridled and as it were reſtreyned, it is a ſure
record that they are bent too all euill, and vtterly frowarde of their
owne nature. But S. Paule ment not after that ſort in his foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
ſaying: He intended too paſſe further: namely that God
purpoſed too bewray mennes wickedneſſe by meanes of the Lawe.
And this reaſon is peremptorie, too ſhewe that wee bee not able to
purchace rigtuouſneſſe: for heate and cold come not bothe out of
one ſpring. If a fountayne bee ſweete, there is no ſeeking of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in it: but cleane contrarywiſe, if a fountaine be bitter or brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh,
ſweete water muſt be ſought for in another ſpring. Euen ſo is it
with the Law. And wherefore was it giuen? To proue men double
giltie before God, that their hypocriſie might not ſtand them in any
more ſtead, nor they haue occaſion to flatter themſelues any more,
or too ſhrowde themſelues vnder their vayne excuces as they haue
bin wont too doo. And that is the cauſe why S. Paule in the fourth
too the Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. c. 15</note> reaſoneth that a man cannot bee iuſtified by the
Law. For (ſayeth he) the Lawe bringeth nothing but wrath. And by
the woord wrath he meeneth Gods vengeance. Lyfe and death can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come both of the Lawe, but in ſundry reſpectes. Now the Lawe
is deathfull vntoo all of vs, ſo that it condemneth vs and ſheweth vs
that wee bee all curſed and abhominable before God: and therfore
what a fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dneſſe is it to ſeeke rightuouſneſſe by it, as who ſhould ſay
that God ought to take vs into his fauour for the keeping of it? But
he declareth this mater more familiarly in the .vii. to the Romanes,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:23060:179"/>
when hee ſayth that by the Lawe ſinne becommeth out of meaſure
ſinfull.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. b. 8</note> For there is ynough to condemne vs though there were no
lawe at all, according as it is ſayde, that they which ſinne without
lawe,<note place="margin">Ro. 2. b. 12.</note> ſhall periſh without lawe, that is to wit, although the heathen
folke had no inſtruction whereby to be rebuked: yet had they a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde
ingrauen in their conſciences, which did find them guiltie. Ye
ſee then that men are ſufficiently worthy to be condemned though
God go not vp into his iudgement ſeate, nor cyte them, nor examin
them, howbeeit that ſuch as ſinne and offende agaynſt God, charge
not themſelues with their faults. For we be ſo giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſelfſoothing;
that euerie of vs weltereth and ſleepeth in his owne filth, inſomuch
that till the lawe touch vs too the quicke, our conſciences are as it
were benummed, and to be ſhort, euerie man diſpenſeth with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and taketh leaue too doo euill. But when the Lawe ſteppeth
forth, then is ſinne knowne, and euerie man ſpite of his teeth, muſt
be faine to ſtoupe before God, or elſe gnaſhe his teeth at him as a
rebell. Neuertheleſſe God gathereth vs too him by the lawe, by
bringing vs to the knowledge of our curſedneſſe. To be ſhort, it is al
one as if a man had his face all berayed: euery man might mocke at
him, but he himſelfe ſhould not ſee it. But if one bring him a glaſſe,
he is aſhamed of himſelfe, and hydes his face, and goes his way too
waſh his face when hee ſees it ſo diſfigured with filthineſſe. Or if a
man be ſo yll fauoured that he maketh folke afrayd with his looke:
he thinketh not that that fault commeth of his owne perſon, till he
haue a looking glaſſe ſet before him. Euen ſo is it with vs. For
though all of vs be ſaped in wickedneſſe and ſinne, inſomuch that
heauen and earth are aſhamed of vs, and God prepareth horrible
condemnation for vs: yet ceaſſe we not too keepe on our race and
to be retchleſſe ſtill. And why ſo? For our ſinfulneſſe is vnknowne
to vs; and hypocriſie doth ſo blindfolde our eyes, that we perceyue
not our owne curſedneſſe. But the Lawe ſheweth vs what we bee,
and therewithall ſetteth Gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before vs. For on the one
ſide it ſayth, ye ſhall do all theſe things vnder payne of curſing. And
what maner of things are they? it is not ynough for vs to abſteyne
onely in reſpect of our feete, handes, eyes, and eares: but we muſt
be pure and clere from all luſting: there muſt be ſuch an vncorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:23060:180"/>
in vs, that all our ſenſes, thoughts, and affections muſt ame at
God, ſo as no inticements of this worlde may holde vs backe. And
where is this to be founde? Beſydes thys, beholde, God beeing
ſette as a Iudge in his ſeate, hathe alreadie gyuen ſentence of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe
vppon vs as ſoone as wee bee founde too bee tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
as wee bee. Yee ſee then that mankynde is in miſerable ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
And that is it that Saint Paule ment in this Text, when hee
ſayde that the Lawe was added for tranſgreſsion. It is true that
the Lawe ſerueth too other purpoſes alſo: namely, firſt of all, too
ſhewe vs the waye too ſerue God. But wee knowe that hee will
bee honoured wyth obedience, and not haue euery of vs too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
himſelfe after his owne lyking. The Lawe therefore gyueth
vs the difference betweene good and euill. For what is the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſeruice which wee owe vnto God? It is too ſubmit our ſelues
too his wyll,<note place="margin">Ro. 12. a. 1.</note> ſayeth Sainct Paule. Seeing it is ſo, yee perceyue that
the Lawe ſerueth to excellent good purpoſe: namely that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
wee labour in vayne too ſerue God after our owne imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it ſheweth vs the waye in ſuche wyſe as wee cannot myſſe, and
gyueth vs the rule whiche wee ought too keepe by. Furthermore,
when Sainct Paule ſayd that the Lawe was gyuen bycauſe of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion,
it came not in his minde to rehearſe all the frute and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
which the Lawe bringeth with it: for (as I haue ſayde alreadie)
it ſerueth alſo for our inſtruction, that wee might learne too diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
betweene good and euill: and againe it quickeneth vs vp, as
thoughe God ſhoulde gyue vs ſtrokes with the ſpurre, too make
vs apply our ſelues the more diligently vnto hym. But hee ſpake
according too this preſent matter, and according too the grounde
of the text that he treateth of. Now then he ſheweth that the Lawe
is not ſuperfluous, and yet that it ſerueth not to bring vs too rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
but in ſtead thereof caryeth vs to ſuch confuſion, that we
muſt needes be founde to be double ſinners, and are more condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and leſſe excuſable than before, ſo as there is nothing before
vs but a bottomleſſe goulfe. Lo to what end the Law was giuen vs.
But hee ſayeth that it was added too the promiſe, whereby wee bee
done too vnderſtand, that the adding of it was not for that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
was weake of it ſelf, and vnable to bring men to ſaluation, ſo
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:23060:180"/>
as there ſhoulde neede ſome other incomme: it was nothing ſo,
ſayeth Saint Paule: but it was added too make menne knowe that
God had rightfully condemned them all, and that they coulde not
haue any releefe, but ſhoulde bee continually tormented with ſuch
vnquietneſſe that they ſhoulde bee alwayes in diſpayre, till they
reſted themſelues vpon the ſayde promiſe. Nowe if it be alledged
that the promiſe might haue ſerued that turne afore: the anſwere
and ſolution is verie eaſie. For although God in offering himſelfe
to be our Sauiour, do thereby ſhewe that we bee all damned in our
ſelues till he haue pitie vpon vs: yet can we not be helped as were
requiſite, vntill ſuche tyme as hee ſcare vs. By hys promyſe hee
calleth vs gently, and after a fatherly maner: and no doubt but the
ſame ought to make vs perceyue our miſeryes, and to bee ſorie for
them: but we bee ſo faſt aſleepe in our ſinnes, that we neuer thinke
on them, except we be compelled. Although then that vpon Gods
making of the promiſe, men had cauſe to lament their ſinnes, to the
end they might reſt themſelues wholy vppon the grace of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt: yet did they it not, till God had ſtriken them as it had
bin with many blowes of a Beetle vpon the heade, which thing he
did by the Lawe. Moreouer Saint Paule ſheweth, that we abuſe the
gentleneſſe of our God through our vnthankfulneſſe, bycauſe that
the more curteous hee ſheweth himſelfe towardes vs, the more
occaſion do we take thereby too flatter our ſelues. Therefore hee
muſt bee fayne too rouze vs vp, and to make vs feele what we bee,
thereby too ſcare vs and driue vs too ſeeke his fauour in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.
Thus yee ſee what the woorde <hi>Added</hi> importeth. It is all
one if Saint Paule ſhoulde blame vs for that wee make not oure
profite of Gods goodneſſe, ſeeyng hee allureth vs ſo gently vntoo
him, and ſheweth himſelfe as meelde as may bee: but greeue him,
and after a ſort inforce hym too vſe rygour agaynſt vs, too beate vs
downe by that meanes, and ſo to prepare vs too the ſeeking of hys
grace, the which wee ſhall finde in oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſt when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
wee lyſt. And heerewythall Saint Paule addeth, that the
Lawe ſerued but <hi>till the ſeede came to whome the promiſe was made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This concerneth properlye the Ceremonyes, or elſe wee
muſt take it too bee ſpoken of the Lawe with all his appurtenances,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:181"/>
circumſtances and appendants as men terme them. If we take the
Lawe for no more but the ten commaundements, the thing that S.
Paule ſpeaketh will not ſtande. For the lawe muſt euen at this day
haue ſuch force with vs, as to be our rule of good life, and to ſhewe
vs Gods will, that we may not liue like vagabondes, and gad abrode
at aladuenture, but haue our way plaine before vs. The lawe then
is not tranſitorie in reſpect of ſhewing vs what is good, for it muſt
continue to the worldes ende. But wee muſt marke Sainct Paules
diſcourſe: for he taketh the lawe, as conteyning the promiſes and
threatnings,<note place="margin">Leu. 18. a. 5</note> and alſo the Ceremonies. Then on the one ſide there
is [this promiſe,]<note place="margin">Deut. 27. d. 26.</note> he that doth theſe things ſhall liue in them, as we
haue ſeene heeretofore. And on the other ſide there is this threat,
curſed is he that fulfilleth not all that is conteyned heere. Now the
lawe (as we ſee) promiſeth ſaluation to none but ſuch as liue purely
and vncorruptly: but all of vs come ſhort of that, and therefore the
promiſe of the lawe is to no purpoſe. Marke that for one poynt. If
it be alledged, what Sirra? Ment God too mocke men? I ſay, no:
but they haue alwayes beguiled themſelues with vainglorie and
preſumption, bearing themſelues in hande that they could purchace
their owne ſaluation: and therefore God is fayne too ſay vntoo
them, Goto, if ye bee ſo able men as ye thinke, ſhew it: as for me,
I giue you my Lawe, and bicauſe you ſhall not thinke your ſelues
ill delt with for your ſeruing of me, your wages is readie for you if
you performe it. Beholde, I aſſure you of euerlaſting life out of
hande: nowe let me ſee a little what you can do, buskle your ſelues
to your worke. But when men haue tryed the vttermoſt that is in
them, ſurely they ſhall perceyue their owne weakeneſſe which was
hidden afore. Thus ye ſee that the promiſe of the Lawe can haue
none effect towardes vs, and yet it is not guilefull, for it ſerueth vs
to another ende. As touching the threates of it, it is infallible, for
we be all damned by this threatning, Curſed is he that performeth
not all. But we come ſo farre ſhort of performing all, that there is
not one poynt but wee fayle of it. If wee thinke too ſerue God by
halues, it is nothing: for he hath not ſeparated one peece from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
but will that he which walketh in chaſtitie, ſhall alſo abſtain
from theft, robberie, craft, extortion, and all other ſinnes. Seeing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:23060:181"/>
it is ſo, let vs marke that the threate holdeth all ſhet vp vnder it,
and that is the thing that Saint Paule had an eye vnto. As touching
the Ceremonies, they were a confirmation that all of vs are accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
according as I haue tolde you, howe Saint Paule in his Epiſtle
to the Colloſsians,<note place="margin">Col. 2. c. 14</note> lykeneth them to obligations and autenticall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence,
that ſerue too holde a man moſt ſtraytly bounde. If a man
haue borowed a peece of money, he is a detter, and giueth a bill of
his hande for it. But if hee binde his goodes or bodie for it by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſance
[or Statute,] ſo as his deede is inrolled of common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde:
then is he bounde more ſtraytly than hee was before. Euen
ſo is it with the Ceremonies. The lawe of it ſelfe was ynough too
condemne men bicauſe they are all offenders: howbeeit foraſmuch
as God ſaw the pride that is rooted in our nature, he added the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
for an ouerplus, to the ende they ſhoulde be as a ſolemne
bonde agaynſt vs. But nowe Saint Paule ſayth, that all this geere
ſerued but till the promiſed ſeede were come: that is too wit, that
the lawe ſerued not too holde thoſe in ſlauerie and bondage which
put their truſt in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, but to bring them to him,
that there they might find the thing which they wanted in the law.
So then wee ſee that Gods vſing of rygour in condemning of vs,
procureth our welfare, and his thundering vppon vs after that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
is a witneſſe of his ſingular goodneſſe towardes vs. And why
ſo? I haue tolde you alreadie, and experience ſheweth it too much,
that we ceaſſe not to abuſe his gentleneſſe, and too drawe it cleane
contrarie to his meening. Therefore he is fayne to rouze vs vp, and
to ſhew himſelfe to be our iudge, and to make vs heere this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſentence, able to caſt vs into diſpayre, that there is nothing for
vs to looke for but euerlaſting death: and finally too confirme and
ratifie the ſame ſentence ſtill. Yea but all this is but too make vs
ſtoupe, that beeing at our wittes ende, we ſhould flee to our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt with a true and vnfeyned zeale, and learne to reſt vpon
him when we bee troubled with vnquietneſſe and torment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
Thus ye ſee why Saint Paule hath ſayd expreſſely, that the
lawe was giuen too continue no longer, than till the promiſed ſeede
was come. Nowe if a man demaunde, howe then did the fathers
obteyne ſaluation? I anſwere, that the lawe raigned and had his full
<pb facs="tcp:23060:182"/>
ſcope as in reſpect of outwarde order before the comming of oure
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: but yet for all that the fathers myſſed not too
reſort too the grace that was promyſed them, although they ſawe
it not, as wee ſhall ſee more plainely hereafter. Then is it a thing
vtterly out of all doubt, that the Lawe did nothing preiudice the
promiſe, nor was added for any helpe of it, as though the promiſe
had not bin ſufficient of it ſelfe too ſaluation: but that it ſerued too
correct mennes pryde and preſumptuouſneſſe, too the ende they
might with all lowlineſſe ſeeke the mercie that is profered them
in Ieſus Chriſt, and by his meanes bee able to receyue it and inioy
it. And heerevpon Saint Paule addeth, <hi>that the Lawe was ordeyned or
deliuered by the hande of Angelles, and in the hande of a Mediator.</hi> Here
he authoriſeth the Lawe, too ſhewe that it ought to bee receyued
with all reuerence, but yet not be applyed too any other ende than
God hath appoynted. For proofe hereof he ſpeaketh of the Angels,
as if he had ſayd that God had witneſſes ynow to giue authoritie to
his Law, and therewithall ſhewed how it ought to be taken &amp; herd.
But the cheefeſt matter is in his ſetting downe of the Mediator:
that is to wit, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. True it is that many men haue
taken this ſaying to be ment of Moyſes, as though he had bin called
the Mediator betwene God and men, as in reſpect of doctrine: but
that can by no meanes ſtande. For Paule dooth firſt ſet downe the
Angels, and afterward addeth the Mediator as cheefe, and he is here
in higher degree than they, which cannot bee verified of the perſon
of Moyſes. Moreouer we ſee what Saint Paule diſcourſeth. He ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
that there was no diuerſitie betweene the Lawe and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
in the free promiſe of ſaluation. For the confirming thereof,
he bringeth in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and ſayeth, that when the
Lawe was gyuen, it was done by his hande and direction. Truely
this woorde <hi>Hande</hi> in the holy Scripture dooth oftentymes import,
<hi>force, power, or ſtrength:</hi> but heere wee ſee howe Saint Paule ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
compariſon betweene Ieſus Chriſt and the Angelles. He ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
downe the Angels that were aſſembled there to make his Law
to bee heard among men, and too bee receyued of them wythout
gainſaying. Therefore they were as witneſſes of Gods Maieſtie:
but hee ſetteth downe the Mediator as the greater. The hande
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:23060:182"/>
therefore importeth direction, as if he had ſayde, that hee had high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
place, and was cheefe Commiſsioner in ſetting out the Lawe.
And we muſt not thinke this ſtrauuge: for when the Angell appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vntoo Moyſes,<note place="margin">Exo. 3. a. 6.</note> hee ſayde, I am the Euerlaſting. There hee is
named an Angell. Therefore is hee Gods meſſenger as the worde
betokeneth: and yet notwithſtanding hee ſayeth, I am the Euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,
that haue my beeing of my ſelfe: which ſaying could not be
verified of any creature: and as for the Angels they were made of
nothing as well as we. Then had it bin highe treaſon for an Angell
too haue taken vppon him the tytle that agreeth to none but God
alone. Therefore muſt wee conclude, that that Angell was Ieſus
Chriſt,<note place="margin">1. Co<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. b. 9.</note> who executed the office of Mediator aforehande, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as Saint Paule treateth thereof in the firſt too the Corinthians,
where he ſpeaketh of the Iewes rebelliouſneſſe, and of their prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of God to diſpleaſure by their murmuring and wicked luſts. He
ſayeth that they tempted Ieſus Chriſt which led them and guided
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through the wilderneſſe. No doubt therfore but that our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt was euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Mediator, yea euen to reconcile men
to God his father after diuerſe maners. And heere ye ſee why the
Apoſtle in the Epiſtle too the Hebrewes ſayeth that the ſame Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt whiche is too day,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. b. 8</note> was yeſterday, and ſhall bee ſtill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrowe
euen too the worldes ende, too the intent that men
ſhoulde holde themſelues too him, and not wander any more in
ſtraunge doctrines. But nowe hee addeth, Ieſus Chriſt then hathe
bin a meane betwixt God and men, to the intent that poore ſinners
might find ſome releefe, and that although they had ſome hartby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
by beeing troubled with Gods iudgements, yet neuertheleſſe
they might alſo be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted, ſeing that God offered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Mediator
by whom they might obteyne grace to come vnto him. Howbeeit
Ieſus Chriſt is our Mediator after another faſhion alſo, which is
that by him God hath alwayes communicated himſelfe to men. For
there is ſuche a diſtance betwixt God and vs, ſo long as wee bee
eſtraunged from him by ſinne: that wee cannot come at hym.
And hee will not come downe too vs for his part,<note place="margin">Ge. 28. b. 12</note> except it bee
by the Mediator, according alſo as it is ſhewed in Iacobs viſion
in Geneſis. For there it is ſayde, that Iacob ſawe a Ladder,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:183"/>
vpon the toppe whereof ſate God in his Maieſtie, and the Angels
went vp and downe vpon that ladder. And no doubt but that in that
figure or Image, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was repreſented vnto Iacob,
to ſhewe that men are baniſhed from Gods kingdome, till there be
a meane that reacheth vp from beneath, as our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt
doth, who being on the one ſide God manifeſted, dooth ſurmount
all the heauens, and on the other ſide, being ioyned vnto vs in that
hee is clothed with our nature, and is become a man, (yea euen a
frayle and mortall man, ſinne excepted,) hath taken vpon him and
borne our infirmities, though he himſelfe were without ſpot. So
then, ye ſee howe the lawe was giuen long ago by the hande of our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. VVherevpon it followeth that there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie
betwene the Lawe and the Goſpell. For Ieſus Chriſt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
one without any variableneſſe. Nowe let vs ſee what Saint
Paule addeth, namely <hi>that the Mediator is not of one, but that God is
one.</hi>
In ſaying that the Mediator is not of one, he meeneth that our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt came too gather toogither againe all things that
were ſcattered bothe in heauen and earth, accordingly alſo as hee
ſpeaketh of it in the firſt too the Colloſsians.<note place="margin">Col. 1. c. 20.</note> Truely ſome haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the meening of this text to bee, that Ieſus Chriſt was of mo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
than one, or that although hee were the Mediator betweene
God &amp; men, yet did it not follow that there was diuerſitie betwene
the Lawe and the Goſpell. But doubtleſſe, Saint Paules meening
heere, is to gather againe the Iewes, and the Gentiles: as if hee had
ſayde, Ieſus Chriſt was the Mediator in giuing of the Lawe, as the
partie by whoſe meanes god ment to humble men, that they might
be partakers of his grace. Howbeit let vs marke that our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt who was the continuall Mediator in giuing the Lawe too
the Iewes, had therewithall a Commiſsion that ſtretched yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
that is to wit, to gather and knit togither againe the Gentiles,
which were eſtraunged from God. For although God did for a time
preferre the lynage of Abraham before all the reſt of the worlde:
yet notwithſtanding in the ende our Lorde made vs parttakers of
the ſaluation wherevnto we were ſtraungers, and it behoued vs that
were farre off, to be gathered togither againe, as thoſe that had bin
neere neighbours afore. And therefore Saint Paule in another text
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:23060:183"/>
calling Ieſus Chriſt our peace,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. d. 17</note> ſayth that he hath ioyned and knit
vs vnto God, euen vs that had bin neere him before, as well the
Iewes which had the Lawe, as thoſe that had bin vtterly deuided
from them. They that earſt had none acquayntance with God,
were in the ende gathered togither agayne into the body of the
Church at the comming of the anoynted, and ſo were they alſo
which had heretofore bin ſeparated a great way off, not only from
God, but alſo one from another. Now wee ſee S. Paules meaning.
Howbeit, that we may profite the better by this text, let vs marke
that as God hath giuen vs his Lawe by the Angels: ſo ſhall they
beare witneſſe agaynſt vs if the Lawe beare no ſway with vs, and
that wee make none account of it, but doo as it were treade it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our feete. Then ſhall the Angels bee armed too aske vengeance
at Gods hande agaynſt our wickedneſſe and rebellion. For it was
no babes play when God willed his Angels too bee preſent and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
at the publiſhing of his Lawe. Therefore it was to the ende
it ſhould bee receyued with all reuerence. Nowe it is true that wee
can not perfourme all that the Lawe commaundeth, and if wee
ſhould ſtande vpon that poynt, wee ſhould bee plunged into euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
death, and vtterly ouerwhelmed in diſpayre. But firſt of
all, ſeeing that God is ſo gracious too vs as too teache vs his will,
too the ende wee ſhould diſcerne betweene good and euill: let vs
bowe downe our neckes, and receyue the yoke that God layeth
vpon vs, to make vs ſubiect vnto him. Let that ſerue for one point.
And for as muche as the Lawe dooth quicken vs, and cheare vs vp
when wee bee hartfroſen, and when there is ſuche ſlouth and ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in vs as wee can not come vnto God: Let euery of vs looke
well too him ſelfe, and early and late call too minde Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements,
to reproue our ſelues withall. Then let vs bethinke
our ſelues better, ſeeing that the Angels keepe watch and warde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
vs, &amp; will not (now after that God hath giuen them in charge
to authoriſe his Lawe) ſuffer vs to deſpiſe it, and miſuſe it as if it
were a thing of nothing. Furthermore, as touching that the Lawe
curſeth vs: let vs aſſure our ſelues that although men commende
vs, and clap their hands at vs for ioy, yet ſhall we be put to ſhame
before the Angels of heauen. Then if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whole world fauour vs, it
<pb facs="tcp:23060:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is nothing. For to what ende was it Gods will that all his Angels
ſhould appeare togither at the publiſhing of his law, but to teach vs
to be aſhamed of our ſinnes, and therby to humble vs in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
that wee might ſeeke all our welfare in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt?
And moreouer where as it is ſayd that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was
the mediator of the Lawe: let vs aſſure our ſelues that if we reſort
wholly to his grace, wee ſhall not neede to feare that the law ſhall
haue any more power to condemne vs, yea or to reigne ouer our
ſinne.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. g. 56.</note> For we muſt beare in minde howe S. Paule in the firſt to the
Corinthians ſayth, that the law is the ſtrength of ſinne, and doth ſo
ſharpen ſinne as it woundeth vs deadly. Seeing it is ſo then: ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if we had not the thing that is ſhewed vs heere for our comfort,
we ſhould be ſtriken with ſuch feare, as wee could not bee ſure of
our ſaluation, though the promiſes were offered vs in our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt. For wee would alwayes matche the contrarie things
agaynſt them, and lay the Lawe in balance with them, ſaying:
VVhat? was not the Lawe giuen of God? But God condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vs by it. Therefore although our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſteppe in
too helpe the matter, yet doothe it not ſeeme that wee bee eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.
So ſhall wee alwayes bee in trouble. But if we conſider howe
our Lorde Ieſus was the mediator in the publiſhing of the lawe: it
ſheweth vnto vs that if he bee our aduocate at this day, it will bee
a good and ſufficient diſcharge for vs: in ſo muche that although
God haue pronounced his ſentence of curſing agaynſt vs, yet wee
muſt not be diſmayde at it, nor ſo ouerpreſſed with hartgreefe and
anguiſhe of mynde, as though the miſhiefe were incurable: but
aſſure our ſelues that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt wyll very well agree
too doo bothe twayne, that is too wit, bothe make vs aſhamed
that wee may learne humilitie, and therewithall alſo make vs ſure
of our ſaluation. And therefore let vs learne, that whenſoeuer wee
bee beaten downe, there is none other meanes too rayſe vs vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gayne,
but too know that the ſelfe ſame perſon which was ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to bee the mediator for the publiſhing of the lawe, is now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
vnto vs at this day with the ſame commiſsion, and will
make vs too perceyue it by experience. Further let vs marke that
he is not a mediator for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> one nation alone, but for al the whole

worlde, in as muche as all of vs are the creatures of God. True it
is that wee were after a ſorte cut off from him by the ſinne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.
But our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is come too make vp the breache
agayne that was both in heauen and in earth,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 20.</note> as I haue alledged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
out of the firſt chapter to the Coloſsians. Seeing it is ſo then,
let vs not doubt but that God accepteth vs as heires of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
in aſmuch as he acknowledgeth vs for the ſpiritual children of
Abraham. And although there bee great diuerſitie [betweene our
dayes and] the time of the ceremonies whiche ſerued too ſeparate
the one from the other: yet let not that hinder vs from comming
vnto God. For why? God is one. Although then that there bee
bothe Iewes and Gentiles, although there bee many diuers Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
among men, although their languages bee diuers, their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and trades of liuing contrarie, and euery of vs hath ſo muche
varietie and inconſtancie in himſelfe, that we haue no holde of our
ſelues: yet let vs reſt vpon God, for he is [alwayes] one. He hath
giuen vs his law, he hath giuen vs his Goſpell: and let not vs think
that there is any contrarietie in that cace, but that all agreeth very
well. Only let vs ſuffer our ſelues to be ruled by him, that we may
come to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And howe may that bee doone?
By beeing cleane ridde from all pride, by beeing abaſhed and aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
by miſliking of our ſelues, and by perceiuing that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in vs but death. Then ſhall wee come too our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, knowing that God the father accepteth vs, if we holde that
way. VVhy ſo? For he is alwayes one: and his giuing of the lawe
was not too diſanull or impeache the promiſe that he had made
afore. Likewiſe his reuealing of his grace more fully vnto vs in his
Goſpell, was not for that he wiſt not how to make his law of force
towards vs, and to put it to the right vſe and purpoſe of it, that we
might haue a rule wherby to liue well: but that whereas wee were
accurſed by it, wee might knowe howe there is none other remedie
for vs, but by beeing bliſſed agayne in the ſeede that was promiſed
from time to time, in whoſe hande our welfare was ſtabliſhed, that
is to wit by comming to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
and welſpring of all bliſſedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Nowe let vs fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with acknowledgement of our faultes, praying him too make vs
perceyue them more and more, ſo as we may miſlike of them, and
not onely confeſſe them with our mouth, but alſo lay open our
hearts before him, and ſubmit our ſelues wholly to his holy word,
and that in ſuche wiſe as wee may bee comforted by his free good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as it is ſhewed vs in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and he reforme
vs alſo by his holy ſpirite, too the ende that whereas wee of our
ſelues be full of rebelliouſneſſe, we may by his gouerning become
teachable and readie to follow his holy will, and to giue our ſelues
ouer all wholly vnto him. And let vs pray vnto him for all theſe
things, ſaying: Almightie God heauenly father. &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue alreadie this morning diſpatched this
poynt, that the Law was not giuen in vayne,
though it coulde not bring vs too righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to make vs acceptable to God. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly,
it was ſhewed you, that Gods giuing of hys
Lawe, was not to the intent we ſhould ſeeke
our righteouſneſſe and ſaluation there, as
though his grace, had bin weake and vnſufficient: but for a farre
other reſpect, that is to wit, to giue men ſuche knowledge of their
ſinnes, as they might be aſhamed of them in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they could not be touched to the quicke, to flee to our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt for refuge, as we ſee too much. And now S. Paule mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
another queſtion: namely, whether the lawe bee agaynſt the
promiſes. For ſurely when it is ſayde that the lawe promiſeth vs
ſaluation, vpon condition that wee deſerue it: and the promiſe of
the Goſpell telleth vs that wee ſhall bee taken into Gods fauour
without any deſeruing: a man would thinke there were ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie
in the matter. As if a man ſhoulde offer mee a houſe, ſo I
would pay wel for it, and did ſet me a price of it: and another man
ſhould ſay vnto me, no, thou ſhalt haue it for nothing. There is
great contrarietie in theſe ſayings. And it ſeemeth that in ſpeaking
after that faſhion, God vnſayeth that which he had ſpoken in hys
law, where he ſayth, Serue me, and keepe my commaundements, &amp;
you ſhall not miſſe of your wages. For in the Goſpell he ſpeaketh
another language, ſaying, I require nothing of you, for yee bee ſo
wretched that ye can giue me nothing: but I receyue you into my
kingdome frankly and of mine owne free goodneſſe without any
deſert of yours: your heritage is aſsigned to you, euen bicauſe it
is my good pleaſure to doo it. Heerevpon S. Paule declareth, that
although God ſpeake after another maner and faſhion in the lawe
than in the Goſpel: yet notwithſtanding when we haue well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
the marke that he ſhooteth at [wee ſhal perceyue] there is
no contrarietie in the matter. For (as I haue tolde you this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
Gods promiſing of rewarde to our works is not to beguyle
vs, but to ſtop our mouthes that wee might not repine agaynſt
him, as we ſee that the world doth, which is alwayes ready to carpe
<pb facs="tcp:23060:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at him with diueliſh malapertneſſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he handleth them not after
their owne will and liking. God then cutteth off all occaſion of
grudging, when he telleth vs that wee ſhall not be diſappoynted of
our wages for our wel ſeruing of him. Furthermore let euery of vs
examine him ſelfe well, and he ſhal finde that that is not the match
wherby we muſt obteyne ſaluation: for there is none of vs all but
he may condemne him ſelf by his own life, if he iudge without flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering.
But after that God hath ſpoken after that faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he offereth
vs remedie in the Goſpell, and telleth vs that for as much as we be
damned, and can not hope to attayne any ſaluation by our works:
he him ſelfe offered it vs of his own free goodneſſe, bicauſe it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
him ſo to doo. And for that cauſe S. Paule anſwereth, <hi>If the law
had bin giuen to iustifie, I coulde wel inough graunt that righteouſneſſe
ſhould be giuen vs by it.</hi> But let vs ſee whether God ment that or no.
It is certayne he ment it not. Then ſendeth he vs to Gods purpoſe:
as if he ſhould ſay, that the Hypocrites which are ſo puffed vp with
pride &amp; ouerweening, that they think they be able to iuſtifie them
ſelues, &amp; to win heauen, are il expounders of Gods law, yea &amp; fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifiers
therof. For men muſt alwayes haue an eye to the intent of
the ſpeaker. Now God ment not to ſet men a gog with any truſt in
their own wit &amp; deſeruings: for we be too much giuen to that of
our own nature. VVe ſee it hath bin a common error through the
whole world in all ages. Therfore we nede no ſcholing to perſuade
vs that we be able folke, &amp; that we can bind God to vs by our ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
doings. But contrariwiſe God hath giuen vs his lawe, to the
intent we ſhould be wounded with it as with a ſword, &amp; the ſtripe
be ſo deadly as we might be conſtrayned to flee to him for ſuccor.
Seeing then that Gods will it to ſlea vs by the Law, it is not giuen
vs to make vs righteous. And therfore they that ſeeke their life &amp;
welfare there, beguile them ſelues: and there is no reaſon why they
ſhould alledge for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, yea? how ſo? God hath promiſed me
it. No, but they muſt conſider to what end he ſaith ſo. Now we ſee
how S. Paul hath diſcuſſed this queſtion, that there is no contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
betweene the Law &amp; the Goſpel, though God alter the maner
of his ſpeech at the firſt bluſh. Now he addeth afterwarde, <hi>That the
Scripture hath ſhut vp all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>der ſinne, that we might obteyne the promiſe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:23060:186"/>
by the fayth of our Lorde Ieſus Christ.</hi> VVhen he ſayth that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hathe ſhutte vp all vnder ſinne, he ſheweth that men are too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
blockiſhe, too thinke that God ment too aſsigne them a due
wages or hire, when he dyd ſet them downe this condition. He
that dooth theſe thinges ſhall liue in them. Lette them reade the
whole lawe, let them ſearche the contents and ſubſtance of it, let
them looke well vpon the whole holy Scripture: and they ſhall
finde that it accuſeth and condemneth all men from the moſte to
the leaſt, without any exception. Now if we be al condemned, euen
by the law: what would we more? Muſt it not needs be that we be
tootoo much blinded with hypocriſie, when we will needes binde
God to vs after this ſorte, notwithſtanding that we be farre wyde
from all righteouſneſſe, and he hath tolde vs that we can not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
it in his ſighte, but that we muſt bee vtterly ouerwhelmed?
S. Paule alledgeth not heere any text too ſhewe that the Scripture
hath ſhut vp all vnder ſinne, but taketh it as vtterly certayne and
which ought not to bee doubted of any more among the faithfull.
And for proofe thereof wee ſee, that euen from the creation of the
world, we be all of vs corrupted in Adam. His ſinne condemned
not him ſelfe onely, but alſo all his whole ofſpring, and all of vs are
falne in that fal of his.<note place="margin">Gen. 6. a. 5.</note> And thervpon it is ſayd, that al our thoughts
are rebellings agaynſt God, and there is nothing but naughtineſſe
in vs. VVhat then is mans wit? A warehouſe of all wickedneſſe.
And ſeeing that God hath auouched it to be ſo at a word, what ſhal
wee gayne by chalenging this or that too our ſelues? For all our
ſtartingholes ſhal but increaſe our miſerie, bicauſe that in ſo doing
wee ſpite God, and kindle his wrath ſo much the more. For wherto
ſerued all the ſacrifices, but to ſhew vs to our faces, that all men are
vtterly accurſed ſo long as they continue in them? And although
there were no ſacrifices at all, yet very experience ſheweth it. Let
euery of vs enter into himſelfe, let him conſider what maner a one
he is, and let him viewe himſelfe in the perfection which the holy
ſcripture requireth at our hands: &amp; he ſhal wel find that there is no
way for him but to imbrace the promiſe of Gods mercy which he
maketh vnto vs,<note place="margin">Eſ. 43. c. 25</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayth that our iniquities ſhal be wiped out,
&amp; that there is no way for vs to come to him, but only by his loue.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And doth he not hereby ſtill bewray our ſinne? ſpecially ſeeing he
ſetteth down Ieſus Chriſt for our rightuouſneſſe? But if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liſt
to haue a larger &amp; certener diſcourſe hereof, let him ad that which
S. Paule ſetteth down in the third to the Romans,<note place="margin">Ro. 3. b. 19.</note> where he ſetteth
foorth the thing largely which is touched here briefly: &amp; then ſhal
he ſee yet better how the ſcripture hath ſhut vp all vnder ſinne. For
there S. Paule alleageth the texts that ſerue to bewray mans nature
till Gods haue drawen him backe, changed him, and faſhioned him
new agayne.<note place="margin">Pſa. 14. a. 1</note> Like as when he ſayth that God looked downe heere
bylowe, to ſee if he could find any ſoundneſſe, and all were corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yea and feſtered in their naughtineſſe, and there was not ſo
much as one that ſought after God. Nowe it is certayne that there,
there is no ſpeaking of two or three, but generally of all men in
whom God hath not wrought to gouerne them by his holy ſpirite.
Therefore it is all one as if Dauid did ſhewe vs in a paynted table,
what maner of ones wee bee by birth and heritage. Afterwarde he
addeth that which is written in the fiftith Pſalme, and in all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue,<note place="margin">Eſa. 59. b. 8. &amp;c. 16.</note>
and finally alleageth Eſay alſo, to ſhewe that God was fayne
to ſerue his turne with his own arme, when he purpoſed to redeme
men. VVhat is it (ſayth he) that men haue done in that behalfe?
For they do but runne forwarde, and caſt themſelues headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
all curſedneſſe and tranſgreſsion. They doo but wander: they
loue ſhifting, ſutteltie, falſhod, and lying: to bee ſhort, when God
had looked that men ſhould haue helped to bring themſelues too
ſaluation, they were rather a hundred thouſand times more in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of periſhing. S. Paule therefore alleadgeth all thoſe things.
Nowe let vs flatter our ſelues as muche as wee liſt: yet can not
the things bee called backe which God hath pronounced vpon vs.
And as ofte as wee reade the ſayde textes,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> and heare Sainct Paules
expounding of them in the forealledged chapter: it is for vs too
caſt downe our heads, and to receyue the ſhame which we deſerue:
namely to be berefte of all glory, and too ſeeke at Gods hande the
things that we want. And thus ye ſee how the ſcripture hathe ſhut
vp all vnder ſinne. In the eleuenth chapter to the Romans he ſaith
that God hath ſhut vp all vnder ſinne,<note place="margin">Ro. 11. d. 32</note> too the intent to haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
on all. But there he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſeth yet one ſteppe higher. For he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:23060:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not of the things that are told vs in the law and the prophets,
but of Gods ſecret iudgement, in that it was his will that all of vs
ſhoulde bee as good as drowned in deſtruction, to the intent that
there ſhould be no ſaluation but only by his goodneſſe. Then if it
be demaunded why God hath ſuffered men to fall into ſo miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
plight: it is bycauſe he will haue vs beholden to his only mercy
for all things. Truly this will ſeeme ſtraunge to many fantaſticall
perſons, whiche would fayne reſtrayne God to their meaſure, and
are ſo raſh that when Gods determinations paſſe beyond theyr
fleſhly reaſon, by and by they condemne him for ſpitefull and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell.
Yet for all that, S. Paule will haue vs too reſt vpon thys ſaying,
that God hath ſhet vp all vnder ſin, that is to ſay, that he could well
haue created vs much ſtedfaſter and perfecter than he hath done.
He could haue preſerued vs as he doth his Angells. He could haue
giuen vs ſuch conſtancie in the perſon of Adam, that wee ſhoulde
haue entered into the heritage of heauen without dying. Yea and
he could haue made that no mo ſhould haue falne in the perſon of
Adam, but Adam alone. But he liſted not ſo to do. If it be demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
why the miſcheefe ſpreaded out further: is it not bycauſe God
would haue it ſo? Therefore we muſt in this cace, as it were brydle
and impriſon ourſelues, and receiue the doctrine in ſuche wyſe as
Sainct Paule hath vttered it: namely that God hath put vs all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſinne, to the intent we ſhould reſort to him for mercie. But it is
not ynough that God hath ſo determined it in his ſecrete purpoſe:
it was requiſite alſo that the determination ſhoulde be publiſhed
and knowen. For vntill ſuch time as men perceyue themſelues too
be condemned: they will ſtill be weltring in ſome vayne ſelftruſt,
and boaſt of themſelues, as we ſee too much. The Scripture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
muſt be fayne to bring vs to this vnderſtanding, that euery of
vs may condemne himſelfe for a ſinner, as it were with his owne
mouth, yea and that we do it vnfeynedly. And why? Bycauſe it is
by beleeuing, that we obteyne the promis, that is to ſay the rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
that is freely promiſed vs.<note place="margin">Ro. 11. d. 32</note> In the ſayd text of the eleuenth
to the Romanes whych I alledged euen now, Sainct Paule ſayth,
to the intent to ſhew mercy vpon all: but heere he ſheweth that it
is not for all men to be partakers of it in generall. For wee knowe
<pb facs="tcp:23060:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the greateſt number periſheth in their ſinnes, bycauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
the remedie that is offered them in the Goſpell. And why then
doth Sainct Paule ſpeake of all? It is aſmuch as if hee ſhould ſaye,
there is none other help for vs but only Gods looking vppon vs
with pitie, of his owne meere goodneſſe, that pardoning our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and receiuing vs into his fauour, he take vs for his children, too
bring vs to the heritage of the kingdome of heauen. VVe ſee then
that Sainct Paule did not without cauſe ſay that God will haue
mercy vpon all: not that euery man is comprehended vnder that
word <hi>all,</hi> but to exclude and put away all ſelfrightuouſneſſe of man.
Moreouer we ſee how the meane is expreſſed heere: namely that
wee muſt obteyne the promis by fayth,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. b. 16</note> according as Sainct Iohn
ſayth that God ſo loued the world, that hee ſpared not his onely
ſonne, to the end that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
but haue life euerlaſting. VVill wee then enter into the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
that is ſhewed to vs heere? Faith muſt be as a keye to open vs
the dore. For God calleth vs to it, but it is not ynough for vs too
be called only: it behoueth vs to anſwer according to this ſaying,
you are my people:<note place="margin">Eſai. 25. b. 9</note> yea Lord, and thou art our God. VVhen hee
ſayth,<note place="margin">

motion: it muſt be giuen vs of the holy Ghoſt. Howbeit the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
is not heere whither fayth come of mens ſelues or no. Sainct
Paule doth no more but declare that to be quit before God, and to
be drawen out of the dungeon of curſedneſſe wherein wee are all
of vs plunged, we muſt not bring any thing of our owne, as though
we would go about to bind God, and that it were meete for vs too
imagine any deſert of our owne: but come too craue hys fauoure
which is offered vs freely without any duetie to vsward, and ſettle
our truſt there, ſo as we hope not for any welfare otherwiſe than
bycauſe God ſheweth himſelfe mercifull towards vs. I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
already wherefore this ſerueth. Surely men would alwayes
fayne cloke themſelues with ſome preſumptuouſneſſe, as wee ſee
that Adam dyd: who though hys owne ſinne vpbrayded him, ſo
as he was afrayde of Gods maieſtie, did neuertheleſſe ſeeke fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaues
to couer himſelfe withall. At the ſame poynt are we. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:23060:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is but a beguiling of ourſelues too come before God, lyke
whytelimed walles, and to thinke to be accepted at his hand: for he
hath an eye to the ſoundneſſe of the hart, which is not to be found
in any man. For ſo long as he letteth vs alone in our owne kinde,
wee bee naughtworth, how fayre a ſhow ſoeuer wee make too the
worldward. Againe, when he hath reformed vs, and giuen vs a good
deſire too walke in his feare, whiche thyng all the faithfull muſt
needes haue: it doth not follow therefore, that our affection is full
and perfect: no, it commeth farre ſhort of it. And yet, that which we
haue, we hold of his meere grace. So haue we not any thing to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of or to reſt vpon howſoeuer the world go: wee cannot ground
ourſelues vpon our owne deſeruings. True it is that the faythfull
muſt ſeeke to gyue themſelues wholly vnto God: for wee cannot
bee members of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, except wee be ſanctifyed
by hys holy ſpirite, as wee ſhall ſee in tyme and place hereafter.
And our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt cannot be deuided nor cut in peeces
as infinite as he is. Although our ſinnes bee forgiuen vs by hys
death and paſsion, and waſhed away and clenzed by hys bloud, and
that the ſame waſhing be gyuen vs to faſhion agayne the image of
God hys father in vs, ſo that we muſt bee made new creatures in
hym: yet notwithſtanding howſoeuer we fare, it is not for vs too
preace boldly before God, as though we were worthy to be recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
or as though wee brought him any thing wherewith to binde
him. For if we preſume to alleadge one thing or other to him, firſt
and formoſt all that we haue commeth of him. Agayne on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſide
we be conuicted of a hundred thouſand faultes, and when
we go about any good worke, we ſhall no ſooner haue done it, but
it ſhall be infected with ſome ſpot or other, ſo that if it bee tried ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly,
it ſhall always be ſubiect to condemnation. Then muſt we
needes keepe our mouthes ſhut: ſo that if wee will haue God fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and mercifull to vs, we muſt bring nothing with vs but onely
fayth, no, but only fayth. Neuertheleſſe it is not meant that euery
man ſhoulde take the bridle in his necke too do euill (as I haue
declared already heeretofore:) it is not meant that wee ſhoulde
bee voyde of Goddes ſpirite, nor that wee ſhoulde welter in
all wickedneſſe: no, but heere the cace concerneth onely oure
truſt wherevppon wee may ground ourſelues too call GOD
<pb facs="tcp:23060:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our father, that we may be ſure of the eternall heritage. If we go to
our owne works (as hath bin declared afore) there will be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie
at all. For why, it is not a worke or twayne, or three that is
required, but a perfect obedience, which was neuer yet found in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mortall creature. Truly if the Angells ſhould come to account
before God, they could not anſwer to that perfection of rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
&amp; much leſſe were it poſsible that we which are but wormes,
and which ſucke vp ſin as a fiſh doth water,<note place="margin">Iob. 14. d. 18. &amp;. 15. b. 6.</note> (as Iob ſayth) ſhould be
ſo ſound that God ſhould receiue vs for our worthineſſe. To bee
ſhort, wee muſt quite and cleane giue ouer the truſt of our owne
works, and acknowledge that there is nothing but condemnation
in vs, if we mind to haue the promis performed towards vs. Thus
ye ſee in effect what Sainct Paule meant too declare in thys text.
And now he addeth immediatly, <hi>that before faith came, we were kepte
vnder the law, and as it were ſhet vp till the faith was reueled.</hi> Heere the
words <hi>Lawe</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> would be ſomewhat darkſome, if they were
not opened more at large. For ſometimes when the ſcripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of fayth, it meeneth all religion, and comprehendeth all the
inſtructions that are giuen vs in Gods booke. Sometimes it mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the certeintie of beleefe which we ought too haue when wee
come to pray vnto God, bycauſe wee may not ſtep to him at al ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture,
but accept the grace that he offereth vs. Then in aſmuche
as Gods promiſes depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not vpon our deſerts, but is altogither
freely and frankly giuen vnto vs, and we are made partakers by our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: if we imbrace the ſame, our ſo doing is called
fayth, and ſo hath Sainct Paule taken it hitherto, and likewiſe in his
Epiſtle to the Romanes, and in all other places where he diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
or treateth how we may be iuſtifyed before God, or how we
may come in his fauour, for they be both one thing, as I haue ſayde
afore. But in this text the word <hi>Faith</hi> hath yet a more peculiar ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
which is, the reuelation [or diſcouerie] which wee haue
by the Goſpell. For it is very certaine that the forefathers had the
ſpirit of faith or beleefe, according as I haue ſhewed you alreadye
that Abraham was iuſtifyed bycauſe he beleeued God, &amp; that wee
alſo muſt be faſhioned like to his example in that behalfe, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we be made his children to come to the kingdom of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:23060:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had faith his full ſtrength at all times, and there neuer was any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes to ſet God and men at one: but yet was not the fayth
reueled in Abrahams time, bycauſe our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte who is
the very pledge and ſubſtance therof, was not yet come intoo the
world. Thus ye ſee how we be iuſtifyed freely at this day, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any deſert of our owne. And why is that? For he that beleeueth
that Ieſus Chriſt died for our ſinnes, and is riſen againe for our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification:<note place="margin">Ro. 10. b. 10</note>
hath all the whole. And as it is ſayd in another place, our
beleeuing with our hart maketh vs ryghtuouſe, and our confeſsing
with our mouth maketh vs ſafe. But now had Abraham had oure
Lord Ieſus Chriſt diſcouered vnto him as we haue him at this day,
(in ſomuch that he is as good as crucified among vs as Sainct Paule
hath ſayd heeretofore:) his fayth had bin all one with ours. But it
was yet after a ſort ouercouered, that is to ſay, although Abraham
truſted in Ieſus Chriſt, hoping for ſaluation at his hande, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he vtterly diſtruſted himſelfe, knowing that there was ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in him that might go for payment before God: yet was he hild
ſtill vnder ſhadowes, &amp; was fayne to looke at Ieſus Chriſt a far off.
For he was not yet named the day ſunne of rightuouſeneſſe, as hee
is called in Malachie.<note place="margin">Malach. 4. a. 2.</note> Now then we ſee what Sainct Paul meant by
ſaying that faith was not yet come namely that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient time
of the reueling of it to the world as it is nowadayes by the Goſpel,
was not yet come, ſo that the fathers were ſhet vp vnder the lawe.
So therefore, heere is ſome peece of difference, and ſome peece of
likeneſſe: in ſomuch that if it bee demaunded what the ſtate of the
fathers wer that liued vnder the law: it is to be anſwered, that part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it differed from ours, and partly was al one. How were they both
one? In this, that God had ſhewed himſelfe mercifull to our father,
howbeit for our Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake: and that Abraham percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
how it ſtoode him on hand to put his whole truſt in the meere
grace of God, gaue ouer himſelf, and ſo his beleeuing was reckened
to him for rightuouſneſſe, as we haue ſeene afore. In lyke cace was
it with all the Patriarks and Prophets. So then their taking was all
one with ours, in that they grounded themſelues vppon our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, and boaſted not of any thing ſaue onely Gods mercy,
and had the promiſes of the inheritance of the heauenly life, as we
<pb facs="tcp:23060:190"/>
haue. Yet was there alſo a diuerſitie, bycauſe they were fayne to
haue Sacrifiſes, waſhings, and ſuch other like thinges, till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And when the law was giuen, ſo as
there was a Preeſt that entered into the Sanctuarie to be an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,
and the people ſtoode aloofe a great way of, and a veyle or
Curtayne was drawen in the middes of the Tabernacle to make a
darkening of things: ye ſee they were thinges wherein the ſtate of
the fathers differed from ours: for during the abſence of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, they had Ceremonies &amp; figures, whereas we haue the
very body &amp; ſubſtance of them,<note place="margin">Colo. 2. c. 17</note> as ſaith S. Paule to the Coloſsians.
For God biddeth not vs to offer any mo Calues, Sheepe, or Oxem
to wipe out the ſpots of our ſinnes. But he telleth vs that we muſt
be ſprinkled with the bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, through the
power of the holy Ghoſt, &amp; that in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt we ſhall
find all that is requiſite for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ye ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that as now faith
reigneth in ful power: that is to ſay, whereas the fathers had but a
little taſt of it according to their meſure: it is fully &amp; ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly reueled
vnto vs. And for this cauſe S. Paul ſaith, that the fathers were after
a ſort reſtreined or ſhut vp: ſo that he likeneth the law to a bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage,
&amp; in very deede ſo was it, &amp; he will hereafter ſhew what maner of
bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage it is. It is not ment that the fathers obteined not the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
life which we hope for, or that we ſhal not be crowned all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
at the laſt day: but that God was fain for a time to weeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
like little babes. And for that cauſe alſo doth he vſe the ſimilitude of
a ſcholemaſter, &amp; wil againe ſet down a third ſimilitude of Tutors
&amp; gouerners. Howbeit for aſmuch as this ſhal be handled in his due
place, let it ſuffiſe vs as now to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that whereas S. Paul like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the law vnto a bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage, it is to ſhew far greater fauor to vs, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he did to the fathers that died before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, bicauſe he vſeth vs now after a freer faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
doth yet better expreſſe that the Iewes were as children,
&amp; we now are as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For this word <hi>Scolemaster</hi> betokeneth
a maſter of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ſaith the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the law executed the office of a
Scolemaſter, to traine vp the childhood of the people in old time.
And herevpon it may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, that the faithfull which beleued
in Ieſus Chriſt before he was manifeſted to the worlde, were Gods
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:23060:190"/>
children as wel as we. And if they were children, then were they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
heirs. Herin we ſee that we muſt not make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like brute beaſts,
as ſome fantaſticall heads do, which thinke that the Iewes conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted
themſelues with the poſſeſsion of the plentifull land that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; cared for no more but to be wel nurriſhed &amp; ſed ther:
for that is too curſed a blaſphemie. But Ieſus Chriſte ſerueth not to
fil me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s bellies &amp; to feede their paunches: he ſerueth to bring vs to
the heauenly life.<note place="margin">Iohn. 8. g. 56</note> It is ſaid that Abraham ſaw his day: that then was
the thing wheron he reſted his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. And wee ſee how Dauid
did always looke vp higher tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the world: &amp; Iacob at his death eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
though he was giuing vp the laſt gaſp,<note place="margin">Ge. 49. c. 12.</note> and looked not to liue any
longer in the world, ſaid he would truſt in the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God. The
auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fathers the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were not little childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after ſuch a ſort, that they
were not marked with Gods holy ſpirite, nor called by him to the
inheritance of the endleſſe life: but onely in the meaſure of faythe,
which was the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; vs. And how was that? Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
bicauſe the law whiche they had was yet wrapped in figures &amp; ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes:
whereas now Ieſus Chriſt leadeth vs right forth to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And
whereas I ſaid that they were inferior to vs in the meaſure of faith: I
meene not that Abraham, Dauid, &amp; other like had a weaker faythe
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we: for ſeeke we neuer ſo narowly through the whole world, it
is not to be preſumed that any one creature is to bee found at thys
day, which hath the hundreth part of the faith of Abraham or Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid.
And the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of their faith appeereth in this, that although
they had not the promiſes ſo apparant as we haue, but very darkly,
yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they ouerdame all ſuch temptations as woulde
haue ouerthrowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs a hundred thouſand times. If any of vs wer put
to the induring of the incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters of Abraham or Dauid, what would
become of vs?<note place="margin">Ge. 21. c. 25.</note> For Abraham was a wayfarer al his life lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
country, wher me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grudged him water to drinke, though he himſelfe
digged the welles. He was put to as many plunges as could be. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
God exerciſed him in ſo many incou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters, that he ſemed to be
minded to throw him into the bottom of hel: and yet neuertheleſſe
his faith abideth ſtil vnva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed. As touching Dauid, he was driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place to place. Being hunted out of the whole realme
&amp; hauing no ſuccour to retire vnto, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:23060:191"/>
enimies of God, or elſe into dennes and among wyld beaſtes: he
was moreouer put to ſuch reproche, that euery man curſed him as
the verieſt villayne and kaytif in the world: and yet for all that, he
hild out ſtill, hee called ſtill vppon God, and hee neuer fell to any
murmuring or blaſpheming, but rather glorifyed God in thoſe his
extremities and diſtreſſes. So then wee ſee that their faith ought to
make vs all aſhamed. And when euery of vs ſhall haue looked wel
into his owne conſcience, wee ſhall fynd that wee ſcarſly haue any
little peece of the faith that they had. But the greatneſſe of their
faith muſt not be meaſured heere by the conſtancie and ableneſſe
that euery of them had to truſt in God. VVhereby then? By the
outward obiect of their fayth. As for example: Although Eſay was
an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teacher, ſo that his like is not to be found in the world:
yet the leaſt preacher that ſetteth foorth the Goſpell purely, ſhall
be preferred before Eſay,<note place="margin">Math. 11. b. 11.</note> as is auouched by the mouth of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt hymſelfe. And why is that? Bycauſe that although Eſay
was as an Angell, and ſpake with ſuch authoritie yea, and maieſtie,
as were able to touch the hartes to the quicke which are moſt falne
aſlepe in this world, in ſomuch that euen God himſelfe ſeemeth to
haue opened his owne holy mouth in him, and his words were not
as the words of a mortall man: yet did he hold but the manner of
teaching that was conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for that tyme: that is to ſay he did ſet
foorth the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Chanaan as a pledge to thoſe whom he taught, &amp;
keepe them to the Sacrifiſes, waſhings, figures, ſhadowes, &amp; al other
like things, whervnder he ſhewed what the happineſſe of gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
is.<note place="margin">Eſai. 54. c. 11. &amp;. 60. c. 17.</note> As for example, we ſee how he likeneth the church to a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
builded of gold &amp; ſiluer and preciouſe ſtones. Yee ſee then that
his maner of dealing was faſhioned vnto the darkneſſe of the law.
But now our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is ſet forth vnto vs, although a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
man preach the Goſpel, which hath nother great eloquence nor
authoritie: yet ſhall hee as it were poynt at Ieſus Chriſte with his
fingar, he ſhall ſhew vs how we be in the time of fulneſſe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
hee ſhall aſſure vs that our ſinnes are forgiuen vs in the
death and paſsion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, in ſomuch that Gods
wrath is pacified, and victorie obteyned for vs ouer death. Thus ye
ſee that the diuerſitie is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. doctrine, and not in the qualitie of the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:23060:191"/>
fayth as it is in euery mans heart. For although Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
fayth, and ſuch a one as we ſhall not finde nowadayes in the
worlde: yet was it alwayes hemmed in with the ſayd Ceremonies
and ſhadowes. Dauid was an Angell and myrror of all perfection:
and yet for all that, he was faine to be ſubiect to the ſame order that
the common people were, and to vſe all the Ceremonies that were
then in vſe, and his looking at Ieſus Chriſt was but a farre off, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there was the ſaid Curtain before him, which letted him that
hee coulde not beholde his glorie as it is ſhewed vs nowadayes in
the Goſpell. And although we know not the hundredth part of the
things that were diſclozed to Dauid and Abraham, to make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
agaynſt all temptations, and to make them fight ſo manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that god might be glorified in them, and to make them beare out
all brunts: yet had they not that which we haue: that is to wit, they
had not the pledge Ieſus Chriſt deliuered vnto them, as we haue, to
the ende we might call vppon God his father, bycauſe we be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his bodie, and hee is our heade, aſſuring our ſelues that he
and we are all one, with condition that his goodes become ours, and
that we haue full inioyment of them at this day. Thus yee ſee that
our fayth is greater than Abrahams was, not in reſpect of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones,
nor yet in reſpect of any ſtedfaſtneſſe and firmneſſe that is in
vs: but in reſpect of the doctrine or teaching of it, which we terme
the obiect of fayth, that is too ſay, the thing that is ſette before vs
from without. And ſo ye ſee why Saint Paule ſayeth that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were hilde in warde as it were vnder a Schoolemayſter, tyll
the comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Math. 13. b. 16.</note> Nowe we for our part haue
cauſe too magnifie Gods goodneſſe, according alſo as oure Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt exhorteth vs, ſaying: bleſſed are the eyes which ſee that
which you ſee, and the eares which heare that whiche you heare.
For many Kings and Prophets haue deſired the like,<note place="margin">Iam. 2. d. 23.</note> and haue gone
without it. Beholde, Abraham was called Gods freend. Beholde,
Dauid is reported too haue bin founde according too Gods owne
heart:<note place="margin">Act. 13. c. 22</note> and yet for all that, hee was fayne too looke aloofe at the
promiſes which are now as it were caſt into our lappes, and whereof
we haue our fill. They ſought Ieſus Chriſt then abſent and hidden,
and they wayted for him. But now that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath
<pb facs="tcp:23060:192"/>
come downe into the worlde and bin conuerſant here, he hath gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs a ſure warrant that all is performed as he himſelfe declared
at his death.<note place="margin">Iohn. 19. c. 30.</note> VVhat a lewdneſſe then is it, if we nowadayes bee not
much the more inflamed and quickened vp to followe the promiſes
of the Goſpell, where God communicateth himſelfe ſo familiarly
vnto vs? So then on the one ſide wee haue cauſe too yeelde vnto
God his deſerued prayſe, for that he hath vouchſafed to exalt vs, I
ſay vs miſerable creatures to ſo high dignitie, as to preferre vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the holy kings and Patriarkes that lyued vnder the Lawe.
Howbeit heerewithall let vs take good heede, that this benefit and
prerogatiue turne not to our double conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation for our vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
in not making account of ſo great a good turne ſo offered
vnto vs. Nowe although Abraham were ſtill hilde vnder after the
maner of a childe (as I haue ſayd alreadie:) yet forſooke he both his
kinſfolke and natiue Countrie, and went as a poore wayfayrer into
a ſtraunge lande, where he was hunted and toſſed from poſt to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
in continuall languiſhing. And if he had repented him, could he
not haue returned into his owne Countrey againe? Yes: but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
in the eleuenth to the Hebrewes telleth vs, that he had ſuch
a truſtfulneſſe and ſo conſtant a fayth, that he hilde out euen to the
laſt puſh: inſomuch that hee ſhewed by effect, that his minde was
wholy ſet vpon the kingdowme of heauen, and not intangled with
this worlde: and yet notwithſtanding, for all that both hee and the
reſt of the holy fathers walked after that maner before vs: yet tary
they ſtill for vs at this day, and receyued not the promiſes which
are manifeſted to vs in the Goſpell. For while they liued they had
but a ſmall taſte of that which is reueled to vs nowadayes, &amp; which
is layde open before vs. VVo be to vs therfore if we be not warned
and inflamed to receyue Gods offer, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vttereth the infinite ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of his goodneſſe, to winne vs and to draw vs in ſuch wiſe from
this worlde, as we may come to yeelde our ſelues freely vnto him.
Then if ſuche gracious dealing moue vs not too come vntoo him,

lette euerye of vs beſtyrre hymſelfe, and take oportunitie

euerie of vs ſtreyne and inforce hymſelfe: and ſythe wee bee ſo

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue ſeene heretofore to what dignitie we
be aduaunced by the Goſpell. For not only we
be called to be of the felowſhip &amp; company of
the holy fathers whom God honored ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
but alſo our ſtate is yet more woorthie and
noble, bicauſe we be deliuered from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of the Lawe, whervnder they were hilde.
And for the better confirming of this doctrine, S. Paule addeth <hi>that
we be al made the children of God by beleeuing in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 1. b. 12</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
alſo as it is ſayd in the firſt Chapter of S. Iohns Goſpell. For
there this dignitie is commended to vs as it deſerueth: namely, that
we haue preeminence and prerogatiue to be counted. Gods children
through fayth, verely for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſts ſake, who is his
only and naturall ſonne. For that tytle belongeth alonely to him by
right, and is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to vs but only by grace, inaſmuch as God
hath voutſafed to adopt vs for his ſake. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus Chriſt is the hed
of the Church: howbeit for his ſake god acknowledgeth &amp; auoweth
vs for his children. And here we ſee that the word <hi>Beleefe</hi> importeth
more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly take it to do, according alſo as I haue declared
before. For they that are not exercized in the holy Scripture, thinke
it ſtraunge that God ſhould honor vs ſo highly for beleeuing, &amp; (to
their ſeeming) fayth is not ſo great a vertue that it ought to obteyn
ſo great a benefite. But I haue ſhewed you heeretofore, that our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
in Ieſus Chriſt is not as the crediting of ſome ſtorie when
we heare it or reade it, but a receyuing and conceyuing of him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
with full aſſuredneſſe as hee is offered vs by God hys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Therefore when wee imbrace our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, as the
partie that hath made amendes for our ſinnes too reconcyle vs too
God, ſo as wee repoſe the whole truſt of our welfare in him, not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:23060:193"/>
doubting but that hee hath brought vs all that is for the inheriting
of heauen: I ſay if wee bee once aſſured of that: it is no maruell
though God acknowledge vs as his children for our beleefes ſake.
Howbeeit therewithall we muſt call to our remembrance, what we
haue diſcourſed before: namely that this [benefite of God in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
vs to bee his children] commeth not of any deſert of
fayth, neyther muſt wee wey it heere in the balance what maner of
vertue it is: for wee bee made Gods children by free adoption. If
a man demaunde the cauſe: I anſwere, that the verie well ſpring
and foundation is not too bee ſought elſewhere than in Gods one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
goodneſſe, inaſmuche as it pleaſed him too pitie vs. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it is brought to paſſe by the meanes of fayth (as I haue ſaide al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie,)
bycauſe that beeing rid of all fonde ouerweening, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
our ſelues to be damned in our owne nature, wee flee
for refuge to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Thus you ſee in effect what S.
Paule ment to ſay. And he goeth on ſtill with the matter, to the end
we ſhoulde knowe, that onely fayth ought to ſuffice vs to the attey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of ſaluation, without ſeeking any other meanes one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too helpe vs. VVhat ſhoulde wee deſyre more than that God
ſhoulde acknowledge vs for his children? VVill we needes haue an
ouerplus added too ſo ineſtimable a benefite? Ye ſee then that our
full felicitie and perfect glorie, is that we haue leaue to call vppon
God as our father, not doubting but that ſeeing he hath receyued vs
into his fauour, hee will alſo handle vs as his owne children. But
howe ſhall we come by that? Saint Paule ſayth it is onely fayth that
maketh vs parttakers of that dignitie. Then let vs conclude, that
the Lawe can nothing aduauntage vs, or elſe it muſt needes bee that
wee bee woonderfull couetous, yea and as good as out of our wits,
to deſire more than too be the children of God.<note place="margin">Iob. 1. b. 6.</note> The Angelles are
greatly honoured in the holy Scripture, and yet the cheefe tytle that
is giuen them, is that they be the children of God. Now ſeeing that
we, we (I ſay) poore wormes of the earth, in whom there is nothing
but filthyneſſe, no nor aught but corruption of ſinne, bee matched
with the Angelles, inſomuch that God openeth vs the kingdome
of heauen, and intendeth too haue vs fellowes with them, who bee
vertues &amp; are nere about him, ſeing (I ſay) that we be made partakers
<pb facs="tcp:23060:194"/>
of that glorie: ſhall we be ſo preſumptuous to ſeeke I wot not what
moreouer? Truely it is not onely fayth that maketh vs to obteyne
that benefite. VVherfore lette vs learne to renounce all other
meanes that may bee ſet before vs: for when men offer vs any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
helpes as though the fayth that we haue in him were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
it is but a turning of vs away from our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.
That then is Saint Paules meaning. But wee ſhall neuer conceyue
the frute that is conteined in this texte, except we alwayes beare in
minde, that by this worde <hi>Fayth</hi> S. Paule meaneth to exclude all the
deſert &amp; worthineſſe that men ſuppoſe or imagin the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues able to
bring with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto God. VVhen they will needs go through with
the matter by their owne power and vertues: It is all one as if they
would cut off a peece of the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. But he
cannot be rent in peeces or deuided. Therefore all the working of
our ſaluation muſt come of him alone, and we muſt not skulk heere
and there, nor ſeeke bywayes, but come right forth vnto him by the
ſtreyte way of fayth. Herevpon S. Paule addeth, <hi>that beeing baptiſed
in Ieſus Chriſt, we haue put him on.</hi> And this is too take away a doubt
that might be caſt heere, namely howe it is poſsible that we ſhould
become the children of God, ſeeing that that dignitie is peculiar to
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Heb. 1. d. 15</note> For whereas he is called the Sonne of God,
the Apoſtle ſheweth that that tytle cannot be verified of the verie
Angels of heauen. True it is, (as I haue ſayde heretofore) that they
be named the children of God: howbeeit, that is not without an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
So is it out of doubt, that there is not any creature to whom
that dignitie belongeth. But nowe ſeeing that Ieſus Chriſt is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſonne of God, howe doth the ſame extende vntoo vs? S. Paule
declareth that it is by reaſon of the vnion that is betwixt him and
vs,<note place="margin">Iohn. 17. d. 32.</note> according as it is ſayd in the .xvij. Chapter of. S. Iohn. Then if we
were not one with our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, ſurely wee ſhould haue
none acquaintance at all wyth God: for we be quite cutte off from
all hope of lyfe by ſinne. Yea and wee muſt needes be as deadly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies
vnto him, and he vnto vs, till hee haue altered and renued
vs. Howſoeuer the worlde go, beeing ſeparated from Ieſus Chriſt,
and conſidered in our owne nature, we bee vnworthie too be called
men, and therefore much leſſe can we boaſt that God is our father.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:23060:194"/>
But here (as I ſayde) Saint Paule intended to aſſoyle that queſtion,
ſaying that by Baptiſme we be clothed with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
And this ſimilitude of clothing is verie ryfe in the holy Scripture,
and it betokeneth in effect, that Ieſus Chriſt is our apparell or ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby all is couered and buryed that might make vs to be
reiected at Gods hand, and grace is purchaſed vnto vs, ſo as he doth
not any more ſift vs and ſearch vs in our ſelues, but accepteth vs as
if we came in the very perſon of his owne Sonne. To be ſhort, Saint
Paule ment to ſhew here the vnion that is betwene our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt and all the faythfull, which are the members of his body. And
like as all the ſubſtance of a tree commeth from the root, and al the
powers and abilities of a natural bodie come from the head: euen ſo
is it betwene the ſonne of God and vs. For (as I haue ſayd alredy) we
haue not ſo much as one drop of the heauenly life, but of his inſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
or breathing into vs. Therefore if we will come vnto God, and
be partakers of the holy Ghoſt, and of the giftes that belong to the
endleſſe life: let vs be in Ieſus Chriſt, and not thinke our ſelues to
be any thing or aught worth of our ſelues. And for the ſame cauſe,
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt in the ſayd text which I alledged out of the
xvij. of S. Iohn, ſetting out the true and perfect happineſſe of his,
fayeth: Father I pray thee that they may bee made one with vs.
Ye ſee then that the way for vs to get out of the dungeon of death
wherein we were drowned, is to be vnited to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
by the bond of fayth. Now S. Paule ſayth, that that is done in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.
Not that all they which are baptized are true members of
Ieſus Chriſt in deede: for we ſee the cleane contrarie, inſomuch that
there are ſome which vnhallow and defile all the holineſſe of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
and are giltie of high treaſon too God, bicauſe that whereas
they profeſſe to holde of Ieſus Chriſt, they deſpyze and ſpyte him,
and are as dung and filthineſſe too marre all things. Baptiſme then
maketh vs not all Chriſtians, and againe wee knowe, that too bee
made the childe of God, is too great a benefite to bee fathered vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
a corruptible Element. VVhat is the water? Too ſay that the
water begetteth or regenerateth vs againe, and that thereby we be
deliuered from death, and obteyne the glorie wherein God lyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vs vp too himſelfe: as (ſay I) a peruerting of all order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:195"/>
But firſt of all let vs marke here, that when Saint Paule ſpeaketh
of Baptiſme, he preſuppoſeth that we receyue the thing that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
vnto vs in it. Many that are baptiſed do wype away the grace
of God: and notwithſtanding that it be offered them, yet they make
themſelues vnworthie of it through their vnbeleef, lewdneſſe, and
rebellion. Thus yee ſee that the power of baptiſme is diſfeated in
many men. But when there happeneth a mutual agreement &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodie
betwene God and vs: then hath baptiſme the effect whereof
S. Paule treateth and diſcourſeth in this text. And ſo the thing that
maketh vs Gods children and clothed vs with Ieſus Chriſt, is that
God draweth vs out of the corruption wherin we were by nature,
and will haue Ieſus Chriſt to be our head, and vs ingraffed into him
to be parttakers of his goods. Therfore looke when we receiue that,
then is all acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed that is figured by baptiſme. If hypocrites brag
of their baptiſme,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. b. 16</note> S. Paule ſheweth them that it is but vanitie and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion,
ſaying that the circumciſion of the letter is nothing: that is to
ſay, if we loke no further but to the outward and viſible Sacrament,
it is all of no value. Euen ſo is it with baptiſme: it ſhall ſtand them
in no ſted which with their mouthes vaunt themſelues to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
and great pillers of the Church, foraſmuch as they defile the
thing which God had dedicated to ſo excellent an vſe, as I haue told
you before. Then let vs marke well that S. Paule ſpeaketh this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
not to all without exception, which beare the ſigne and mark
[of baptiſme] outwardly: but to ſuch as fare the better by their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.
Againe S. Paule meeneth not that baptiſme, that is to ſay the
water hath the power to chaunge vs in ſuch wiſe, that we ſhould be
clothed with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: for by that meanes God ſhould
be robbed of the prayſe that is due to himſelf alone. But he ſheweth
here the meane whereby we be certified that we be the members of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſts bodie. I haue tolde you alredie, that we muſt
not ſeeke any other cauſe of it than Gods mere goodneſſe: for if we
fetch windlaſſes one wher or other, it is like as if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were a thirſt,
and would turne his back to the fountaine [to ſeeke water.] Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs learne, that it is only God which knitteth vs to our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, of his own mere goodneſſe, &amp; that he doth it by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
power of his holy ſpirit, and yet notwithſtanding ceaſſeth not
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:23060:195"/>
too woorke by baptiſme as by an inferiour inſtrument, according as
wee ſee how all light co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of him, in ſomuch that there was light
in the world, euen before there was eyther Sunne or Moone. And
yet neuertheleſſe God hath ſtabliſhed the Sunne whereby we haue
light heere bylowe euen vnto this day. But yet doth not the Sunne
ſerue too diminiſh the power that is in God alone. Againe it is ſayd
that man liueth not by bread onely,<note place="margin">Deut. 8. a. 3</note> but by euery woord that proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
out of Gods mouth. And in good ſooth the bread it ſelfe is a
dead thing. VVho giueth it vs? It is God that inſpireth life into vs:
for wee liue in him as S. Paule ſayeth in the .xvij. of the Actes.<note place="margin">Act. 17. f. 28.</note> And
yet notwithſtanding it is his will too doo it by bread, and he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it dayly too our vſe, too the intent we ſhould bee fed with it. So
then there is none inconuenience that wee ſhould bee clothed with
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt by baptiſme, and yet notwithſtanding that the
ſame ſhould proceede of Gods meere grace, and that it ſhoulde bee
done by the ſecrete working of the holy Ghoſt, ſurmounting the
whole order of nature, whereof baptiſme dothe certifie vs, bycauſe
we bee rude and earthly. God therefore is fayne too drawe by little
and little by reaſon of our infirmitie, too make vs too conceyue the
things that otherwiſe are too high for vs. For where are our wings
too ſtie with aboue the heauens? VVee haue much a doo to creepe
heere beneath vpon the earth, and therefore God is fayne too come
downe to vs, which thing he doth by his Sacramentes. Thus are we
clothed with our Lord Ieſus Chriſte by baptiſme, according alſo as
S. Paule ſhe weth by another ſimilitude in the ſixth to the Romanes.<note place="margin">Rom. 6. a. 5.</note>
For he ſayeth that we bee greffed into the death and paſsion of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, too the end alſo to bee made partakers of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
and life. This ſimilitude of greffyng is as fit as the other
of clothing. For take mee the ſyen of a tree, and cut mee of the head,
or ſome bough of another tree, and greffe mee that little ſyen into
it, that was taken from another, and yee ſee they growe bothe into
one, ſo as they become bothe one ſubſtance, and the roote yeeldeth
his ſap too the little ſprig that was taken from another tree. Euen
after the ſame maner are wee greffed intoo our Lord Ieſus Chriſte
(ſayeth S. Paule) and that is too the end that our old man ſhould be
crucified in him, and we be rayſed vp againe in newneſſe of life. But
<pb facs="tcp:23060:196"/>
heere wee haue firſt too marke, howe gratious and bountifull God
hath and ſtill doth ſhew himſelfe towardes vs, in that it pleaſeth him
too vnite vs too his owne ſonne: for that paſſeth all the benefites
whiche wee can conceyue in our imaginacion. And therefore alſo
doth S. Paule proue, that all things which God hath, do belong vnto
vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. f. 31.</note> and that we haue the inioying of them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we once poſſeſſe his
Sonne. Seing (ſayeth hee) that God hath not ſpared his owne
Sonne, how ſhould he not giue vs all things with him. Too be ſhort,
God coulde not haue vttered the infinite treaſures better, than by
ioyning vs after that maner to his only Sonne. It is more than if he
had giuen vs heauen and earth: For ſurely if wee compare Ieſus
Chriſt with all the goodes of the worlde, yea and all the goodes that
are aboue the earthly world: he farre ſurmounteth them all. Marke
that for one poynt. Furthermore let vs vnderſtand that God hath ſo
vnited vs to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as wee muſt be fayne to haue all
our lyfe in him. And it ſerueth to humble vs the better, and to make
vs perceyue how horrible a thing it is to bee wrapped in the curſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Adam. For if the holy Scripture told vs not that wee muſte
be vnited to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, before wee can bee in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour:
wee ſhould not feele ſufficiently the wretchedneſſe wherein
we be hild by nature, nother ſhould wee hate our ſinnes ſo much as
we ought to do. But now that it is tolde vs how it is impoſsible, (yea
though all the Angels ſhould come to our ayde, &amp; that all the world
ſhoulde helpe forward the matter): and too bee ſhort, that although
nothing wanted yet it were impoſsible for vs to come neere vntoo
God, or that he ſhould looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs with a fatherly cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance, yea
or that he ſhould acknowledge vs for his creatures, til we be clothed
with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: This were ynough to make vs abhorre
our ſelues. And needes muſt it be that we be worſe than lothely, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is none other meanes to appeaſe Gods wrath towards vs,
and to ſet vs againe in his fauour, than by his couering of our ſinnes,
&amp; by his clenzing of vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al our filthineſſe &amp; infection, by blotting
out all our wickedneſſe: &amp; that the ſame muſt be done by clothing
our ſelues with Ieſus Chriſt, according to the figure therof which we
fee in Iacob,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. d. 27.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God bliſſed him by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; meane of his father.
True it is that Iacob was ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>en as Iacob: but yet was he faine to be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:23060:196"/>
appareled as Eſau. So was he himſelfe as in reſpect of Gods calling
of him to the heritage or birthright: and he was another man in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of his borrowing of his brothers clothing. Euen ſo come wee
alſo as chozen of God and as hauing his promis, whereby he aſſureth
vs that he is ready to receyue vs to mercie: but yet muſt we firſt &amp;
formeſt be clothed with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For if we appeere in
our owne likeneſſe, God muſt needes hate and abhorre vs as we be
worthie. That is the thing whereof we be warned. But in the meane
while let vs fare the better by the warrant that is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs in baptim,
that we may be able to fight againſt al the temptations and diſtruſtes
which Satan ſetteth before our eyes to ſhake our fayth withall. If we
be blockiſh ſo as we perceyue not our owne vices, but be as it were
rotten in them, wo be to vs. But if we bee wakened, to bethinke our
ſelues what it is to make accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before god, ſo as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth euening
&amp; morning to our reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, that he is the iudge of the world and
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not giue vp his office: if we enter into our ſelues to make examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of our ſinnes: ſurely we muſt needes be afrayd &amp; as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
our ſelues: &amp; if we had no help to releeue vs, we ſhould needes
be drowned in deſpayre. But let vs haue our recourſe to our baptim,
&amp; aſſure our ſelues that it is not for nought that God hath called vs
to be partakers of the pureneſſe of his only ſonne, &amp; made vs al one
with him: &amp; then ſhall his bloudſhed haue ſuch effect to clenze vs
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all our ſpottes, as we may come before God with our heads vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right:
not with ſuch loftineſſe as hipocrites haue, which preſume vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truſt of his ineſtimable goodneſſe, in aſmuch as he
hath told vs that all things which belong to our Lord Ieſus Chriſte
are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to vs. Againe if we perceyue our ſelues to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted
ſo many offences that Gods wrath is kindled againſt vs: behold, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt hath offered a ſacrifice, wherby we know that the attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is made betweene God and vs. Seyng then that God hath
ſo teſtified his loue towardes vs: let vs not miſtruſt but that he will
preuent vs when ſo euer wee ſeeke him in true fayth, that is too
ſay, with ſuche ſtedfaſtneſſe as wee doubte not that he ment too
diſappoynt vs when hee pretended too bee ſo liberall towardes
vs. Thus yee ſee that the way too make our baptiſme auaylable to
vs, is too vſe it as a ſheeld too beate backe all the diſtruſtes that
<pb facs="tcp:23060:197"/>
come vpon vs too ſtoppe vs from praying vntoo God, and from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
our whole recourſe vnto him, if we went not vnto him, [ſaying
thus in our ſelues]: Surely it is true that I haue ſuch ſtore of ſinnes
in mee, as the number of them were able too make God too lothe
mee: but therefore I will not go too him in mine owne perſone: I
renounce my ſelfe and mine owne nature, as wherein there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſhame and confuzion: and I go to him in the name of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, yea and he goeth before mee, he giueth mee as it
were his garment, he ſpeaketh for mee, and in his name do I preſent
my ſelfe as though I were very he, bicauſe it hath pleaſed him to bee
ſo gracious too mee as to make mee all one with him. Thus ye ſee
that we muſt leaue our ſelues behind vs when we come before God,
and wee muſt take vppon vs the perſone of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte,
yea we leaue our ſelues behind vs. Not that we ſhould not perceiue
our owne miſdoings and be rightly humbled and ſorie for them: but
[that we ſhould doo the cleane contrarie, and] yet notwithſtanding
take it for a full and reſolute certaintie, that God accepteth vs when
wee come vnto him as in the perſone of his onely Sonne. But there
are very fewe that thinke vppon this. And in good ſooth, although
that all of vs profeſſe the Goſpell, yet wee ſhall finde a number that
know not the true vſe of baptiſme, nor wheretoo it auayleth, nor to
what end it was ordeyned. But ſuch folke ſhall pay deerly for taking
ſuch a pledge at Gods hand. He will ſhewe that it is to coſtly a thing
too bee abuſed, for aſmuch as it is ſayd to be the meane whereby we
bee vnited to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and ingreffed into his death and
reſurrection. Then whereas many haue receyed baptiſme in their
childhood, and haue liued a fortie or fiftie yeeres in the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing too what ende they were baptized: it were better for
them that they had bin borne dead, and too haue bin ſunken a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
times into the earth, than too haue vnhallowed ſo holy a thing.
And therefore let vs bethinke our ſelues the better, and learne that
although there bee but a little water caſte vppon our heads, yet not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
it is not a vaine figure: for God ſpeaketh in it as it were
from heauen, and Ieſus Chriſte is there preſent as a witneſſe of the
vſage and operation of the ſacrament, and ſpecially his death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
are warranted too vs by it. Let vs thinke well vpon theſe
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:23060:197"/>
things, and conſider too what end we be baptized and what benefite
it bringeth vs: let it bee well rooted in our hartes, and when ſoeuer
any yong childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are baptized, let vs bethinke our ſelues the better:
For to what end is baptiſme ſolemnized in the companie [or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregacion]
of the faythfull? Truly to the end that the babe ſhould
be commended vnto God. Againe it is a certaine infraunchizing of
him into the heauenly Citie, and therefore it muſte not bee done in
hudther mudther: but it is ſo excellent a deede, as ought to be done
after a more orderly and ſolemne faſhion, than any thing belonging
to worldly pollicie. For therein wee haue a mirrour of the benefite
that was beſtowed vppon vs before, to the intent we ſhould ioy in it
to the end. But we ſee that the vnbeleeuers do through theyr own
vnthankfulneſſe depriue themſelues of this adoption of Gods, and
quite baniſh themſelues from it. To the end then that we may bee
confirmed more and more, wee muſte conſider well, that when bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
is celebrated, it toucheth vs very neerely, and God calleth vs
to him, too ſhewe vs in another bodies perſone, that wee our ſelues
are forlorne and damned by nature. Howbeit for aſmuch as he hath
knit vs into the bodie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, we be no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
in our owne kinde, nother doth God looke what wee bee of
our ſelues, nor what wee haue deſerued: but accepteth vs as if Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt were in vs, as in deede wee muſte not bee ſeparated from
him. This in effect is it that wee haue too conſider vppon this text.
Now herevpon S. Paule co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth, <hi>that there is nother Greeke nor Iew
bond nor free, male nor female, but that Ieſus Christ is one in vs all, and
all wee are one in him.</hi> And by this ſentence S. Paule ment to expreſſe
yet better, that only fayth ought to ſuffyze vs, and that we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all other meanes: for elſe it were a derogacion as well to the
grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as to the working of his holy ſpirite.
If any man alledge that circumciſion was alwayes a recorde too the
fathers, of the ſame thing that wee haue at this day in baptiſme: the
doubte is aſſoyled in the ſecond too the Coloſsians,<note place="margin">Coloſs 2. b. 11.</note> where S. Paule
ſayeth that in being baptized wee bee circumcized: [howbeit] not
with mans hand, nor with viſible circumciſion: but that it ought to
ſuffize vs that God acknowledgeth vs to bee partakers of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
circumciſion, namely for ſomuch as baptiſme is ordeyned too
<pb facs="tcp:23060:198"/>
the ſame end now adayes. And let vs marke, that circumcizion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to put a difference betweene the Iewes and the Gentiles. It was
(as the Scripture termeth it) a wall betwixt them, too fence in the
Iewes as the people whom God had chozen.<note place="margin">Eph. 2. c. 14</note> But nowe the bliſsing
is publiſhed euerywhere, ſo as there is no more diuerſitie. Now then
baptiſme being in theſe dayes ſucceeded in the place of circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
ſupplieth the want of that old ſigne, which was a figure and ſhadowe
of things too come. And that ſhould not needed too haue bin, if our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt had not bin away. But nowe that he is manifeſted
vnto vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we haue baptiſme ordeyned in ſteade of it. Notwithſtanding
let vs marke (as I haue ſayd already) that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bring nothing of our
owne wherwith to purchace fauour before God: all that we can do
is but ſimply to confeſſe our ſinne, which were ynough too drowne
vs in deſpayre. Furthermore wee haue fayth, whereby wee recouer
that whiche is requiſite for our ſaluation. I ſay wee recouer it, by
ſeeking it in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Nowe then if wee ſay, yea but
wee bee weake and rude, wee cannot mount ſo high as too the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes
of heauen: let vs looke vpon the baptiſme that is giuen vs, as
though God reached out his hande too vs. There he ſheweth vs
to eyeſight, after what maner he plucketh vs out of the curſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we were plundged, and couereth vs with our Lord Ieſus Chriſte,
to the end that all our miſdeedes ſhould be buried by the perfection
of his rightuouſneſſe. For wee knowe he yeelded ſuche obedience
too God his father, that if wee come grounded therevppon, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but finde fauour at his hand. Thus yee ſee how that on the one
ſide God wil haue vs to reſt vpon him and on our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
his ſonne, to the end we ſhould draw out of the fulneſſe of that fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne,
and yeelde the whole prayſe of our ſaluation to the woorking
of his holy ſpirite: and on the otherſide giueth vs baptiſme as a help
of our rudeneſſe and infirmitie. Seyng wee haue all this, what ſeeke
we any more? Is it not a wilfull robbing of God, if wee will needes
haue other helpes, and put too other opinions and fancies as they
come in our heades? VVhereto ſerueth all this? But ſuche min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glings
are Diueliſh corruptions. Therefore S. Paule telleth vs, that
wee muſt be ſo vnited too our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as none of vs muſt
aduaunce himſelf as though he were better worth than his fellowes,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:23060:198"/>
but acknowledge our ſelues beholden too Gods meere grace for all
things, and bothe great and ſmall muſte indeuer the ſame togither,
and with one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon conſent confeſſe, that in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
they haue all that is to be wiſhed for, and therefore giue ouer all the
inuentions and deuices that can come in their owne brayne. Yet not
withſtanding, S. Paule ment not too ſay that there is no diuerſitie of
degrees as in reſpect of worldly policie. For wee knowe there are
mayſters and ſeruants, Magiſtrates and ſubiectes: in a houſeholde
there is the good man which is the head, and the good wyfe whiche
ought to bee ſubiect. VVee know then that this order is inuiolable,
and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is not come into the worlde to make ſuch
confuſion as to aboliſh that which was ſtabliſhed by God his father.
But when S. Paule ſayeth that there is nother mayſter nor ſeruant,
man nor woman: he meeneth that too bee ſure of their ſaluation,
men muſte not ſet vp theyr tayles lyke Peacockes, and ſtand gazing
vppon their owne fethers: but looke what woorthineſſe ſo euer we
weene too bee in our ſelues, wee muſte wipe it away and caſt it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foote, and acknowledge all to bee but hinderances that turne vs
aſide from comming to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Therefore when both
great and ſmall doo acknowledge that they cannot bryng aught of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, but muſt receyue all things of Gods only free goodneſſe:
Then is our Lord Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe alone is all in all in vs: that
is to ſay, we wil not go about to adde aught to the grace that he hath
purchaced for vs, and which he offereth vs dayly by his Goſpell too
the end wee ſhould be partakers of it and inioy it too our ſaluation.
Thus yee ſee in effect, that on the one ſide wee muſt keepe the ciuill
orders of this world. Let ſuch as are great men, and men of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
aboue others, knowe that God intendeth too be ſerued by them
in that ſtate. As for example, let the Magiſtrates conſider that they
be ſo much the more bound to do their duetie, ſeyng that God hath
done them the honour too aduaunce them after that faſhion aboue
others. Agayne, they that are priuate perſones and ought too obey
the Magiſtrates, muſt looke that they ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, vnleſſe they
purpoſe to ſtriue with God and to make warre againſt him. Yee ſee
then that S. Paule holdeth vs in ſobrietie and modeſtie, and vnder a
bridle which was not deuized by men, but dedicated of God too our
<pb facs="tcp:23060:199"/>
vſe, bycauſe mankind could not continue without it. And truely we
ought too honour and reuerence the ſtate of gouernance, as a thing
ordeyned of the Lord. And yet for all that, when wee come too the
heauenly life, let vs aſſure our ſelues that all worldly things paſſe
and vaniſh away,<note place="margin">Cor. 7. e. 21.</note> as the world and the faſhion thereof paſſeth, ſayeth
Sainct Paule: but the kingdome of God indureth for euer. Then as
touching our being children vntoo God, and as touching our beyng
his heires, we come not to it by riches, nobleneſſe, or dignitie, or by
any power or vertue of our owne. How then? By Gods meere grace
and goodneſſe. For the great ones muſt be fayne to ſtoupe and to
humble themſelues, and the little ones muſte needes wonder at the
ſight of Gods ſo ineſtimable goodneſſe, who hath vouchſaued to lift
them vp after that forte aboue the heauens, whereas they be fearſly
counted worthie to dwell vpon earth. Furthermore let vs haue the
skill to profite our ſelues hereby. Truely the chiefe poynt is that we
go foreward and trauell ſtill to the inheritance of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and that our ſtudies, thoughtes and deſires be chiefly applied
therevnto. But yet therewithall wee muſte alſo in paſsing through
this world, haue regard of the degrees which our Lord hath ſet too
be kept. And when any are to be chozen to the ſtate of gouernment,
to weeld Gods ſwoord, and too ſit in the ſeate of Iuſtice: let euery
man bethinke himſelf well, and pray to God for ſuch as are too bee
chozen, that they may be found to be good and faithful Magiſtrates,
and imploy themſelues too doo their duetie. And let vs on our ſide
walke peaceably in their obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and ſubiection: let vs feele there
as it were the firſt frutes of the kingdome of heauen: and let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt doth by that ſigne ſhew vs aforeha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
that he hath a care of vs, and ouerlooketh vs, and watcheth ouer vs,
vntill we may feele it to the full when he ſhall haue gathered vs vp
to himſelf. And to the intent we may the more cherefully and with
the better courage beare the yoke which he hath appoynted: let vs
vnderſtand that it is acceptable too him, and a ſacrifize whiche he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
well of, when wee walke according to the order which he hath
ſtabliſhed, and when wee proceede to liue, not onely without doing
any man wrong, or without offering any violence or deceyt: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
doo walke in all godlineſſe and honeſtie,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. c. 12</note> (as S. Paule ſayeth) that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:23060:199"/>
is to ſay, when we firſt feare and reuerence God aboue all thyngs,
and labour to dedicate ourſelues wholly vnto him: and ſecondlye
liue after ſuch a ſober manner, as we do well ſhewe that we be not
giuen to the world, though we dwell in it: but that we take it as a
ſtraunge countrie, through the which wee trauell continually to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the heauenly reſt, till we ſee the thing in very deede whyche
is taught vs heere, that is to wit that we haue not bin knit vnto our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt in vaine.</p>
            <p>And now let vs fal downe before the maieſtie of our good God
with acknowledgement of our ſinnes, praying him to make vs ſo
to perceiue them, as we may continually ſeeke him, euen with as
earneſt zele as may poſsibly be, and giue ourſelues wholly to oure
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to the ende that being ioyned to him, wee may
giue ouer all the cares of this worlde, and ſtill more and more go
forward to the felicitie of the heauenly kingdome, till we be fully
come thither. And ſo let vs all ſay, Almightye God heauenly
father. &amp;c.</p>

for: it is but a mockerie and a beguiling of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
For (as hath bin ſhewed heeretofore) we
are all of vs reiected of God, curſed, and the children of wrath. On
our owne part we be not able to recouer that which wee haue loſt
in Adam, but God muſt of his infinite goodneſſe be fayne to worke
in that behalfe: for all other helps are vayne and vnauaylable. But,
now hath God ſtabliſhed one only meane whereby men may get
out of the dungeon of curſedneſſe wherein we be all hild. Therfore
it muſt needes be that the fathers of old time were ſaued by Gods
meere grace,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1. d. 19.</note> euen as we be, which hope for the like at this day. For
it is too be ſeene in the ſecond Epiſtle to the Corinthians, that all
the promiſes which God hath giuen in al ages, were grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and that he is the pledge of them, which
maketh them auaylable and giueth them effect and force towards
vs. Then, to be ſhort, it muſt needes be, that there is but one ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
common to all the faithfull, both whiche are at this day, and
which haue liued at any time ſince the beginning of the world: and
it muſt needes be alſo, that God hath gathered vs togither in one
accord, to the intent we ſhould be reconciled to him by the grace
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and by that meane be counted rightuous
and enioy the inheritance of heauen. Yet notwithſtanding, wee ſee
great difference betweene the Church that is now adayes, and the
Church that was vnder the law. For the fathers were ſubiect to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Ceremonies. They were circumciſed from their childhoode.
Beſides this, they had their Sacrifiſes, waſhings, and ſuch other lyke
things. At this day all thoſe things are aboliſhed, and none of them
is in vſe. How then ſhall, we ſay that the ſubſtance of faith is all one
among vs and the fathers, and yet that the gouernment was diuers
and that God hathe vtterly chaunged it? If it bee alledged that this
diuerſity proceedeth of God: it would ſeme that he is variable. And
if it bee ſayd that it commeth of men: then muſt we conclude that
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:23060:200"/>
we hold two ſundry ways, and that there was great oddes betwene
them and vs. I haue anſwered already too the firſte obiection that
may be made: namely that there is no variableneſſe in God, though
he haue altered the order of gouernment in his Church. For when
he ſendeth faire wether or foule, heate or colde, and diſpoſeth the
ſeaſons of the yeere diuerſly, ſhall we ſay therefore that he chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
his mind, and that he is mutable in himſelfe? No, but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
we muſt ſay that he hath ordeyned the things that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
for mankind, and yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding doth by thoſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and turnings warne vs that wee muſt not ſeeke our reſt heere
beneath, but paſſe away as wayfarers, and as they that vndertake a
long iourney to come to the kingdome of heauen. As touching the
ſeconde obiection, Sainct Paule ſheweth that if there be any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt vs and the fathers that liued vnder the Lawe, it is
not in that our religion is not all one, it is not in that wee haue not
all one God, it is not for that the promiſes which we receyue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
not to vs nowadayes, or for that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath
not at all times had the power to make attonement among al men,
euen from Abell to thoſe which ſhal be found in the laſt end of the
world: but he ſayth that the diuerſitie is in the outward gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And the better to expreſſe that, hee alledgeth a ſimilitude
which we ought to be well acquainted with. For if a father leaue
his children fatherleſſe and vnder yeeres of diſcretion, he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
tutors and gouernors of them till they come too full age.
VVhen the father is deceaſſed, his children ſhall be vnder Tutors
and gouerners, without enioying of the goodes that their father
hath left them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet do the goodes belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to them: neuertheleſſe
they haue not the rule of themſelues, but in ſted of following their
wanton appetite, men giue them ſchoolebutter with a rodde. Thus
ye ſee that although the children be heires, yet haue they not liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
at the firſte day, bycauſe they bee too weake, and haue nother
wiſedome nor diſcretion. Now according to this ſimilitude Sainct
Paule ſayth, that the fathers, (that is to ſay the Iewes which lyued
vnder the law) were Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and heires as well as we: but that
the Church was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it were vnder age as a yong child, &amp; needed
a bridle, and therefore they were in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>age &amp; ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the law.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
S. Paule then compareth Gods law whereby the Iewes were hylde
in ſtreight awe vnder the yoke of Ceremonies, I ſay he compareth
it to a Tutorſhip. But nowe is that time paſt and gone ſayth he: for
God hath ſent his only ſonne, in ſomuch that in our Lorde we bee
men growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and are come to ſuch perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of age, that the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was vnder the law is now ſuperfluous &amp; vnprofitable,
yea &amp; it ſhould be altogither contrary to Gods will, and to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which he hath ſtabliſhed. And ſo we ſee whereat S. Paule amed.
For it is a thing of great importance to know that our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt is no newcome thing, as though god had ſodenly bethought
him to remedie the deſtruction of mankind. For Chriſt had that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
from the beginning, and it behoued all men to ſeeke their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
in him, for the faith hath always bin one ſelfſame, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
alledgeth in the Epiſtle to the Hebrues.<note place="margin">Heb. 13. b. 8</note> And truly Abels ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
were not accepted for any worthineſſe that was in his own
perſon, nor for any valew that was in him: but only by the meanes
of faith: faith was faine to be his foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and buttreſſe. In reſpect
whereof alſo the Apoſtle ſayth,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. a. 4</note> that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt whiche
was yeſterday, is alſo to day, and ſhall be ſtil to the end. Therefore
we muſt be well reſolued of this point as a thing vndoubted &amp; out
of all queſtion: namely that wee in theſe days haue not any newe
hope of atteining to ſaluation, but the very ſame that hath bin at al
times heretofore, and that the Goſpell is not a newfound doctrine
forged within theſe few yeeres, but the very ſame doctrine wherein
all the rightuous men that euer were, haue bin inſtructed. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it hath bin ſaid heretofore, that we be made the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
when we once haue our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For S. Paule inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to rebuke the folie &amp; preſumptuouſnes that was in the Iewes,
for that they boaſted always of their earthly linage. He ſheweth that
in this behalf we muſt haue reſpect of nothing but of the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
ſeede of Gods word, whereby wee bee begotten new agayne.
Now when God adopteth vs and receiueth vs to bee his children,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth he auow vs to be the ſpiritual ofſpring of Abraham. How
then ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s children, except we agree with him in faith?
Ye ſee then that Paules handling of this point here is to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
namely to do vs to vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al time out of mind, then
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:23060:201"/>
hath not bin any other meane to renue men to ſaluation, and too
bring them into Gods fauour and loue, than by truſting in Ieſus
Chriſt, and by fleeing altogither vnto him for refuge. Thus yee ſee
why it is ſayd that yong children are maſters of the houſe, and that
the inheritance belongeth to them, though they do not yet enioy
it by reaſon of their age. And heere we haue alſo to marke further,
that it wer great wrong to the fathers of old time, to ſhet them out
of the felowſhip and onement of the faith that is ſhewed heere by
Sainct Paule. For their life was of all mens moſt miſerable, bycauſe
God kept them occupyed with many afflictions: and the liues of
the fathers (ſpecially of thoſe whome God marked out too make
them excellent) were all mirrors of inuincible patience. For what
things indured Abraham? How hard and great incounters dyd hee
heare out? VVhat manner of temptations did Iſaac and likewiſe
Iacob abide? Again what vertues ſee we in Dauid? Now if they had
ſet their mind vpon this world, they had bin in worſe plight than
the brute beaſts. Therefore (as I haue ſayd afore) it muſt needes bee
that they looked higher: and that did they witneſſe ſufficiently, not
only by word of mouth, but alſo by deede. Then let vs marke well
the point that is ſet downe heere: whiche is, that the fathers hoped
for the ſelfſame heritage that we looke for, euen by the meanes of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And for aſmuch as we agree with Abraham,
Dauid &amp; the other holy kings &amp; Prophets in faith: we ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thred
into the heauenly life with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; obtein the ſame crowne of
ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. b. 9</note> which is the reward of faith as S. Peter termeth it
in his firſt Epiſtle. Furthermore wheras S. Paule ſayth that the child
differeth nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſeruant: he doth it, always to magnify Gods
grace towards vs, and the priuiledge which we obteine by meanes
of the Goſpell. It is much for vs to be called the children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:
but it is much more whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſaid of vs, that God hath aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
vs to a higher degree by the Goſpell, than euer Abraham came
vnto. For in aſmuch as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was not yet come: he
was vnder the yoke of the law. But we at this day are free from it:
and ſo ye ſee that God hath exalted vs aboue all the Patriarks and
Prophets. And wel ought we to acknowledge this grace, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
it as it deſerueth, to the end we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſeruing of God with the earneſter affection and zele.<note place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> But (as I haue
touched already) we muſt marke, that S. Paule ſpeakes not heere of
any ſeueral perſon. For there is none of vs all but he ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
himſelfe to be much rawer and weaker in faith, then were the
Prophets and Patriarkes: and that doth their liues ſhew full well.
Then if we be not come to ſuch perfection as they were, how is it
ſayd that they were as little children, and that we be nowadays as
it were at the ſtate of men? I told you before, how S. Paul ſpeaketh
not of one man or other, but of the common gouernment of the
Church. For he ſpeaketh not of the men themſelues, but of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
that God vſed in guiding thoſe that are his. This will be ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
the better by things contrary.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. a. 2</note> S. Paule vpbraideth the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,

required. Therfore it was a kind of childiſhneſſe for them to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

the Iewes yet more roughly,<note place="margin">Eſa. 28. c. 10</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith that they were little

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to grow ſtil til they be come to the ful age of manhood. It
ſhuld ſeme at the firſt bluſh that there is ſome contrarietie. For hee
ſayth here, that al thoſe whome God hath receiued into his Church
&amp; made them of the houſhold of faith, are already come to ful age,
yea euen the verieſt idiots that ſcarſly vnderſtand three wordes
of faith, ſo they haue the principles and as yee would ſay the groſſe

And in another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he ſaith, that not only ſuche as are weake

torch before others to giue them light, muſt grow ſtill. And how
long? Not for a yeere or two, but al their life time: ſo that as long as
they liue in this world, they muſt dayly acknowledge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to
be weake ſtill, &amp; that they haue neede to inforce and ſtreine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to go forwarder and forwarder. But al this agreeth very well
togither. For if euery man examin himſelfe what he is, ſurely euen
the forwardeſt of all, ſhall finde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be ſtil as little children.
For although we indeuer to come vnto God, yet we drag our legs
after vs: and howſoeuer we bee diſpoſed of ourſelues, a number of
hindera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces ſtep before vs, &amp; euery little ſtraw ſtoppeth vs: or elſe if
a flie do but croſſe our eyes, byandby we bee ready to turne away.
And although wee had neuer ſo great courage in vs, yet haue wee
many vices to fight againſt, &amp; our knowledge is not ſuche but wee
haue neede to pray God dayly to increace our faythe, and correct
the remnant of vnbeleefe that is in vs. Thus ye ſee what euery man
ſhal find on his owne behalfe. But if we looke vpon the faſhion that
God keepeth in guiding &amp; gouerning his Church: it is certaine that
we be fully men growen. And why? For we be no more hilde in ſo
ſtreight ſubiection of the law as the fathers were: but for aſmuche
as we haue our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, we reſort vnto him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue
ſinned. VVe ſee welynough how we be berayed with ſpots &amp; blots
before God: but yet is our waſhing ready at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, in ſomuch that by
being dipped in the bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt by faith throgh
the working of the holy Ghoſt, we become pure &amp; cleane, &amp; God
accepteth vs into fauour. Againe we be bound to euerlaſting death
by reaſon of the faultes that we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit dayly againſt him: but yet the
amends for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to be found in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, for he is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined
the ranſome to diſcharge vs. Ye ſee then that we be no more
vnder the bridle wherto the fathers were ſubiect, namely in reſpect
of God and of his gouerning of vs. Therfore although we feele our
owne infirmities, yet doth not that barre vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being men growen:
that is to ſay, it is not let but that God giueth vs greater libertie and
priuiledge, than he did to ſuch as liued vnder the law. Thus in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
that queſtion is aſſoyled. And it ſerueth to bring vs backe too
that which I haue touched already, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that we muſt magnifye
<pb facs="tcp:23060:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Gods grace towards vs, for aduauncing of vs to ſuch dignitie. But
therwithall we ſee alſo, that it is not lawful for men to deuiſe a new
gouernment at their owne pleaſure vnder pretence that folke are
raw, or that many are not yet fit to be led and guided after a higher
and wiſer faſhion. And it behoueth vs to marke that wel. For when
the ſuperſtitions that reigne nowadayes in poperie did firſte enter
into the world: they began not with ſuche diueliſh blaſphemie as
they bee now mainteined with. For looke how many Ceremonies
there are in the popedome, tearmed by the name of Gods ſeruis: ſo
many be their Idolatries and the Illuſions of Satan: and to be ſhort,
all is abhominable before God. VVhy ſo? For they imagin them to
be things neceſſary to ſaluation, that by the meanes of them they
be able to raunſome themſelues, and too get forgiueneſſe of theyr
ſinnes. Moreouer they deface our Lord Ieſus Chriſt and the grace
that is brought vs by him, bycauſe they hope too raunſome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
by their owne ſatiſfactions, and by that meanes vſurp and
plucke to themſelues the thing that belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to the ſonne of God.
Thus ye ſee that they be curſed villaines. Neuertheleſſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al their
gewgawes were firſt brought into the Churche, they were not yet
ful of ſo groſſe dotages: but they crept in vnder a ſomewhat more
fauorable prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: that is to wit, that men were rude &amp; dul, &amp; vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ſecrets of the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if they had
not bin ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled &amp; dandled after the maner of little childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now (as
I haue touched alredy) it is true that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he knowes his owne infirmitie: but yet doth it not therfore
follow, that we ſhuld bring vp new faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s after our owne fancies.
VVe muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with that which God hath ordeined. A yong
child muſt not chooſe his tutor of his own head: no, he ſhould not
be ſuffered to do ſo: But his father will apoint him one. True it is
that there are other meanes ſtabliſhed by lawes: but heere S. Paule
hath taken a ſimilitude agreable to the matter that he deales with.
Then if an earthly father haue authoritie to apoint Tutors to hys
children: why ſhould not God haue the ſame power? A childe ſhall
not be licenced nor ſuffered to chooſe a Tutor to his owne liking.
Sith it is ſo: by what right or title will wee deuiſe this or that,
too ſaye, wee bee yong <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>yldren, and therefore we muſt haue a
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:23060:203"/>
faſhion meete and agreable to our ſlenderneſſe? Yea, and God hath
prouided one for vs: now ſhall wee be wiſer than he? Howſoeuer
the cace ſtandeth, the very cauſe why mens wits haue bin ſo ticke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe
to deuiſe ſtore of Ceremonies in the Chriſten Churche, was
that they ſawe ſo much rudeneſſe among the common people. Yea
mary (ſay they) it is good reaſon that there ſhould be this &amp; that.
Baptiſme were to ſimple a thing if there were nothing elſe to bee
ſeene in it but water, and that water would not bee ſufficient. For
there are a great number of lay folke, which are ſo dull that they
vnderſtande not what that miſterie meaneth, that is to wit, that we
be renued by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Therfore there needeth oyle
and creame to repreſent the holy Ghoſt, as it were in a viſible fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
Beſides this there needed light, and a white Chriſome, and
ſalte, and eft one thing, and eft another. Very well: thus was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
dayly decked, yea in the opinion of men: but all of them are
but defilings: for did not our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, who is the inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible
wiſdome of God his father, knowe well inough what
ſhould be for our profit? Shal men come creeping like little todes,
and ſeeke I wot not what, and beare them ſelues in hande that the
things which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath ordeyned are vnperfect,
and that they will take in hande to make them perfect? As muche
is to be ſayd of all the reſt. Specially the Supper of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt hath not only bin corrupted and maymed: but alſo vtterly
defaced by the diueliſhe abhomination of the helliſhe maſſe. For
they make it to be but an ordinarie matter to take a bit of bread &amp;
to drinke three ſippes of wyne. [Gods word willeth vs to] looke
to the promiſe [namely] that wee be made partakers of the body
and bloud of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, when wee receyue his holy
Supper with true fayth and obedience, and that in him onely lyeth
the foode of our ſoules. But contrariwiſe men haue bin fayne
to apparell themſelues like players in an enterlude, &amp; therwithall
to vſe ſo many murlimewes, as it was a ſhame to beholde them:
and what was the ende of al? Mary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir, it was a ſacrifice for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
of ſinnes, both of quicke and dead. VVherin yee ſee howe
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is berefte of his prieſtly dignitie which was
giuen him of God his father, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſolemne oth that he ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:23060:204"/>
neuer haue any ſucceſſor: but yet for al that the Papiſts make him
a thouſande thouſande ſucceſſors. And what maner of men I pray
you? Surely if they were Angels of heauen, yet ought they to bee
taken for diuels. But their choyce is of al the vermin of the world,
of all the raſcals, and of all naughtipackes: and ſhall wee ſay that
ſuche a rable are the ſucceſſors of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And yet
neuertheleſſe yee ſee what the Papiſtes alledge for their couert:
namely that men muſt needes haue ſome helpes bicauſe of their
infirmitie. And thereof came all the reſidue of their ſuperſtitions:
as for example, when they did ſet vp their Idols and puppets, they
termed them the lay mens bookes. But wee ſee that all their mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertneſſe
is confounded heere, when S. Paule bringeth vs backe
to the order that God hath ſet, bicauſe wee muſt all wholly holde
vs too it, and there reſt. So then, will wee not diſclayme the heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of heauen whiche our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath purchaſed for
vs? Let vs followe the gouernement which God hath ſet downe
in his Church, and aſſure our ſelues that God will ſupply al wants.
Howe rude or rawe ſoeuer wee be, he can well skill too drawe vs
to him. Yea, ſo we keepe the beaten way, for as for them that haue
ſo mingled and turmoyled things, and pyled vp ſuche a heape of
Ceremonies: they haue ſo little remedied their infirmities therby,
that they haue rather eſtraunged themſelues quite and cleane from
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. For wee know that men are of their owne
natures too muche inclined to viſible things. Therefore by taking
vp many ceremonies, men are ſo intangled, ſo ſnarled, &amp; ſo depely
drowned in them, that afterwarde they forſake God and our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt. If any man alledge, why ſo? Had not the fathers of
olde time many ceremonies alſo too helpe their infirmities? Yes:
but all theirs were reuealed too them by God. For firſt it was tolde
them that the patterne of all thoſe things was heauenly, as it is
ſayde in the .xxv. of Exodus.<note place="margin">Exo. 25. d. 40.</note> And it was ſhewed too Moyſes in
the mountayne, too the intent they ſhould not muſe vppon theſe
preſent and corruptible things. And when God ſawe they were
too muche giuen vnto them,<note place="margin">Pſa. 50. b. 8 &amp; Eſa. 66 a. 3.</note> wee ſee howe he rebuked them
ſharply by his Prophets, ſaying: away with your ſacrifices, fye on
them, for thinke yee that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ake pleaſure in your cutting of the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:23060:204"/>
throtes of beaſtes, in hope too pacifie mee thereby, as thoughe I
were an hungred or a thirſt? Thinke yee that I haue neede of
ſuche helpes? Yee ſee then that God dyd alwayes drawe his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from ſuperſtition, notwithſtanding that there were many cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
ordeyned, which was done for the neceſsitie of the time.
For it was requiſite that there ſhould be figures and ſhadowes in
the abſence of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, according too S. Paules ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
who telleth vs that the fathers of olde tyme were by that
meanes directed too ſeeke Chriſt: but nowe that he is come, wee
haue no more neede of any ſuche thing. As for example, if a man
bee away from mee, ſo as I can not come too the ſight of him, and
I would fayne haue a repreſentation of him too finde him out by, I
muſt at leaſtwiſe haue an Image that may reſemble him: but if I
ſee his body preſent, and may beholde him face too face, I neede
no more any Image or counterfet too paynte him or expreſſe
him more liuely vnto mee. Euen after the ſame maner the fathers
of olde time had many figures and ſhadnwes,<note place="margin">Mal 4. a. 2</note> bicauſe our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt was not yet reuealed.<note place="margin">Mat. 27. f. 51.</note> But nowe that he ſhineth vpon
vs, and ſheweth him ſelfe as the dayſonne of rightuouſneſſe ſo
brightly vnto vs: were in not a wilfull burying of him agayne, if
wee woulde needes haue figures ſtill? And for that cauſe alſo
was the vayle of the Temple rente a ſunder at hys death. For now
a dayes wee may enter in familiarly vntoo God, and offer him
our ſpirituall Sacrifices, that is too wit, our prayers and petitions,
and that is bicauſe wee haue the very body and ſubſtaunce as
Sainct Paule ſayth in another texte to the Colloſsians.<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.</note> Now then
wee ſee that all they which haue forged new deuiſes after that ſort,
haue vtterly corrupted and falſified the Goſpell, and haue tied to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels
and napkins before mens eyes, too keepe them from the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and knowing of Ieſus Chriſt, as they ought to haue done, and
as was requiſite for their ſaluation. And therfore it is certayne that
all they which buſie them ſelues about ſuch gewgawes, do in ſteade
of ſeeking Chriſt, throwe them ſelues headlong into damnation
by following ſo their owne brayne. They bee ſo giuen too it, as
they can not be plucked from it: they play the little children that
are buylding of ſome houſe of oyſte <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>els, who are ſo earneſt at
<pb facs="tcp:23060:205"/>
their work, that they forget to eate or drinke, and are contented to
ſuffer heate and colde, hunger and thirſt. And why ſo? Bicauſe their
fondneſſe carieth them away. Agayne they remoue their ſtuffe too
and fro, and bring in this and that, and when they once begin to ſet
them ſelues to it, they can neuer make an ende. Euen ſo is it with
men when they will needes ſerue God after their owne liking. Yee
ſee then that we had neede to be ſober in that behalfe, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
our ſelues with the helpes &amp; meanes that are ordeyned alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to bring vs to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. VVe haue Baptiſme &amp; the
Lords ſupper: let vs hold our ſelues contented with them, for our
curioſitie will always draw vs vnto euill, vnleſſe we yeeld to Gods
appoyntment, and giue ouer al our owne ſpeculations and fancies.
Yea and let vs vnderſtande that it is a blaſphemie agaynſt God,
when men ſay [of their owne heads] this or that is good for vs. I
tell you playnly, when ſoeuer men ſay, we muſt haue this, and we
muſt haue that, or we muſt haue our Church or religion of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
or that faſhion: It is as much as if he ſhould ſay, God was not
well aduiſed how wee ſhould bee gouerned, he wiſte not what was
meete for vs. As for example, it ſeemeth to them to be too ſlender
a matter that there ſhould be no more but only water in Baptiſme:
and they muſt haue ſomewhat elſe to giue it a greater grace and
maieſtie. Therfore they haue tapers, and ſalte, and creame, and all
the reſt of the pompes of their owne making. Lo how men wyll
alwayes bee adding of ſomewhat vnto Gods commaundement:
which doing is a curſed blaſphemie, as I ſayde afore. And it riſeth
of this, that they had not an eye to the principall, but gazed ſtyll
vpon the appurtenances. The principall is the promiſes: for all
the Ceremonies of the world are not onely vayne and baggagely,
but alſo diueliſhe illuſions, excepte Gods worde bee printed in
them, and that that be the thing whereat they looke, and the marke
wherat they ame. As how? If wee had no promiſe for baptiſme, ne
knew to what end it was ordeyned: what a gewgawe were it? It
were much better for vs to forbeare it. Agein, if we knew not what
the Lordes Supper meaneth, it were better that the remembrance
of it were vtterly buryed. But when Gods word goeth with it, ſo as
we haue the promiſes to w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lyeth all our truſt there. And moreouer it is ſayde that there we be
renued by the holy Ghoſt. Lo how baptiſme leadeth vs to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and the promiſes leade vs to Chriſt, as to the partie that is
conteyned in them. Thus ye ſee what wee haue to beare in minde,
when S. Paule exalteth vs in degree aboue all the Patriarkes, and
thoſe that lyued vnder the Lawe: namely, that it is not for that
there was not more perfection, conſtancie, and fayth in them, than
is nowe a dayes in vs. And therewithall (as I haue earſt ſayde) wee
bee ſtill confirmed in this poynt, that there is no newe meane of
ſaluation ſet foorth vnto vs, but that God gathereth vs too hym
for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, in like wiſe as he hath in all ages
called his choſen, and thoſe whome he lyſted too cull out, and
whome he voutſafed too make partakers of the adoption that is
imparted too vs at this day. For if it mighte bee ſayde, that men
haue had the meane too bee iuſtified, and too come in fauour with
God, but onely ſince Ieſus Chriſte came into the worlde: what
ſhould become of thoſe that lyued afore? Our fayth ſhoulde bee
but weake, and it would caſt vs into ſuche a maze, as wee ſhoulde
not wote where too become. How nowe, would wee ſay? Hathe
not God bin the father of his creatures in all ages? VVas there
no ſaluation tyll Ieſus Chriſte came intoo the worlde? Yes, but
where as it is ſayde that the ſaluation is manyfeſted vnto vs by the
Goſpell, yet was it alſo alreadie before: and althoughe there was
a veyle in the Temple, and other ſhadowes, yet neuertheleſſe
the fathers had alwayes an eye vnto Ieſus Chriſte, vnto whome
wee bee led at this day. Thus you ſee howe they mighte walke
freely and without doubting, and howe that at this day alſo there
is not any thing that can ſhake vs, if wee keepe on our waye too
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, knowing that by his meanes wee bee all
called too the heritage which he hath purchaſed for vs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
wee ought ſo muche the more too abhorre theſe Deuils, that

               </gap>eare vs in hande and ſtrayne them ſelues too proue, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

was that curſed creature that was puniſhed heere according to his

that Abraham neuer taſted nor knew of the heauenly life, nor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
worſhipped God but imaginatiuely, and that the reporting of
him to be the father of the faythfull is but a mockerie, and that his
fayth was but a ſhadowe of fayth, and finally that he neuer knewe
of Ieſus Chriſt, nor of his comming. Beholde (I praye you) the
blaſphemies wherwith his bookes were ſtuffed. But let vs in theſe
dayes abhorre ſuche plagues of Satan. For it is certayne that the
ſayde Champion of the Diuell was purpoſely bent too bring too
paſſe, that there ſhoulde bee no more fayth in the worlde. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
muche as the Diuell tranſformed him ſelfe, and ſhewed not his
hornes at the firſt, it was very daungerous when he came after
that faſhion, as it were too digge downe the foundation of oure
fayth, as it were vnder the earth. And Sainct Paule warneth vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
heereof, too the ende wee ſhould ſtande vppon our garde,
and keepe good watche that wee bee not taken tardie. Then let vs
marke well, that wheras it is ſayd heere, that to be made the heires
of God, we muſt be made the members of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:
thereby the holy Ghoſt intendeth too confirme vs, to the ende we
ſhould be ſo muche the better diſpoſed to go on forwarde conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
vnto God, and to holde out in the hope till wee haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
all the battels of this world, to be brought into the ſpirituall
reſt which we looke for. Alſo we haue therewithall to marke well,
what is ſayde concerning the fulneſſe of time. For according too
mens vnmeaſurable inquiſitiueneſſe, it mighte bee demaunded
heere, why and how ſo? VVhy hathe God: driuen it off ſo long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
ſeeing wee were forlorne and damned in Adams fall? How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
it that he hath not remedied it rather? Surely S. Paule doth
not altogither ſatiſfie mens appetites, but cutteth it quite off by
the waſte. And in good ſooth if God mente too content vs, hee
ſhoulde bee fayne too feede vs with many needeleſſe things: but
he intendeth too t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ye the obedientneſſe of our fayth. And Sainct
Paule alſo dooth barre vs of that thing, in ſaying, <hi>that the fulneſſe of
time was not yet come.</hi> And what meaneth he by the fulneſſe of time?
He meaneth the time that God hath appoynted in his owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:23060:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not according as men might haue iudged of it: for
they bee no competent iudges of that matter, but muſte ſubmitte
them ſelues to God, and allowe of that whiche he hath ſtabliſhed.
Thus yee ſee what S. Paule ment by ſaying, that the full time was
then come, when God ſente his onely ſonne into the worlde.
Therefore let vs learne that our cheefe wiſdome is this ſoberneſſe
of ſubmitting our ſelues vnto God, too accept for good and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
what ſoeuer thing he dooth, knowing that on our owne part,
though wee haue neuer ſo muche vnderſtanding, it is but folly for
vs too thinke our ſelues aught woorth, or too take vppon vs the
skill of any thing: and that wee muſt learne too humble our ſelues
to our God, and not doo as many men doo, who are ſo haſtie as to
ſay, VVhat? I thinke thus, and thus is mine opinion. For there is
not any thing more contrarie to Gods doctrine; than when men
preſume ſo much vpon them ſelues as too ſay, thus muſt the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
go, and ſo and ſo do I thinke or ſuppoſe. Truely it becommeth
vs too behilde as captiues,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. a. 3.</note> as S. Paule ſayth in the ſeconde too the
Corinthians. Let vs holde our ſelues in ſuch awe, as wee may not
once lifte vp our heades too diſpute agaynſt God, nor make any
eſtimation of our ſelues as though we were of ſome abilitie. Let vs
holde vs contented with the libertie that he hath giuen vs, and not
abuſe the grace that he hath graunted vs, in preferring vs before
thoſe that were as Angels in this worlde, and yet notwithſtanding
were not aduanced to the libertie which wee haue by the Goſpell.
Furthermore S. Paule doth heere bring vs back to the thing which
we ought to conſider aboue all others: which is that our beeing at
the time of full age in theſe dayes, is not in reſpect of any vertue
that is in vs, but in reſpect of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. The difference
betweene vs and the fathers of olde time, is (as I haue ſayd already)
that they were led as vnder awe, and wee bee nowe ſet free into

glorified in him ſelfe, wyll alſo bryng vs intoo the heauenly

glory, whereinto hee is gone before vs. This is the thing that
Sainct Paule ment purpoſely too tell vs. As touching that it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that he was made of woman, and put vnder the Lawe: it can
not be diſpatched at this time, and therefore we will reſerue it tyll
an other time.</p>
            <p>And nowe let vs fall downe before the maieſtie of our good
God, with acknowlegement of our faultes, praying him to make

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue tolde you already why S. Paule ſpeakes
heere of the fulneſſe of time: namely to abate
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s curioſitie, who by their good willes would
ſeeke to farre into Gods ſecretes, yea and take
vpon them ſo boldly as to reply againſt God if
he behaue not himſelf after their fancie. To the
intent therfore that the faythfull may content
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with the order that God hath kept in ſending of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt: he ſayeth that the due ſeaſon was not before, for that
matter dependeth vpon the only good pleaſure of God, and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his
vnchaungeable purpoſe, wherevnto it behoueth vs too ſubmit our
ſelues. And now S. Paule ſayeth, <hi>that our Lord Ieſus Christ was made of
woman, and put vnder the lawe, to acquite thoſe that were vnder the lawe.</hi>
Firſt he ſayeth that he was clothed with our nature, for elſe he could
not haue yeelded obedience to God in our behalfe, that wee might
be ſet free. Howbeit for aſmuch as he was conceyued after a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
maner, therefore doth S. Paule ſay he was made or begotten of
a woman. It is true that he was of the ſeede of Dauid: neuertheleſſe
I haue told you already, that there was a ſecrete working of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Ghoſt in his conception. But how ſoeuer it was, our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſte tooke our nature vppon him, too the end he might yeeld
obedience to God his father, as it were in our perſone. And that was
the cauſe why he tooke our nature vppon him. And this ſubiection
whereof he ſpeaketh, was not of conſtraint, but of good will. For
wee know that the Sonne of God hath all ſuperioritie and ſouerain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
in ſo much that euen the Angelles and all the principalities muſt
bowe their knees before him too doo him honour. How then could
he bee ſubiect too the Lawe, ſeyng that the Lawe is ſuch a bondage?
This doth no whit deface the Maieſtie of Gods ſonne, for aſmuch
as he abaced himſelf of his owne good will. Therefore (as it is ſayd
in the ſecond too the Philippians) there is no contrarietie in that he
might make himſelfe equall with God without robberie:<note place="margin">Phil. 2. b. 6.</note> and yet
that he abaced himſelfe alſo. So then, for aſmuch as this doing of
his proceeded of his owne meere and vnconſtreyned goodneſſe: he
continued alwayes in his owne ſtate, not withſtanding that before
men he had the ſhape and faſhion of a ſeruant as S. Paule alſo ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
<pb facs="tcp:23060:208"/>
[in the ſame place.] How ſoeuer the cace ſtand, let vs marke
well, that he which was Lord of heauen and earth, tooke that ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, to ſet vs free from it. For we ſee how our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt was circumcyzed, and when he came to mans age, he kept di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
all that belonged too the lawe of Moyſes: not that he was
bound to do it, but to put away the bondage, and to breake the bond
wherewith wee were as it were pinched and fettered. Therefore as
oft as the Goſpell ſpeaketh to vs of libertie, (whereof S. Paule doth
alſo treate in this text): let vs come backe to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
aſſuring our ſelues that he became not bonde after that faſhion for
nothing. Now, there is nothing in him which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyneth not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of our ſaluation. Then muſt we needes conclude that wee
be not any more ſubiect to the bondage of the lawe, or elſe it would
turne too the diſhonour of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte. For what a thing
were it, if after his yeelding of himſelf to ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our ſakes, we
ſhould ſtill hold ſcorne of libertie? It were more conuenient that
heauen and earth ſhould chaunge their nature, than too ſay that the
ſonne of God is come downe here bylow, and hath abaced himſelfe
in maner aforeſayd, and yet that we ſhould eſteeme it but as a play
or trifling thing. For what a dealing were that? Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let vs learn,
that we may now ſerue our God freely, and come directly vnto him
without being hild any more ſo ſtreitly vnder the yoke of the law as
the auncient fathers were, bicauſe Ieſus Chriſt is come, &amp; hath ſet vs
free. I haue told you already heretofore, in what wiſe we be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the law. It is not for that it remayneth not ſtill as a rule to
frame our life by, ſo as God may gouerne vs &amp; haue all ſuperioritie
ouer vs. For what a thing were it if we ſhould be worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
folke &amp; vnbeleeuers? But it is certaine that they haue the law
ingraued in their hartes as ſayeth S. Paule.<note place="margin">Rom. 2. b. 15.</note> He that neuer went too
ſchoole, ne hath had any teaching at all, nor euer hath herd or red a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, may notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding diſcerne betweene good &amp; euill. Not
that he hath a perfect skill: but bicauſe that howſoeuer the world go
with him, God to take away all excuce of ignorance, would that men
ſhould haue that euidence printed in their hartes, that theft, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
extortion, deceyt, periurie, drunkenneſſe and ſuch other like
things, are vices to be condemned. Alſo it was his will to haue men
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:23060:208"/>
know, that to blaſpheme his name is an irkſome thing. The Heathen
folke knew all this without any teaching. Now then if we ſhould be
lawleſſe vnder pretence that our lord Ieſus Chriſt reigneth ouer vs,
and hath ſet vs at libertie: what a thing were it? There woulde bee
greater co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion in the Church, than there is where Satan hath made
a minglemangle and put al things out of order, ſo as there is no bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
at all. But whereas it is ſayd that we be no more vnder the lawe:
it is in the ſame reſpect whereof mention hath bin made heretofore;
namely, that the Lawe ſhall not execute any more this ſharpneſſe
and rigour vppon vs, too ſay vnto vs, curſed ſhall he bee that fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not all things. For ſo long as the threatening remayneth and
ſtandeth in force, we muſt needes be as men out of their wittes, and
as folke vpon the racke ready to be torne in peeces. To be ſhort, we
can haue no reſt except the ſentence of the law be aboliſhed, which
is that they which performe not all that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayned in the law ſhall
be accurſed. But co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarywiſe let our conſciences beare vs record that
God pitieth vs and beareth with our infirmities as a father doth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
his children, and paſſeth not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vyces that are in vs, but
hideth &amp; burieth them ſo as our ſeruis is acceptable to him, though
there be many things amiſſe in it: &amp; then are we no more ſubiect to
the law. Not that we ſhould be quite without rule, nor that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements
ought not to be preached continually vnto vs, to the
end we may know what God hath ordeyned &amp; be hild in awe by it:
but that we ſhould not be out of hart if we fall, or halt, or make any
falſe ſteppes: or that if we cannot diſcharge our ſelues of al things ſo
perfectly as were requiſite, yet we ſhould not bee vtterly diſmayed,
knowing well that God will alwayes hold vs vp by the hand, &amp; not
enter into accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with vs to ſift our life rigorouſly: &amp; moreouer by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Ceremonies that were before the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſte, are no more in vſe as they were towardes the fathers of
old time, who were trayned by them as in their childhood. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the brute beaſts were offered in ſacrifize, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> behild there his
owne death, as though the bottomleſſe gulfe of hell had bin opened
too ſwallow vp the whole world. At this day wee knowe that the
Sonne of God hath by his offering vp of himſelfe in ſacrifize, and by
his ſheading of his bloud for vs purcha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:23060:209"/>
that we come with our heads vpright before God, not doubting but
that we obteyne life by the death of him that was not ſubiect too it,
but of his owne good will made himſelf ſubiect too it as our ſuretie,
to the end that we might be quit and diſcharged by his death &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
Thus ye ſee that at this day the law is aboliſhed towardes vs, &amp;
that we be deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, euen to obtayne the adoption. Howbeit,
in ſpeaking ſo, S. Paule meeneth not that the Patriarkes, Kings, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and other faythfull folkes that liued vnder the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
were not the children of God as well as wee, or that they knew not
themſelues to be adopted by fayth as well as wee: but that the ſayd
adoption was not yet ſo reueled as it is now adayes. For (as we haue
ſeene) the lawe was a Tutor too rule little children. But we be come
to the age of men, bicauſe the ſonne of God hath ſhewed himſelfe,
and brought vs all perfectneſſe by his comming. Then ſeing it is ſo:
wee do now inioy the adoption which the fathers did but as it were
taſte of afore, bicauſe the tyme was not yet come. Not that God
wrought not in them with ſuch meaſure of his ſpirite as he thought
good: but bicauſe the cace co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth the order of gouernment that
God hild, &amp; not the perſones themſelues, as I haue ſayd already. For
in thoſe dayes there were ſhadowes and figures, ſo that it was as a
chayne of bondage: but now that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt calleth vs to
him, and that the veyle of the temple is rent aſunder: he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
vs a Sanctuarie, not buylded with mans hand, but of a heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly
making, whereinto wee may boldly enter, in aſmuch as he is gone in
thither before vs. Ye ſee then that we be receyued fully into this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option,
bicauſe the law hath no more power ouer vs, as it had in the
time of the figures and ſhadowes. Nowe too confirme this matter, S.
Paule addeth, <hi>that God ſheweth that he taketh vs for his children, bycauſe
the ſpirit of his ſonne is in vs, crying father:</hi> Speaking of the holy ghoſt,
he doth by a circumſtance terme him the ſpirite of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt. For by what title can we be Gods children, but bycauſe wee
be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of his onely ſonne, to whom that right honour, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
belongeth by nature? For in that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is called
the only ſonne of God, not only men, but alſo the very Angelles of
heauen are excluded from that dignitie, ſo that it belongeth to none
but onely to Ieſus Chriſt. Howbeeit for aſmuch as we bee ioyned
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:23060:209"/>
vnto him, and he will not be ſeparated from vs, but ſheweth himſelf
to be our head, and we haue ſuch vnion with him as the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers haue
with the head: therfore he ſayth that eyther we muſt haue the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, or elſe we can haue no familiar acceſſe
to our God, too call vpon him as our father: and it were too great a
preſumption for vs too take that honour vppon vs. For if a begger
would make himſelf a riche mans ſonne, folke would laugh him to
skorne, and he ſhould be ſhaken off with al the ſhame that might be.
And how then ſhould wee ſillie woormes of the earth, yea and full
of all infection and filthineſſe, go match our ſelues with the Angels
of heauen, to ſay that God is our father? Truely the very Angelles
themſelues cannot chalendge ſuche nobilitie, but by the meanes of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt bycauſe he is their head. Then were it greate
pryde in vs if wee would take vppon vs too ſtie aboue the Angelles,
without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in the name of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, or without
hauing his ſpirit, that we might be accepted as members of his body,
and bee intertayned as it were in his perſone. And therefore alſo it
is ſayde that he maketh interceſsion for vs, and that wee call vppon
God in his name. For if he were not our ſpokeſman, how could we
hope too haue our petitions receyued? Let vs a little conſider the
feebleneſſe that is in vs when wee intend too pray vntoo God. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
wee ſigh vnfaynedly, and although wee haue good motions
to lift vs vp: yet do wee faynt, and they that thinke too come vnto
God with a perfect zele, beguile themſelues, yea euen to groſly. But
they that humbly acknowledge themſelues to be as they bee: doo
perceyue themſelues too halt and ſtumble euen in the very vertue
and ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth that is giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Howbeit for aſmuch as our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt is in the middes, &amp; ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth there in our behalf, and maketh vs
to come neere: therfore we may boldly pray. And for the ſame cauſe
did the high Prieſt in the time of the lawe beare twelue precious
ſtones vpon his breſt, and other twelue behind vpon his ſhoulders,
wherein were written the names of the twelue tribes of Iſraell. For

for a witneſſe of Gods preſence. It w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> ynough that the high prieſt
<pb facs="tcp:23060:210"/>
went in,<note place="margin">Exod. 28. d. 29.</note> in the name of them al, hauing in his hand the bloud wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Gods wrath was to bee appeazed. Then had he the ſayd tablet
at his breſt, wherein the names of the twelue trybes (that is too ſay,
of Gods people) were ingrauen. Alſo he had them vppon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that it might bee ſayd howe he was there in the name of the
whole Churche. Thus yee ſee how wee crie, euen by the ſpirite of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, vntoo God his father, with full aſſurance that
he knoweth and auoweth vs for members of his ſonne, by whoſe
meanes he receyueth vs into his heauenly kingdome, and ſetteth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the gate vntoo vs, ſo as wee haue acceſſe vntoo him familiarly.
And this is expreſſed yet better by the woord <hi>Crie.</hi> S. Paule coulde
well haue ſayd, <hi>wee ſay:</hi> but he goeth further as neede was. For (as
I haue touched heretofore) here he compareth the old fathers with
vs, and ſheweth that our ſtate is better than theirs, bicauſe God hath
ſhewed himſelfe more bountifull towardes vs, than he did towardes
them that were vnder the lawe. That is the cauſe why he ſayeth that
we in theſe dayes do crie out that God is our father, yea euen with
open mouth and ful libertie, and that we come boldly to him, glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that we be taken for his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">Eſai. 63. d. 16.</note> True it is that the fathers vnder
the lawe did alſo vſe the ſame maner of ſpeeche, as when they ſayd,
Lord what ſhall become of vs if thou receyue vs not to mercie? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
knoweth vs not, no more doth Iacob. VVee bee borne of
them as touching the fleſh: howbeit, all this naturall kinred is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in compariſon of the ſpirituall kinred, whereinto thou haſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greffed
vs in the perſone of thy ſonne. Therfore thou art our father?
After that maner did the whole Churche pray vntoo God as Eſay
reporteth it. And there are many ſuch textes. And out of doubte it
had bin impoſsible for the fathers too haue offered vp good petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and prayers vnto God, without that ground: that is too wit, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
they had bin fully reſolued, that God tooke them for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
For that is the thing wherein the faythfull differed from the
Heathen and vnbeleeuers in all ages. The Heathen menne did in
deede pray vntoo God, howbeeit, that was but at all aduenture, not
knowing whither they ſhould bee herd or no. But our prayer muſte
bee grounded vppon fayth.<note place="margin">Rom. 10. c. 13.</note> And Sainct Paules ſaying ſhall alwayes
bee true: namely that wee cannot pray vntoo God, except we firſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:23060:210"/>
know and vnderſtand his good will towardes vs. Therefore it muſt
needes followe that they whiche liued vnder the Lawe, were fully
aſſured in their conſciences that God accepteth them for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Howbeeit this was ſhewed them as yee woulde ſay but with
half face, ſo that they prayed beyng wrapped in many ſhadowes and
figures, whiche taught them groſly. It is true that they offered not
themſelues without fayth (for then had it booted them verie little,)
and that it ſtood them on hand to ouer come all the lettes that were
ſet before their eyes: but yet were they not able too call vpon God
with the full certeintie whiche is communicated too vs vnder the
Goſpell.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. c. 15</note> And this is yet better expreſſed in the eyght too the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
where Sainct Paule ſayeth that wee haue not now receyued
the ſpirit of fearfulneſſe and bondage, but the ſpirit of boldneſſe, ſo
as we bee able too crie Abba, father. And by the contrarie member
he inlighteneth the matter that might bee darkſome in this Texte
by reaſon of the ſhortneſſe of it. For he ſetteth downe the ſpirite of
bondage, bycauſe the Lawe was giuen with great terribleneſſe, and
the old fathers were driuen too feele that they were hilde in awe
vnder it and had not yet the libertie that is purchaced vs in theſe
dayes by the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. They were as little
children: who although their fathers trauell for them, knowe not
what is layd vp for them. For although their fathers loue them:
yet muſt the rod bee walking now and then, and they ſtand alwayes
in awe. And bycauſe they haue no diſcretion to gouerne themſelues,
they know not how their fathers will deale with them. Euen ſo was
it in the tyme of the Lawe: There was a kind of fearefulneſſe, in ſo
much that they which were Gods children, were yet vnder the ſtreit
bondage afore ſayd.<note place="margin">Exod. 19. c. 16. &amp; 20. c. 19.</note> But Sainct Paule ſayeth that we be no more as
it were at Mount Sinai, where God thundred, where the lightenings
flaſhed, where trumpets ſounded, and where the ayre rored in ſuche
wize, that all menne were ſo amazed as they durſt not come neere
God, according as it is ſayde, let not God ſpeake vntoo vs, for then
are wee all dead and vndone. VVee bee not nowe in that feare
ſayeth Sainct Paule: but God hath giuen vs full libertie bycauſe
our Lord Ieſus Chriſte is come. And we know that he is gone into
heauen, to the intent that the, heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

haue ſuch terrible Maieſtie as to make vs ſhrinke backe from it: and
that we might find fauour &amp; grace to talke familiarly with our God.
Thus ye ſee in effect what this woord cry importeth. Now, it is true
that the faythfull oftentimes ſhall not feele ſo franke &amp; free a mind
in themſelues, but that they ſhall be diſtreſſed when they open their
mouthes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>artbitings, and caſt doubtes whither God will
heare them or no. Heauineſſe wil ſo ouerpreſſe vs, as we ſhal hardly
know how to diſpoze our prayers, or whereat to begin. This then is
a thing that might ſeeme contrarie to that which S. Paule ſpeaketh
heere, and to the text which I am about to alledge. For it will follow
that we be cut off from the aray of the faithfull, if we doubte in our
ſelues whither<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may pray vnto God or no and that our hartes be
as it were locked vp in thoſe doubtings. If wee bee at that poynt, in
what cace are we then? where is the truſt that S. Paule ſpeaketh of
heere?<note place="margin">Rom. 8. d. 25.</note> He diſchargeth that doubt immediatly, ſaying that Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
ſupplieth our wantes &amp; infirmities. For there are certaine vnut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable
gronings which God heareth, although they be not percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Therfore let vs firſt marke, that if we haue profited in the
Goſpel, we muſt beleeue aſſuredly that God taketh vs for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and that he calleth vs gently vnto him, and that we may boldly
come vnto him. According wherevnto he ſayeth in the third to the
Epheſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,<note place="margin">Eph. 3. c. 12.</note> that by our beleuing in Ieſus Chriſt, we by and by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyue
truſt &amp; boldneſſe to offer our ſelues vnto God. Then if we haue not
truſt and boldneſſe, it appeereth that wee haue no fayth. Howbeit
for aſmuch as our fayth is neuer perfect, but indureth br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ts wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is as good as beaten downe too outward ſeeming: ſometimes
wee bee ſo diſmayed at it through the ouerpreſsing of our miſeries
and afflictions, that God ſeemeth too bee eſtraunged from vs, and
wee cannot vtter one woord of prayer vnto God. And therefore
let vs receiue that which S. Paule ſayeth: namely that the ſpirit hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
our infirmities. And ſo let vs holde out ſtill and pray vnto God
without ceaſsing, and if wee bee ſpeechleſſe, or do ſtutte, and cannot
vtter any one peece of our minde to the purpoſe, but bee intangled
with many impedimentes: well, howſoeuer wee fare, let Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
thruſt vs foreward ſtill, and let vs ſticke faſt to this ground, that
God is neuertheleſſe our fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, and let vs flee too him for refuge,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:23060:211"/>
and though wee do it not ſo frankly as were requiſite, but be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weyed
with the heauineſſe of our greefes, yet whatſoeuer come of
it, let vs go on forwarde ſtill, and not ſhet our ſelues out of the
gate through our owne default, but holde on ſtill in praying to our
God, aſſuring our ſelues that he will haue pitie vpon vs in the ende.
Thus ye ſee what we haue to conſider here when mention is made
of the ſpirite of boldeneſſe or truſtfulneſſe, whereby wee may crie
[vnto God,] bicauſe we bee ſure of our adoption. Let vs not think
that this can bee fully in vs, for there are many vyces which we bee
not yet ridde of. Againe there remayneth vnbeleefe, which if it bee
not throughly rooted in vs, hath notwithſtanding many ſtrings too
holde vs backe with, ſo as wee muſt be faine to ſtriue agaynſt them.
But yet in the meane while, we muſt be fully reſolued that God is
our father: and afterwarde according too oure meaſure and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
let vs keepe onwarde to the marke that is ſet forth here. And it
is one of the greateſt controuerſies that we haue with the Papiſts in
theſe dayes. For they ſay we cannot be ſure that God loueth vs, and
that it is a cace which ought to hang in ſuſpence whether he loue vs
or hate vs. But by this meanes they vtterly deface the true maner
and faſhion of praying. For wee knowe howe the Scripture ſayeth,
that we cannot pray without fayth,<note place="margin">Ia. 1. a. 6. 7.</note> and S. Iames ſayeth, let not ſuch
a man thinke that euer he ſhall bee heard, that is to wit, ſuch a one
as commeth like a wauering reede that is ſhaken too and fro wyth
euerie winde. For we muſt beleeue that God is faythfull in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and that we ſhall not be diſappoynted in comming vnto him,
bycauſe he hath bidden vs come. VVee muſt be thus minded in all
our prayers and petitions, or elſe all is nothing worth. Againe what
Chriſtianitie is there in vs if wee haue not Gods ſpirite, as ſayeth
Saint Paule in the .viij. to the Romanes?<note place="margin">Rom. 5. a. 5</note> And for for the ſame cauſe
alſo doth he ſay in the fifth Chapter, that wee ſhall neuer bee aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of our hope, bycauſe Gods loue is ſheaded into our heartes by
the holy Ghoſt which is giuen vntoo vs. For if wee haue no hope,
ſurely then are we baniſhed out of Gods kingdome, and cannot bee
named Chriſtians. And what maner of hope is it? It is (ſayeth Saint
Paule) that Gods loue is ſheaded into our heartes: that is too ſay,
that we be fully ſettled and contented bycauſe we know our ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:23060:212"/>
to be in Gods fauour. And howe knowe wee that? By the ſpirite.
And he ſetteth downe purpoſely the worde <hi>Sheade,,</hi> too doo vs too
wit, that Gods making of vs too feele his fatherly goodneſſe and
loue towardes vs, is not with a wette finger and away (as they ſay,)
and then afterwarde too leaue vs hungrie and needie: but that hee
ſheadeth or poureth it out vpon vs, that is to ſay, that he giueth vs a
ſufficient &amp; ful warrant that he acknowledgeth and auoweth vs for
his owne, ſeeing he hath layde foorth all the treaſures of his mercie
in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Nowe, this muſt needes comes of Gods
ſpirite,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. c. 9 &amp; d. 14.</note> according as it is ſayd in the firſt to the Corinthians, that we
do not now by our naturall wit comprehende that God loueth vs:
for that paſſeth all the power of man. God then muſt be faine to lift
vs vp aboue the worlde: for it lieth not in our owne power to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
our ſelues of Gods loue. Therefore the ſpirit giueth it vs: that
is to ſay, we haue it not by nature, nor by inheritance, neither do we
purchace it by our deſertes: but God of his owne mere goodneſſe
aſſureth vs of it, to the intent wee might reſort vnto him familiarly
in all our needes. But contrariwiſe, the Papiſts after their own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
deeme that we cannot be ſure of Gods loue. And theſe
wretches are ſo blinde, that they ſay it is preſumption if we deſyre
to haue any certentie of it: yea [and ſo is it,] if we would haue it of
our ſelues. For if a man woulde vpon his owne conceyte beare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in hande that God is his father, he ſhoulde be but a fantaſticall
childe, and a foole at all aſſayes like one of theſe dizardes that gad
vp and downe the ſtreetes, and play the Kings and Princes. But if
we haue the ſayde recorde of our God: ſhould wee then doubt of
it ſtill? Is it a preſumptuouſneſſe to do God ſo much honour, as to
beleeue him to be faythfull, and to reſt our ſelues vpon his worde.
Againe on the other ſyde;<note place="margin">Math. 11. d 28.</note> when we go to pray, is it not a good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe
that hee gyueth vs when hee ſayeth, come too mee? If
wee had no commaundement to pray vntoo God, ſurely it were
too great a raſhneſſe to preace into his preſence. But ſeeing that,
hee calleth vs, yea and taryeth not till wee ſeeke hym, but preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vs, and telleth vs that he requireth nothing but that we ſhould
come to him, and giueth vs both the motion and mynde too pray
vnto him: if we take him for our God, let vs yeelde him his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:23060:212"/>
prayſe, by ſeeking all our welfare at his hande. Seeing (ſay I)
that he hath ſo preuented vs: ſhoulde we diſpute whither we ought
to follow him or no? Is it not a blaſphemie that tendeth to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing
of all Gods promiſes? Thus yee ſee what wee haue too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
when mention is made of this worde <hi>Crie.</hi> But yet for all
this, howſoeuer the worlde go with vs, though wee bee fayne too
hacke it out lyke folke that haue halfe forgone theyr ſpeeche, and
bee ſtraytened with ſo many ouerthwartes that wee cannot faſhion
out one ſillable or iote aright: yet whatſoeuer come of it, let vs not
leaue goyng vnto God, vpon this grounde, that he will ſuccour vs
at our neede, and redreſſe the infirmities that plucke vs backe. To
be ſhort, when the ſpirite worketh in vs to ſtirre vs vp to the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
whereof I haue ſpoken: let vs ſeeke God, and though we be
at our wittes ende, and knowe not whereat to begin: let vs alwayes
go forward to the marke that is ſet before vs here. And Saint Paule
ſayth purpoſely, <hi>that we crie Abba, father,</hi> to ſignifie that it is not the
Iewes onely whome God will haue to call vpon him, and to flee to
him for ſuccor nowadayes: but that he will haue the whole worlde
to do it. And foraſmuch as the Goſpell which is the key to open vs
the gate of Paradice, is publiſhed euerie where: nowe he will haue
all men to inioy the right which heeretofore had bin as the ſpeciall
priuiledge of the linage of Abraham. Thus ye ſee after what maner
we crie <hi>Abba,</hi> father. Nowe the firſt worde <hi>Abba</hi> ſignifieth a father:
howbeeit Saint Paule vſeth the language that was hilde ſtill as moſt
common among the Iewes. For the Hebrewe tongue was not ſo
pure after the captiuitie of Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it was before, but was mingled
with the Chaldey tongue. Howbeeit Saint Paules meening heere,
is to ſhewe that vnder the Goſpell all men in common ought to cal
vppon God with open mouth, bicauſe his adoption was offered to
all Nations, and the wall was broken downe which deuided the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes
and Gentiles aſunder, ſo that henceforth he will haue vs to be
equall and in lyke ſtate. Ye ſee then that wee may call vpon God
in all languages, as it were with one mouth, and we muſt not doubt
but that God receiueth vs and giueth vs leaue to preace vnto him,
inaſmuch as we haue the doctrine of the Goſpell to leade vs, which
is an infallible guide for vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:213"/>
Now by this meanes we ſee that euery mans praying vnto God
ought to bee with vnderſtanding. For if a man that vnderſtandeth
no more but his owne mother tongue, ſhoulde pray vnto God in
Greeke or Hebrew, ſurely it were but a daliance, and an vtter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting
and marring of the rule of praying aright, and there coulde
be nothing but hypocriſie and feyned deuotion in it. I haue tolde
you alreadie that we cannot pray vnto God without fayth, too bee
ſure that he will heere vs. And what a thing is it if wee knowe not
what we haue to aske at his hande? Is it not a defiling of ſo holy a
thing as prayer is? VVe knowe that to call vpon God, and too flee
to him alone for ſuccour, is the Sacrifize that hee requireth at our
handes, bicauſe that therein we confeſſe him to bee our father, and
the verie welſpring of all welfare. Nowe then it is meete that wee
ſhould reſort vnto him which is the rewarder, according as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſayth in the .xj. to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. b. 6</note> that hee diſappoynteth not
thoſe that ſeeke him, but that they ſhall alwayes finde that there is
nothing better than to flee vnto him. Therefore when we pray vnto
God, we muſt haue vnderſtanding to know what wee craue of him.
Marke that for one poynt. Moreouer whereas it is ſayde that wee
crie Abba, father: thereby we be done to vnderſtande, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie
of languages hindereth not the vnitie of faith. Eſay ſeemeth
to vſe a cleane contrarie maner of ſpeaking,<note place="margin">Eſa. 19. d. 15</note> when hee ſayth, that all
men ſhall ſpeake the language of Canaan, that is to ſay, the Hebrew
tongue. Nowe to be Chriſtians and faythfull beleeuers, it is not of
neceſsitie that we muſt haue skil of that language: but he meaneth
that God ſhall be worſhipped in all languages. And hee ſpeaketh of
the tongue of Canaan, bicauſe the Hebrew was a holy tongue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Gods ſecretes were conteyned. Foraſmuch then as that language
was after a ſort conſecrated vnto God: he ſayth that God ſhall bee
honoured of all men, and all men ſhall renounce their blaſphemies,
ſuperſtitions, and abuſes, and there ſhall be one conformitie of faith
among men, and being inſtructed both in the Law and the Goſpell,
they ſhall all make one ſelfe ſame profeſsion, ſo as there ſhall be one
tunableneſſe and good agreement among all men. Howbeit S. Paule
ment to expreſſe here more clearely after what maner we call vpon
God: namely that euery man prayeth to him as now in his own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:23060:213"/>
and he heareth vs all. For God needeth not to go to ſchole
to learne this mans or that mans language. And we knowe that in
praying, ſpeech ſerueth too no other purpoſe than too ſtyrre vs vp
the more vnto it. Alſo it ſerueth vs too witneſſe before men with
our mouthes, that we repoſe all our truſt in God. Moreouer it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
to helpe our infirmitie, and bycauſe we bee lazie and colde, our
tongue had neede to driue forth our heart, and to helpe our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſlouth which are ouergreat in vs. But God hath no neede
of none of all this, we neede not to crie out alowde when we would
be heard at his hande: for he knoweth the ſecrete thoughtes of our
heartes. Thus ye ſee in effect what we haue to marke. And herein
we ſee howe great ſway the Diuell beareth in Poperie, ſo that there
is neyther prayer nor fayth. To their ſeeming there is neyther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
nor holineſſe, except men babble in an vnknowne language,
and mumble it vp without knowing what they ſay. And although
the Preeſtes, Monkes, and Hypocrites ſay they vnderſtande latine:
men knowe well inough what their vnderſtanding is. Beſides this,
they make euen a rule of their iangling without knowing what they
ſay, and it is ynough with them to haue a finall intent (for ſo do they
terme it:) ſo they haue that finall intent before they babble their
<hi>Domine labia,</hi> to ſay we go to pray and to ſerue God, although their
minde be vpon their kitchin, or vpon things much worſe, and much
more ſhamefull: they beare themſelues in hande, that all theyr
prayers and ſupplications are acceptable to God. The poore people
haue their eyes bleared at it: for they be made to beleeue that it is
not lawfull for them to pray in a common language, and therefore
they ſhunne that as a bugge. VVe ſee then that the Diuell hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted
theſe wretches, yea and vtterly bewitched them, ſeeing they
be ſo loth to receyue the foode of life, that in ſtead of good bread
and wholſome meate, they receyue poyſon and burſt with it. But for
our owne part wee ſee the rule that is giuen vs heere and which
wee ought to kepe: which is, that when wee pray vnto God wee
muſt not ſtep to it vnaduyſedly without bethinking of vs what wee
ſhould demaunde, or without knowing how wee ſhoulde behaue
our ſelues towardes him. And when wee call him our father, let vs
conſider well that it is not for any wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thineſſe of our own perſons,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:214"/>
nor for any deſert or worke of our own: but bicauſe he hath vnited
vs to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and gathereth vs altogither in him, and
bycauſe we be his bodie, and God accepteth vs to fauour in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
And for that cauſe alſo doth Saint Paule adde, <hi>that if wee bee
children, we be beyres alſo.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, that we inioy our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
euen now: not that we bee entered into the poſſeſsion of it,
to be partakers of the glorie that is promiſed vs, but as in reſpect of
the fathers of olde tyme, which were ſhet out into the bodie of the
Temple, and had a veyle or Curteyne drawne before them, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
figures and ſhadowes. Nowe, wee bee not lyke them in that
cace: but we repayre vnto God in ſuch wiſe as wee bee franke and
free. And ſo is the adoption otherwiſe in our heartes nowadayes,
than it was in theirs in the time of the Lawe. For we bee heyres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuch a ſort, that yet notwithſtanding wee bee alſo as pilgrims in
this worlde,<note place="margin">2. Cor. a. 6.</note> and (as ſayth Saint Paule in the ſeconde to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians)
muſt be fayne to be abſent from God, till he haue ridde vs of
this mortall bodie, and haue taken vs out of this earthly pilgrimage
and tranſitorie life. Howſoeuer the cace ſtande, wee muſte magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
Gods grace: and ſeeing hee hath adopted vs to be his children,
let vs vnderſtande that therein lyeth all oure happineſſe and ioy.
Therefore let vs glorie in that, yea euen ſo farre forth as to reioyce
in the middes of the troubles and aduerſities which wee haue too
ſuffer. Let vs not ceaſſe to haue an inwarde ioy continually in vs,
in as muche as God calleth vs, and hath tolde vs that all the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
which wee indure, ſhall bee turned to our welfare and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo wee holde on to the marke that is ſet before vs, that is too
wit, ſo we go on ſtill forwarde to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
all other things.</p>
            <p>Nowe let vs fall downe before the maieſtie of our good God,
with acknowledgment of our ſinnes, praying him to make vs ſo too
feele them, as it may humble vs before him, and yet we not bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
but that ſeing he vouchſafeth to accept well of vs, &amp; hath

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee haue ſeene heretofore howe that after the
Galathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had bin faithfully taught by S. Paul,
who had taken much paine among them, they
ſhrunke back againe: not that they vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
Ieſus Chriſt and the Goſpel: but that
they had bin to eaſy in ſuffering themſelues to
be deceyued in folowing diuerſe opinions, as
we ſee it is come to paſſe through the whole worlde. For the name
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and baptiſme as a marke of faith do in deed
continue ſtill: but yet for all that, wee ſee that all things are marred
with ſuperſtition and Idolatrie. So the Galathians pretended ſtill to
be of Gods Church: and yet in the meane while they were bewrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in many follies, as ſpecially in this, that they ſhould partly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace
grace and ſoule health at Gods hande, by keeping the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Law. But that was to great a defacing of our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt. For it is impoſsible for him too bee our Sauiour, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
wee lay away all ſelfe weening, and put oure whole truſt in
him. VVee ſee then that the fault of the Galathians was, that they
<pb facs="tcp:23060:215"/>
were not ſo well grounded in the Goſpell, as to be firme &amp; ſtedfaſt,
and to ſhake off all errours, but rather were miſſeled through too
light beleefe. In this reſpect Saint Paule ſayth that they bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of double blame, bycauſe that whereas God had ſet them in a
good way, and in a good forwardneſſe, they fleeted aſide through
their owne inconſtancie. And he maketh compariſon betwene their
preſent ſtate, and their former ſtate. For they had bin poore Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims
that had neuer taſted of true religion. God viſited them, and
graciouſly drew them to him, and gaue them the knowledge of his
truth. Nowe foraſmuch as herevpon they mingled the illuſions and
trumperies of Satan with the pure truth of the Goſpell: that was a
fault too farre out of ſquare, and no more to bee excuſed than their
former. And that is the cauſe why Saint Paule ſayeth, <hi>at ſuch tyme as
yee knewe not yet any thing,</hi> it was no maruell though you ſerued I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolles,
bycauſe ye were blinded in your errours, and God had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
diſcloſed himſelf to you, that ye might haue bin able to diſcerne
the lyuing God from all the forgeries of mans owne brayne. But
nowe that ye haue bin taught the Goſpell, and obteyned ſo great a
benefite, not by your owne trauell, as though you had compaſſed
it by your owne wiſedome, but by Gods goodnes who marked you
out before you coulde ſeeke him: and ſeeing hee hath ſo gathered
you out to himſelfe: what excuce haue you too ſtart away, and not
to continue in the doctrine which you knowe to be certaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible?
Moreouer looke (ſayth he) howe yll choyſe ye haue made.
For God had giuen himſelfe to you, and you haue forſaken him for
pelting tryfles. For the Ceremonies of the Lawe (beeing ſet alone
by themſelues from our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt) are but baggage. Lo
howe yee make great account of things too no purpoſe, and in the
meane while paſſe not at all for God. Heerevpon as a man moued
with great greefe hee concludeth, that hee is ſore afrayde that hee
hathe loſt his labour, in that hee hath ſo long tyme ſtreyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
too bring them too the pure knowledge of the Goſpell. And
therewithall he alledgeth a ſpice of the things which he had termed
beggerly and vnprofitable Ceremonies: namely <hi>that they kept the
feastes conteyned in the Lawe,</hi> as though there had bin ſome neceſsitie
in the matter, thinking too deſerue and earne grace thereby before
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:23060:215"/>
God. This is the ſumme of the matter that is treated of heere.
Nowe wee haue a good warning too gather of this texte: whiche
is, that if wee holde not out in the fayth of the Goſpell after that
God hath once brought vs vnto it, althoughe the poore Infidels
might be excuſed, yet can not wee eſcape horrible damnation, by
reaſon of our vnthankfulneſſe in that wee haue profited no better
in the ſchole of our God. It is true that although the heathen had
no knowledge, yet they ſhall not fayle to be condemned, bicauſe
there is naughtineſſe alwayes to be founde in men, for aſmuche as
they gaue them ſelues ouer to their owne ſuperſtition: but if wee
conſider what they bee in reſpect of vs, ſurely whereas they might
haue a doſen excuſes, we ſhould not haue ſo muche as a peece of
one. Therfore when we haue once bin inlightned with the truth of
the Goſpell, like as the benefite of God is ſingular, ſo alſo ſhal we
pay deare for it if we make not account of it. And let vs marke
that this is not ſayde too any one people alone: but that it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs alſo at this daye too apply too our vſe the things that S.
Paule telleth vs, to the ende that we become not ſo wretched as to
giue ouer the truthe of the Goſpell after we haue once knowen it,
but that it may bee ſo printed and rooted in our harts, as the diuell
may neuer ſhake vs from it. Thus yee ſee what we haue to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
in that S. Paule doth heere ſet the leaudneſſe of the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
before them, and blameth them as vtterly vnexcuſable, for their
ſtarting away after that faſhion from the pure truthe, after they
had once bin inlightned with it. Now alſo herewithall we ſee wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Idolatrie proceedeth, and what is the fountayne therof: namely
the want of knowledge of the liuing God. For wee muſte needes
haue ſome feeling in our ſelues, that there is a God who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ought
to worſhip, and which is worthy to be honored both of great and
ſmall, bicauſe we haue our life of him. It can not bee ſo cleane wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
out of our minde, but that there ſhall alwayes bee ſome ſparke
of Religion in vs. But yet in the meane ſeaſon, euery man wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth
away in his owne fooliſhe conceits, bicauſe wee vnderſtande
not what God is, nor can come at him. Truely if wee were not
corrupted, and our vnderſtanding blynded by ſinne, God would
ſtill drawe vs vnto him. But for as muche as Gods image is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced
<pb facs="tcp:23060:216"/>
in vs, there is nothing but darkneſſe, &amp; that ſo horrible, that
when wee ſhoulde mounte, vp alofte too ſeeke God, wee thruſt
downe our muzzels too the ground like wretched brute beaſtes.
Therfore till ſuch time as God ſhewe him ſelfe to vs, it is vnpoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for vs to haue any true Religion, and wee ſhall alwayes be led
with abuſes and meere follies. Heereby we know what the vanitie
of men is, how euery man beares him ſelfe in hande that he hathe
skill inough to gouerne him ſelfe. Yea and wee ſee howe the very
Idiots do brag of their wit: and as for thoſe that haue gotten any
reputation amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men, they be ſo puffed vp with pride, as they can
not abide any correction, or to be tolde of their faults. But if men
had any one drop of good wiſdome, were it not meete that the firſt
poynt which they begin at, ſhould bee to knowe what God they
ought too worſhip? That is the poynt wherein they fayle, in ſo
muche that they ſeeke Satans leaſings in ſteade of the truthe, and
worſhip Idols in ſteade of the liuing God, till God haue called
them to him. VVee ſee then that to pleaſe God, and to yeelde him
acceptable ſeruice, it is not for vs to behaue oure ſelues after oure
owne fancie, but we muſt ſuffer our ſelues to be guided and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by his worde and holy ſpirite. Moreouer if we will follow the
opinion of this man and that man, they be not a two or three that
this text ſpeaketh of, but we ſee it is impoſsible to haue any good
rule, or to holde the right way, till God haue taken the charge of
vs to draw vs too him. So then, they that followe the ſteppes of
their forefathers, and make cuſtome and antiquitie the rule too
frame them ſelues by, do ſhewe that they deſpiſe God. And why?
for they wilfully leaue the fountaine of liuing water, &amp; go to ſeeke
puddles, as though they had no wit to diſcerne betweene white and
blacke. Seeing then that S. Paules meening heere, is too ſhewe
vs as it were in a liuely image, that men can not but go aſtray and
deale vntowardly, till God haue brought them into the way of
ſaluation: Let vs renounce our owne nature, and let all things
which we know to come of man be thruſt vtterly vnder foote, and
let vs learne to holde vs ſimply to Gods pure truthe. This (ſay I) is
the thing that we haue to remember vpon the words of S. Paule,
where he ſayth, that thoſe which knewe not God had ſerued ſuche
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:23060:216"/>
as were but Idols. Moreouer let vs not thinke our ſelues too bee
wiſer than the Galathians: but (as I haue ſayde alreadie) let vs
vnderſtande that in this place the holy Ghoſt mente too beate
downe all pride, that men might not preſume vppon their owne
reaſon and skill to doo what they like themſelues, but rather know
that there is nothing but brutiſhneſſe in vs, till God haue inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
vs with his grace. Furthermore whereas S. Paule ſayth, that
Idols are no Gods by nature, he meeneth that we be very dulhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
when we can not repayre to the maker of all things, who ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
him ſelfe bothe aboue and beneathe, too the ende we ſhould
know him to worſhip and ſerue him. For wee can not looke vpon
our hands and our feete, but we muſt openly ſee Gods wonderfull
wiſdome, power, and goodneſſe: and when we beholde the skyes
and the ſtarres, wee haue there a ſufficient recorde that there is a
ſoueraygne Lorde which maynteyneth them. VVhen we conſider
the chaunges of ſeaſons, and ſee the ſnow, rayne, winde, or heate:
beholde therein doth God ſhew him ſelfe. VVhen the earth brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
foorth hir fruites, or is as good as dead and withered: in all
thoſe things wee continually knowe God, or at leaſtwiſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted
that he ſheweth him ſelfe there. And if we will not perceiue
him nowe: wee ſhall bee driuen too confeſſe it at the latter daye
when the bookes ſhall bee opened. Now in the meane while, if wee
woorſhip thoſe whiche are not Gods by nature: it is all one as if
wee dyd wilfully ſhet our eyes ageynſt ſo many recordes and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingglaſſes,
which God ſetteth afore vs to bring vs vnto him. How
ſoeuer the world go, all the worſhipping that men can deuiſe is but
a vayne fancie, till they haue bin brought intoo the good way. For
of their owne natural wit they cannot but giue themſelues to al er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and deceiuableneſſe. He addeth, <hi>Now that you haue knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God,
or rather haue bin knowen of hym.</hi> Some tranſlate it, <hi>nowe that you
haue been inſtructed in the knowledge of God:</hi> but all comes too one.
Neuertheleſſe in the firſte part (as I haue touched alreadye) he
ſheweth that ſuche as haue bin trayned in the pure truth, are giltie
of periurie to Godward. And therof they bee vnexcuſable: for it is
no ignorance any more: it is not with them as thoughe they neuer
had taſted of the true religion: but it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as a manifeſt falſhod, lyke
<pb facs="tcp:23060:217"/>
as if ſome ſubiectes knowing well inoughe who is their Prince,
ſhould reuolte from him, and breake the allegeance whiche they
had promiſed him, and confederate them ſelues with his deadly
enimie. Thus yee ſee in what plight wee bee: namely that all ſuche
as haue knowen Gods truth, can not ſteppe aſide after their owne
ſuperſtitions and errours, but they muſt become periured and falſe
forſworne traytors.<note place="margin">Eſa. 46. a. 1</note> For it is not cauſeleſſe ſayde that all Idols
muſt fall downe when God is to be glorified in his highneſſe: and
that all ſuperſtitions muſt vaniſh away when his maieſtie commeth
abrode. Nowe if he voutſafe too ſhew him ſelfe to vs, it is as much
as if he dyd ſet vp his chayre of eſtate among vs, of purpoſe to bee
ſo good and gracious too vs, as too become our king. If wee can
not finde in our hearts too yeelde him any ſubiection, are wee not
falſeharted caytifs towards him? If we alledge for a replie, that our
intent is not ſo: it is but hypocriſie. For we knowe that our Lorde
can abide no companion: in ſo muche that he vſeth the worde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſie,<note place="margin">Ex. 20. a. 5</note>
to ſhew that he wil ſo poſſeſſe vs, as we may belong vnto him
wholly and not in parte. Then if we will play on both ſides, &amp; row
betweene two ſtreames: there will bee nothing but fayning and
hypocriſie in vs. But there ought to bee a ſubſtantiall ſoundneſſe
in vs. And therfore S. Paule ſayth not ſimply, if wee bee beguyled
by Satan, &amp; forſake the Goſpell quite and cleane: but, if we ſwarue
from the ſimplicitie of it. As for example, the Galathians (as I haue
ſhewed alreadie) had not renounced Ieſus Chriſt nor denied their
baptiſme (for they profeſſed to holde the Goſpell ſtill) but they
had mingled it, and that marred all: a little Leuen ſowreth a whole
lumpe of dowe. Euen ſo when men will needes adde I wote not
what of their owne brayne to Gods truthe, it marreth all. For let
a man put a little vineger, or ſome other ſlaberſauce into a cuppe
of the beſt wine in the worlde, and he were better to drinke ſheere
water. In like cace is it when men wyll turkin the true Religion,
as all they doo which take vpon them too inuent I wote not what
of their owne heade. Surely it were muche better that they had
neuer knowen anye more at all, but groſſely that there is a
God: than too haue beene trayned vp in the good doctrine of
the Goſpell, and afterwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e too falſifie all, and too diſfigure
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:23060:217"/>
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte after that ſorte. Yee ſee then howe it is a
thing that can not be borne withall: and that is it which we haue to
marke in the firſt place. Secondly, S. Paule ſheweth that the calling
of the Galathians to the Goſpell, came not of their owne proper
motion, nor through their owne furthering of the matter: but of
God, who had ſought them out when they were wandering and
ſtraying wretches. And this is not ſpoken for them alone: for wee
know how the Prophet Eſay ſpeaketh after the ſame maner gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
of all ſuch as ſhould be partakers of the ſaluation that is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
for vs by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eſa. 65. a. 1</note> ſaying: I was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of them
that ſought me not, and I ſhewed my ſelfe to ſuch as inquired not
after me: and vnto ſuch as made none account of me, I ſaide, Lo
here I am, here I am. See how God magnifieth his grace, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that men ſhould not be ſo far ouerſeene, as to thinke that they
atteine to fayth by their owne wiſdome. No, ſayth he, yee bee all of
you in the way of deſtruction, &amp; there is none of you that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
to me without I draw him, for pitie of the wretchedneſſe wherein
you be plunged. Therfore it is I that haue diſcouered my ſelfe, and
all this is of mine owne meere gracious goodneſſe, for you would
neuer haue ſoughte me, yea there is none of you all but he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
him ſelfe further and further off from mee. For wee be not
onely as ſtraying beaſts, but alſo as wylde and wood beaſtes: wee
be wholly giuen to rebellion tyll God haue tamed vs, and chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
vs that wee might be ſheepe of his folde, that he may do the
office of a ſhephearde towards vs. So then it is not for noughte
that Sainct Paule correcteth this ſpeeche of his when hee ſaythe,
<hi>you haue knowen God, or rather haue beene knowen of him.</hi> As if hee
ſhoulde ſay, that when wee bee come too the knowledge of the
Goſpell, wee muſt not imagine our ſelues too bee better than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, but that God preuented vs, and that wee ſhould rather
haue periſhed a hundred times in our beaſtlyneſſe, than haue come
too any good amendment, if God had not vtterly chaunged vs.
Nowe then wee ſee what free will is able too doo, whereof igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
wretches boaſt them ſelues too the defacing of Gods grace.
No doubte but all men wyll graunte that they can not bee inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
without Gods working: but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by after they reſtryne
<pb facs="tcp:23060:218"/>
it agayne, ſaying that his working is but in parte, and it ſeemeth to
them that euery man brings ſomewhat of his owne. But all thys
geere is excluded heere when he ſayth that none but onely God
knoweth vs, who alſo marketh vs out, too ſhewe him ſelfe vnto
vs, and too make vs come vnto him. Then let vs generally vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande,
that it is not our owne worthineſſe that hath brought vs
too the obteyning of this benefite that the Goſpell ſhould be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
purely too vs, and that euery of vs applyeth it too his owne
behoofe: for if I thinke my ſelfe to haue aught at all in mee why
I ſhould be preferred before one man or other: it is a taking away
of Gods prayſe, and an vſurping of it to my ſelfe: and that were
an intollerable trayterouſneſſe. And therefore wee muſte come
backe too that which S. Paule ſayth in another texte:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. b. 7.</note> VVho hath
made thee too excelle, ſayth he? He ſpeaketh too ſuche as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
them ſelues, beleeuing that they had ſome vertue or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
in them, as in very deede the Corinthians had ſuche ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
giftes as might bee had in eſtimation among men. S. Paule
graunteth well inough that they had great graces, and worthy of
eſtimation: but he asketh them from whence all of them came,
whether they were of their owne getting, or whether they were
able too take them of them ſelues? It is very certayne that they
were not. VVherefore let vs learne, that it is not inough for vs to
haue Gods worde preached too vs, excepte God worke in vs by
his holy ſpirite, according as experience ſheweth in that it is not
giuen too all men. And moreouer there was neuer yet any man
that bethought him ſelfe too ſeeke the good foode, except it were
offered him of God. Therefore away with all the fonde imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our owne head, and let vs put away all pride: let vs not
thinke our ſelues wyſer than other men, bicauſe wee haue kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
the Goſpell: but let vs yeelde this prayſe vnto God, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that at ſuche time as wee turned our backes vpon him, and were
as good as drowned a hundred thouſande tymes in deſtruction,
he caſte hys eye vppon vs, and drewe vs backe too him ſelfe, too
the ende that when it is tolde vs that wee bee iuſtified by fayth,
and thereby obteyne ſaluation: wee ſhould aſſure our ſelues that

giuen vs bicauſe wee can not purchace it: and let vs confeſſe with
poore Agar,<note place="margin">Ge. 16. c. 13.</note> that wee haue ſeene him that looked vppon vs afore.
For there wee haue a mirrour of all mankinde. The ſayde poore
woman was in great heauineſſe, forſaken of all men, and wyſte
not whither too go: but God pitied hir and viſited hir, in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.
Heerevpon ſhee confeſſeth that God had looked vppon
hir before ſhee had thought vpon him. So then let vs bee hilde in
awe and humilitie, ſeeing that the welſpring and beginning of our
welfare is that God knew vs and marked vs out at ſuch time as we
cared not for him, but beſides our ignorance, did alſo deſpiſe him,
and were ſo brutiſh, that euery of vs had ſought his owne ruine and
deſtruction, if he of his owne infinite goodneſſe had not hilde vs
backe. Thus ye ſee in effect what we haue to marke. But now let vs
put the thing in practiſe that is tolde vs heere: which is that for as
much as God hath called vs to the pure knowledge of his Goſpell,
we muſt continue ſtedfaſtly therin, according to the way which he
ſetteth before vs, who (as we know) is the liuely fountayne of all
welfare, as it is ſayde in the ſeconde of Ieremie. Then if wee go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
too digge crauyed Ceſterns that can holde no water: is it
not an vtter refuſing of the benefite that was put into our handes?
VVhen a man ſeeth good meate readie for his repaſte, and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
that he may take good ſuſtenance of it, and yet will go hys
way from the table, and ſeeke dung and filthe too feede on, is he
not worthy too bee poyſoned? Euen ſo is it with all ſuche as are
not contented with the pure doctrine of Gods Lawe and Goſpell.
For beholde, the fountayne is before them,<note place="margin">Eſa. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.</note> they may drinke their
fill of it,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.</note> as it is ſayde in Eſay and S. Iohn, and yet they had leuer
too ſtarue, or elſe too feede them ſelues with winde. Nowe then
ſhould not ſuche vnthankfulneſſe bee puniſhed double as S. Paule
ſayth heere? <hi>Is it poſsible that yee ſhoulde returne agayne too the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
and weake Ceremonies that can doo you no good at all.</hi> Nowe
at the firſt bluſhe S. Paule might ſeeme too ſharpe and roughe in
ſpeaking after that faſhion of the Ceremonies of the Lawe. For
in very truthe, although the Ceremonies had bin the firſt enteran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or traynings, like as in trayning vp of yong children men are

<pb facs="tcp:23060:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was figured in them: and there were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
in them too bring men too ſaluation. For the remiſsion of
ſinnes is the chiefe good thing that we can wiſhe for at God hand,
bicauſe that by that meanes wee be reconciled vnto him. He recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs as his children, and we may call vpon him with free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Men therfore are then in true and perfect felicitie, when their
ſinnes are forgiuen them. And hereof they had as it were a pledge
in their ſacrifices in olde time. VVhen they waſhed them ſelues, it
was a full aſſurance too them that God did clenſe them, and that
their ſpottes were no more layde to their charge, but rather that
they were receyued as cleane and vtterly without blemiſhe. Howe
then dooth S. Paule terme theſe things vnprofitable ceremonies,
which caried ſuch inſtruction in them? ſpecially ſeeing it is ſayde
that the paterne of all the whole Sanctuarie was ſhewed to Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,<note place="margin">Exo. 25. d. 40.</note>
yea euen from heauen. The law then ſerued not to holde men
in ſome play, as though God intended to buſie them about petie
trifles? neither alſo did S. Paule regarde whereto the ceremonies
auayled or ſerued the fathers of olde time: He doth but only ſhew
that when our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was once come,<note place="margin">Col. 2. c. 17</note> all thoſe things
were aboliſhed. For (as he ſayth in the ſeconde to the Coloſsians)
wee haue no more the figures and ſhadowes, bicauſe that nowe a
dayes wee haue the body and the ſubſtaunce. Seeing it is ſo: if a
man ſhould ſet foorth the ceremonies of the Lawe, he ſhould ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and what ſhould they be then?
They would be of no force. For (as I ſayd afore) if a man ſeparate
them for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, ſurely they ſhall bee but pelting
traſh. Therefore when men kept the ceremonies, ſo as they were
applied to their lawful vſe: they were good exerciſes, and the old
fathers miſpente not their time, bicauſe they were confirmed by
them in the hope of their ſaluation, and they were vntoo them a
warrante of Gods fatherly loue towardes them, and they led them
to oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte the fountayne of all welfare. But if
men buſie themſelues in keeping the ceremonies without knowing
why or wherfore: ſurely it is but flat mockerie. For the Heathen
men dyd make ſacrifice alſo, and ſome of them had no Idols, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that they offered too God the maker of heauen &amp; earth: and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:23060:219" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet whereto did al their Sacrifiſes ſerue them, but to their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?
For they had ouerthrowen Gods order, bycauſe they ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
not at our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Now then Sainct Paul doth not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cauſe ſay, that when the Ceremonies of the law tend not to the
ſeeking of all our welfare in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, they are but
beggerly Ceremonies, that is to ſaye, corruptible thinges of this
world, and conſequently things of no force and vnprofitable, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that Ieſus Chriſt who is the quickner of all things, is not ther.
And this is yet ſo much the better to be marked, to the ende we be
not beguiled. It is ſaid that in old time all men offered Sacrifiſe,
and thought they worſhipped God: and yet notwithſtanding, that
the ſeruis of all ſuch as had not their beleefe ſettled in Ieſus Chriſt,
was reiected.<note place="margin">Heb. 11. a. 4</note> For the Apoſtle in the eleuenth to the Hebrues ſaith,
that the only thing that made Abels Sacrifiſe acceptable, was faith.
Now then for aſmuch as the heathen men did in their ſacrifiſing i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin
God to be fleſhly, and that they could make their attoneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
with him by ſuch meanes, they buzied themſelues about outwarde
things, and conſidered not that in aſmuch as we be faultie, it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs on hand to haue an excellenter raunſome than we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bring
any. If we had a hundred worlds to giue, they were not ynough too
redeeme any one miſdeede that we haue done againſt God. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Sacrifiſe that ſhould anſwer for all our ſinnes muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie
be heauenly. The heathen men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered not this: but ſtood
poring vpon the ſhadow of it, as the Turkes and Iewes do yet ſtill
at this day, who by their often waſhing of themſelues both euen
and morne, and at noone, and by theyr other Ceremonies, confeſſe
themſelues to be defyled, and to haue neede to be clenzed by ſome
others, and yet do renounce our Lord Ieſus Chriſt who is the very
cleanneſſe whereby we muſt be made cleane, according alſo as in
very deede it is he that hath wiped away all our ſpottes. Seeing it a
ſo then, all they that keepe any Ceremonies in hope to get any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
at Gods hand by them, do not only beguile and martir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in vayne without any profit: but alſo do certeinly prouoke
Gods wrath ſtill more and more. Now we on our ſide are taughte
that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath ſhed his bloud too waſh our ſoules
withall. Then if we ſeeke any other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nzing or purgatory beſides,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:220"/>
ſurely it is an intollerable trecherie. And if Sainct Paule ſpake ſo
of the Ceremonies of the lawe: what ſhall wee ſay of all the toyes
and gewgawes that are nowadayes in poperie? For beholde, the
Papiſts weene to win much by taking of holywater, by babling this
and that, by keeping of holidayes, by tyring themſelues in gadding
on ſome pilgrimage, by ſetting vp a waxcandle before ſome pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
by chaunting maſſe by note, and by ſaying of thus many or
thus many tymes their beads ouer. I ſay they hope well to make
attonement with God by ſuch meanes. But it is certeine that they
plunge themſelues the deeper in hell, and caſt themſelues fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intoo Satans ſnares by it, as though they had confederated
themſelues with him to their owne deſtruction. To bee ſhorte, all
the Ceremonies of poperie are vtter renouncings of our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt, and of the pure truth which hee hath purchaced for vs
by his death and reſurrection, and of the grace that is offered vs at
this day in the Goſpell. For they may well bring what ſhrowding-ſheetes
they liſt, but they cannot diſproue the holie Ghoſt, who
hath vttered the ſayd ſentence by the mouth of Sainct Paule. Then
do we ſee in effect what is ſhewed vs heere. Now as touching the
particular whiche Sainct Paule alledgeth heere concerning <hi>dayes,
mooneths, and yeeres</hi> he meeneth not the ſeaſons of winter and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
nor the diſcerning of one day from another, nor that men
ſhoulde not recken yeeres and mooneths: but hee ſpeaketh of the
feaſts that were commaunded in the Lawe, and which thoſe decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
would needes haue to bee kept ſtill, euen as of neceſsitie. In
which cace there was a kind of binding and thraldome, and it was
an aboliſhing of the fredome that was purchaced for vs by our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt. Lo heere the cauſe why Sainct Paule vſeth ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentneſſe,
howbeit that hee did it alſo in reſpect of the foreſayde
falſhood: for it was requiſite that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhould haue
bin knowen in all thoſe figures, and that men ſhould haue amed at
that marke. But they that had beguiled the Galathians, had bound
them to the cleane contrary, ſeeing that by holding ſtill the feaſt
of Paſſeouer and other feaſtes, they intended to bring them backe
agayne to the olde forworne figures, which ought to be aboliſhed.
In olde time when men kept <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Eaſter day vnder the lawe, it was
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:23060:220" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the end that the people beeing put in minde of their deliuerance
out of the thraldome of Egypt, ſhould looke for the great redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that was promiſed them.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. b. 7.</note> And for that cauſe Sainct Paule ſaith
that our Eaſter lamb (that is to wit, Ieſus Chriſte) is offered vp al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
He ſheweth that the thing which had bin figured by the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
lamb that was offered in the law, was now fulfilled in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of our mediator. In like cace was it with the feaſt of Tabernacls
or Tents, whereby God did put the Iewes in rememberance, that
they had dwelled in the wilderneſſe where there was nother houſe
nor building, and yet had continued there a long time traueling
too and fro. And that was alſo a warning too them that thys lyfe
is but a wayfaring, where through we muſt paſſe in haſt. As muche
is too be ſayde of the firſtlings when men came to offer vp theyr
firſte frutes vntoo God. Agayne, when the Iewes made ſolemne
confeſsion of their ſinnes, it was a figure to leade them too Ieſus
Chriſte whych was promiſed to them. But now that he is come,
if wee wyll needes keepe ſtill thoſe thinges, what is it elſe than
a toying? For wee diſplace the principall and the ſubſtaunce,
which is all one as if a man would feede himſelfe with the coloure
of bread, wyne, and meate, and not with the things themſelues.
And can a man receiue any ſuſtenance thereby? So then ſeeyng
that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte is come, the figures of the lawe
are not too bee vſed any more, and if men will needs keepe them,
they ſhewe themſelues too haue no knowledge of God, but that
all is turned vpſide downe. Therefore it ſtandeth vs ſo muche
the more on hande too marke well, that if wee nowadayes do
ſwarue neuer ſo little from the pureneſſe of the Goſpell, wee bee
ſtreytwayes ſtrayed from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. I graunt wee may
well keepe certayne dayes of aſſembling, howbeit not after the
manner of the Iewes. And why? VVe keepe them not for ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
ſake. In the time of the law it had bin a deadly offence for a
man to haue lifted vp but a mallet vppon a peece of wood, or too
haue done any other buſineſſe of his owne. If a man had but ſet
a potte or a kettle vppon the fyre on the Sabboth daye, God
commaunded that hee ſhoulde bee rooted out. Yet was it not
meant by that rigoure, that God d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>yghteth in ydleneſſe: but
<pb facs="tcp:23060:221"/>
it ſerued for a figure, as if hee had ſayde, I haue enioyned you my
Sabbothes, too the ende you ſhould knowe that I am hee whyche
ſanctifyeth you. VVe haue the ſelfſame ſanctification at this daye,
howbeit not with like figures as the fathers had it in olde time: for
that were too burie our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. It were too hang
vp a veyle agayne, too the intente too daſle our eyes in ſuche
ſorte, as wee ſhoulde not ſee the lighte of the Goſpell. Lo
what wee haue too marke vppon thys obſeruing of dayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Sainct Paule ſpeaketh heere. But aboue all things let vs marke
that he intended to ſhewe vs heere, that in aſmuch as wee knowe
the benefites whyche are imparted too vs by oure Lorde Ieſus
Chryſte, wee muſt ſticke too them and ſettle ourſelues wholly
therevppon: and that if wee bee fleeting too and fro, it is a ſhrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away from our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, in whome wee haue the
fulneſſe and perfection of all lyfe, ioy, welfare, and glory. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
ſeeyng that God commeth too vs after that faſhion, yea
and that euen at ſuche time as wee were as wretched wandering
beaſtes, hee gathered vs too hymſelfe, and ſhewed hymſelfe to
be our herdman, too the intente that we ſhould become the ſheepe
of his flocke, and hearken too his voyce, and diſcerne it from all
falſe doctrines, and from all the curious ſuttleties of men, that our

            <p>Nowe let vs fall downe before the maieſtie of our good God

Paule at the firſte bluſh bring not any reaſon
that ſeemeth to be of great weyght or impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
yetnotwithſtanding it is not for naught
that he doubteth leaſt his labour be loſt, and
all the frute of his trauell among the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
bee periſhed, ſeeyng they obſerued the
holy dayes and other Ceremonies of the law. For wee muſt not
looke vppon the day itſelfe, or vppon the kynd of meate, or vppon
ſuch other like things: but we muſt conſider to what end men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
the eating of any kind of meate, or why they keepe certayne
dayes, and ſo of other Ceremonies. Now I haue tolde you that by
that meanes the lyght of the Goſpell is after a ſort damned, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vtterly quenched. For the end why al thoſe things were ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in old time, was that the fathers might be foded and maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the hope of the redeemer, who was not yet come amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
But now that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is come into the worlde, and
hath finiſhed and performed all that was requiſite for mans ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it were an vtter derogation too the full perfectneſſe that is in
him, if men ſhould ſtill buzie themſelues with figures. It were all
one as if a man ſhoulde drawe a Curtaine before hym that hee
myght not bee knowen as he is. Furthermore, there goes a bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with it: and when a thing is commaunded vnder peyne of
deadly ſinne, mennes conſciences are made ſubiect too ſuche ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannye,
that God forgoeth hys authoritie and dominion ouer vs,
for he will not haue vs to make conſcience of any thyng that is
not commaunded by hym. And truly the thing wherein hee will
be diſcerned from his creatures, is that hee haue all ſouerenitie
in ruling our lyfe: that the thing whych he commaundeth be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
as good and needefull without gaynſaying: that the thinges
which he forbiddeth, be omitted, and that men make no reckening
nor conſcience of them. But in obſeruing the Ceremonies and in
thinking to deſerue at Gods hand for ſo doing, there is yet a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matter: namely that we renounce or giue ouer the thing that
is purchaced for vs by the death and paſsion of the ſonne of God
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

vnto God hys father. Not to gyue vs libertie to do euill, but
too the ende wee ſhoulde flee vnto him alone when wee haue done
amiſſe. If we find ourſelues to haue tranſgreſſed Gods lawe, and
that our owne conſcience vpbraydeth vs: there is none other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
for vs but to put ourſelues into the hands of our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, that we may bee quit before God, and waſhed from all our
ſpottes by the merit of his death and paſsion, and by the ſheading
of his bloud. To be ſhort, Sainct Paule ſheweth heere, that men
runne aſtray when they ſeeke meanes of ſaluation any where elſe
than in Ieſus Chriſt, in ſomuch that they become forlorne and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
paſt recouerie. Now then ſeeing that God hath ſette vs foorth
but only one way of ſaluation: they that turne aſide from that,
do caſt themſelues wilfully into deſtruction, and Satan reigneth
ouer them for their vnthankfulneſſe ſake in deſpiſing the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
benefyte that God offered them. VVhat a bountifulneſſe
is it that God calleth and allureth vs too hys fauoure and loue,
notwithſtanding that we be his deadly foes? Againe ſeeing he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynteth
not the Angells to bee our mediators, but voutſaueth
to ioyne himſelfe vnto vs in the perſone of his only ſonne: if we be
ſo miſerable that that will not ſuffiſe vs, but wee will needs of a

of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then let vs learne, that too profit well
in the Goſpell, wee muſt forſake all that is contrary to the truſt
whych we ought to haue in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and ſticke whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his ryghtuouſnſſe, too ſeeke all perfection in hym. Let that

            <p>Alſo therewithall let vs looke well to ourſelues: for ſometimes
we ſhall thinke we commit but ſome ſmall and light fault in ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

the cauſe why ſo feaw holde out to the end. For men doo eaſly
beare wyth themſelues, vnder the foreſayde pretence, bearing
themſelues in hand that it is nothing, and ſo euery man giueth him
ſelfe libertie. But God puniſheth ſuch rechleſneſſe, &amp; giueth vs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

let vs keepe the way that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte teacheth
vs. It is true that though wee ſwarue aſide, yet he will pitie vs,
as wee ſee by experience. For hee muſt bee fayne too rayſe
vs vp agayne, not three or foure tymes in our whole lyfe: but
a hundred tymes euery day. For wee bee fickle and neuer leaue

ſo harden ourſelues that the Diuell leade vs away or draw vs
one way or other: but let vs labour too make the ſeede of lyfe
auaylable in vs, ſeeing that God wyll haue vs too yeelde foorth
frute too hys honor in all our thoughtes, wordes, and deedes.
Let vs beware that wee indeuour ourſelues heerevntoo. Nowe
heerevpon Sainct Paule addeth, <hi>that hee woulde fayne haue the
Galathians faſhion themſelues lyke vnto hym, bycauſe that hee on hys
ſide laboureth to apply hymſelfe vntoo them.</hi> It ſhoulde ſeeme that
thys ſaying differeth farre from that whyche wee hearde euen
nowe: for it was as a ſtroke of ſome tempeſt or thunderclap
when he ſayde. <hi>I am afrayde least I haue lost my laboure vppon you:</hi>
I will let you alone like folke paſt amendmente. It greeued hym
too ſee that the doctrine whyche hee had preached was ſo ill recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and nowe hee vſeth a gentle and freendly manner of ſpeeche.
To bryng them backe agayne vntoo hym, hee calleth them bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and afterwarde proteſteth that hee deſireth to ioyne wyth
them, and too frame hymſelfe to them as much as is poſsible for
hym, ſeekyng nothyng but that they ſhoulde yeelde the like vntoo
hym.</p>
            <p>And heerein we ſee what meaſurableneſſe they ought to keepe

beare with themſelues, the leſſe are their faultes to be ſpared, for
elſe it were a betraying of them. That is the cauſe why S. Paule vſed
ſo great vehemencie, in ſaying that hee was ſore afrayde, leaſt hee
had loſt his labour, and there leaueth the Galathians as it were in
deſpayre. But yet for all this, hee intendeth to cheere them vp
agayne, that they may come to repentaunce. And ſo hee ſeaſoneth
hys ſharpeneſſe with ſweeteneſſe, and ſheweth that the gate is ſtill
open for them, if they will ſubmitte themſelues vnto God. Thus
yee ſee twoo things that are requiſyte when wee will haue our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
too bee profitable. The firſt is, that there bee a liuely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in vs too pricke foorth ſuche as haue done amiſſe, that they
may bee throughly touched with the knowledge of theyr ſynnes,
and mourne and bee ſorie for them before God: for if they haue
not that ſoryneſſe, they will neuer yeelde to followe God. True
it is, that to outwarde ſyght menne may well alter theyr lewde diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions:
but howe ſoeuer they pretende, they ſhall ſtyll bee full
of ſtubbornneſſe and malice, till they be aſhamed of themſelues and
feele what they haue deſerued. So then the true preparatiue too
repentaunce, is to be pricked ſo neerely as wee may feele the euill
that is in vs, and condemne our ſelues for it: yea and that wee bee
full of anguiſhe, finding no reſt till God haue receyued vs to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
But yet muſt wee not lye ſtyll in ſuche perplexitie: for that
woulde make vs too ſhunne Gods preſence, and to go aboute too
eſtraunge our ſelues from him for euer, inſomuch that wee woulde
fayne haue him plucked out of his ſeate, that he might no more bee
our iudge, if wee were not well perſuaded that hee will bee pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to vs, and that wee ſhall not bee diſappoynted of our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

there muſte bee mercie in God too drawe men vntoo him,<note place="margin">Pſal. 130. a. 4.</note> or elſe
they will neuer bee brought too ſtande in awe of him. For as for
all the feare of the vnbeleeuers, it is but a terrour that diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

taſted the goodneſſe of oure God, and ſee howe all his ſeeking is
too bee at one wyth vs, and too haue vs come vnto him wythout
feyning, yea and that his touching of our heartes is too the intent
wee ſhoulde conceyue ſure confidence, and therevppon offer our

bee afrayed of it, ſeeing it is the thing wherevntoo hee calleth vs:
I ſay, when wee bee thus aſſured, namely that our ſinnes are wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
out: then maye wee bee bolde too preace vntoo oure God,
and that is the order which Saint Paule keepeth heere, and which
it behoueth vs too keepe in all our rebukings. In that place then
hee did beate downe the Galathians, bycauſe they exalted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and did as it were ſette vppe theyr bryſtles agaynſt God,
through theyr luſtyneſſe. And nowe hee reacheth them his hande,
and lyfteth them vppe agayne, and telleth them that after they
haue once felt and perceyued their faultes, they muſte not yet for
all that thinke themſelues vtterly ſhette oute from God, and from
all hope of ſaluation. But this cannot bee done except wee haue
a carefulneſſe too drawe ſinners too ſaluation. For many menne
will bee vehement ynoughe, and they ſhall haue iuſt cauſe ſo too
doo: but yet in the meane whyle theyr rygorouſneſſe will bee ſo
exceſsiue, as it ſhall ſhette vppe mennes heartes, and make them
take ſuche ſtomacke agaynſt the bytterneſſe that is vſed towardes
them, that they ſhall caſt themſelues vtterly out of order, yea and
conceyue a hatred agaynſt God and his woorde. Howbeeit, they
that are ſo ouerſharpe will ſay they haue iuſt cauſe. Yea, but yet
for all that, they whiche rebuke ſinne in the name of God, muſte
alwayes haue a care and deſire too bring thoſe too ſaluation, which
were in the high way too deſtruction. VVhen they bee ſo minded,
no doubt but they wil labour to winne ſuch as were out of the right
way, and to make them perceyue that they ſeeke their welfare, and
that although their rebukings bee greeuous, yet they fayle not too
bee for their behoofe. Neuertheleſſe, on the other ſyde, let
ſuch as are handeled ſo ſharpely, vnderſtande that they haue neede
of ſuch medicines: for what ſhall they winne by ranckling agaynſt
God? But yet wee ſee many which can well ynough make coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
too bee great Proteſtantes, and too burne in zeale of the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:23060:224" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Goſpell, which yet notwithſtanding will not abide to bee touched.
So long as they be borne withall, they will confeſſe what ſoeuerye
will haue them and all that is ſpoken to them, yea and more too. Ye
woulde thinke that the Goſpell was made euen for their turne: but
if a man find fault with them, then they beginne to play the woode
beaſtes. And what gayne they by it, ſauing that firſt they bewray
their hypocriſie before men, and ſecondly ſet themſelues in battell
agaynſt God.</p>
            <p>Nowe it is certaine that in fighting againſt ſuche an aduerſarie,
they ſhall not be the ſtronger partie. Therefore let vs ſuffer our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
too bee rebuked ſharply when neede ſhall require. And if wee
wiſt not of the euill that was in vs, wee ought too miſtruſt our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
ſo much the more, and not ſeeke ſtartingholes to defende our
ſelues withall, but rather enter into examination of our ſelues, and
euerie of vs become his owne iudge, that by meanes thereof wee
may not enter intoo account with our God, nor hee bee compelled
to cite vs too heere the ſentence of damnation. Thus yee ſee howe
we ought to receyue the chaſtizements, that are put to vs, and that
wee muſt not be too much greeued at them, bycauſe they prepare
and diſpoſe vs too humilitie, but let vs in the meane while wayte
for the comming of the ſweete that followeth afterwarde. For the
thing that keepeth many men from receiuing the warnings that are
giuen them, is that they bee fully reſolued of the matter afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hande:
ſo that if a man ſpeake a woorde too them that miſlyketh
them, they ſtoppe their eares at it, or elſe their hearts are ſo harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and dulled, as they cannot by any meanes afterwarde conceiue
what is put too them for their welfare and profite. A man maye
talke to them of Gods mercie, and proteſt to them well ynoughe:
and a man may well ynough (as ye woulde ſay) ſhew them with his
finger that his ſeeking is nothing elſe but to bring them to ſaluation,
but they be vtterly deafe: and that is bycauſe they bee fully bente
of themſelues too reiect Gods woorde. Therefore let vs bee pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and modeſt, when men ſteppe too vs vppon the ſodaine, too
aſſayle vs roughly by ſhewing vs our faultes: let vs be quiet at it,
and tarie till hee haue ſpoken the laſt woorde. And ſo let vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlace
and knitte theſe twoo things togither: that is too witte, the
<pb facs="tcp:23060:225"/>
rygour which we muſt take holde of that wee may haue a true and
liuely feeling of our ſinnes, to bee ſorie for them, and to aske God
forgiueneſſe, and to be abaſhed in our ſelues: and then let vs aſſure
our ſelues that God will alwayes bee mercifull to vs: and when
wee haue ſo indyted our ſelues, let vs alſo hope too bee quitted at
his hande, and that the more he condemneth vs by his worde, the
more he intendeth to beare vs vp, to the ende he be not inforced
to come agaynſt vs with armed hande, and with his ſworde in his
fiſt. Thus ye ſee in effect what we haue to remember in this text,
where we ſee Saint Paule on the one ſyde ſo ſharpe and vehement,
and by and by afterwarde too call the Galathians his brethren, and
too praye them that there may bee good conformitie betweene
him and them, and one accorde and tunable conſent among them.
Nowe as touching that he ſayth, <hi>I beſeeche you bee like vnto mee, for I
alſo do applie my ſelfe vnto you:</hi> as wee haue ſeene alreadie, it is not
too ſoothe them in their vyces, nor too cloke theyr filthineſſe, nor
too vſe any flattering of them: but too trie all the wayes too the
woodde to winne them vnto God, according as wee ſhall ſee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
howe hee will vſe the ſimilitude of a woman with chylde,
which longeth to ſee hir childe borne into the worlde, and although
ſhee indure paine, yet will not wreake hir ſelfe vppon hir babe by
ſtrangling it, but bee more chare of it than of hir owne lyfe. Saint
Paule will vſe the ſayde ſimilitude. So then hee meeneth not here
too ſtryke ſayle (as they ſay) too pleaſe ſuche as had neede too bee
rebuked: but rather aduaunced him ſelfe as farre as hee coulde to
winne them, according alſo as hee will ſay, that hee hathe prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with them as a Nurſe dooth with hir childe: and that might
well bee done wythout hardening menne in theyr ſinnes. Not
that they ſhoulde bee too much borne withall: for when a Nurſe
ſtoupeth too teache hir yong childe too go, whome ſhee holdeth
by the hande, hir intent is not too make hym too tumble, nor
too teache hym too haulte, nor too make hym ſuche a Cockney:
that hee ſhoulde not bee able too go when hee commeth too
mannes age: but contrarywyſe, when ſhee intendeth too ſtaye
the childes arme, ſhee will take him by the hande, or by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:23060:225"/>
So then we ſee after what maner we muſt faſhion our ſelues to
ſuch as are weake. It is not too harden them in their naughtineſſe,
but rather to amende them: neuertheleſſe we muſt go by meaſure,
hauing alwayes an eie to our owne abilitie. And truely it is not for
naught that S. Paule in another text exhorteth the ſtronger ſort,<note place="margin">Ro. 14. a. 1.</note> and
the forwarder ſort,<note place="margin">Gal. 6 a. 1.</note> to applie themſelues to ſuch as are yet rawe and
weake. For if a man had neuer ſo great and excellent vertues, that
he were as an Angell: yet ſurely if hee bee ſo rigorous that hee will
haue euerie man too bee as perfect as himſelfe, all his vertues will
bee but ſmoke. VVhy ſo? For the meeldeneſſe and gentleneſſe
which God commandeth vs, ſerue to giue as it were a taſte and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to all vertues. And the better that a man knowes himſelfe,
the more will he be thinke hym of the vyces that are in him, which
haue neede to bee borne withall, and therefore that hee muſt alſo
beare with others. Againe hee will conſider too what ende God
hath aduaunced hym, namely to ſhewe other menne the way, and
finally he will beare with himſelfe leaſt of all men. And heereby
may a man haue a good incling too diſcerne whether the admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
proceede of pure loue, or whether they proceede of too
muche ſternneſſe. For if in rebuking other menne, a man take not
heede to himſelfe, and flatter not himſelf, ne caſt forth his choler
to finde fault with this man or that mannes vyce, but in the meane
while is vtterly ſteyned himſelfe, and woulde fayne bee plundged
in it ouer head and eares: it is certaine that all is but hipocriſie. But
when a man reyneth himſelfe ſhort, and deſyreth not to bee more
borne withall than his neighbours: if therewithall he be rigorous,
it is to be acknowledged that he hath the zeale of God, and of his
holy ſpirit in him, and that he procureth the welfare of al men. Thus
ye ſee in effect why Saint Paule ſayeth here, that he intended to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
himſelfe to the Galathians. Nowe hee addeth further, <hi>that
they had not hurt or offended him in any thing,</hi> meaning thereby that
hee vndertooke not any priuate quarell agaynſt them. For the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
things that marre all when doctrine and Admonitions come to
bee put foorth, are that eyther wee bee of opinion that the partie
which ſpeaketh is not woorthie too bee heard, or that wee beare
ſome hatred or pritch towardes him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ure heartes. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible
<pb facs="tcp:23060:226"/>
that we ſhoulde take any thing in good part at his hande,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhal haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyued any ſuch opinion or fancie of him. I ſee
a man that ſpeakes as an Angell: nowe if I ſurmyze that hee hates
mee, and ſeekes too byte mee, or that hee goes aboute too diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
my ſhame, ſurely I ſhall not take any profite by heering of
him. But this cannot excuze vs: for it is a lewde fault: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe
it were true that a man hated vs, and that hee rebuked vs
vppon malice and ſpyte: yet ought wee too learne too bee confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.
The verie Heathen men coulde well ynough ſay, that our
foes did vs ſometymes more good than our freendes. For why, they
that loue one another will winke at many things, and ouerpaſſe
all without thinking amiſſe. But their enimies keepe watch to take
aduauntage of them whome they miſlyke,<note place="margin">Pro. 26. d. 24.</note> and when they ſpie any
fault, they miſſe not to blaze it abrode, as ſayth Salomon: yea and
ſometymes when they woulde fayne fall out with a man, they gyrde
at him vnder pretence of giuing him warning. Neuertheleſſe when
our enimyes doo ſo, ſurely God giueth vs a meane too bring vs
backe againe: for the Diuell may nowe and then ſerue the turne
of a Phiſition towardes vs, according as we haue ſeene howe Saint
Paule ſayeth that hee was buffeted by the ſame Meſſenger, that is
too witte,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12. b. 7.</note> of Satan, which thing was done to beate downe all pride
in him. Therefore when our enimies come too ſyft vs after that
faſhion, and ſeeke nothing elſe but too finde faultes with vs: God
dooth by that meanes waken vs, bycauſe we were aſleepe before in
our owne flatteryes: and if wee were wiſe and well aduiſed, ſurely
our enimies ſhould oftentymes do vs more good than our friends,
as I ſayde afore, and as the Heathen men knewe well ynough. And
it is a great ſhame for vs, that the blinde wretches which were plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in darkeneſſe, ſhoulde ſee more clearely than wee that haue
the light of ſaluation, and that wee ſhoulde not knowe the thing
which thoſe ſillie deccyued ſoules perceyued. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
it is as (yee woulde ſa) a peece of our nature, and menne
make an ordinarie rule of it, that if they haue once taken any lewde
conceyte that a man hateth them, they bee ſo eagre and forepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
with it, that they cannot abyde too receyue any correction
at his hande. For this conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ration Saint Paule proteſteth heere,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:23060:226"/>
that in reprouing the Galathians, hee dealeth not with any cace or
quarell of his owne. VVee (ſayeth hee) haue bin freendes heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore:
I might perchaunce be diſpyzed too the worldewarde, my
comming vnto you was not with any great pompe, I was no payn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fellowe: but I brought you the pure doctrine of the Goſpell.
And althoughe I was a man withoute any great gayneſſe, ſo as I
was not accounted of too the worldewarde: yet notwithſtanding,
you receyued mee as an Angell of God, yea euen as Ieſus Chriſt
himſelfe: and whereof commeth nowe this alteration? I holde on
ſtyll in doyng my duetie: and why then are you ſo alienated from
mee? See if yee can alledge any other thing, than that you hate
Gods truth and cannot abyde it. And what a ſhame is it that yee
ſhoulde ſo hate Gods truth, that yee ſhoulde diſdeyne it in my

quarelles and contentions for theyr owne peculiar matters. And
ſo yee ſee howe wee muſt abſtayne from all quar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lles, leaſt the gate
bee ſhette agaynſt vs, and wee bee disbarred of all libertie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking
men when neede ſhall requyre, that wee may proteſt with
Saint Paule that we deale not wyth them for any deſire of reuenge,
enmitie, or euill will, but onely for deſyre of theyr welfare, let
vs bee ſure of that, too the intente it maye open vs a gappe, and
giue vs a waye too all maner of rebukings. Marke that for one
poynt.</p>
            <p>Againe, let vs alſo be well aduized, that if our vices be touched,
wee caſt not a blocke in the way by conceyuing and ſurmiſing this
falſe opinion in our heades, that it is done of hatred: for that is the
pollicie of Satan. Although men be inclinable to thinke that other
men do bite them and nip them of hatred: yet let vs not thinke that
they doo it of their owne mere motion, but by the Diuels meanes,
who ſnarleth them after that faſhion. If we bee rebuked when wee
haue done amyſſe, whence ſoeuer the ſame commeth, ſurely it is
a meſſage ſente of God, bycauſe hee will not haue vs too periſhe,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:227"/>
but would haue vs to returne vnto the right way, notwithſtanding
that the partie which findeth fault with vs doo it not of a good and
pure affection, but ſeeketh onely to ſpite vs, or to wreake his teene
vppon vs: for yet doth God neuertheleſſe reache vs his hande, too
the ende we ſhould not periſh. But beholde, Satan on the contrarie
parte ſtoppeth vs from receyuing of the medicine, and putteth vs
in the heade, that the rebuking of our faults commeth not of good
will, but that there is a pad in the ſtraw, ſo as we be either too much
ſifted, or too ſore bitten, or elſe that there is ſome other ſecrete
grudge lurking vnſeene. All theſe imaginations doth Satan mingle
with mennes admonitions, to the intent we ſhould bee out of loue
with them, and refuze them, and by that meanes rebell agaynſt
God. VVherefore let vs beare well in minde what is ſayde heere,
to the ende that when we be warned of our faultes, we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that God, to the intent he would not be our iudge himſelfe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynteth
as it were attourneyes &amp; ſolliciters in his name, to come
and charge vs with our offences. VVhen a mortal man rebuketh me
for my miſdoings, it is Gods will he ſhoulde do ſo, and he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
him in his place. And too what ende? That we ſhould
not come before his Maieſtie to yeelde an account of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it
were better for vs too bee drowned a hundred thouſande tymes.
Gop then dooth pitie vs, when hee ſendeth vs mortall men to bee
our iudges, yea euen to bee oure iudges to put vs too ſome ſhame,
and thereby to ſtyrre vs vppe afterward to returne againe into the
right way. Therefore whenſoeuer God is ſo mercifull vntoo vs:
let vs profite our ſelues by ſuch grace, and beware that we inuenim
not our ſelues with opinions that come incontinently in our heads,
as that the partie hateth vs, that hee ſeeketh vs, that there is ſome
hartburning, that there is ſome enmitie, and that there is I wote not
what. Let all this geere bee troden vnder foote, and let vs accept
their warnings if they be true. To bee ſhort, if any man blame vs,
we cannot do better, than to conſider what our owne conſcience
telleth vs of it. Marke this for a ſpeciall poynt, that wee muſt not
looke what the perſone is that ſpeaketh, nor paſſe whither there
bee any grudge or enmitie in him: but onely what our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
iudgeth of the matter and then muſt we needes conclude,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:23060:227"/>
I am rightly reproued. It is a maruelous thing, that they which do ſo
chafe and ſtorme and grind their teeth whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be rebuked, ſhould
neuertheleſſe condemne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues continually whither they would
or no, if they entered into their owne conſciences, and yet had much
leuer to play the mad bedlems againſt God, and too ſpite him by all
meanes poſsible, than to humble themſelues in acknowledging their
offences. Yee ſee then that the way which we haue to keepe when
we be found fault with, is too herken vnto ſuch as may make vs too
enter into account, and ſpecially too haue an eye too that which is in
vs. And where ſhall wee finde that? Euen written and ingrauen in
our conſciences. And although wee perceyue it not throughly: yet
let vs miſtruſt our ſelues, for noman is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>petent iudge in his owne
cace as they ſay. True it is that God doth already make vs iudges
in part: but yet muſt wee rather receyue the condemnation whiche
wee perceyue not, than carpe agaynſt it before wee haue well and
throughly weyed whither wee bee faultie or no. But there are a
number that are well apayde to ſhet vp, or rather too ſeele vp their
eyes, that they might not ſee their own ſhame: when a man comes
to prouoke them to amendment, they fall to skirmiſhing at the firſt
puſh, with, did they ouerſhoote themſelues ſo? And then all is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht,
they wil heare no further of the matter, let a hundred things
bee proued againſt them, and all is nothing with them. They do but
wring their mouth awrie at it. For they would alwaies cleere them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and although they bee a laughing ſtocke euen too little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
they paſſe not for it, but glory ſtill of the hardening of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in their owne leudneſſe and filthineſſe. Therfore let vs keepe
our ſelues from falling into ſuch wilfull ſtubbornneſſe: and in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vnfeynedly of our vices according to truth, let vs alſo be lowly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
too humble our ſelues and to beate downe all pryde in vs,
too the end that nothing may let vs from acknowledging freely that
wee haue done amiſſe. This is the effect of that which wee haue to
remember vppon this text. Now a man might thinke it ſtraunge that
S. Paule ſhould ſay, <hi>that the Galathians had receyued him as an Angell of
God, yea or rather as Ieſus Christ.</hi> For what perfection of holineſſe ſo
euer was in him, yet could he not match with the Angelles, as wee
ſee how he ſpeaketh in the ſeuenth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the Romanes, where he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth

himſelf too bee wretched, and ſheweth that he is as a
poore captiue and ſlaue of the world vnder the bondage of ſinne. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
S. Paule had an earneſt deſire too ſerue God: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
he knew he did but drag his legges after him, and that hee
had many infirmities to plucke him backe. And heere he ſayeth that
he was receyued as an Angell: yea and he ſtayeth not there, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
further, as Ieſus Chriſt, who (as we know) is the very Sonne of
God, and higheſt King, whiche hath ſouerain power ouer all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
But heere the cace concerneth not Sainct Paules life, nor any
worthineſſe that he pretendeth in himſelf. He hath an eye onely to
the doctrine. It is ſayd firſte, that he was receyued as an Angell of
God.<note place="margin">Mal. 2. b. 7.</note> And why not? For the ſame title hath bin giuen too all ſuch as
haue had chardge too beare abrode the doctrine of the Lawe, and of
much more reaſon ought too bee giuen to the publiſhers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell:
for there God vttereth his maieſtie and power, muche more
than he did in olde time vnder the Lawe. For aſmuch then as God
appoynteth mortall men to ſpeake in his name and authoritie: it is
requiſite that they ſhould be acknowledged to be his Angelles, that
is to ſay, Meſſengers or Ambaſſadors, for the woord Angell betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
none other thing. And in good ſooth too what purpoſe were
the doctrine which wee heere, if it came not of God? It were much
better that we [preachers] were dumbe and ſpeechleſſe, and that the
heerers were deafe and blind, than to ſtand herkening to a man that
were not ſent of God. For the chief honour that God requireth at
our hands, is that we ſhould be whiſt and herken to his woord, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
him all authoritie, and holding our ſelues bridled and captiue as
vnder the royall ſcepter wherevnto he will haue vs too ſubmit our
ſelues. Now if a mortall creature ſhould vſurpe this to himſelf: what
a thing were it? So then let vs marke well that S. Paule doth iuſtly
compare himſelfe with an Angell, as in reſpect of his doctrine. And
why? For he knewe well inough he had not forged it of his owne
brayne, but had receyued it of God. And that alſo is the cauſe why

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:23060:228"/>
ment not too make idolles when he ordeyned his Apoſtles and ſuch
as ſhould bee miniſters of his woord. He ment not that they ſhould
bee woorſhipped in his ſteed: for out of all doubte, that prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
is not to be giuen to the very Angelles of heauen: and what
ſhall bee done too vs then, whiche are but dung and rottenneſſe?
Howbeit, our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt regarded not what maner of ones
men are, but ment too aduaunce his owne woorde, too the end that
all men ſhould ſubmit themſelues too it. Although then that wee
bee but as brittle earthen pottes, or rather already broken, ſo as wee
bee nothing woorth: yet muſte not the treaſure of the Goſpell
which wee beare abrode bee therefore deſpyzed. For when Gods
woorde is preached purely vntoo vs, it is all one as if he dwelte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vs, and appeered perſonally vntoo vs, and it behoueth vs too
giue a proofe of our feare, loue and obedience towardes him, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing
his woorde though it come out of a mortall mans mouth.
And furthermore if wee holde skorne of the Goſpell, vnder colour
and pretence that they which ſpeake vntoo vs are nother Kings nor
Princes ouer vs: let vs aſſure our ſelues that that rebelliouſneſſe of
oures heaueth at our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. He that deſpyzeth you
(ſayth he) deſpyzeth mee: and he that reiecteth you reiecteth mee.
And this is well woorth the marking. For wee ſee now adayes that
Gods woord ſhall bee ſo lightly eſteemed vnder pretence of mens
perſones, as it is dreadfull too behold. And all ſuche as are loth too
bee rebuked, will by and by haue this anſwere in their mouth: who
are you Sir? who made you my Prince? As who ſhoulde ſay, that
God had not ſuperioritie ouer vs, nor might ſpeake too vs by the
mouth of his ſeruaunts. A Prince may well ynough ſende his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
or ſome ſuch man as he liſteth to chooze, and although the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone
bee of no countenance, yet will he haue him receyued without

ouer vs, and ſole preheminence ouer all the kingdomes and

who ſhould ſay, that God might not ſpeake by thoſe whom he hath
appointed to be his inſtruments: for as I haue ſayd heretofore, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
mought we be if wee bring our owne inuentions. It were muche
better that wee were drowned a hundred times, than that euer wee
ſhould go vp into the pulpet, if we ſhould not vtter Gods will faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and ſticke too that which he commaundeth vs, and draw it out
of the cleere fountayne of his holy woord. Should not theſe things
be declared? Thinke we that God can be bereft of the thing that is
peculiar too him, that is too wit of his truth? No: he and his truthe
can neuer bee ſeparated. So then let vs abhorre the blaſphemies of
theſe naughtipackes which ſay, ô, he that ſpeaketh will make himſelf
a God. If he require men too heere him without gainſaying, namely
when he is ſure in himſelf that he bringeth not any thing whiche is
not of God, it is good reaſon that he ſhould commend the authoritie
of his mayſter. So then let vs not haue any acquayntance with theſe
worldlings: but let vs yeeld ſuch reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to our God, that although
ſuche as ſpeake in his name bee of no eſtimation, yet wee may not

pretend Gods name falſly, and make a vayne cloke of it, and thoſe
that be faythfull dealers of his woord which he hath committed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

not aſhamed to ſay that whoſoeuer heereth them heereth Chriſt, &amp;
that he which reiecteth them reiecteth Chriſt: for they alledge that

that ſuch as haue charge to ſpeake in his name, ſhould be exalted too
haue any tirannie: but he ment that his woord ſhould be receyued
reuerently and without gaynſaying. And whereas S. Paule ſayeth
heere that he was receyued as an Angell, or rather as Ieſus Chriſt:
it is as much to ſay as he came not in his owne name, but indeuered
too preach Gods grace purely, and too make men too followe Ieſus
Chriſt, &amp; to frame themſelues wholly vnto him, that he might haue
his due preheminence, that the Goſpell might be receyued without

and if there come a thing, that he fought for he catcheth at that by

Euen ſo play wee: no doubt but we alwayes thinke our ſelues wiſe
ynough, and wee take ſcorne too bee taught at any mannes hande,
or too bee warned what is good for vs, for it ſeemes too vs too bee
an offering of wrong too vs: but yet experience ſheweth that wee
want bothe wit and reaſon. For what is the cauſe that men doo ſo

But lette vs ſee wherevntoo men apply their mindes: there is not
that man whoſe affections boyle not within him, in ſomuch that ye
ſhall ſee the greateſt number (as yee would ſay) racke themſelues,
and their mindes neuer ceaſſe day nor night too runne ſtill vppon
the things that come afore them, whereby they hope for any profite.
And when they haue well tormented themſelues, a man ſhall ſcarſly
finde one among a thouſande that hath his affections well ordered:
in ſomuch that it were much better for them too bee a ſleepe all the

greate inconſtancie and lightneſſe in vs, that the thing whiche wee
loue more deerely than our lyfe too day, ſhall bee as good as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpyzed

that looke where a mannes treaſure is there is his harte alſo, is

which we ſet moſt ſtore by, and whervpon we do wholly repoſe
<pb facs="tcp:23060:231"/>
our ſelues: for there are many things which men do well like of, the
which neuertheleſſe they can eaſly finde in their harts too forbeare.
Though a man ſee a fayre and coſtly thing, yet can he content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
quietly with his owne ſtate ſtill, if he haue wherewith too main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne

without the inioying of any welfare at all, ſurely we ſhall bee toſſed
with continuall vnquietneſſe, till wee haue obteyned it: and that
doth common experience ſhewe well inough. Seing then that our
hartes muſt needes bee tied too the thing which wee take too be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite

will alwayes labour for the ſame. Such as are poſſeſſed with

ſatisfied with any thing. They indure hunger and thirſte, heate and
cold, and dare nother eate nor drinke halfe their fill, and all too the
intent to heape vp out of meaſure. Lo at what poynt they bee. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
ſuch as couet to bee eſteemed and exalted too the worldward,
indure as great miſerie as if they were in the hands of the hangman:
nay, the hangman would not torment them ſo cruelly as they doo
themſelues: and yet they bee ſo headſtrong, as they cannot by any
meanes bee turned from it. But when God is ſo gratious as to ſhew
vs where our welfare lieth, that is to wit, in the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
although wee be warned that our life is of no continuance, and that

worldly things which are right nought. Therefore let vs conſider,
that S. Paules preſent vpbrayding of the Galathians when he asketh

than to inlighten them with the knowledge of his Goſpell, whereby
they had bin throughly perſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

nothing but deceitfulneſſe in it, for ſomuch as it turneth vs away
from the heritage of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according alſo as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
alledgeth the ſame ſimilitude,<note place="margin">Math. 13. f. 44.</note> that the Goſpell and the treaſures &amp;
riches conteined therein are a precious ſtone, and that if we ſhould
giue ouer all the things which we eſteeme in this world, and which
we like beſt of, we ſhould loſe nothing by the bargaine, nor haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
cauſe to repent vs. But now are we dubble too blame, ſeeing we
turne away after we haue knowen that God drew vs from beneath
to make vs partakers of his heauenly glory, and put that ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
benefyte out of our remembrance for the whisking of a flye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwart
our eyes as they ſay. For aſmuch then as it hath pleaſed
God to open our eyes, and too plucke vs out of the myre wherein
we were plunged with the vnbleeuers and ignorant perſons, not
only in following ſuperſtitions and idolatries as others did, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in giuing ourſelues ouer to our fleſhly likings and wicked luſts:
and ſeeing that God hath made vs to perceiue where our true ioy
lyeth, and giuen vs ſuch a taſt of it as we ought to reſt wholly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it: let vs take good heede that we neuer change our purpoſe, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of God doth heere condemne vs of vnthankfulneſſe by the
mouth of Sainct Paule, ſaying, <hi>VVhere is your happineſſe?</hi> For had we
bin alwayes let alone like brute beaſts without knowing wherein
our welfare and ioy conſiſt, it had bin no maruell though wee had
ſtill kept on our common trace. But ſeeing that God hath ſhewed
vs that we muſt ſeeke all our welfare in our Lord Ieſus Chryſte,
and that he is the full perfection in whome we muſt wholly reſt:
if we do afterward fleete too and fro and bee ſhaken now one way
and now another: it is certaine that wee can no more excuſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
by ignorance. Ye ſee then that the thing which wee haue too
beare in mind in this text, is that when we haue once bin taught the
Goſpell, we muſt ſet light by the thinges that wee made too great
account of before, and which men couet without end or meaſure:
that is to wit by the allurements of Satan and of the world, and by
all tranſitory and flightfull things whiche haue no ſubſtantialneſſe
in them and continually ſeeke our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, till wee come
to the full enioying of al the benefyt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> which hee hath brought vs.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:232"/>
And now herevppon S. Paule blameth the Galathians yet further,
<hi>that he cannot be their enimie but for telling them the truth.</hi> For it is too
great a leawdneſſe to fall out with our freende, only for ſhewing
himſelfe faithfull towards vs. VVhat is the thing that wee ſhoulde
cheefly deſire in a freend, but that he ſhould deale roundly with us,
and not beare two faces in one hood, nor vſe any craft and vntruth
towards vs? Euery man can tell that welynough, and it is as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
leſſon which we know without ſchooling: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
we be greeued and diſpleaſed with them that tell vs the
truth, and by that meanes do worke our weale: and therefore muſt
it not needs be that we are bewitched of Satan, if we ſtep vp againſt
them and become their enimies? Sainct Paule then ſheweth the
cauſe of his feare that they ſhould be alienated from him, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they were become his enimies, for none other cauſe
than that he had dealt ſoundly and roundly with them. Nowe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
this vice be horrible, and all men condemne it: yet is it as
common as any other nowadayes in the world. For what elſe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
frendſhip, but lying, flattering, diſsimulation, counterfetting,
and ſuch other like things? In ſomuch that if a man go roundly to
worke, hee ſhall purchace himſelfe hatred and ill will on all ſydes.
And the very cauſe of the greateſt contentions and debates that
are nowadayes in the world, is that men ſtop their eares againſt all
truth and reaſon: for we would fayne haue all thinges buried that
might miſlike vs: Therefore this was not written for the Galathians
only, but is to be applyed ſtill at this day to the common inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all ſuche, as cannot abide that men ſhoulde deale faithfully
and truly with them. For let euery of ys looke vppon himſelfe and
examine himſelfe well, and he ſhall find that all of vs are atteinted
with that vice, till God haue purged vs of it. So then let vs aſſure
ourſelues that if we greeue ſuch as tell vs the truth, in ſo doing wee
deſpiſe God, and fall out with him rather than with the men. VVe
will proteſt the cleane contrary: neuertheleſſe we do but lye, when
we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not indure that God ſhould bewray the thing that we would

Howbeit, although that his words be ſomewhat ſweete, yet doth he
not fayle to ſauce them a little to the intent to quicken them vp, by
calling them little babes, telling them that whereas they ought too
haue bin faſhioned and borne long ago, yea and to haue bin growe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to mans eſtate in Ieſus Chriſt, he wiſt not what too make of them.
For you driue me ſo to my ſhifts (ſayth he) that I cannot tell what
ſpeech I may vſe towards you any more: and therefore ſeeing you
be ſo ſtraunge and vntoward, and ſo fickle to bee dealte with that I
cannot tell how to handle you, I muſt faine to tranſforme my
ſelfe into a new man. Lo how he vſeth a manner of ſpeech mingled
with rigoure and great freendlineſſe. And hee is not contented too
take vppon him only the perſon of a father, whoſe loue notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is tender ynough towards his children: but hee likeneth
himſelfe alſo too a mother that is towardes hir trauell and full of
throwes, who (notwithſtanding all the peines that ſhe feeleth) is
more charie ouer the child that is to come out of hir womb, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe
is of hir owne bowells and lyfe. VVhen Sainct Paule vſed thys ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude,
it is certaine that hee wiſt not how to ſhew himſelfe more
affectioned towardes them, to the intent to breake, or at leaſtwiſe
to ſoften the hardneſſe that was in them to whome he ſpake. But
yet whatſoeuer come of it, he is flat with them in vpbrayding them
with their leawdneſſe, in that they acknowledged not their mother
that bare them and nurriſhed them with the ſubſtance of hir owne
bloud, but for all the gentleneſſe that hee vſed towardes them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
as wilde beaſtes that could not bee tamed: and that was an

continually followe the meane that I tolde you of to day: whyche
is that to the vttermoſt of his power, hee laboreth too bring thoſe
backe againe by louingneſſe, which were gone out of the way. And
to that end he telleth them, that he hath a greater care of their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
than they would thinke. But yet howſoeuer the cace ſtande,
he mingleth their oyle with tart vineger, which quickened them vp

as poyſoned or rather bewitched by Satan, ſo as they perceiue not
their owne filthineſſe: All ſuch geere muſt be razed out. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
hap what hap will, he holdeth ſuch an euen hand, as they muſt
needes perceiue that he procureth their welfare, and that all hys
ſeeking is to bring them vnto God. This in effect is the thing that
we haue to marke vpon this text. Howbeit we haue alſo too marke
particularly, that when Sainct Paule tearmeth them little babes,
he vpbraydeth them cloſely for that they had profited no better.

to be the children of God. Now when we come into the world, we
grow by nurriſhment of milke, and from time too time become
ſtronger, ſo as at length wee feede no more vppon milke, but vſe
ſubſtantialler foode, whereby we gather force and ſtrength more
and more, till we come to mans ſtate. Now then, what a thing were

the Goſpell? No ſurely: and therefore wee muſt acknowledge

               </gap>eas Sainct Paule calleth the Galathians litle babes,
although he do therin ſhew an earneſt loue towards them: yet doth
he ſting them alſo, according alſo as we ſee how the Apoſtle in the
Epiſtle to the Hebrues ſaith:<note place="margin">Heb. 5. c. 12.</note> How now? You ought to bee greate
Clearkes conſidering the long time that you haue gone to ſchoole:
for this is not the firſt day that the Goſpell hath bin preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and yet you be ſtill at your apcie: and what a ſhame is that?
For God hath done the office of a good ſchoolemaſter towardes
you and taught you ſufficiently: and you on your parte haue played
the trewands: and ſo what will now become of you? For S. Paule
had long time bin deliuered of the Galathians in Ieſus Chriſt, and
they ought to haue bin growen ſtrong in the faith of the Goſpell.
But behold, they be ſtil nouices &amp; raw ſchollers, yea &amp; ſo brutiſh as
they wote not wherevnto to <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>icke, nor what to follow. That is the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:23060:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>
firſt point. And now conſequently he addeth: <hi>that hee traueleth of
them in birth new againe.</hi> Hee had bin brought abed of them before:
howbeit, that was as ye would ſay before their time. Not that hee
had not giuen them all that was requiſite for their inſtruction: but
for that they were not able to receiue it, bycauſe they were ſtil too
much giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their earthly luſts and likings.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2. d. 14.</note> Now we know that the
ſenſuall man comprehendeth not the ſecrets of God. Therefore we
muſt be diſcharged of our owne nature, that we may be renued in
God: and the thing which we call Regeneration, that is to ſay new
birth or ſecond birth, doth vs to wit that the old man whiche is in
vs, muſt be mortifyed and as it were chaunged. For aſmuch then as
the Galathians had not giuen place to the doctrine of the Goſpel:
therefore Sainct Paule ſayth that hee muſt bee fayne to bee wyth
childe with them agayne, yea euen <hi>till Ieſus Chriſte bee faſhioned in
you</hi> ſayth he. This ſaying is added to ſweeten that whych was ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſowre of itſelfe. For what a ſhame was it that they whych had
receiued the earneſt pennye of their ſaluation in baptim, and in the
Lords ſupper, (as there were many of them both men and women
that had bin taught at the age of twentie, thirtie, fiftie, or threeſcore
yeeres) after proteſtation made before God that they were fully
renued in Ieſus Chriſt, ſhould neede to be as it were new molten,
caſt, and faſhioned agayne? And in that reſpect Sainct Paule ſayth,
<hi>till Ieſus Christ be faſhioned in you.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I maruell that
you ſhould be ſtill as little babes, and that I ſhould be forced (as ye
would ſay) to receiue you againe into my womb and bowells, till
the time came that yee might be riper than you haue hitherto bin:
and yet am I afraide alſo leaſt the peine and trauell that I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
among you be loſt and miſpent, and that you bee not ſo well
ſhaped and faſhioned as were to be deſired. Thus yee ſee breefly
howe Sainct Paule mitigateth the rigoure that myght haue bin too
great, and haue wounded the Galathians too ſore, when hee ſayde
vnto them, VVhat? Yee bee as it were borne before your time: I
thought I had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued you, bred you, borne you, and brought you
vp in Ieſus Chriſt, and I ſee now there is no life in you, at leaſtwiſe
no ſpirituall life, and that all is ſlipped and vaniſhed away. If Sainct
Paule had ſtayed there: ſurely thoſe wretched people had bin dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb facs="tcp:23060:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to confuſion and vtter deſpaire. Therefore to giue them cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to returne againe, he ſayth: Go too, truly ye haue profited very
ill hitherto: but enter new againe into the right way, and let that
which ſeemeth to be ſtarke dead bring foorth new frute againe, and
let it be perceiued that your proteſting too walke according to the
Goſpell heeretofore, hath not bin vayne. For like as if a tree bee as
good as dead, and ſeeme to be vtterly withered, it wil ſpring againe
if a man put new earth to the roote of it and cheriſh it: ſo will it fall
out that a man which is quite ſtrayed away from the Goſpell, ſhall
not only bee as it were eftſoones begotten new againe, if hee bee
brought backe agayne into the way: but alſo the thing that hee had
receiued afore ſhal do him good, as is to be ſeene whereſoeuer God
giueth the grace too bring thoſe backe againe intoo the right way
which were ſtrayed from it. But ſurely that happeneth not too all
men: and therefore let vs beware that wee abuſe not Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as many of theſe skoffers do, whiche turne away as though
they had confederated themſelues with Satan, whereof we ſee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
in theſe folke that defyle and vnhalow themſelues, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
Gods truth to the vttermoſt of their power. And if any man
turne away through vnconſtancie, it ſeemeth that all is marred, and
ſome will ſay, what ſhall a man win by teaching of them? behold, he
is but a loſt child: and ſo they will conclude that there is not one
drop of good knowledge in them. But if God call them agayne, as
there are many ſuch examples to be ſeene: a man ſhall find that the
thing which was as good as choked &amp; ouerwhelmed before, ſprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
againe, like as if dung were caſt vpon a well tilled grounde, or
as if duſt and ſuch other things were ſtrowed vpon it, that which is
vnderneath it ſhoulde lye hid for a time, but afterward it woulde
ſhoote vp againe. This in effect is the thing that Sainct Paule ment
to tell vs heere. But by the we way we haue to marke, that whereas hee
ſaith <hi>that Ieſus Christ ſhall be faſhioned in them new agayne</hi> it is meant
condicionally that they returne vnder his obeyſance. Surely thys
ſaying might ſeeme ſomewhat harſh at the firſt ſight: for we be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
faſhioned in Ieſus Chriſt, than he in vs. For proofe whereof,
beholde, Ieſus Chriſt is our full and whole perfection. Now, too
ſay that he is nurriſhed in vs as a little babe, or that he groweth or
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:23060:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is furthered: is not ſeemely for hys perſone. Neuertheleſſe Sainct
Paule ſaith ſo: howbeit, that is but too ſhew the vnion that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
vs and Ieſus Chriſt our head. Although then that Ieſus Chriſt
can neither increace nor diminiſh in himſelfe: yet doth hee take all
our faultes and infirmities vppon him. I haue told you already that
we are then borne in him, when we bee called too the hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
by the doctrine of the Goſpell: for wee bee all dead and
damned in Adam. There is but one meane of lyfe, whych is, to be
made one with our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, who is the fountaine that
hath all fulneſſe in it, and whereoutof it behoueth vs too drawe.
Then we are borne in Ieſus Chriſt (as I ſayd afore:) ſo doth hee
ſuckle vs with the doctrine of his Goſpell, till we bee able too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
perfecter learning, and till our faith be ſo farre forward, that
wee reſemble little babes no more, but increace ſtill in profiting
more and more, till we be come to mans age, as Sainct Paule ſayth
in the fourth to the Epheſians. Furthermore to the end wee may
know that oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſt intendeth not to bee ſeparated
from vs, but that he and we be all one: hee ſayth that hee taketh
our faultes vppon him, and becommeth as a little babe in vs. How
ſo? Can Ieſus Chriſt be weake? No, not in reſpect of hymſelfe: but
for aſmuch as we bee members of his body, hee ſayth he is little
in vs in reſpect of the little knowledge of hym whiche wee haue.
And for aſmuch as we proceede ſtill further and further: he ſaith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
that hee groweth and is increaſed in vs. Lo heere a record of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
goodneſſe, yea of the infinite goodneſſe of Gods ſonne,
in that it pleaſeth him ſo to abace himſelfe, as not onely too haue
compaſsion and pitie of our infirmities, too releeue them and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
them: but alſo tranſformeth himſelfe, and is contented too
ſay that he is as it were vnperfect, and as a little babe, and that hee
groweth greater and greater according too the continuall increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of our fayth.<note place="margin">Eph. 1. d. 23</note> And heere ye ſee alſo why in another place Sainct
Paule calleth the Churche the fulneſſe of God and of his ſonne
our Lord Ieſus Chriſte. But ſurely if we imagine that God is not
throughly full and perfect in himſelfe, but that he hath neede too
borrow of vs: it is ranke trayterouſneſſe: for what are wee able
to gyue vnto him? VVhen hee ſhall haue gathered vs all before
<pb facs="tcp:23060:235"/>
him, what can he find in vs but vtter miſerie? For we bee plunged,
yea and vtterly ſaped in it. Yet notwithſtanding he telleth vs by the
mouth of Sainct Paule, that we be his accompliſhment, and that in
that reſpect he is after a ſort imperfect. Not that he could not bee
without vs. for he hath bin always euerlaſtingly, before he had cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
the world. And although there were nother heauen nor earth,
could not God be ſatiſfyed with himſelfe? VVere hee nor riche y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of his owne glory? Yes ſurely: but he will not be perfect nor
fully ſatiſfyed til he haue vs knit in one with him. Thus ye ſee what
we haue to marke vpon this text. And by this word <hi>Faſhion</hi> we be
warned, that it not ynough for vs to haue ſome ſlight knowledge
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: but that he muſt be ſo liuely ſhaped in vs
to the full, as we may haue ſuche a print of his power, of all his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and of all his benefytes grauen in our harts, as may neuer bee
blotted out or defaced againe. He ſayd heeretofore, that when the
Goſpell is preached with ſuche efficacie as belongs vnto it, Ieſus
Chriſt is after a ſort crucifyed among vs: in ſomuch that wee not
only ſee him peinted liuely afore vs, but it is aſmuch as if wee ſaw
him vpon the Croſſe, with his bloud ſtreaming downe, as though
he were preſently offering vp the euerlaſting ſacrifiſe to God hys
father, to waſh away all our offences and miſdeedes. Now lyke as
God ſheweth vs that fauoure: ſo let vs on our ſide beware that we
let not the thing ſlip that is ſet afore vs, as many folke do, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they haue gotten the vnderſtanding of a two or three wordes of
the Goſpel, do fall to floriſhing, and thinke themſelues to haue too
much, whereas notwithſtanding they haue but a confuſed imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
Therefore it is not to be wondered at, though they be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
at their wittes ends in euery temptation be it neuer ſo ſmall,
ſo as all that they weene themſelues to haue learned, ſerueth them
to no purpoſe: for God doth by that meanes puniſh their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
VVherefore, in aſmuche as God hath graunted vs the
grace to knowe hys ſonne: let the foreſaid repreſentation be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in vs as oft as we come to any Sermon, and let vs bee renued
in knowledge and remembrance: that when the Diuell ſhall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to darken, and finally to deface the fayth which we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
he may gaine nothing at our hands bicauſe we haue the liuely
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:23060:235"/>
impreſsion [of Chriſtes ſacrifize] ſo deepely grauen in our hartes,
as it may well bee ſayd that he is truely and throughly faſhioned in
vs. And herein it to is be ſeene, that the Papiſtes haue vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: For they cokes the world, ſaying
that it is ynough too haue a confuſed faith, and that men muſt not
bee too inquiſitiue, and that it is perlous for men to indeuer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to profit in the Goſpell. Behold their blaſphemies. But heere
wee ſee how S. Paule telleth the Galathians, that it is a great ſhame
for them that Ieſus Chriſt Chriſt ſhould bee faſhioned new ageyne
in them, ſaying that it is all one as if they were doted, and had not
receiued the doctrine as they ought too haue done which had bin
preached among them. Therefore if wee doo our dutie and bee as
good ſcholers too Godwarde, as he is a good and faithful ſchole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter
towardes vs: ſurely wee ſhall not haue an intangled fayth
of ſome confuſed imagination,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. d. 18.</note> but wee ſhall beholde the ſonne of
God as he is ſpoken of the Corinthians, where it is ſayde that the
Goſpell is the true looking glaſſe wherein wee behold Ieſus Chriſt
as it were in the face. Not that wee ſee him with our eyes, for that
is reſerued to the laſt day, at what time we ſhall be lyke vnto God.
As then his glorie ſhall bee fully diſcoured vntoo vs: but as nowe
wee behold our Lord Ieſus Chriſt in the Goſpell ſo farre forth as is
meete for vs, and as our weakneſſe and rudeneſſe will beare, that
wee may bee transformed and faſhioned like vnto him. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
S. Paule addeth, <hi>that he would faine be with the Galathians, to change
his ſpeeche bicauſe he was ſorie for them:</hi> therein he bewrayeth ageine
howe groſſe and intolerable their fault is, ſithe he woteth not at
which ende too begin with them, and that although he haue bred
them in Ieſus Chriſt, and fed them vp with the doctrin of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
yet he knoweth not how to rule them any more, whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
a mother ought to knowe the complexion and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of hir childe. Needes then muſt thoſe men bee vtterly froward
and leaudmynded, whoſe fathers and mothers are at their wits end
and wote not how to behaue themſelues: and when their children
are become eyther ſerpents full of poyſon, or Lyons full of pryde
and ſtubbornneſſe, ſo as they be paſt teaching or handling: it muſt
needes be that they are become feendes. And yet doth S Paule vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayd
<pb facs="tcp:23060:236"/>
the Galathians with it. Howbeit, in ſtead of blaming them,
let vs ſee if the like vice bee not to bee founde in vs: namely that
when God openeth his mouth to teache vs, he finde vs ſo fickle-headed,
that he muſt be fayne to alter his ſpeeche at euery turne. It
is true that he can welinough weeld our hearts when it ſhall pleaſe
him. But we treate not heere of his ſecrete power whereby he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in his choſen. VVe treate heere but only of our owne nature,
how beaſtly it is if it be conſidered in it ſelfe, and of the preaching
of the Goſpel. Are not they that would preach the doctrine of our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt faythfully, ſtriken continually in heauineſſe to
ſee men ſo beaſtly as they ſhew them ſelues to bee? For our taſting
of the goodnes of our God ought to tame vs. Surely we ought to
giue good eare to his doctrine: and if wee could bee drawn vnto
him by gentleneſſe, or if wee would bee warned with euery little
beckening of his finger, like the childe that ſeeketh too pleaſe his
father, who as ſoone as his father dooth but ſpeake the worde, hath
his feete readie out of hande too runne whither ſoeuer his father
ſendeth him, and both his hands ready to doo whatſoeuer he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
him: he ſhould not neede to vſe long proceſſe with vs.
But when God ſpeaketh to vs, we be ſo dulwitted as we wote not
what he meeneth: or elſe wee ſtop our eares, that cry he neuer ſo
loude, it is to no purpoſe, for wee abide alwayes at one poynte.
Therefore the thing that S. Paule hath ſpoken in this text, ſerueth
not for any one people alone: but it is all one as if he blamed the
whole world in all ages for vnthankfulneſſe, ſaying that God is
after a ſorte greeued with vs for beeing ſo crooked and frowarde,
and for the great number of lurking holes and hypocriſies that are
in vs: in ſo muche that if he vſe vs gently, wee become ſo muche
the more ſturdie: and if he handle vs roughly, wee kicke agaynſt
the ſpurre. And in good ſoothe wee ſee what his gentleneſſe and
roughneſſe auayle vs: that is to wit, ſo little, that our leaudneſſe
muſt needes be ouergreat, ſeeing he can not winne vs by the one
nor by the other. Therefore let vs bethinke our ſelues throughly.
Furthermore foraſmuch as God is willing to beget vs by his word,
to the end we ſhould be his children, and in the end obteyne inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
whervnto he hath adopted vs by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:23060:236"/>
which he hath purchaſed for vs by the death &amp; paſsion of him that
is the true &amp; only heire: as oft as we come to Sermons, or any of
vs reade the holy Scripture, let vs conſider to what end it ſerueth.
And moreouer, if wee finde not ſuche power and efficacie in Gods
worde when wee heare it preached or read: let vs blame our own
naughtineſſe or dulneſſe for it, aſſuring our ſelues that the worlde
doth ſtill holde vs backe and hinder vs too much: and let vs pray
God that his worde may not bee vnprofitable to vs. Beſides this,
when we be once reformed by it, ſo as we are become his children:
let vs dayly feede vpon it, aſſuring our ſelues that wee haue neede
of it all the time of our life, and that wee bee not yet come to the
perfection wherevnto wee muſt tende. VVherefore let that ſtirre
vs vp, and let vs alwayes be earneſtly minded to go ſtill forwarde,
till wee ſticke faſte too oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and let vs take
good heede that wee doo not ſtop and ſhet vp the paſſage that he
ſhould haue to vs,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. c. 12.</note> to guide and gouerne vs to our ſafetie. And this
is the very ſame thing which we haue ſeene S. Paule vpbrayde the
Corinthians with, namely that he coulde not come at them: and
why? It was not long of me, ſayth he. VVherof then? Euen of your
owne ouerſtrayghtneſſe &amp; ſhrinking backe: and bicauſe ye ſubmit
not your ſelues to God, but rather draw from him, or elſe ſhrinke
backe into your lurking holes: I am fayne to talke to you, now in
one ſpeeche and now in another. So then according to his vpbray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Corinthians there, and of the Galathians ſtill heere, let
vs beware that we be not ſo ſtreightlaced as we be of our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
but let vs pray God to giue vs acceſſe to his worde. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that all our luſts, our ſinfull vanities, and our frowarde affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are as barres, gates, and ſuche other things caſt in the way, too
the intent that Gods worde ſhould not paſſe: let vs fight agaynſt
them, let it not only enter in vnto vs as at a creuis, but let it finde
the gate wide open, and when ſoeuer God ſpeaketh, let vs giue
good eare, and open our harts and minds, to receyue the doctrine
rightly and roundly, wherby we ſhould be clenſed, till wee be come
to the fountayne of all clenneſſe.</p>

ſhe thought that God forſlowed the performance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
ſo long, and ſhe was deſirous to haue iſſue. But ſhee thought
that that could not come to paſſe by hir owne meanes, &amp; therfore
ſhe made a very euil conſtruction vpon Gods word, and it apereth
that ſhe was not ſo pacient &amp; well ſtayed in hir fayth as was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite.
To be ſhort the mariage was to be condemned, and no better
than whordome, howbeeit that Abrahams intent was not ſo. For
he was not led with wicked luſt. He might very well haue deſired
to haue had the ſeede wherof the ſaluation of the worlde ſhould
ſpring: but ſee what our fooliſh intents doo. VVhen wee attempt
one thing or other without hauing Gods word for our warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we
ſhal be caried and led into many faults through our own raſhneſſe.
After this maner is Iſmaell borne of Agar the bondwoman, and yet
is that no Lawfull mariage nor allowed of God. Iſaac is borne of
Sara long tyme after Iſmaell: for Iſmaell myght well haue bin ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeere olde ere Iſaac was borne. But Sainct Paule followyng
the recorde of Moyſes, ſaythe <hi>that Iſaac was borne by promyſe, and
Iſmaell after the fleſhe.</hi> Not that Abraham begat not his ſonne Iſaac:
but that he did it by power from heauen, bycauſe his body was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
withered and as good as half dead, and he had not any more
luſtineſſe in him. He was a man of a hundred yeeres old, &amp; his wife
alſo pricked much about the ſame age, who had bin barrein all the
foretime of hir life, &amp; was full fourſcore &amp; ten yeres old or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts
ere ſhe might conceiue &amp; be with child, in ſomuch that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſhe hir ſelfe alſo thought it to be but a tale and a laughing matter,
when the meſſage was brought him by the Angels.<note place="margin">Ge. 18. b. 12.</note> Yee ſee then
that Iſaac was borne by promiſe. For in that cace God wroughte
by miracle, too the ende it might bee knowen that our Lord Ieſus
ſhould bee ſent into the worlde, not after the common order of
nature, but as proceeding of Gods goodneſſe and woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
forepurpoſe. But howſoeuer the cace ſtande, yee ſee heere in
the houſe of Abraham (who is as it were a figure and image of
the Churche) two women with their two children borne of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them one. Now as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ching Agar, S. Paule ſayth that ſhee
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:23060:238"/>
repreſenteth mount Sinay where the Lawe is giuen: and he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it a mountayne of Arabie, to ſhewe that it was not in the holy
land which God had appoynted to be the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his people.
Alſo Sara repreſenteth Ieruſalem: not the Ieruſalem (ſayth he,
which is now ſtanding, for that was corrupted and gone away from
the lawe and pure doctrine of God: I ſay from the lawe, not after
the maner that S. Paule taketh it heere to engender vnto bondage:
but according to the couenant that God had made with his people
in the name of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. For as muche then as the
Ieruſalem which was in S. Paules time, had forſaken Ieſus Chriſt,
and by that meanes diſanulled Gods couenaunt: S. Paule ſayth
that it muſt be coupled with Agar or mount Sinay. It is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
(ſayth he) that the Iewes make their brags vnder colour of
their Temple, Sacrifices and ſuch other things, that they bee Gods
choſen and peculiar people: for notwithſtanding all that geere, yet
are they as good as baniſhed and rooted out of the holy land, and
haue no more but a vayne title of the law. For let a man looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the ſtate of Ieruſalem as it is now to be ſeene, and it differeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all from Sinay. <hi>But there is a Ieruſalem from aboue</hi> (ſaith he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
that is to wit, the Church, which breedeth vs before God, and ſhee

that came to paſſe when the Goſpell was preached openly too the
world. For then the Church had not only the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Abraham,
or ſome one certayne people: but through the heauenly ſeede of
the Goſpell, ſhee brought foorth infinite children vnto God, of
all Nations and Countreys, farre and wide, according to the power
which God vttered through the whole world. Lo heere in effecte

               </gap> rehearſed. But firſt of all
<pb facs="tcp:23060:239"/>
wee haue to marke, that whereas S. Paule ſayth, <hi>that theſe things are
ſpoken by an Allegorie:</hi> he ment not too impeache the naturall ſenſe
of the holy Scripture, as wee ſee howe ſome haue doone, who
through their fooliſh curioſitie of ſeeking fonde ſpeculations in the
holy Scripture, haue turmoyled and diſordered all things, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the literall ſenſe to be nothing worth. This was the cauſe
that all things were falſified and peruerted, and there hath not bin
a more diueliſhe deuice than theſe allegories, whiche haue borne
ſuch ſway in the world, and as yet ſtill delight many men ſo much,
that they bee as it were bewitched with them, bicauſe they be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fauourable and plauſible. O noble expoſition, ſaye they. And
why ſo? Bicauſe that when as it toucheth neyther heauen nor
earth, the ſillie people are rauiſhed at it, and it is an eaſie matter
too hang in ſuſpence and mamering at it. But Sainct Paule mente
not that the things whiche Moyſes reporteth of Iſaac and Iſmaell,
ſhoulde onely ſerue for ſuche curious ſpeculations: but he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
that in that ſtorie wee ſee in effecte the ſtate of the Churche,
bicauſe that at that time there was no Churche in the worlde go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
by God, but onely the houſe of Abraham. There was as
yet Salem where Melchiſedeck was kyng: Howe be it for as much
as the ſame wente ſtill too decaye, God gathered a people in the
perſon of Abraham, whereby he gaue an incling, that he woulde
bee called vpon by thoſe whome he had ſholed out from the reſt
of the worlde. Therefore wee muſte not reade this ſtorie of
Moyſes coldly without looking any further, that is too ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
conſideration of the things that happened in that houſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the ſtate of the Church is ſhewed vs. Marke that for one poynt.
But nowe too come too the principall, let vs marke that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
Sainct Paule likeneth Agar Abrahams bonde woman vntoo
mounte Sinay, and vntoo the Lawe that was publiſhed there: he
meeneth not the Lawe with the whole contentes and ſubſtance of
it. For in the Law there are promiſes of ſaluation, which wee muſt
hope for by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, as Sainct Paule declareth in
dyuers places, and as wee our ſelues haue ſeene. Then if we could
take the Lawe in hys ryghte and lawfull vſe, it is certayne that
wee ſhoulde haue there the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> corruptible ſeede of lyfe, and God
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:23060:239"/>
would bee our father, and we ſhould be ſet free by him. The lawe in
deede hath ingendred vntoo bondage as in outward reſpect, as hath
bin declared heretofore. Although the fathers of olde time were
Gods children and heyres of the kingdome of heauen as well as we:
yet were they vnder tutors and gouerners. For they were as yet like
little children, and the perfection of things was reſerued to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and the Ceremonies were as brydles
and thongs, ſo that they which kept them had not the full freedome
that God graunteth vs to inioy now adayes as it is purchaced for vs
by our Lord Ieſus Chriſte. Yet notwithſtanding S. Paule ſpeaking
heere of the Lawe that ingendereth vnto bondage, taketh it for the
falſe opinion which they had againſt whom he diſputeth. For he will
adde anon, that all ſuch as are ſo ingendred, ſhall in the end be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
and driuen out of Gods houſe and heritage. Now although the
fathers were ingendred in outward bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage, as is ſayd of them in the
viij. to the Romanes: yet were they free by the ſpirit of faith, which
ouer ruled the bondage, or elſe they had bin cut of from all hope of
ſaluation. To be ſhort, S. Paule ſpeaketh heere of the lawe, after the
interpretation wherewith it had bin corrupted by the hypocrites
that buzied their heades aboute pelting trifles, and woulde needes
make meritorious deedes of them, and in the meane whyle did caſt
mennes conſciences into ſo ſtreyt bondes, as was ynough too choke
them. But hereof ynough hath bin ſayd heeretofore. Neuertheleſſe
wee muſt call to minde howe the lawe hath bin compared with the
Goſpell, bicauſe that ſuch as will needes purchace themſelues righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe
by it, do beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in hand that God is bound vnto
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for their doing of their dutie, and they think they do it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in deede.<note place="margin">Leuit. 18. a. 5.</note> VVhen they heere this promis, he that doth theſe things
ſhall liue: by and by they ſtreyn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and they beleue that they
ſhall bring the matter about to performe al that euer God requireth
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth. And when they haue once gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the promis by the
end, ſtreytwayes they looke for the wages too: &amp; they neuer thinke
any more that their ſaluation is a free gift, but that they haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
and earned Gods promis, ſo that the eternall life is with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but
a reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence of their deſerts. Thus yee ſee what is ment by the Lawe
when S. Paule compareth it with the Goſpell. And as touching the
<pb facs="tcp:23060:240"/>
Goſpell he doth vs to wit, that it is a doctrine wherby God ſheweth
himſelf to be our father, with couenant that we ſhould be ſet free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the condemnation of Satan and ſinne, yea and from the curſe of the
law. For (as wee haue ſeene afore) it is ſayd that all ſuch as fulfill not
the lawe in all poynts ſhall be accurſed. Nowe the cace is ſo, that all
of vs are indau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gered. And by that meanes all the world is ſwallowed
vp in deſpayre, and there is no remedie, vnleſſe God drawe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
ſinners out of that condemnation, and acquit them of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that was pronounced againſt them. Nowe then wee ſee after
what maner S. Paule tooke the name of the Lawe: namely that he
ment not, that the doctrine which is conteyned in Moyſes, doth not
make vs rightly the children of God, or that it contayneth not the
promiſes which were for the euerlaſting ſaluation of mankinde: but
onely that before Ieſus Chriſt came into the worlde, there was not
yet any ful libertie or freedome as there is now adayes, &amp; moreouer
that the hipocrites abuſed the law by their falſe interpretations. For
they ſurmyzed that they could make God amends, and thereby pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace
fauour at his hand. And therefore S. Paule ſayeth that we ſhall
alwayes be in bondage till wee be begotten againe by another kinde
of ſeede, that is to wit, by the Goſpell. But let vs marke well theſe
wordes, where it is ſayd that Agar or Sinay repreſenteth the Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
which was at that time, that is too wit, the ſame Citie which had
erſt bin Gods ſanctuarie, &amp; ſhould haue bin the welſpring of all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
doctrine,<note place="margin">Eſai. 2. a 3.</note> according too Eſay and Micheas, which ſay, The law
ſhall come from Sion,<note place="margin">Mic. 4. a. 2.</note> and the woord of God from Ieruſalem. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
for aſmuch as the Iewes were corrupt, and had mingled their
own inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; glozes with the pureneſſe of the true doctrine, yea
and had forſaken Ieſus Chriſt the fountaine of life: S. Paule ſayeth
that that Ieruſalem of theirs is like Agar the bondmayd, &amp; like the
mountayne Sinay which cannot ingender but to condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and
that is a thing well woorthie to be marked: for it ſerueth too ſhewe
that God did neuer ſo tie his grace to any one place, but that he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
the thankleſneſſe of the inhabiters,<note place="margin">Pſal. 48. a. 3. &amp;. 132. c. 13.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they would not haue
the wit to make their benefit of the good things that he had put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their hands. Behold, Ieruſalem is called Gods holy citie, his royal
palace, his houſe, and the plac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of his abode: all theſe titles are giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:23060:240"/>
it in the holy Scripture.<note place="margin">Math. 4. a. 5. &amp;. 27. f. 53.</note> And yet notwithſtanding S. Paule ſayeth
that ſhe is become like Sinay a barrein hill in a deſerte and elendge
place, and out of the bounds of the holy land which God calleth his
reſting place and the heritage of his faithful and chozen. Seing there
was ſuch a chaunge in the Citie of Ieruſalem, which had bin chozen
of God and honored with ſo many goodly and excellent titles: what
ſhall become of al ſuch people as do now adayes refuze the doctrine
of the Goſpell? Although they were exalted to the like honour, yet
could God wel ynough make them to tumble into all reproch. VVe
ſee what is ſayd of all thoſe Cities where our Lord Ieſus Chriſt had
preached the Goſpel:<note place="margin">Math. 11. c. 21.</note> as of Capernaum and the reſt. For they might
haue boaſted of their hauing of the meſſage of ſaluation firſt afore all
others, and of Chriſtes being conuerſant among them rahter than at
Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But he ſayeth, thou ſhalt be caſt down to the bottom of hel:
and that was bicauſe they were ſtubborne &amp; maliciouſly wilfull, in
diſdeyning to receyue the grace that was preached vnto them. Yea &amp;
we ſee what Ieremie ſayeth of Silo.<note place="margin">Iere. 7. b. 12</note> Bycauſe the Iewes boaſted ſo
much of their towne of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnder the colour of the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple and
the altar: Go your wayes to Silo (ſayeth he): was not the Ark placed
there a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time? did not me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reſort thither fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all coaſtes to worſhip

toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, bicauſe they had not profited the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
by the benefite that was offered to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt of all. Now therfore let
vs apply this to our own inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that whenſoeuer God ſhall haue
bin ſo gracious to vs, as to make his abode among vs, &amp; as it were to
plant his royall ſeege with vs too reigne ouer vs, wee may walke in
feare &amp; wareneſſe, indeuering on our ſide to obey him, &amp; to ſhrowd
our ſelues ſoberly &amp; aduiſedly vnder his wings. For if wee thinke to

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyt, &amp; vnhalow the gratious gifts which he had dedicated to our
ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſurely ſuch lewdneſſe ſhal not abide vnpuniſhed. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we
be warned by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to yeeld our ſelues peaſably to
the obeying of our God, &amp; to ſuffer him to gouerne vs, applying our
ſelues to him in al reſpects, without puffing vp into vayne preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhal haue beſtowed any of his ſpiritual gifts vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, but rather
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſsing that we be ſo much the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <pb facs="tcp:23060:241"/>
taking occaſion to humble our ſelues. And heere by the way we ſee
what a fondneſſe it is of the Papiſtes, too tie God vnto Rome vnder
colour (as they ſay) that it is the Apoſtolike ſea. Let vs put the cace
it were ſo, although we know not why, for all that they alledge of S.
Peter is but tales and ſtarke lies. It is very certaine that S. Paule was
hild priſoner at Rome, and it may be gathered that he was euen put
too death there. Beholde, all the holineſſe of Rome is this, that the
Goſpell was perſecuted there, and that that Diueliſh dungeon hath
bin defiled with the bloud of the martirs, as it were to prouoke gods
wrath, and too confederate it ſelf too fight againſt the truthe, and as
much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as may be to aboliſh the name and remembrance of our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt. Behold heere all the woorthineſſe of Rome. But now
admit that they had the recordes which the Citie of Ieruſalem had,
whereof not withſtanding they finde not one ſillable in the holy
Scripture. It is not ſayd that God will reygne or haue any dwelling
in the Citie of Rome, nor that it ſhoulde bee named the moother
church, nor haue any other dignitie or preheminence at all. In deede
Sainct Paule ſayeth that the faith of the Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. b. 8.</note> (&amp; yet they were
then but a handfull of people,) was at that time knowen euery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
euen to their great renowme. For yee muſt not thinke that
thoſe whiche bare the ſwoorde there were the Chriſtians: but they
were a fewe folke gatherd togither in couert. Thoſe dooth S. Paule
prayſe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend: but yet doth it not follow that the Church was
ouer all the whole towne of Rome, notwithſtanding, whatſoeuer it
were, wee ſee what happened too Ieruſalem. Sainct Paule telleth
vs that it differed not from Agar or Sinay, which is an vnholy and
defiled place, ſo that the holyneſſe thereof was vtterly done away,
bycauſe it continued not in the pure doctrine of the Goſpell.
Therefore wee may conclude that ſuche as haue bin neereſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
God, and too whome he hath communicated himſelfe moſte
familiarly, ſhall bee ſhaken off as ſtraungers, if they abyde not in
the pureneſſe [of the truth] which is the vnſeparable bande where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee bee made one with our God. But ſurely wee ſee that now
adayes, the pure doctrine of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is not onely ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off, troden vnder foote, deſpyzed, &amp; skorned at Rome: but alſo
cruelly perſecuted with fire &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ord, &amp; finally that there is no reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:23060:241"/>
at all there. For that place is ſo full of filth and lewdeneſſe, that
if a man go thither, it is a wonder that euer he ſhould returne with
any feare of God or with any good ſeede in him. VVee ſee then that
it is as a dungeon of hell: and would God that they which haue bin
there had rather broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their neckes, than lifted vp a foote to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For we ſee preſently, that the countrie of Fraunce hath bin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with all vngodlineſſe by it, ſo that the moſte part of them are
become no better than hogges and dogges, hauing leſſe religion in
them than brute beaſts. But yet (as I haue touched heretofore) wee
bee warned hereby too walke in feare and warineſſe, and too take
good heede that we be not bereft &amp; depriued of the benefite which
wee haue receyued, if we abuſe it, leaſt God poure out his horrible
wrath vppon vs, and wee become as a mirrour and patterne of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche
after the maner of Ieruſalem, whiche S. Paule doth heere ſet
vpon the ſcaffold, not withſtanding that it had bin ſo highly hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before. Furthermore let vs marke, that vnder the figure of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
God doth heere ſhewe himſelfe a father too all his: and ſo
ye ſee we bee begotten of God, ſo as wee haue roume in his Church.
But yet is it not ynough for vs too call vpon God as our father, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we be rightly begotten againe by the incorruptible ſeede, which
is vnto vs as a pledge of euerlaſting lyfe and ſaluation. If it be asked,
how then is it poſsible that wee ſhould bee begotten of God, and
yet notwithſtanding be as it were a baſtardſeede? The anſwere is,
that wee by our owne vice and naughtineſſe doo marre Gods ſeede
whiche is his woorde: for ſo is it named by S. Peter.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1. d. 23.</note> But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that in reſpect that the woorde proceedeth from God it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth
in it ſelf nothing but all goodneſſe. And againe we ſee what
pureneſſe ſhyneth there, howe that all the treaſures of Gods right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſneſſe,
mercie &amp; goodneſſe are vttered there. Thus then you ſee
what maner of thing Gods woord is, and what is the nature thereof.
Neuertheleſſe when we corrupt it and falſifie it by our own fancies,
and make a minglemangle of it: we may ſtill be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
howbeit we ſhall be but as baſtard children, as ſhal be declared
more at large (by Gods leaue) after dinner. For then will S. Paule
declare, that although Iſmaell were the eldeſt Sonne, yet was he in
the ende driuen out of the houſe wherein he had taken the chiefe
<pb facs="tcp:23060:242"/>
roome vpon him, howbeit that he was but a baſtard, and alſo borne
of a bondwoman. Then let vs marke that we muſt not onely be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
by Gods woord into a pure fayth, and God by his holy ſpirit
inlighten vs that we may know his will according as he witneſſeth it
vnto vs. For if we chaunge his woord after our owne fancie, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyze
it: truly it may be called Gods ſeede ſtill, but yet is it not ſo
in deede, what ſoeuer wee make of it, bicauſe it abideth not in his
own ſoundneſſe. And heere ye ſee the cauſe why ſo many do now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
falſly name themſelues Chriſtians: according as the Papiſtes
will well ynough confeſſe that they beleeue in God, and that they
bee contented too hold themſelues too the holy Scripture. But yet
for all that, it is apparant that they bee vtterly peruerted, and that as
touching the Scripture, whereas they ought too receyue it with all
reuerence, they turne it too their owne lyking, yea and make a
mockage and ſcoffe of it, and (as I ſayd erewhyles) they ſpewe out
this blaſphemie agaynſt it, that it is a noze of waxe, and that menne
may turne it which way they liſt: and moreouer it is apparant that
they haue turmoyled all things by their owne forgeries. For what
elſe doo men call Gods ſeruis in poperie, but the things that men
haue ſette downe of their owne brayne. There is no mention of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
themſelues by Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement and ordinance. God muſt
be thruſt out of his place, and men take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them that which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
vnto him, chalendging authoritie too bring folkes conſciences
into bondage, and to make what lawes they thinke good. But that is
to villanous and outrageous a corruption. On the other ſide, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
doo the Papiſtes draw the Articles of their fayth? euen out of their
owne decrees, for they recke not too drawe any reſolution out of
the holy Scripture. So then they paſſe not a whit what is in the holy
Scripture: but if any thing be agreed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and receyued by common
opinion, that is as an Oracle from heauen with them. And wee ſee
alſo that when they intend to proue any of their toyes, the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that they make, is that it is receyued, and that antiquitie ought to
preuayle, as who woulde ſay that there were any preſcription in the
matter: and therevpon they pull out certaine textes of the Scripture
by the heares of the head, and theſe muſt alſo help forward the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But [when all comes to all] it is but flat mockerie, &amp; it is appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:23060:242"/>
that they wilfully corrupt Gods woord. For there is ſuch groſſe and
beaſtly ignorance in them, that very children might iuſtly ſpitte in
their faces for it. So then the Papiſts are a fayre looking glaſſe too
vs at this day, for the things that are conteyned heere in S. Paule:
that is to wit, that many of them vaunt themſelues to be Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and houſeholdmeynie of his Churche, and yet notwithſtanding
are but baſtard ſlippes, and of a corrupted ſeede, bicauſe that in ſtead
of cleauing throughly to the pure doctrine which were able too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
them againe into the hope of the heauenly life, they be ſo giuen
to their owne minglings, that there is not any more ſoundneſſe in
them. But we neede not to go any further too ſhewe that the matter
which S. Paule treateth of heere, is verified too much of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
For where aboutes is our greateſt ſtrife now adayes, but for
freewill, for merites, for ſatisfactions, and for ſuch other things? The
Papiſts ſay that we are able by our owne freewill, to purchace grace
at Gods hand, not that we neede not too be ayded and ſuccored by
his holy ſpirit, but bicauſe there is a certaine matching togither (ſay
they) betweene God and vs, ſo as God worketh one peece and wee
another. Thus doo they make vs Gods marrowes, and like as our
ſtrength would be to weake if it were not ſuccored on Gods behalf:
ſo ſhould Gods grace (ſay they) be vnauaylable, if we made it not of
force by our owne mouing therevnto. And herevpon agayne they
forge &amp; build their merites: there is none other talk among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but
of purchacing the realme of paradice, by making God beholden too
them: &amp; then ſtep forth their merites and ſatisfactions to raunſome
all the faults that they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. Thus ye ſee in effect what the
Papiſtes prate and iangle. Therevpon they conclude, that it is blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie
too ſay that Gods Lawe is impoſsible, and that wee bee not
able too performe it: ſaying that there is no man but he may ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcharge himſelfe of it when he liſteth. It is an eaſie matter for
them too prate after that faſhyon in the ſhadowe: but they that
ſay ſo, are naughtie ruffians, drunkardes, ſwearers, and folke gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
too all villanie and outrage. For menne knowe well ynough
what the holyneſſe of the Moonkes, of the ſhauelings, and of all
the whole rable of their rifraffe and Cankerwoormes is. But
wee on our ſide ſay that wee bee b<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

ſo much as thinke one good thought of well doing, but go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſtill vnto al euil, like as if an Aſſe ſhould alwayes beare his yoke
or burthen with him, and yet wee ſinne not but willingly: But how
ſoeuer we fare, we be ſo ſaped in ſinne, that naturally wee cannot do
any thing but offend God, and therfore that he muſt be fayne to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
vs and ſet vs at libertie by his holy ſpirite. Moreouer wee ſay,
that the law of God is vnpoſsible to be fulfilled, and that it ſheweth
vs our duetie to the end to condemne vs &amp; to ſtop our mouthes, &amp;
too make vs come before God as wretched offenders, too obtayne
grace at his hand for the ſinnes which we haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
vs with ſhame, to the end we ſhould graunt our ſelues to bee
da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, and ſeeke to be ſaued at Gods hand, through the grace of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Finally wee ſay, that too iuſtifie our ſelues before
him, is a thing that paſſeth all our abilitie, and that he ſupplieth our
wants bicauſe he ſifteth vs not with rigour, nor entereth into accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
with vs: &amp; that when we haue offended him, there is none other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for it, than the ſacrifize that was offered by our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, nor any other clenzing, than to plundge our ſelues ouer head
and eares in his bloud. Thus ye ſee how the doctrine which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in S. Paule, is to be put in practize in reſpect of the diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of
the Papiſts againſt vs. For it is certain, that for all their bragging and
falſe prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the name of God, and for all their ſaying that they
be his children bicauſe they be begotten by the holy ſcripture: they
ſhew that their mother is Agar or Sinay, and conſequently that they
be bondmen borne, and do tie the rope about their owne necke, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they haue no will to go vnto God, too receyue the freedome
that he offereth them, but wil rather vſurpe to themſelues the thing
that belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to God only, and wil needes iuſtifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by their
own merites; and fulfill the lawe of themſelues. Therefore they bee
bondchildren, and continue ſlaues ſtil, and in the end muſt be driuen
quite out of the houſe. As for vs, wee ſhall ſee hereafter what proofe
the doctrine hath which we holde, &amp; what it bringeth with it: which
is, that we haue none other freedome than is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs by the doctrine
of the goſpell, according alſo as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſheweth in the
viij. of S. Iohn, that it is his pecul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:23060:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>
drawing of vs out of damnation, is a ſpeciall priuiledge giuen vnto
him by God his father. Therefore when wee come too our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt, and in him ſeeke, for all things that wee want, knowing
that by his meanes we be deliuered from the yoke of the law, which
we are not able to beare, and which not onely made vs too ſtoupe,
but alſo weyed vs downe to the bottome of hell: if is the true ſeede
that begetteth vs againe into full freedome too bee Gods children,
not onely to be bruted ſo in this worlde, but alſo to bee auowed ſo

            <p>But nowe let vs fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good

Gods worde without any corruption or mingling. And for this
cauſe doth S. Paule bring vs backe too the heauenly Ieruſalem, that
we might know who is our mother. Truly to ſpeake properly, ſuch
as peruert the naturall ſenſe of the ſcripture are not the children of
God, and all their crying and calling vpon him as their father, is but
ſtarke lying and hypocriſie. Howbeit foraſmuch as they be taken to
be of that degree: S. Paule diſcerneth them out by their mother, too
the end we might know which are Gods true and lawfull children
and allowed of him. For the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

at al aduenture, and in theſe dayes the Papiſts make a buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler

is againſt them: they thinke it may ſerue them for a couert, that
they (as they wene) haue the Church on their ſide. Yea but S. Paule
telleth vs that we muſt be wiſe to diſcern which is the true Church.
For the Iewes had colour ynough to ſhew that God had his abiding
place in Ieruſalem,<note place="margin">Pſal. 137 c. 14.</note> bicauſe hee had choſen it out with aſſurance that
he woulde reſt there for euer, as we haue ſeene this morning. And
yet notwithſtanding the very ſame Ieruſalem became as a denne of
theeues, bicauſe our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was crucified there, and the
Iewes were for their vnfaythfulneſſe cut vtterly off from the houſe
of God, bicauſe they had indeuered to the vttermoſt of their power
to aboliſh his truth. Though the name of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had earſt bin ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable:
yet was it then had in reproch and diſdein both before the
Angels and before all the faithfull. Euen ſo at this day wee ought to
conſider well which is the Church, to the ende that we be not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of a baſtarde ſeede, and ſo God ſhake vs off and baniſhe vs out
of his houſe, for prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding his name ſo falſly through hypocriſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men. In deede it is a verie excellent honor that God giueth to
his Church, in ſaying that ſhe is the mother of all the faythfull, and
it agreeth with S. Paules report in another place,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. d. 15.</note> where he ſayeth,
that ſhee is as it were the piller that vpholdeth. Gods truth in thys
worlde. Not that the truth hath any neede to be mainteyned by vs,
which are inclined to all lightneſſe and inconſtancie, and which haue
nothing in vs by nature but vntruth: for what ſtedineſſe is there to
be found in vs, to ſay that Gods truth ſhoulde ſtay vpon men? But
bicauſe that of his infinite goodneſſe it is his will to haue his worde
preached here beneath, and hee hath committed the charge thereof
to ſuch as he calleth therto,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. b. 9.</note> in reſpect where of the Church is called
the mother of vs all. For as our lord Ieſus Chriſt telleth vs) we haue
but one father, which is God, yea and he is the father as well of our
bodies as of our ſoules. Howbeit God is our ſpirituall father with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hauing any make, &amp; yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he begetteth vs into the
hope of eternall life, and that is by the meanes of his Church, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
he hath put the ſaid incorruptible ſeed,<note place="margin">Eſay. 59. d. 21.</note> according as he ſaith by
the Prophete Eſay: My worde (ſayth he) ſhall be in thy mouth, and
<pb facs="tcp:23060:245" rendition="simple:additions"/>
continue with thy children from time too time, and with all thoſe
that ſhall come of thy race. Thus ye ſee how God intendeth to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
his faithfull ones, namely by his worde, which he maketh to
bee as a pledge and ineſtimable treaſure of ſaluation in his Church,
to the ende that we ſhould be begotten and nurriſhed with it. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(as I haue touched alreadie) we had neede too bee ſo much the
more skilfuller in diſcerning the Church. For ſeeing it is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the name of it ought not to be diſhonored and
trampled vnder foote, nor yet defiled as it is ſeene to be nowadayes.
There is not a more common treacherie, than to put forth the name
of the Church to deface and darke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods truth. For whereat do the
Papiſts ame nowadayes in vaunting with full mouth and full throte
that they be the Church, but to ſtoppe Gods mouth, and to thruſt
his worde vnder foote, that it might no more be ſpoken of, and that
in the meane while the things that men haue forged after their
own lyking, ſhould be receyued without any gainſaying, and ſticked
to and obeyed? VVe ſee then that men which are but earthwormes
and rottenneſſe, are put into the balance agaynſt God, and all vnder
pretence of the Church. But here Saint Paule warneth vs to ſeeke
the Church which hath the pure doctrine whereby wee were adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God to be his children. Nowe I haue tolde you heretofore,
that the whole matter lyeth in our being ingreffed into the bodie
of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and alſo in our acknowledging that wee
be accurſed by nature, that all our workes are but filthineſſe, that the
Diuell holdeth vs ſubiect to his tyrannie, and that there is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
helpe for vs, but that God ſhould receyue vs to mercie and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Therefore let vs go into Gods houſe by the ſayde gate, that is
to wit, by acknowledging that there is none other way for vs to get
in but by the onely mere grace of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Thus ye
ſee howe the Church doth breede vs and beare vs, verely euen by
the foreſayde incorruptible ſeede. Nowe that we may ſore the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
by this text, wee haue two poyntes too marke. The one is that
we muſt not be like theſe fantaſticall fellowes, which thinke they
may be faythfull without readings or preachings, bearing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in hande, that the holy Ghoſt ought to reueale himſelfe too
them by dreame, or I wote not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>owe elſe. And in good ſooth they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:23060:245"/>
deſpize all doctrine, and (to their ſeeming) all inſtruction is but as
an Apcie for yong children. Let vs beware that we let not our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
looce after that faſhion by the meanes of Satan and of his wiles.
But if we couet to bee counted Gods children, and to haue the true
marke whereby wee may bee knowne before the Angelles: let vs
ſuffer our ſelues too bee taught, and let vs keepe the order of the
Church with all reuerence and lowlineſſe. And ſo the greateſt ſort
and ſuch as are exalted to any degree of honour, ought alwayes to
be throughly perſuaded in themſelues, that the greateſt dignitie
which is poſsible for them to haue, is to bee children of the Church,
yea through they were Kings and Princes. For hee that exempteth
himſelfe from that ſtate, doth vtterly renounce God, and cut him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
quite off from all hope of ſaluation. Therefore marke it for
a ſpeciall poynt, that ſo long as we be in this worlde, wee muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuer
too profite in Gods woorde, bycauſe that that is the place
where all our ſpirituall life lyeth: and that like as God hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
vs againe by it, ſo alſo we ſhall bee fed by it too the ende, as by
the onely food of our ſoules. Then let vs not bee ſo proude and
preſumptuous as to deſpize all teaching, as though we had no more
need to be ſcholers. But let vs from day to day receyue that which is
tolde vs, and by that meanes let vs become true children of the
Church. Thus much for that poynt. The ſeconde poynt is that we
muſt diſcerne, and not bee as beaſtes that are driuen ouer mariſes,
and ouerthwart the wide fieldes: but conſider which is the Church,
according as God hath imprinted certaine ſignes of the Churche,
which ſignes will neuer deceiue vs. Therfore when we haue Gods
worde preached vnto vs purely without any mingling, ſo as there
is no corrupting of the Goſpell, but we be led wholly vnto God to
ſeeke all our welfare in him, and kepe the way which is ſhewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, which way is our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, ſo that wee beeing ridde
of all pride and ouerweening, do ſuffer our ſelues to bee clad with
the clothing that is offered vs in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and repoſe
al our glory ther, I ſay whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue the doctrine after that maner:
then is it Gods houſe and Sanctuarie, then is it the true Church and
our mother, and we may bee well aſſured that God alſo auoweth
and accepteth vs as his children. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:23060:246"/>
proofe, at leaſtwiſe if we become not brute beaſtes wilfully,
as we ſee many do, who ſhet their eies &amp; ſtop their eares, and beare
themſelues in hand that they be ſafe, if they can once pretende the
name of the Church, to hide all their abuſes and trumperies, and the
illuſions of Satan with it. VVherfore let vs not bee ſo beaſtly by our
owne wilfulneſſe: but let vs conſider whither God ſendeth vs to be
truly regenerated by the ſeed of his worde, and to bee fed with it as
with our only food. And for the ſame cauſe alſo is this text of Eſay
aledged, God ſpeaketh not at randon to ſome multitude that might
vaunt themſelues too bee the Church,<note place="margin">Eſa. 54. a. 1.</note> but onely to the flocke that
ſhould be left, after that the Iewes had bin horribly run aſtray and
ſcattered aſunder, as we know to haue happened vnto them. Surely
at the firſt ſight a man woulde haue thought that God had vtterly
baniſhed and aboliſhed his Church out of the worlde: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
he had gathered togither a ſmall number of them, and
thoſe are called the remnant of the free election. For which cauſe
the Prophet Eſay ſayth, that ſuch as are redeemed and vnfeynedly
returned vnto God,<note place="margin">Eſay. 1. a. 9</note> to rule their life obediently after his worde, are
the children of the Church. And here we haue to note by the way,
that the Church tryumpheth not in this world, neither ſhineth with
ſo gay and ſtately pompe, that men might bee rauiſhed at the onely
ſight of it, ſo as they ſhould ſubmit themſelues vnto it: but that it is
moſt commonly forſaken, &amp; as it were diſfigured, and that is a point
well worthie to be marked.<note place="margin">Mat. 10. b. 10.</note> For whereas the Papiſts brag that they
haue the Church on their ſide: how are they able to do that? They
muſt needes bring ſome euidence. But they alledge not aught ſaue
their riches, their authoritie, and the great pompe and brauerie that
is among them: but thoſe are not the things that God will haue his
Church knowne by. For we knowe that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt will
reigne heere in the thickeſt of his enimies, inſomuch that the leſſon
which he taught his diſciples muſt alwayes bee verefied vppon vs,
that is to wit, we ſhall be forſaken and deſpyzed of the worlde, men
ſhall bleare out their tongues at vs, and we ſhall be ſo troubled and
vexed heere, as we may not ſeeke for any peace or reſt heere. Now
then, whenſoeuer any man talketh too vs of the Church, let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke
vs well of the thing that Saint Paule telleth vs heere. For
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:23060:246"/>
he likeneth the Church to a widdow, which is all alone in hir houſe
and hath neither ſuccour nor helpe. The world forſakes hir, no man
makes account of hir, ſhee is as good as halfe dead and buried alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
Neuertheleſſe God ſayth that ſhe ſhall be ſet aflote againe, and
that ſhe ſhall haue mo children than ſhe that is maried and is in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and reputation. This leſſon muſt we (I ſay) put in vre nowadayes
when we ſee the poore Church ſo troden vnder foote, and the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
thereof in ſuche pride or rather madneſſe, that they ſet vp
their creſts and triumph ouer vs, as though we were no better than
duſt and ſmoke. VVhen we ſee ſuch things, let vs wayt paciently till
God gather togither thoſe whom he hath choſen: and let it content
vs that he auoweth vs for his children, though the world diſdeyn vs,
and ſhake vs off after that ſort. Yee ſee then that wee muſte not
bring eies full of vanitie, to diſcerne which is the Church, as they do
which will haue nothing but pompe and great outward ſhewes. But
contrariwiſe let vs conſider that god will ſo afflict his poore church,
as there ſhall not appeare any beautie or ſhape in hir too the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
but rather vtter deſolation, yea (and as we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſee) eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
man ſhall riſe vp agaynſt hir. But howſoeuer ſhe fare, let it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
vs, that God gathereth vs to him as his children: yea and let vs
marke, that when we be called by the pure doctrine of the Goſpel,
we be made fellowes with all the fathers whome God choſe vnder
the Lawe, with all the holy Kings and Patriarkes, with all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
and Martyrs, and finally with all the faythfull ones that haue
bin ſince Abell to this day, or which ſhall be to the worldes ende. No
doubt but the Papiſts will bragge ynough of their multitude: yea,
but wee ſee that the Prophete laugheth all of them too ſcorne.
And why? VVee muſt alwayes diſcerne which are the [true] chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
For what elſe we are all the Churches of the Papiſtes than Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelhouſes
of Satan? All things are infected, nothing is there but
fylthyneſſe, Gods ſeruice is there vtterly marred, and too bee
ſhort, there is no ſoundneſſe at all in them. The Papiſts therefore
for all that euer they can pretende too make themſelues Gods
Churche, are but misbegotten Baſtardes, as they that are tyed too
the Brotherlhouſe wyth theyr mother that Sinagog of hell.</p>
            <p>Ye ſee then how the cace ſtandeth and it is not I that doth ſay it,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:247"/>
but it is the Prophete Eſay that ſpeaketh ſo, and Saint Paule who is
a faythfull expounder of Gods meening, confirmeth the matter.
VVherefore let vs learne too ioyne with the true children of God,
which haue the infallible recorde of the holy Ghoſt, and not follow
the greater throng, but let all theſe wretches go, whiche caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
wilfully into Satans ſnares, &amp; wander like brute beaſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any diſcretion. But by the way wee haue to marke, that ſuch as
are the children of the Church ceaſſe not to bee our fathers, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that beſides the common brotherhood that is betwixt them
and vs, there is this moreouer, that by their meanes we be begotten
in the worde of God,<note place="margin">Gal. 6 d. 16</note> according as it is ſayde that we bee Abrahams
children, and the true Iſraell of God, as if we were diſcended of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs
race. Therefore wee haue thoſe for our fathers which are our
brothers too: and all of vs togither are the children of God and his
Church. For whereas our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is in verie deede the
onely ſonne of God: he is to this ende called our head, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
knitte togither in him, and becomming members of his bodie,
might be hilde and taken for Gods children, becomming that thing
by free adoption, which we be not by nature. And Saint Paule tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs, that this befalleth vs <hi>by promiſe after the example of Iſaac,</hi>
too expreſſe that wee muſt not haue any vaine confidence in our
owne deſertes, or in any vertue that is in our perſons, but be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
voyde of all pryde, knowing that all the woorthineſſe which wee
haue, commeth of Gods mere grace and free gift. Thus ye ſee that
the thing wherein we differ from the baſtard children which boaſt
themſelues falſly of Gods name, is that whereas they be puffed vp
with ſelfelyking, and delight in their hypocriſie, and are alwayes
prating of their free will, of their meritorious woorkes, of their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfactions,
and of their vertues as well cardinall as theologicall, as
they terme them, and (to be ſhort) haue nothing in them but pride:
VVe on our ſide ſticke to the promiſe, that is to wit, that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
looked vppon vs with mercie, hath drawne vs out of the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
of deſtruction wherein wee were and by his Goſpell tolde vs,
and aſſured vs that he will be our father, and that an heritage tary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for vs, which is purchaſed for vs, not by our ſelues, or by any
mortall creature, but by Ieſus Chriſt, who being verie God became
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:23060:247"/>
man, to the intent we might obteyne the thing in him which is not
to bee found in all the world. Yee ſee then in effect that the ende
wherevnto S. Paules concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tendeth, is that if we mind to be well
grounded in the doctrine of the Goſpell, and to be ſure of a good
ſtud and ankerholde of our ſaluation, we muſt not intermedle any
opinion of our own deſeruings with it, nor ſurmiſe that we be able
to bring any thing of our ſelues, but ſimply receiue that which God
offereth vs, and ſuffer Ieſus Chriſt to be our ſauiour wholly &amp; not
by halues. That is the thing whervnto the word <hi>promiſe</hi> tendeth, as
I haue declared more at large already. But the law had alſo his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
howbeit with condition, as I haue declared. The promiſe that
S. Paule ſpeaketh of preſently, is the thing that aboliſheth all mans
pride, and diſgraceth the men them ſelues, ſhewing them that there
is nothing in them but vtter confuſion, and that all their welfare
lieth incloſed in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſo as we cannot come by it,
nor inioy it but by meanes of the Goſpell. Nowe the Goſpell tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs that we muſt holde all of God, and do him homage for our
ſaluation, bicauſe he giueth it vs, and it is not a wages due vnto vs,
that he ſhould by any meanes be bound vnto vs. And heerevpon
S. Paule ſayth, <hi>that it is ſo euen yet ſtill at this day,</hi> according as Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
declareth vnder the figure whiche he dyd ſet foorth this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<hi>For in Abrahams houſe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>there was an elder ſome called
Iſmaell, and he perſecute <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Iſaac which was the lawfull ſonne.</hi> Now then it
behoueth vs to be ſo handled and delt withal, that ſuch as haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but diſsimulation &amp; hypocriſie in them, which are but as ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardſhips,
and which are vtterly corrupt &amp; become ſtrangers, may
neuertheleſſe crake &amp; boaſt their fill, &amp; ſet vp their briſtles ageinſt
vs, as though we were vnworthy to kiſſe their feete. Suche maner
of men then muſt perke vp in all pride, and perſecute vs: but yet
let vs be conſtant ſayth S. Paule, and let not our fayth bee ſhaken
downe by ſuch loftineſſe, nor by the wiles that are caſt in our way
by thoſe hypocrites and falſifiers, which haue peruerted Gods doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine:
For in the ende the fame will happen too them (ſayth he)
which is reported of the houſe of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, namely, <hi>driue out the ſonne
of the bonde woman, for he ſhall not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

them ſelues to bee faythfull, and win needes bee taken to bee of
<pb facs="tcp:23060:248"/>
Gods houſholde, ſhall be cut off as rotten members, and not haue
any part or peece of inheritance there. And it is moreouer a righte
excellent leſſon, which conteyneth a very profitable admonition,
euen to confirme the thing which I haue touched already, which is,
that the pompes of this world muſt not bleare our eyes, to carie vs
away at a gaze when wee ſee great ſolemnities and gorgeous dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings.
If a man ſhould beleeue no further than he ſees, when the
Pope were in his Pontificalibus, he might bee taken for a God, he
hath ſo many knicknacks gliſtering about him. And no maruell
though many be amazed at it, as thoughe one had knocked them
on the head with a club, and become as good as brute beaſtes. For
why? men are ſo giuen to iudge fleſhly, that they bee worſe than
little children in things that concerne Gods kingdome. But yet
for all this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eholde, Sainct Paule ſayth, that they whiche haue the
primacie, and are al in all, and are dreaded of euery man, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
which beare the title of firſt begotten, are oftentimes but Iſmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
ſo as they be but baſtards, alledge they their elderſhip neuer
ſo muche. But if S. Paule were aliue at this day, that one texte of
his were inough too make him too bee burnte a hundred tymes.
For let men write and ſpeake as muche as they liſte, and they can
not more liuely decipher or bewray that the Pope and al his cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
are a heape of Iſmaelites and filthie baſtardes, whiche fighte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
God, and all his true and right begotten children, according
alſo as Moyſes hathe reported it. For what elſe alledge the Papiſts
for them ſelues, ſaue that it is not a day or twayne ago, or a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres ago that they haue had poſſeſsion: but that they haue
kepte their traditions and Ceremonies theſe eyght or nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres? But ſurely euen in this behalfe alſo they lye, and are
paſt ſhame. But put the cace that the world had not appayred theſe
eyght hundred yeres: yet notwithſtanding, that elderſhip of theirs
which they alledge, is not better nor of greater value than was the
elderſhip of Iſmael. Agayn, vnto their elderſhip they add alſo mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
ſaying, that wee be but a handfull of folke in compariſon of
them, they haue kings &amp; Princes on their ſide, the whole world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both great &amp; ſmal ſay as they ſay, &amp; the largeneſſe
of their kingdome ſtretcheth out far &amp; wide throughout al Europe
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:23060:248"/>
welneere, and into a peece of Affrike. VVhen they haue all this
for themſelues, very well, it is euen as the elderſhip of Iſmael. Nay,
it were more meete for them to haue begon at the other ende, that
is to wit, at the holding faſt of the pure doctrine of the Law &amp; the
Goſpell, without mingling any thing at all with it: for elſe it is a
generall concluſion, that there is nothing in them but corruptneſſe
and baſtardie. But they will not enter into this diſcourſe, that men
might knowe whither they be bacebegotten of Gods word or no:
for it is ſeene too manifeſtly alreadie. And in good fayth (as I haue
ſayd alreadie) vnder the name of the Church, they haue boldly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vpon them to diſanull and falſifie the whole worde of God.
Sothe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no bringing of the Papiſts to the true trial or touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
that men mighte diſcerne certenly whether they be Gods
children or no: but they ſtande proudly vppon their elderſhip as
Iſmaell did: they alledge that they are an infinite number, and wee
but ſprules as ye would ſay, and folk deſpiſed to the worldwarde,
which haue neither eſtimation nor credite. Thus yee ſee howe Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maell
ſpeaketh now a days by the mouth of the Papiſts. Now wee
for our part had neede to be armed with pacience: for it is a right
hard te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation, that they which are Gods deadly foes, ſhuld after a
ſort poſſeſſe the higheſt roomes in his houſe: &amp; that we ſhould be
hidden vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like corne vnder chaffe vpon a barne floore. This
is a hard &amp; irkſome plight. And ſurely we ſee many that giue ouer
the Goſpell through infirmitie. VVhen the poore ſimple ſoules
heere theſe ſo braue titles of Catholike Church, of Apoſtolike ſea,
of Vicar of Chriſt, of Succeſſor of S. Peter and S. Paule, of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
and of Biſhops: I ſay when all this gay geere is flaſhte oute
before the ſillie ſoules: they are amaſed at it, and conclude by &amp;
by, then muſt wee needes ſticke to it. For they bee rauiſhed at the
ſight of theſe vizors that ſerue to ſcare little children. But they that
haue any firmneſſe in them, &amp; iudge according to that which God
ſheweth them, are not at that poynt. And in good ſooth, when the
Papiſts ſay that they be the repreſenting Church, they ſay truely:
for in deede they make a godly repreſentation [reſemblaunce, or
ſhewe] that is too ſay, there is as it were a gaye gazing ſtocke: but
as the Prouerbe ſayth) all is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>de that gliſtereth. Therefore
<pb facs="tcp:23060:249"/>
they muſt bee ſearched to the bottome, to ſee if there bee truthe in
them or no. And ſo let vs marke what is tolde vs heere by S. Paul,
that is to wit, that it was not once only that there was an Iſmaell
in Gods Church to perſecute Iſaac: but that wee ſee the lyke at
this day: and that the children of God ſhall be borne downe and
trampled vnderfoote, by ſuch as haue no more but the bare title of
Elderſhip, and vnder that ſhadow beguyle the ſimple ſort, cloking
all their filthes &amp; foulneſſe vnder the pretence of gay colours. But
howſoeuer the world go, let vs prepare our ſelues to battell (ſayth
S. Paul) and let not our fayth quayle at the ſight of the pride of the
enimies of Gods truthe, yea euen of the houſholde enimies of it,
which are not as Turkes and heathen men, but keepe a gariſon in
the Church, and yet will needes be Prelates and more than greate
pillers of it. How ſoeuer the world go (I ſay) let vs not be abaſhed
for it, ſith we be fenced with the example of our father Iſaac, to the
intent we ſhould hold out ſtoutly, for aſmuch as we be regenerated
by the pure ſeede which God alloweth, whereby wee bee made his
lawfull children, and heires of his heauenly kingdome. But heere
a man might thinke it ſtrange that S. Paul ſhould ſay that Iſaac was
perſecuted of his brother Iſmaell.<note place="margin">Gen. 21. a. 8</note> For Moyſes rehearſeth no more
but that at the day when Iſaac ſhould be weaned, &amp; at the feaſt that
was made at it, Iſmaell laughed him to ſcorne. It is not ſayd that Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maell
layd any perſecution vpon Iſaac, for aught that is recorded
by Moſes: only it is ſaid that he beeing then of ſome age, &amp; thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to haue a much higher degree tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iſaac, bicauſe he was already
come to yeres of diſcretion, did laugh at him, &amp; mocke him. Nowe
if there were nothing more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſimple mocking &amp; laughter, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that S. Paul ſhould not terme it perſecution. VVe muſt mark
that the perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Gods children are not done, only by ſword,
fire, racking, impriſonment, or other torments of the body: but alſo
in that they be wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with the ſcornful reproches which the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers
and enimies of Gods truth doo ſpue out agaynſt them.<note place="margin">Pſal. 69. b. 10.</note>
And if we do wel practiſe the thing that is ſayd in the Pſalme, wee
ſhall not thinke the maner of ſpeeche ſtraunge which S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paul vſeth
heere. For where as it is ſayde, that the raylings whiche are caſte
foorth agaynſt Gods maieſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, ought too rebounde backe vppon
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:23060:249"/>
vs: it is to ſhew that we ought to be very tender harted or ſquey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
when we heere Gods name ſet light, or his honor diminiſhed
in any maner of wyſe. If any of vs bee touched in our good name
or honeſtie, wee will be angry and make a quarell of it: wee ſee that
for one croſſe worde, cholerike fellowes doo by and by draw their
ſwordes, and all is vnder colour that they muſte maynteyne their
honor and honeſtie. If a man ſpeake euill of our Parents or kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke,
we will be in ſuch heate and fumiſh paſsions, as wee can not
be appeaſed. Then if God be miſuſed, or his maieſtie diſhonored
in mens mouthes, aught we to ſuffer, and not to be moued to cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
and anger?<note place="margin">Pſal. 69. b. 10.</note> Euen for that cauſe alſo it is ſayde, that the zeale of
Gods houſe ought to eate vs vp, ſo as wee muſt not only bee wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
and ſory for the defacing of the maieſtie of our God, and
for the corrupting of the doctrine of ſaluation, and for the diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of his Church: but theſe things muſt alſo bite vs at the hart.
According heerevnto it is ſayd heere that Iſmaell perſecuted Iſaac.
If a man demaunde, what? had he neyther torture, fyre, nor ſword
to cut his throte? No, none of all theſe: but he ſcoffed at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
that had bin made concerning Iſaac. For it was ſayd expreſly,
Iſmaell ſhall liue: but yet is he not therfore heire of the promiſe,
Iſaac is he in whom they ſhall bee bliſſed. Yee ſee then that Ieſus
Chriſt, and conſequently all hope of ſaluation was cloſed vp in the
perſon of Iſaac.<note place="margin">Ge. 21. b. 12</note> VVhen Iſmaell did ſo diſdayne and ſcorne the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerein
welfare and happineſſe, that mockage of his wounded all
the children of adoption, &amp; all the faythfull, yea euen with a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtripe. Nowe then wee ſee what S. Paule mente, and howe wee
ought to put this doctrine in vre, which is, that wee muſt prepare
our ſelues to inwarde battels, knowing that not onely the Turkes
and Paynims ſhall bee aduerſaries of the Goſpell, but alſo the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
who too the vttermoſt of their power, doo deface the
doctrine of grace that is offered them in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte,
to aboliſhe all the dignitie and reuerence which wee ought to giue
vnto it in magnifying the mere bounteous goodneſſe of God, and
in acknowledging that all our whole welfare lyeth there. Let vs
bee ready (I ſay) too abide ſuche battels at the hands of our houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
enimies, whiche boaſt them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ues too bee Gods children,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:250"/>
which are aduaunced euen aboue vs, &amp; which outface vs with their
elderſhip, as who ſhuld ſay, that vnder the colour of that, we ought
too bee vtterly borne downe and ouerwhelmed. But there is yet
more: that is to wit, that we muſt be touched too the quicke, and
ſorie at the harte to ſee Gods doctrine ſo corrupted. True it is that
naturally wee ſhunne the harmes that come agaynſt vs, as bodily
perſecutions and ſuche other. But yet for all that, wee muſt not be
ſo wedded to this world, as not to preferre the heauenly heritage
before all things that we eſteeme moſt worthy to be deſired. And
therfore when ſoeuer Gods name is blaſphemed, &amp; when men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to aboliſhe the doctrine of life: let vs in thoſe caſes ſet ſuche
greef to our hart, as we can not beare with it, or at leaſtwiſe as if we
were perſecuted in our bodies. For he that ſhould cut our throte,
yea &amp; put vs to all the torments that were poſsible, as wee ſee the
enimies of the Goſpel do, whoſe rage againſt their poore brethren,
can not now a dayes be ſtanched with racking, burning, cutting out
of their tungs, and ſuch other like torments: all this aught not to
greue vs ſo much, as to ſee Gods name torne in peeces, &amp; ſcorned
by the wicked. For the very ſame is ſuch a cutting of our throtes,
as not only bereeueth vs of this flightfull and tranſitorie life, but
alſo bereth vs quite out of the kingdome of heauen. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods
doctrine is corrupted, then is foode turned into poyſon, lyfe into
death, and light into darkneſſe. So then let this texte of S. Paules
warne and exhort vs, not to be ſo giuen too the earth and too the
world, but that we may alwayes haue our minds &amp; vnderſtandings
lifted vp to the ineſtimable benefite that is offered vs by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and fight more earneſtly for that quarell, than for our owne
life. For truely a whole million of ſuch liues as wee haue here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
can not be comparable to the endleſſe life that is promiſed
vs in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Thus yee ſee wherin it behoueth vs to
exerciſe our ſelues, and we can not exceede meaſure in beeing too
angry, when we ſee wicked men blaſpheme God after that ſorte, &amp;
labour by their wiles and pollicies to ouerthrowe and to falſifie the
onely doctrine whereby wee liue ſpiritually. Furthermore let vs
marke alſo, how S. Paule addeth in the ende for a concluſion, that
all they which now a dayes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> boaſt themſelues ſo highly to be the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:23060:250"/>
Church, and ſpecially thoſe that haue the title of elderſhip, ſhall be
driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out as baſtard children. Therfore let vs not be beguyled with
al the pompes that are among thoſe which fight agaynſt Gods pure
truth, to maynteine them ſelues in their tyrannie by force, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
braggings, &amp; ſuch other like things: but let vs tarie the ende,
which is, that they ſhal be cut off, for they be none inheritors. VVel
may they dwell in the houſe, as it is ſayd of Antichriſt that he ſhall
ſit in the Temple of God: but yet muſt they needes be ſwept out
of it, as filth and vnclenneſſe. And although this bee not ſo before
men, but that it is hidden from vs for a time: yet let vs wayte tyll
God ſhewe his truthe more full, and vntill our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
confound his enimies with the breath of his mouth, and by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of his worde. Thus yee ſee how wee ought to be ſetled in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
conſtancie. And although we be now deſpiſed &amp; ſcorned,
yet let vs not ceaſſe to holde out in the holy calling of our God,
knowing that we ſhall not be diſappoynted, if we be grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the doctrine of the Goſpell, and reſt wholly thervpon till God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
the things that are nowe hidden, &amp; that wee be throughly
gathered vnto him, and finde that it was not in vayne that we were
trayned vp in his pure worde, giuing ouer all the fancies of men, &amp;
not ſeeking life elſewhere than in the ſeede wherby wee were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
agayne, and in the foode whereby wee bee ſuſteyned and
nouriſhed to the ende.</p>
            <p>Nowe let vs fall downe before the maieſtie of our good God,
with acknowledgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our ſinnes, praying him to make vs feele
them in ſuch wiſe, as it may leade vs to true repentance, that wee
may mourne continually before his maieſtie, and bee ſo abaſhed in

without ſwaruing to the right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or to the left, but only folowing

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue ſeene heeretofore, that to haue a ſtate
of continuance in the Churche, wee muſte bee
grounded vpon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
doo boaſt themſelues to be Gods children,
who notwithſtanding are not begotten of the
true ſeede, which maketh the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wherby
God auoweth and acknowledgeth vs for his
children. Therfore if we wil be truly knit to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
we muſt hold faſt the doctrine of the Goſpell, that he as our heade
and mediator may ioyne vs to God his father. Therwithall I haue
declared that the cauſe why S. Paul ſpeaketh ſo of bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; free ſeed,
is for that they which ſeeke their righteouſneſſe in their owne ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
do alienate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his grace.
For by that meanes they bind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to an impoſsibilitie, that is
to ſay, to ſatisfie God in keeping his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements. But there is
ſuch weaknes in vs, as none of vs is able to perform the leaſt point
of the law: and therfore much leſſe can we attaine to the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that is ſhewed vs heere. And for that cauſe S. Paul co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that we muſt ſtand faſt in the freedome which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
hath purchaſed for vs. It is certayn that he treateth heere of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of the law: but yet muſt we always reſort to the welhead
and cheefe poynt. For if the matter concerned no further than the
keeping of a holyday, or the forbearing of ſome kinde of meate:
it were not of ſo great weigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, that ſuche ſtrife ſhould bee moued
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:23060:251"/>
for it in the Church. But Sainct Paule pored not vppon a matter ſo
ſlight and of ſo ſmall importance. He had an eye to the doctrine: he
conſidered that if me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be tyde to do this thing or that thing
of neceſsitie: it were an excluding of them from the hope of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For if I muſt needes performe a thing vnder peine of deadly
ſinne: then if I fayle, I am become a tranſgreſſer, and there is no ſhift
for me bycauſe God is my iudge, and I muſt be fayne to come too
account, and there is no meanes to redeeme me. Now it is certaine
that al of vs are ſubiect to the keeping of the law: but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
there is a remedie for it, which is to runne vnto our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt in all our needes, who was made ſubiect to the law to
purchace vs freedome, and bare our curſe to diſcharge vs of it. Now
if any neceſsitie be layd vpon vs againe, too ſay that the doing of
this or that is ſinne: then cannot our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſtand vs in
any more ſtead as I ſayde afore: by reaſon whereof we muſt needes
bee plunged in our owne curſedneſſe, without any manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe.
Therefore it is not without cauſe that Sainct Paule exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the Galathians to hold their owne, and not too ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to be brought into bondage. For by that meanes he faith that
they ſhall be bereft of ineſtimable benefyte, euen ſo farre foorth as
they ſhall be falne quite away from Gods grace or fauour, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ſeparated from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in whome lieth all our
welfare and happineſſe. Now, that wee may the better conceiue S.
Paules meening, and alſo reape the frute that is offered vs in thys
text: Let vs marke, that by this word <hi>Libertie o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> freedome,</hi> it is meant
that we may walke with full confidence before God, and that hee
will alwayes be fauorable, ſo that although wee bee giltie of many
offences, yet we ſhall be quit of them for our Lord Ieſus Chriſtes
ſake: and moreouer that it is not in mans power to bridle vs or too
hold vs in bondage: but that it ought to ſuffiſe vs to yeld ourſelues
obedient vnto God, howbeit not after a ſlauiſh and conſtreyned
faſhion, but as children yeeld themſelues ſubiect too their father,
knowing well that their father will not handle them roughly. Thus
ye ſee what is meant by the worde libertie or freedome whiche S.
Paule vſeth. Neuertheleſſe to the end that this ſhortneſſe bee not
darkſome: I will declare it more a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ge. So long as we be in doubt
<pb facs="tcp:23060:252"/>
whither God do loue vs or hate vs, there will always bee trouble
and vnquietneſſe in our conſciences, and we ſhall be as it were loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
vp in priſon. So then there will be no freedome in our mindes,
till we know and be throughly perſwaded that God is at one wyth
vs, and that he receiueth vs into his fauoure &amp; grace, though we be
not worthy of it. But it is impoſsible for vs to haue any certeintie
of it, except we haue our quittance alwayes before our eyes, which
was made vs in the death and paſsion of our Lord Ieſus Chryſte.
VVhy ſo? For as I ſaid afore, we be indetted vnto God many wais,
yea infinite wayes. For we be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to keepe the law, and we breake
it a hundred times a day, yea euen or euer we thinke of it. Again we
offend euen in groſſe faultes. But howſoeuer we deale, we cannot
aſſure ourſelues of Gods loue, vnleſſe wee bee diſcharged againſte
him of the obligation of euerlaſting death wherein we ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d bound.
Now we atteine that benefyte when we be perſwaded by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
that the bloud of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was ſhed to waſh away
al our ſpottes, and that his death is a ſufficient ſacrifiſe too appeaſe
Gods wrath, and to wipe out the remembrance of al our offences
&amp; iniquities. Ye ſee then that the way to ſet vs free, is to know that
God receiueth vs to mercie for our Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake, &amp; that
our faults &amp; ſins ſhal not hinder vs to find fauor alwais in his ſight,
or to haue familiar acceſſe vnto him, as children haue vntoo theyr
fathers. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly we muſt not be wauering too &amp; fro, to make co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of euery thing that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deuiſe of their owne heads: but walke
ſtedfaſtly according to gods word, knowing moreouer that our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces
are free, &amp; that whither men co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand or forbid any thing, it
is nothing to vs, I meene as in reſpect of the ſpirituall regiment of
our ſoules: For we talke not heere of ciuil policie nor of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
life of men, but of our ſaluation. So then, all things ought too
bee free vntoo vs when they bee not forbidden vs by Gods owne
mouth. Yet is it not ynough that we haue Gods word for our guide
without mingling any thing at all with it: but (as I haue touched al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readye)
we muſt therewithall know, that God accepteth our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
when he ſeeth vs willing to obey him, and that although there
be much faultineſſe, and ouer many infirmities in vs, and that we
come halting vnto him, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that all that euer wee doo were

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
he taketh al in good woorth. And why? For he beareth with
vs as a father with his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That therfore is the freedom wherein
we muſt ſtand, except we wil be ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our lord Ieſus Chriſt
For (as I haue ſayd alreadie) if we beleeue not aſſuredly that God
loueth vs, though we be vnworthie of it, and that his louing of vs
is bycauſe our ſinnes are buryed by the death and paſsion of oure
Lord Ieſus Chriſt: what will become of vs? what ſhal Ieſus Chriſte
boote vs? Ageyn if we be in doubt and vnquietneſſe, not knowing
whether God accept our ſeruice or no, and therwithall be bounde
to the keeping of this or that at mennes appoyntment, the intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
of our ſelues in ſo many debatyngs will neuer ſuffer vs too
haue any reſt. Neyther is it without cauſe that Saint Paule hauing
exhorted the faythfull to continue in the freedome that was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
them ſo dearly, addeth, <hi>that Ieſus Christe ſhall not profite them
at all,</hi> vnleſſe they know the thing that he hath purchaſed for them,
<hi>and ſuffer not themſelues to be in any wiſe bereft of it by men.</hi> Nowe we
ſee heere, that the freedome which Sainct Paule ſpeaketh of, is not
to giue vs leaue to doo what we our ſelues thinke good, as though
he layd the reynes of the brydle vpon our necke: and that will he
alſo proteſt in place conuenient. Then intendeth he none other
thing, than that we might ſerue God quietly without greef of mind
without conſtreint, and without any continuall tormenting of our
ſelues with diuerſitie of debatings &amp; doubtfull ſcruples as wee ſee
the vnbeleeuers do, namely ſuch as haue not their truſt wholly ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
vpon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Therfore beſides that which hath
bin ſayd alredie, we haue to mark further, that the end of that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is, too bee able too carie a cheerfull and quiet minde before
God. For without that, wee ſhall neuer haue the hart to obey him,
but wee ſhall alwayes bee in trouble, and not bee able too call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
hym, which is the cheefe ſeruice that he demaundeth and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
of. VVe ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that this matter concerneth the cheef point
of oure welfare, if it bee well vnderſtoode. VVhen wee ſpeake
now a dayes of Chriſten libertie: the Papiſtes ſay wee go aboute
too aboliſhe all the ordinances and traditions of the Churche, and
that we paſſe not what commeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſo euery man may liue as he
<pb facs="tcp:23060:253"/>
liſteth, to eate fleſh on all dayes alike without let, and to deſpiſe all
other ſuch ordinances. But their ſaying ſo, is bycauſe they neuer
knew, that it is no obeying of God, vnleſſe it be done with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtreyned
will. For let the Papiſtes be throughly ſifted all the
packe of them, yea euen the deuouteſt of them: and it is certayne
that they chafe vppon the bitte, when they tyre and ouerlabour
themſelues moſt to ſerue God. For all that euer they do is but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly:
and if they could plucke their heads out of the collar,
they would full fayne do it. Furthermore when they haue toyled
after that faſhion in their fond deuotions, they beare themſelues
in hand that God ought to like well of it. And if a man tell them
that they cannot do any thyng that God ſhoulde accept, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
that although their works were good, yet they deſerue
not aught before hym: ye ſhall ſee them ſpew out their poyſon (as
they do) and fall to blaſpheming of God vnleſſe yee beleeue them
that they be able to worke wonders by their owne merites. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
the cace ſtand, they are neuer able to know and to taſt what
it is to obey God. For why? they vnderſtand not what it is too bee
quiet: namely that it is an vnconſtreyned offering of their doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
vnto God with a free hart, and an aſſuring of themſelues that
he accepteth the ſame, euen bycauſe he handleth them gently, and
beareth with them as with his children. The Papiſts know not this,
and therefore it is not too be wondered at, though they thinke it
ſtraunge that we ſhould ſtriue for that freedome, for they wote not
what it meeneth. But yet doth not Sainct Paule ſpeake it without
cauſe: and by thoſe words we ſee how precious that libertie is, and
that it is not a thing to be deſpiſed. For Ieſus Chriſt did not ieſt in
hys death and paſsion when he offered vp himſelfe vnto God hys
father: but wrought a worke that in excellencie and worthineſſe
paſſeth the creation of heauen and earth. Now if Sainct Paule
bring in this libertie for an excellent frute purchaced to vs by the
death and paſsion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: it muſt needes followe
that it is a high and precious thyng. And to the intent wee may
conceyue what the nature and power of it is: wee muſt learne too
gather in ourſelues vnto God when wee bee ſpoken to of it. As
for example: if we be commanded or enioyned of neceſsitie too
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:23060:253"/>
do ſuch a thing or ſuch a thing: very well, the doing thereof too
the worldward hindereth not our freedome before God: for the
thynges that concerne common policie may bee bidden or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
bycauſe that otherwiſe they might turne too the hurt of the
common weale, or elſe ſuch things may be expedient, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt
one of vs ſerue anothers turne in common. Therefore let vs haue a
regard of the things that concerne the policie, bycauſe it behoueth
vs to be knit and vnited togither, and to haue ſuche an onement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vs, that euery of vs ſerue his neighbours turne, and none of
vs be addicted to himſelfe. But when the cace concerneth the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
libertie: then muſt euery of vs draw home into himſelfe, too
conſider the nature and propertie thereof. Euery of vs (ſay I) muſt
draw home himſelfe as it were before God. For our account is too
be made to the heauenly iudge, and therefore it behoueth vs too
enter into ourſelues, to ſay thus: How may I preſent my ſelf before
Gods iudgement ſeate? If my life come to be tried by the lawe: wo
worth me. For I am giltie after ſo many ſorts, yea euen withoute
number, that if I ſhould ſuffer a Million of deaths, it were too little
for the offences that I haue committed. Neuertheleſſe God will be
fauourable to me, and take me to mercy for our Lord Ieſus Chriſts
ſake, and when I reſort to him, I may come with my head bolt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
as hauing my quits eſt and cleere diſcharge, which was gyuen
me in the ſacrifiſe that he offered vp for vs, bycauſe that therein hee
hath made full ſatiſfaction for me, and ſet me at full libertie. Marke
this for one point, that I muſt ſerue God, and it is good reaſon that
I ſhould dedicate my life vnto him. But at which end ſhall I begin?
I cannot bring ſuch perfection as is requiſite, no nor the hundreth
part of it. Yet for all that, God beareth with me, and ceaſſeth not to
take the things in good worth which are vnperfect and weake, yea
&amp; ſinful too. And why doth he ſo? Bycauſe he admitteth me as one
of his children for our Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake. After thys manner
(ſay I) muſt we come before God, if wee will conceyue and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the frute of this libertie or freedome that Sainct Paule trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
of. Now whereas he addeth, <hi>that wee ſhoulde not wrappe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
agayne in the yoke of bondage:</hi> thereby he ſheweth, that before
we be come to the faith of the Goſpell, and do know what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte
<pb facs="tcp:23060:254"/>
is brought vs by the death and paſsion of the ſonne of God,
wee bee all hild in ſtreyt bondes like priſoners, and haue not any
freedome or libertie at all. And in very deede, were it not that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt maketh interceſsion, and is a meane betweene God hys
father and vs: it is certaine that our mindes ſhould be in continual
torment and vnquietneſſe. For there is none of vs all but he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted
to be more than giltie, and therfore we ſhould needes ſtand
at a ſtay as drowned in diſpaire, till we were ſuccoured by our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt and knew that God will be fauorable to vs, &amp; thervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
could find peace and aſſurance to call vppon him, as knowing that
Ieſus Chriſt wil be there aforehand. On the otherſide, if we knowe
not that God hath ſo receiued vs into his fauor, as he is contented
with our willingneſſe to obey him, and with our comming towards
him, though it be with infirmitie: we ſee yet another halter that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
to hang vs withall. But yet ſo is it with all vnbeleeuers S. Paul
therfore doth purpoſely warne vs, that vntill ſuch time as the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
haue taught vs that God loueth vs, and of his own free good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
taketh vs as his children, and moreouer wil not haue vs to be
ouertroden by mens tyrannie, and ſpecially that he deliuereth vs
from the bond and rigor of the Law: we are all of vs drowned in
bondage, and that when Ieſus Chriſt hath once ſet vs free, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs to maynteine well ſuch a benefite. Now let vs come to the
reaſon that he addeth, <hi>Verily</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>I Paule, yea euen I do tell you,
if you bee circumciſed, Ieſus Chriſt ſhall profite you nothing at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> It is a
very ſore ſaying that circumciſion ſhould cut men off in ſuch wyſe,
as they ſhould haue no part in the ſaluation that is purchaced for
vs by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. But firſt of all wee muſt marke, that
when as S. Paule ſpeaketh heere of Circumciſion, he looketh not at
the thing in it ſelfe, but vntoo the ende of it, bycauſe the deceyuers
that had peruerted the pureneſſe of the Goſpell among the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
made them beleeue that they ought too bee circumciſed,
too the ende too keepe the Lawe. Sainct Paule ſtandeth vpon that
poynt, and ſayth, that if wee doo ſo conſtreyne and bynd our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
before God, or enter intoo ſuche couenant with him: Ieſus
Chriſt ſhall profite vs nothing at all. And this is well worth the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
For when as wee nowadayes doo ſay, that is a helliſhe Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:23060:254"/>
for men to commaund the keeping of a thing vnder pein of
deadly ſin, or to forbid a thing bicauſe them ſelues like not of it: (as
the commaundement of keeping the Lent, or the ſhiruing of mens
ſinnes once a yeare:) if we ſtriue againſt ſuch things, the Papiſtes (as
I ſaid) caſt foorthe their deſperate rage, without conſidering of the
cauſe that moueth &amp; conſtreineth vs to ſtand vpon that poynt and
ground. For why? they looke no further than to the outward thing.
But it behoueth vs to go further. For when the Papiſtes command
a thing vnder paine of deadly ſin: it is a bynding of vs in ſuch wyſe
as we may not haue Gods fauor but vpon condition of dooing our
duetie in that poynt. And he that ſhall haue ſo done his dutie, he I
ſay ſhall haue as it were bound God vnto him, yea truely after the
diueliſh opinion that reigneth in poperie, which is that wee muſt
earne grace by our own deſerts, and alſo that we muſt pacify Gods
wrath and wype out the rememberance of our ſinnes and offences
by making amendes. VVherby it appeereth well, that if wee can ſo
diſcharge our ſelues, then is Ieſus Chriſt made vnauailable too vs,
and he ſhal profit vs nothing at all. For why? Ieſus Chriſt cannot be
our rightuouſneſſe, except we ſeeke the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes
in the ſacrifize of his death, &amp; therwithal be wel aſſured that God
is our father, to the end wee may call vpon him with quiet conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
bycauſe he hath adopted vs in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. It is
true that the deceyuers which had beguyled the Galathians, could
well haue found in their hart that Ieſus Chriſt ſhoulde haue bin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
and called the Sauiour of the world. And they did ſo
mingle the law with the Goſpel, as yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding Ieſus Chriſt
ſhould haue had his titles ſtill. But they made a coparcinerie, that
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on their ſide ſhould deſerue, &amp; that by that meanes God ſhuld
bee appeaſed. As if they had ſayde, that Ieſus Chriſt ſupplyed mens
wants: howbeit after ſuch a ſort, as the wretched conſciences were
alwayes out of quiet. The lyke dealing is at thys day in the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
And the Pope with all the rable of his Clergie, differ nothing
at all from the couſiners ageynſte whom Sainct Paule incounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
heere, ſauing that thoſe couſiners did put foorth theyr owne
inuentions and would haue had them too preuayle vnder the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
and authoritie of Moyſes Lawe. They then ageinſte whom
<pb facs="tcp:23060:255"/>
Sainct Paule diſputeth, ſayd, we muſt keepe ſtill Circumciſion, we
muſt needes be circumciſed ſtill. And to what purpoſe? to the ende
wee may diſcharge ourſelues towardes God, and bee accepted
at his hand for doing of our duetie. VVhereto then ſhall Ieſus
Chryſte ſerue? He ſhall ſerue for to fill vp a voyde roome: for hee
is not vtterly vnprofitable: but when men haue ſo diſcharged and
cleered themſelues, then if there bee any want, Ieſus Chryſte
ſhall ſupply that. After that manner did thoſe Couſiners ſpeake,
whiche were Sainct Paules aduerſarie partie. And what ſayes
the Pope? Hee ſayth that in ſted of the Ceremoniall lawe of
Moſes, wee muſt keepe his ordinances, and the thyngs that are
decreed by Councelles, or by thys man or that man: and that
the ſame byndeth vs vppon peyne of deadly ſinne, ſo that if we
offende God, wee muſt make him amendes for it by our owne
ſatisfactions, and not by the things that God hath commaunded.
For the amendes that we muſt make is not any of the thynges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
by Gods lawe: but an addition of an ouerplus of oure
owne deuice beſydes, and ſo are wee diſcharged to Godwarde,
and God muſt needes take it a woorth. VVee ſee then that the
Pope holdeth the ſame diueliſh foundation whiche thoſe Couſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
laboured too bring in. Howbeit that thys is yet woorſe, that
whereas they inforced the law of Moſes whiche ought too beare
ſome ſway: the Pope bringeth in his owne inuentions, and the
forgeries of his owne brayne. But contrariwiſe Sainct Paule ſayth
that Ieſus Chriſt ſhall profyte vs nothyng at all: when we wil nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
indent with God after that faſhion. And why? For it is all one
to pull Chriſt in peeces, and too giue him but the one halfe of that
which belongeth fully and wholly vnto him alone.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1 d. 30.</note> He is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs to
be our rightuouſneſſe, &amp; he is called our peace, &amp; what betokeneth
the word Rightuouſneſſe?<note place="margin">Eph. 2. c. 14</note> That God accepteth vs freely for oure
Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake. Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if we ſay that we win Gods fauor
by our own deſerts, and that Ieſus Chriſt is but a ſupplyer of wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts:
is it not a rending of him in peeces, and a diſmembering of hym as
much as in vs lyeth? But that cannot be done nor ſuffered. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is giuen for our ſatiſfaction or amends<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making:
for there is none other meanes to ſet God and vs at one,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:23060:255"/>
but by knowing that we bee quite and cleane diſcharged, and freely
quit of the bond of endleſſe death. For if wee thinke to ranſome our
ſelues by our owne deſertes, and ſay that if there be any want in vs,
Chriſt ſhall make it good as a ſmall matter: it is a flat mockerie, and
that is in no wiſe to be borne with. VVe ſee then that the cauſe why
S. Paule telleth vs that Ieſus Chriſt ſhal profit vs nothing, is that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſhould not beguile themſelues in deuiſing a newe Ieſus Chriſt, that
ſhould do but halfe his dutie: for we muſt receyue him in ſuch wiſe,
as he is giuen vs of God his father. Now he is giuen vs with condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that we ſhould rid our ſelues of all ſelftruſt, and reſort wholly
vnto him, and furthermore that it ſhould ſuffice vs to haue him too
be our head, and thervpon ſerue God his father, offering him al that
we haue, and aſſuring our ſelues that although the ſame all bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
yet notwithſtanding howſoeuer we fare, it fayleth not to bee
taken in good part, bicauſe the adoption that is gone afore, &amp; grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, maketh vs and our workes to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
accepted of God, vs (I ſay) that are nothing woorth, and our
workes that are but pelting traſh, and yet notwithſtanding God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them in good worth, bicauſe he looketh not what wee bee, or
what we do, nor vpon the qualitie or quantitie of our workes: but
only looketh at this, that we come vnto him as members of his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſonne, reſting wholy vpon the ſacrifice whereby he hath redemed
vs. And therefore S. Paule for a larger confirmation addeth, <hi>that he
proteſteth and witneſſeth, that he which is circumciſed is a detter of the
performance of the whole lawe. For</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>Ieſus Chriſt is vnauailable,
when folke will needes iustifie themſelues by that meane.</hi> VVee haue a
declaration cleare and eaſie ynough of the things that Paule hathe
ſayde: and wee muſt marke it well, bicauſe it is hard too perſwade
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Ieſus Chriſt is vtterly vnauaylable, when they go about to
make him vnauylable in any part. For although the Turkes and
other Heathen folke neuer knewe what Ieſus Chriſt is: yet haue
they had an opinion fully lyke the Papiſtes, and a man ſhall finde
them to be both of one ſtampe. For there were neuer yet any hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in the world, which haue not bin of opinion that they could
not ſatiſfie God: and yet they haue gloried in their owne workes,
beleeuing that their ſaluation or welfare proceeded of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:256"/>
The Heathen men then did alwayes beare themſelues in hande,
that they were able to purchaſe grace, and too deſerue ſomewhat
at Gods hande. And therevppon they offered Sacryfices, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not that the ſame were a figure of Ieſus Chriſt, but yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
the worlde went, they thought too make ſome ſatiſfaction
or amendes. Euen ſo alſo did the Iewes, when they had once mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and corrupted the true meening of the Lawe. As much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
doo the Papiſtes at this day, fully reſoluing that God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
theyr dooings, and that hee is in a maner bounde too them
ſo too doo. Let them then bargaine with him too allowe of theyr
dooings, though they doo amyſſe. For they bee ſure ynough that
they can not make ſatiſfaction too the full, nor in all poynts: but
yet on the other ſyde they ſay, that they can doo more than God
hath commaunded and that that ſhall ſerue for recompence and
payment. Nowe foraſmuch as it is ſo harde a matter too perſwade
men, that Ieſus Chriſt will not ſerue their turne by halues: it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs on hand to marke this Text ſo much the better, where Saint
Paule ſayth, that whoſoeuer is circumcyſed is a detter of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the whole Lawe. VVhen Saint Paule ſpeaketh after that
ſort of Circumciſion, wee muſte marke that hee talketh not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Gods firſt inſtituting of it: for too what purpoſe did God
giue it vntoo Abraham? Hee gaue it him as a ſeale of the rightu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
of fayth,<note place="margin">Ro. 4. b. 11.</note> and ſo dooth he himſelfe ſay in the fourth too the
Romanes. Therefore the Circumciſing of Abraham, was not too
make him a detter of the performance of the whole Lawe: but
contrarywiſe, too aſſure him of the forgiueneſſe of his ſinnes, and
that God accepted him for one of his children, for oure Lorde
Ieſus Chriſtes ſake. Yee ſee then that Circumciſion did ſet our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Abraham at full libertie. VVhy then did hee take it? Bicauſe
God gaue it him as a recorde and Sacrament of his free goodneſſe.
But contrarywiſe, thoſe agaynſte whome Saint Paule reaſoneth,
tooke Circumciſion as a meritorious worke, and thought therby to
deſerue at Gods hande: they entered intoo a kinde of bargayning
with him, as if they ſhoulde ſay, verie well, I am beholding to you
for ſuch a thing, and I haue done this or that in recompence of it.
Therfore whenſoeuer we fall to indenting after that ſort with God:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:23060:256"/>
we become detters of the performance of the whole Lawe. As if he
ſhoulde ſay, yee muſt not bargaine in this cace: men muſt not beare
themſelues in hand that they can partly binde God, ſo as he ſhould
of right bee in theyr dette, and bounde of neceſsitie to take them
into his Paradice for dooing this or that for him. No no (ſayth Saint
Paule) wee muſte go more ſubſtancially too worke, wee muſt not
fall to bargayning with God, to ſay that he bindeth vs to performe
the whole Lawe, and that we binde him to giue vs euerlaſting life.
If we come to that poynt, wee bee detters of the whole Lawe. To
bee ſhort, Saint Paule ſtryueth heere agaynſt the diueliſhe errour
that reigneth in the Popedome. They terme it a parting rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that is too ſay, a rightuouſneſſe that commeth partly of gods
grace, and partly of meritorious workes. And why ſo? For it is wel
knowne that there was neuer yet man in this worlde, that perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Gods Lawe, and that doth experience ſhewe too much. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
then as the Papiſtes (as ſhameleſſe as they bee) doo knowe
well ynough (as I ſayde) that it is too manifeſt a thing, that men are
not able to keepe all the Lawe: they ſay, we mainteyne not that we
bee fully rightuous in all poyntes, but wee ſay that Ieſus Chriſt is
partly our rightuouſneſſe and redemer, and wee our ſelues
doo partly deſerue well by our owne woorkes. Fie, fie, ſayth Saint
Paule, whoſoeuer falleth too indenting after that faſhion, too ſay
that hee wyll earne aught at Gods hande, or make hym anye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
ſo as hee wyll play the hyreling wyth him, and make
him as it were his detter, as if he woulde ſay, I haue done thys,
and therefore thou ſhalt pay mee that: hee maketh himſelfe a det<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the whole, and they bee but fonde imaginations wherewith
men deceyue themſelues, thinking that God muſt be faine to take
what they will giue him, and to releaſe them all the reſt. As for
example, if a man bee bounde too pay a hundreth Crownes, and
muſte needes pay and deliuer them, and yet notwithſtanding ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth
that his creditor ought to content himſelfe if hee bring him
but foure florens, and ſay vnto him heere ſir, take this vpon further
reckening, and afterwarde bring him halfe a dozen or halfe a ſcore
mo, &amp; (to be ſhort) do with much ado make vp the thirde or fourth
part of the principal, &amp; beleeueth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> he is by that meanes quite &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:23060:257"/>
cleane diſcharged: is it not (think you) to lewd an vnthankfulneſſe?
For beholde, his freend opened his purſe to helpe him in his neede,
and ſpared not himſelfe to ſuccour him: and yet for all that he will
be diſcharged for bringing I wote not what, and for ſaying, here ſir,
take this in ful payment, whereas all that he bringeth is not a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the whole ſumme. Men ſee wel that this were but a mockery:
what then ſhal become of ſuch as will needes enter into accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with
God to deſerue at his hand? For God auoweth that whoſoeuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth
not all the things that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned in the law, ſhal be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and S. Paule hath alledged the ſame text. VVherto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth god
bind vs in his law? To performe it to the full. And who is able to do
that? Ther is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is able to fulfil any one point of it with ſuch
perfection, but that there ſhal alwayes be ſomwhat amiſſe. And now
what do theſe hypocrites which think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to haue ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe
in their own workes? They bring this and that, &amp; wil nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
be rightuous in part. But God accepteth no ſuch dealing, for he
will not vnſay this diffinitiue ſentence which hee hath vttered with
his owne mouth,<note place="margin">Deu. 27. d. 26.</note> Curſed be he that fulfilleth not all. Thus yee ſee
wherevpon S. Paule ſtandeth here, when hee ſayth that whoſoeuer
is circumcized, is a detter of the whole law. As if he had ſaid, Let not
men beguile themſelues any more, for God walketh not two wayes
at once, he hath tolde vs in his Lawe, that if wee diſcharge not our
ſelues fully towardes him, wee ſhall be curſed. But there is not any
man that diſchargeth himſelf, therefore yee ſee we bee all accurſed.
VVherefore there is none other remedie but to reſort [wholly] to
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. For if wee thinke too make Ieſus Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaylable
in part, and therewithall too holde ſtyll ſomewhat of our
owne dooing: it is a deceyte: for wee muſte needes confeſſe that
there is nothing but curſedneſſe in vs, till our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt
haue releaſed vs, and that wee had neede too ſeeke our wantes in
him, in ſuch wiſe, as wee may acknowledge all our owne woorkes
to bee nothing woorth, no nor any better than filth before God, till
hee receyue vs for hys children, that wee may walke in freedome
of conſcience, knowing that oure ſinnes are forgiuen vs by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the ſatiſfaction that is purchaſed for vs, ſo as God imputeth
not our ſinnes and miſdoings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to vs, bycauſe hee looketh vpon vs
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:23060:257"/>
in the perſone of his onely ſonne. Thus yee ſee howe Saint Paule
proueth that which hee had ſayde afore: that is too witte, that Ieſus
Chriſt ſhall not profite any of all thoſe which are circumcyzed. For
why? If they ſeeke the hope of their ſaluation in their owne workes,
they muſte diſcharge themſelues throughly and wholly towardes
God, and not pelt him out with gobbets and morſels as they ſay, but
fulfill the whole Lawe without myſsing any one iote of it. And who
is able to bring that to paſſe? For take me the holyeſt and perfecteſt
man that euer coulde bee founde, and he cannot do the hundredth
part of that which is commaunded him. Yee ſee then that men are
diſappoynted of the hope of ſaluation, if they come not voyde and
altogyther emptye of all theyr owne merites, and giue themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
in ſuch wiſe too our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: as they acknowledge
that they cannot bee iuſtifyed by hym and by his grace, except
they haue firſt renounced all that euer may holde them backe in
the truſt of any other thing. And furthermore, whereas Sainct
Paule ſpeaketh heere of beeing circumcyzed: hee meeneth the
errour which the deceyuers did ſet forth, in thinking to binde God
to them, and to fulfill the whole Lawe. As if it ſhoulde bee ſayde
nowadayes, that all ſuch as keepe the Popes ordinaunces, do ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
the authoritie of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Not that a man is
damned for not eating of fleſhe vppon Frydayes, or in Lent tyme:
but if hee forbeare the eating of fleſhe for ſuperſtitions ſake, and
thinke to merite by ſo dooing: it is certaine that he renounceth our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. For Chriſt is giuen vs to be our Aduocate, ſo
as wee bee reconcyled too God his father by his meanes, and hee
hath ſo ſet vs free, as hee will not haue vs too bee oppreſſed any
more with the traditions of men. But they which keepe the Popes
traditions, bearing themſelues in hande that it is deadly ſinne too
taſte fleſhe vppon any ſuche day, and that in forbearing it they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
too well at Gods hande, and that they bee good ſatiſfactions,
yea and that Ieſus Chriſt is well honoured by doing of this or that:
I ſay if they acknowledge that, they doo alſo beleeue that the gate
of Paradiſe ſhoulde be ſhet agaynſt them if it were not opened them
by that confeſsion, and they thinke it to be the meane to make their
attonement with God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:258"/>
Nowe in making themſelues too beleeue that, it is certaine that
they make themſelues detters as I ſayd afore, and forſake the grace
that was purchaſed by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Now we ſee how we
muſt profite our ſelues by this doctrine: namely firſt of all we muſt
vnderſtande that God hath tolde vs by his Goſpell, that [wee ſhall
bee welcome] as oft as we come too him, conditionally notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that we be not ouercombred by wauering too and fro lyke
windeſhaken Reedes, but bee able too call vppon him freely, and
with open mouth, as vpon our father which hath adopted vs to bee
his children. Secondly wee muſt vnderſtande that the meane too
bee in his fauour, is too haue him too forgiue vs our ſinnes. And
why? Bicauſe Ieſus Chriſt hath made ſatisfaction for them, and
vtterly diſcharged vs of them. Thirdely, wee muſt vnderſtande
that this is not done to the intent too lay the brydle looce in our
necke, that wee might fall a ſcoterloping, and playe the wylde
beaſtes, ſo as God ſhoulde not tame vs: but rather too the intent
wee ſhoulde repayre vntoo him with a good courage, to obey him
freely. For if wee were not ſure that he taketh vs for his children,
and beareth with vs ſo gently, that the things whiche are nothing
woorth are taken in good woorth at his hand, for the fatherly loue
which he beareth vs: ſurely wee ſhall doo nothing but gnaſhe our
teeth when wee intende too ſerue God. But if wee bee perſuaded
that God caſteth ſuch a fauour towardes vs, that although wee be
full of infirmities, and cannot doo any thing that may deſerue too
bee well lyked at his hande, yet hee accepteth vs for our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſtes ſake: muſt it not needes giue vs courage as thoughe
our ſayle were ſet vp, and wee had the winde on our ſterne. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is certaine that our heartes muſt needes runne ſwiftly as a
ſhippe that hath the full winde vppon hir ſayles, when wee knowe
that wee are in Gods fauour, and that hee accepteth our woorkes,
and intendeth not too bynde vs too any bondage, but is contented
too take vs for his children, and accepteth oure willingneſſe too
obey his. Now then, when we be once ſure of that: we may ſerue
our God with the better courage, and bicauſe wee bee grounded
vppon his grace, it will cheere vs in ſuche wiſe, as wee ſhall offer
him the ſacrifice of prayſe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Nowe let vs fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God,
with acknowlegement of our faultes, praying him to vouchſafe to

we be once come vnto him, we may perſiſt in the fayth of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
without ſwaruing aſyde in any wiſe, and that he may ſo ſuſtein

true repentance, too ſigh and grone before him, till hee haue taken

For the falſe packers that had partly corrupted the doctrine of the
Goſpell in the Church of the Galathians, ment too mingle the one
with the other: that is to wit, that Ieſus Chriſt is giuen vs to ſupplie
our wantes, and yet notwithſtanding that wee ceaſſe not to be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
in part, by indeuering to do well. For they did not vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, neither ſayd they that all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
wherein God telleth vs that he wil of his goodneſſe forgiue the
faithful their ſinnes, are deceyt and mockerie: but their intent was
that men ſhould labor to iuſtifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, that is to ſay, to purchaſe
fauour at Gods hand by their owne workes. And foraſmuch as wee
be farre from perfection: they ment that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould ſupply
it as a ſecond remedie: that was their ſurmize. Likewiſe nowadayes
in Poperie, they will not with ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mouth vtter this blaſphemie that
Ieſus Chriſt ſerueth vs to none other purpoſe, but too teach vs the
will of God his father: they will afoorde to ſay that he hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
vs and purchaſed the ground of deſeruing for vs, for he hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
vs the gate of Paradice too enter in at, and alſo that his
death and paſsion do dayly profite vs, too reconcile vs vntoo God
dayly when wee haue offended him. But howſoeuer the worlde
go, they will haue vs too deſerue or earne the kingdome of heauen
in parts, and to redeeme our ſinnes by diuerſe meanes, and thereof
ſprang all their ſatiſfactions, and finally that if a man cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
all during his life, the reſt ſhall bee fulfilled in Purgatorie.
Thus yee ſee howe Ieſus Chriſt hath but halfe a place with them in
receyuing vs vnto God, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the meane while they ſhoulder

him in ſuch wiſe, that freewill, merites, workes of ſupererogation or
ouerplus as they terme them, and ſuche like things runne away at
leaſtwiſe with the one half of our ſaluation. But S. Paule telleth vs
that God liketh no ſuch partenerſhip. For either we muſt bring ſuch
a full performance of the Lawe as God may be contented with: or
elſe yeeld our ſelues giltie. If there bee neuer ſo little a fault, all the
reſidue deſerueth nothing at all. For (as I haue declared) God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
not ſaluation too ſuch as doo him halfe ſeruis, or too ſuch as
ſerue him after a ſorte: but to ſuch as keepe his Lawe throughout.
He that dooth all the things ſhall liue:<note place="margin">Leuit. 18. a. 5. &amp;. Deut. 27. d. 26.</note> and contrarywiſe he that
performeth not all ſhall bee curſed. But it is ſo that no man dooth
the things that are required and commaunded in the Law. For what
good zele or will ſoeuer wee haue too ſerue God, there is alwayes
much feebleneſſe in vs, and wee go too him halting and make many
falſe ſteppes, yea and oftentimes wee happen to ſteppe aſide and too
go aſtray: and ſo are wee all ſhet out from the promis of ſaluation
as in reſpect of our own workes, and the curſe wayteth for vs, which
we cannot eſcape. For who is ſo farre ouerſeene, as to take vpon him
that he hath performed the whole Lawe? Then if all of vs be found
giltie of offence againſt God: wee be as good as vtterly vndone, till
our Lord Ieſus Chriſte reach vs his hand. Therefore it followeth
that wee muſt forget the rightuouſneſſe of the lawe, and lay it vnder
foote, ſo as it may bee vtterly aboliſhed, and therevpon that wee go
naked too our Lord Ieſus Chriſte for remedie, confeſsing our owne
pouertie, and not beyng aſhamed too bee defaced with all reproche
before God, that we may be clothed againe with his glorie. Thus ye
ſee in effect what we haue too gather vpon this text, where S. Paule
ſayeth that Ieſus Chriſt is made vnprofitable, if men hope to iuſtifie
themſelues by the Lawe. For it hath bin too common an errour in
all ages, that at the firſt ſetting forth and firſt brunt, men will needes
pay God all that is due too him, and in the end ſeeke ſtartingholes
when they ſee no power nor abilitie in them too doo it. VVell ſay
they, though wee cannot doo all, yet will wee do ſomewhat. But in
this cace it is not for vs to follow our owne imaginacions: for God
will iudge vs according too his owne woorde. Therefore let vs not
recken without our hoſt, as the Prouerb ſayes, by making our ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:23060:260"/>
beleeue that God will accept what we think good: but let vs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that Ieſus Chriſt cannot boote vs at all, except wee ſeeke the
fulneſſe of our ſaluation in him. For it is not ſayde in the Scripture,
that the father hath giuen vs him as a help to obtaine our ſaluation:
but that he is giuen vs to be our rightuouſneſſe and lyfe. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
then that in our own ſelues there is nothing but wickedneſſe &amp;
endleſſe death, til we haue recouered the thing in Ieſus Chriſt, which
wee loſt and were vtterly bereft of in Adam. And theſe twoo things
are ioyned here togither: namely <hi>that Ieſus Christ profiteth vs not at
all, and that wee be fallen from grace,</hi> according as in very truth, all the
grace or fauour that we muſt finde at Gods hand, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to
vs by the meanes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And it is a very notable
poynt. For euery man will well ynough graunt that we muſt reſort
vntoo God, bycauſe he is the welſpring of all welfare. But in the
meane whyle the moſt part of men wander in their own windlaſſes,
and in ſtead of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vntoo God, do go from him, as it is too bee
ſeene in the Papacie, where wretched hipocrites &amp; the ignorant ſort
ſay that their gadding after their Sainctes and puppets, &amp; their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in their fooliſh deuotions, is to get Gods fauour.
But in the meane whyle Ieſus Chriſt is let alone, and no man makes
accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of him, but they rather hie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſome ſtocke or ſtone which
they call their Lady, than to the Sonne of God. And wherof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
this? Euen bicauſe they know not how God hath giuen vs his grace,
nor after what maner he will haue vs too ſeeke it, nor what way and
order it behoueth vs to hold. Therefore when we be once through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſolued that God is our father, &amp; alſo know perfectly that what
ſoeuer we haue neede of he will haue vs to draw it from out of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who is as a ſpring that was vnder the earth, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
is opened and floweth abrode, that euery man may take his
fill of it: then (ſay I) do we know that Gods grace cannot bee dray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
drie, but yet dooth it not come at vs, but by the meanes of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Too bee ſhort, let vs marke that all that euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
too our ſaluation is ſo put intoo the perſone of Gods onely
ſonne: that he alone muſt ſuffize vs, and we go ſtreyght vnto him,
and take all our contentation there. And as I ſayd afore, let vs keepe
our ſelues from this imagination of thinking to purchace any thing
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:23060:260"/>
by our deſertes, for it ſeparateth vs vtterly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
Nowe herevpon S. Paule addeth, <hi>that wee wayt for the hope of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe
by fayth in the ſpirite.</hi> It ſerueth to confirme that which he
hath ſayd heretofore, concerning the diuerſitie that is betweene vs
and the fathers that liued vnder the Lawe. For howe was Abraham
receyued intoo fauour, but through fayth? Yet notwithſtanding he
differed from vs in one thing. For in aſmuch as Ieſus Chriſt was not
yet diſcouered: Ceremonies were giuen him, and many mo were
added at the publiſhing of the Lawe, according too the neede which
the people had too bee ſo led and guyded. Too bee ſhort, the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of all ages haue euer ſought their whole rightuouſeneſſe in the
grace of God. Neuertheleſſe they were helped by the Ceremonies
and ſhadowes, bycauſe the Goſpell was not yet ſo reueled vntoo
them as it is vntoo vs, nother was Ieſus Chriſte (who is the very
pledge of rightuouſneſſe) made yet ſo manifeſt. But nowe lette vs
come too that which Sainct Paule ſayeth. He ſetteth heere the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
now adayes among the Chriſtians, to exclude all figures and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
as if he ſhould ſay that it ought too ſuffize vs that the Sonne
of God is appeered too vs for our rightuouſneſſe, and therefore wee
muſte let go the Ceremonies, bycauſe the ſhadowe were needeleſſe
now adayes. And not in this Texte alone dothe Sainct Paule match
the woorde ſpirite agaynſt the ſhadowes of the Lawe. Truly when
God in old time did ordeyne Circumciſion, Sacrifices, and ſuche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, it was not too ſet folke at a gaze heere bylowe: for all
things that are contayned in the Lawe are in very deede ſpirituall.
There was a patterne of them ſhewed too Moyſes on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne.<note place="margin">Exod. 25. d. 40.</note>
            </p>
            <p>So then it is certayne that the fathers had a ſpirituall beleef as
well as wee, ſo as they knewe they were not waſhed and made
cleane by three or foure droppes of water: nor reconcyled too God
by the ſacrifizing of a Calfe or of ſome other brute beaſt: but that
oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſte was their onely waſhyng and clenzing,
and that hee by the Sacrifyze of his deathe had diſcharged them
quyte, or at leaſtwyſe ſhould, bycauſe the thyng was not yet done,
but the Fathers looked aloofe at the thing which was not yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clozed.
And moreouer it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> without cauſe, that the ſayde
<pb facs="tcp:23060:261"/>
woord <hi>[Spirit]</hi> is ſet downe heere, to ſhewe that the fathers could
not imbrace the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, but by the meanes
whiche our Lorde had ordeyned for the time. Therefore when any
man had done amiſſe, he came with a ſacrifice, to acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
woorthie of death before God: not too ſeeke his attonement in
a Calfe, or in a Sheepe, or in any ſuch other thing: for that was too
bee had in Ieſus Chriſte: but yet was it of neceſsitie that the figure
of him ſhould go before. As much is to be ſayd of the waſhings and
of the reſidue of thoſe things.<note place="margin">Col. 2. c. 17.</note> In theſe dayes we haue the body (ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
S. Paule) and therfore the ſhadowes are not requiſite any more.
If a man were preſent before mine eyes: would I ſeeke too knowe
him by his ſhadow? That were to darkſome a dealing: and if I might
behold him in the face, what a doltiſhneſſe were it for mee too turne
away from him, and to go ſeeke ſome tracinges too know him by?
Euen ſo is it now adayes with ſuch as turne backe agayne to the old
figures. They turne their backes vpon Ieſus Chriſt, knowing not that
the rending aſunder of the veyle of the Temple at his death, betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that all the auncient figures were aboliſhed, and that wee at this
day may enter intoo the heauenly Sanctuarie, from the which wee
were as good as ſtraungers before. To bee ſhort, S. Paule ment heere
too declare, that his condemning of the Ceremonies of the Lawe, is
not to condemne the fathers that vſed them, nor God that was the
author of them, but to ſhewe that wee in theſe dayes haue the truth
and ſubſtance of them: and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently that the things which were
ſhadowed heeretofore, are no more ſo, and therefore that wee muſt
content our ſelues with Ieſus Chriſt, who hath brought all perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
with him. Thus muche concerning the Ceremonies of the Lawe.
Now whereas S. Paule ſayeth that wee wayte for the hope of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe
in ſpirite: he vſeth a kinde of ſpeache that may ſeeme
ſtraunge: for what is ment by wayting for the hope of rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?
Let vs marke, that heere S. Paule intended to drawe vs away
from all things that are to bee ſeene in this worlde. For bycauſe wee
bee too muche inclyned and ſubiect too ſticking faſt heere by lowe,
when wee haue any thing for our ſenſes too reſt vppon, ſo as wee
cannot lift vp our mindes aloft, and bycauſe that men are too fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
they euer couet too haue al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:23060:261"/>
God purpoſeth to trie our obedience, by referring vs too his pure
and ſingle woord. And we do then honour him aright, when we ſhet
our eyes at all theſe outwarde things, and holde our ſelues ſatisfied
with Gods will whiche he hath ſhewed too vs, thinking our ſelues
to want nothing when wee haue that. For this woord <hi>wayt</hi> betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that we perceyue not by eyeſight the thing that wee wayt for,
(according as it is ſayd in the eight too the Romanes,) and ſo much
the more, bycauſe the woord <hi>Hope</hi> is added to it. Therefore it is as
much as if S. Paule had ſayd: Verely my freendes, if a man would
go about to know the rightuouſneſſe of Chriſtians, (that is too wit
that they be Gods children, that they be heyres of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly life,
and that God accepteth them as if they were Angelles without ſpot
or blemiſh) I ſay if a man woulde know this after a worldly maner:
he ſhould deceyue himſelf. For wee ſee that the faythfull are deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
folke, men vouchſafe not too looke vpon them but a skew, they
beare a lowe ſayle to the worldward, and (to be ſhort) there is nother
pompe nor outward ſhewe in the rightuouſneſſe that wee obteyne
by our Lord Ieſus Chriſte. For wee ſeeke not eſtimation when wee
ſay, that before God wee cannot reſt vpon any thing but his meere
mercie, and that all our deſeruings hang vpon his meere grace, and
that we muſt go out of our ſelues to haue Ieſus Chriſt as the ful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of all goodneſſe and welfare. VVhen wee ſpeake after that
faſhion: it is not to vaunt our ſelues, but too confeſſe our ſelues to
be full of all reproche, ſo as all our worthineſſe is but dung and filth,
and all our woorkes vnclenneſſe, and that wee ſhould bee lothely in
Gods ſight lyke wretched Lazermen that are full of ſores and
botches, if wee were not ſo waſhed and clenzed by the bloud of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that God did like well of vs by his meanes. Now
then the rightuouſneſſe whiche ought too reigne among the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
is not a thing full of pompe, nor a thing that is greatly gazed at
and commended [of the world]: no, but it is vtter wretchedneſſe.
And therefore S. Paule ſayeth heere, that when the world laugheth
at our ſimplicitie, bycauſe they ſee vs hope after that faſhion in our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and euery of vs humbly abace himſelf euen to the
dungeon of hell, too the end wee may bee lifted vp by the grace of
God too the kingdome of heau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>: although the worldlings doo
<pb facs="tcp:23060:262"/>
mocke and skorne vs for it, yet muſt wee holde on ſtedfaſtly, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our ſelues that wee ſhall not be diſappoynted. For wee knowe
with whom we haue left our gage in keeping, namely euen with him
that hath promiſed too call vs too ſaluation. Therefore let vs walke
on in the ſayde fayth, and imbrace Ieſus Chriſt, and when wee haue
him, let vs ſet light by all the reſt. Let vs not do him the diſhonour
and wrong, too ſhrink away from him into a corner, and too make
him ſerue our turne but in part: but let vs acknowledge that we be
iuſtified throughly and in all poyntes by his meanes. Now herevpon
a man might yet make a queſtion, and ſay: VVhat I pray you, were
the Ceremonies commaunded in the Lawe without cauſe why?
Truely Sainct Paule hath anſwered this matter ſufficiently already.
Howbeit for aſmuch as men are ſlowe in reſoluing of matters that
concerne the holding faſt of Gods pure truth: therefore he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
newe againe, that there is difference betweene vs and thoſe that
liued before the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte. Alſo he had
a conſideration too ſtoppe the mouthes of many raylers: for if a
man preache Gods meere mercie in Ieſus Chriſte: by and by ſome
Maſtife curres or other fall too barking, and caſte foorth ſtore of
ſlaunders, as is to be ſeene yet ſtill at this day. For if wee condemne
the Diueliſh ſelftruſt wherewith men beguyle themſelues, in wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
too obtaine ſaluation by their owne deſertes: ô how ſo ſay
they? that were a condemning of all good woorkes. And after that
maner doo the hypocrites now adayes ſlaunder the doctrine of the
Goſpell whiche we beare abrode, as though wee ment to giue leaue
and licence too doo euill, that there might bee no more difference
betwixt vice and vertue. Againe if wee tell them that their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
are but pelting baggage, and that the more they take pryde
in them, the more abhominable they be before God: ô, how ſhould
that bee ſay they? Behold, theſe fellowes would aboliſh all religion:
and what a thing were that? Shall God be no more ſerued and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored?
ſuch is the ſpeach and talke that is vſed now adayes by thoſe
curredogges, which cannot abide that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhould
be the only foundacion whereon to ſettle the truſt of our ſaluation,
nor alſo abide that wee ſhould bee gouerned by the pure and alonly
woord of God. And for that cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> S. Paule ſayeth here, <hi>that in Ieſus
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:23060:262"/>
Christ there is nother Circumcizion nor vncircumcizion, but fayth that
worketh through charitie.</hi> In ſaying that there is nother Circumcizion
nor vncircumcizio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Ieſus Chriſt: he meeneth that Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Ceremonies was but for a time, &amp; that we muſt alwayes
haue an eye wheretoo he tended, namely that he ment to mainteyne
the people in hope, bycauſe Ieſus Chriſte was not yet appeered too
the world. For if they had not had waſhings, and Sacrifizes and ſuch
other like things: they would haue bin diſmayed, and the frayltie of
man is ſuch, that they would haue quite quayled a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred thouſand
times. And therfore although they ſaw not yet fully how they ſhould
be ſaued: yet notwithſtanding they had therein as it were liuely pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
&amp; lookingglaſſes, where they might behold the grace of god.
Thus ye ſee how the ſhadowes and figures ſerued but for a time. So
then S. Paule declareth,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. d. 19.</note> that he wil not in any poynt diminiſh the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of God who had ſtabliſhed that Law among the Iewes, nor
alſo ſay that all thoſe things were fruteleſſe and vnauaylable: but
that wee, (nowe after that our Lord Ieſus Chriſte is manifeſted,) are
come to the fulneſſe of time, and therefore that wee muſte haue no
more veyles to keepe vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beholding him face to face, according as
he is ſet foorth to vs in the Goſpell. For whenſoeuer the Goſpell is
preached vnto vs, it is all one as if we ſaw Gods ſonne crucified pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
before vs, or as if wee ſawe his bloud ſtreaming downe, for ſo
much as wee be beſprinkled with it by the power of the holy Ghoſt,
as ſayeth S. Peter in his firſt Epiſtle. So then ſeing that our lord Ieſus
Chriſt hath by his death and paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> opened vs the way whereby wee
may come to God his father: it is not for vs to buzie our ſelues any
more about the things that were apointed for the time of his abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
It is true that he dwelleth not now adayes in the world: but yet haue
we his Goſpel, which is the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al things that are neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; therfore it is as good as if he were crucified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
vs,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. a. 1.</note> as S. Paule hath ſayd already. Now that we haue the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of theſe wordes <hi>in Ieſus Christ,</hi> that is to wit, that the Goſpel
is preached: let vs come to this addition of his, that there is nother
circumcizion nor vncircumcizion: that is too ſay, that thoſe things
muſt hencefoorth ceaſſe, and men muſte reſte onely vppon charitie.
And wherefore doth S. Paule add the woord charitie. Too ſhewe
<pb facs="tcp:23060:263"/>
that Chriſtenfolke will not be idle, and that they haue ynough too
occupie themſelues about, though they keepe not the figures of the
Lawe. For albeit that it was Gods meening to leade the people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Ieſus Chriſt, in ordeyning the Sacrifizes, circumcizion, and all the
reſidue: yet notwithſtanding men beyng of themſelues corrupt,
marred all. And truely the Iewes were of opinion, that they bound
God too them in offering vp ſacrifize: but it was cleane contrarie.
For he that offered ſacrifize, did there paſſe a recogniſſance to binde
himſelf ſolemnly to curſedneſſe, as if he ſhoulde ſay, I am woorthie
of death, in token whereof a poore beaſt is heere killed and hath his
throte cut: and is it the beaſt that hath deſerued it? no, it is I. Yee
ſee then that a man might there behold his owne ſinfulneſſe, like as
alſo it behoued him to ſeeke his ſaluation els where than in himſelf.
Lo I pray you how the figures ought to haue brought folke too ſuch
a lowlineſſe, that all men from the greateſt too the leaſt ſhould haue
condemned themſelues, and therevpon imbracing the grace of our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, haue reſted themſelues wholly vppon that. But
now adayes in the Popedome there is a like deceytfulneſſe vſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed, in
ſo much that men do falſifie all that God hath ordeyned. As how?
Looke vpon Baptiſme, looke vpon the Lordes Supper, which were
inſtituted to the end that wee ſhould come and proteſt before God,
that wee holde all things of him. VVhat is there in Baptiſme? It is
ſhewed vs there, that wee muſt die in our ſelues. And why ſo? euen
bycauſe there is nothing but frowardneſſe and curſedneſſe in vs, ſo
as we bee the children of wrath, and vtter ſtraungers vnto God. Yee
ſee then in Baptiſme a man is vtterly ridde of all his truſt in himſelf.
In the Supper wee come to ſeeke our life in Ieſus Chriſt: and ſo are
wee ſtarke dead both the wayes. Yet for all this, the Papiſtes weene
theſe things too bee meritorious workes. And that is the cauſe why
they by the Helliſh abhomination of their miſchieuous Maſſe, haue
falſified yea &amp; vtterly defaced all things that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
had appoynted. For ſuch a woorke euen as it is done by man, or the
very working of the deede, that is too ſay, the very doing of it as it
commeth and proceedeth of man, muſte (ſay they) of neceſsitie bee
meritorious. But therein wee ſee a manifeſt falſhood. Howbeit S.
Paule ment to go yet further, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>buking the hypocriſie of ſuche as
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:23060:263" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are ſo much giuen too theſe outwarde things: the lyke whereof is
ſtill at this day in the papacie. It is true that theſe miſerable wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
take great peynes too ſerue God: they trotte vp and downe
without ende or meaſure: but what doo they? They martyr them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in vaine things, and ſuch as God neuer required, but vtterly
miſlyketh: and yet in the meane whyle, there is nothing but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie
in all their dooyngs. For what doth the deuouteſt perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, but only make much babling and mumbling? He muſt
heere Mattins in the night, and two or three Maſſes in a day: He
muſt gad on pilgrimage, and faſt the Lent and Sainctes euens: He
muſt keepe all the apes toyes that haue bin appointed at the deuiſe
of men. And what are all theſe things? Surely if men put their truſt
in them, they bee diueliſhe deuiſes: but although there were none
other harme in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſauing that euery man followeth his own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginacions:
yet are they but gewgawes and Apes toyes before God.
And why? For he loueth obedience better than all ſacrifices. But if
wee will obey God: wee muſt ſerue hym after a ſpirituall manner,
and not with theſe chyldiſhe playing toyes. Nowe let vs come too
that which S. Paule ſayth, <hi>Circumciſion</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>is nothing: but faith
that woorketh by charitie.</hi> Hereby he betokeneth that although Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonyes
bee layd aſide, wee haue ynough too occupie our ſelues
with, in dooyng the things that God commaundeth: that is to wit,
that all the perfection and holineſſe, of the faythfull conſiſteth in
charitie. That is the fulfilling of the Lawe, that is the ende and
ſhooteanker wherevntoo God bringeth vs. Therefore if wee haue
charitie, let vs not thinke that wee bee vnoccupyed. But nowe a
dayes if a man rebuke the ſuperſtitions of Poperie, and skorne
them, ſaying, Go too, yee haue much baggage amongſt you: when
yee come at Churche yee beſprinckle your ſelues with holiwater,
yee kneele down before a puppet, yee skud from alter to alter, ye
do this and that, and to be ſhort there is an endleſſe hotchpotch of
al maner of gewgawes among you: and poore ſoules as yee bee,
thinke yee that theſe things wyll go for payment? No, for God
will not allow any of them. They reply vnto it agein and ſay, why
not? Shall God bee no more ſerued? VVhat ſhall wee doo for
hym? Verily it ſeemeth to them that vnleſſe they go to Maſſe, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:23060:264"/>
bee ſhriuen, and pay ſome raunſome, and doo one thing or other,
there is nothing at all doone. And in deede we ſee how they leaue
the principall vndoone. For euen they that are the deuouteſt of
them, will not ſticke at all, ſome too keepe whores, ſome to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
God, and ſome too robbe and ſpoyle other men, in ſo much
that if they which pretend greateſt holineſſe can finde occaſion too
pill and poll their neybours, they will byte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the bones. Their
crueltie ſhall be ſo exceſsiue, that they ſhall bee brute beaſts rather
than men. Therevnto they bee full of ſuttletie and wylineſſe. It is
nothing with them too forſweare themſelues, if they may beguile
any man by it. For they nuzell themſelues in all kynde of leawd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
bearing themſelues in hand that God muſt ſerue them for a
cloke when they fall once too making of faire countenances, that it
may bee ſaide they bee deuout or holy folke.<note place="margin">Math. 21. b. 13.</note> Yee ſee then that this
hypocriſie is as a denne of theeues, as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
termeth it. And it is an ordinarie matter for men to forget the
cheefe principall, when they giue themſelues to Ceremonies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
alſo as our Lord Ieſus vpbraydeth them,<note place="margin">Mat. 15 a. 3.</note> ſaying: for your

And for the ſame cauſe it is ſayd in the fifth Pſalme. Thinkeſt
thou that I will drinke the bloud of brute beaſtes? If I bee hungrie
(ſaith God) thinkeſt thou that all is not myne? This is the thing
that I would haue thee to offer vntoo mee, namely the ſacrifice of
praiſe.</p>
            <p>Now we ſee Paules meaning. He mocketh the hypocrites which
thinke that all is mard if there bee not ſtore of gawdes, and gew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gawes
when men ſhould go vntoo God, and that they may not go
to him as it were with banner diſplayed. According whervnto wee
ſee how they pranke vp things with pompe, of lampes, perfumes, &amp;
tapers, gay diſguiſed cotes, puppets, and ſuch other things. VVhen
they haue this geere once, to their owne ſeeming they bee ſo well
cloked, that God knowes no more what they doo, and that their
vices are well ſheltred vnder ſuch ſhadow: and yet for al that, they
doo but ſpite him openly. Now S. Paule laugheth that opinion too
ſcorne, ſaying, that although we haue none of al thoſe pomps, there
is ynough beſides wherwith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> God to keepe vs occupied, &amp; that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:23060:264"/>
is charitie. But to be ſhort, S. Paule ment to tell vs heere, that Gods
ſeruice is ſpirituall. For when wee loue our neybours, it is a token
that we loue God. I meane when we loue them according to Gods
ordinance. For it is no loue too loue a man for our owne profites
ſake, but to loue euen our enemies, ſo as we be patient to beare the
wrongs that are done vs, ſo as we ſtreine ourſelues to do good too
ſuch as haue neede of our help, and ſo as none of vs be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
nor to his owne peculiar profit, but that we indeuer as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers
of one body to helpe eche other as much as is poſsible. If wee bee
once at that point, then doth our life ſufficiently anſwer for vs, and
witneſſe that wee loue God. But wee cannot loue him before wee
know him. Therefore is charitie an infallible ſigne and token that
wee be willing to ſerue God, not in paying him with chaffe in ſted
of corne, but by louing our neybor truly and vnfeinedly. And ſo let
the Papiſtes brag as much as they liſt of their gewgawes and gay
ſhewes wherewith they thinke to couſin God, as it were to make
a mockingſtocke of him: yet ſhal the thing that is vttered heere by
S. Paules mouth ſtand alwayes ſure, that is too with, that ſuch things
are naughtworth before God. And why? For if Circumciſion were
aboliſhed when the time and terme of it was expyred: what ſhall
become of the things that haue bin fooliſhly and malapertly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the ſhoppes of mens owne fancies, which tooke vpon them
that which belonged not too them, nor was by any meanes lawfull
for them to doo? Yee ſee then what wee haue too beare in minde.
But before wee go any further, we muſt aſſoyle a doubt which the
Papiſts caſt heere. For to their ſeeming it maketh wholly on their
ſide when S. Paule ſayth, that fayth which woorketh by charitie is
the thing that maketh all the faythfull perfect. And therevpon they
conclude, that onely faith dooth not purchace vs grace, but fayth
and charitie matched togither. Put the cace it were ſo: whereto
would it ſerue them? For wherevpon doo they ground their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
but vpon childiſhe toyes? as who ſhould ſay they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
God with a Rattle: but S. Paules meaning is farre otherwiſe.
For although he haue hitherto ſhewed the true way how too bee
in Gods fauour: yet notwithſtanding he mindeth not too ground
our rightuouſneſſe or our hope <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:265"/>
VVhat then? It is ynough for him too ſhewe that God can finde
meanes ynow to keepe the faithfull occupyed, although they haue
no Ceremonies, wherewith the hypocrites beguile themſelues, in
making that their principall. To bee ſhort, we ſee that S. Paule is ſo
farre off from fauoring the Papiſts any thing at all, that he fighteth
directly ageinſt them Nowe vnder the colour of that which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
heere, they haue imagined that faith is but a ſingle knowledge
that there is a God, and that his only ſonne Ieſus Chriſt is come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world for the redeeming and ſauing of mankynd, notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that the ſame knowledge bee without any affection, more
than if a man ſhould tell vs ſome ſtorie, and we ſhould beleeue it &amp;
hold it for a certeintie. After that maner doo the Papiſts ſpeake of
faith, &amp; ſay that when faith is all alone, it hath not yet hir ful ſhape
before God: but when it is ioyned with a hartie good wil &amp; loue of
God, then is it full faſhioned ſay they. But when the ſcripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to vs of faith, it meaneth the knowledge that is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs by the
holy Ghoſt: not which flittereth in our owne braine, but which is
ſealed in our harts, in ſuch wiſe as God muſt needes haue wrought
wonderfully in vs, before we can haue bin inlightened &amp; faſhioned
in faith: for there is nothing but darkneſſe in our minds. The lyght
muſt come from aboue. Agein wee bee vtterly inclyned to diſtruſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and therfore the holy Ghoſt muſt be faine too ſet this ſeale vpon
vs, that wee bee throughly ſaued by the meanes of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt. Furthermore it is not ynoughe too knowe generally that
Chryſt is our Redeemer: but fayth importeth that euery of vs
muſt acknowledge him too bee hys Redeemer. And is that poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
too bee vnleſſe our Lorde Ieſus doo dwell in vs and reygne in
vs, and that wee bee inflamed with the loue of hym too gyue
ourſelues wholly vntoo him? The Papiſts therfore neuer wiſt what
faith meaneth, notwithſtanding that they chatter of it not altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo well as Pyes in a Cage, which doo yet vnderſtande ſome
woordes heere and there: but they ſhewe ſo ſhamefull a beaſtli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
as they may bee gazingſtockes of Gods horrible vengeance,
in that they haue ſo forgotten the whole Phraſe of the holy Ghoſt,
and haue no more skill of the holy ſcripture, than a Paynim or a
Turke that hath bin alwayes in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:23060:265"/>
God the father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. Lo in what taking the
Papiſts are. Now then let vs marke well, that S. Paule hath not here
imagined a ſhapeleſſe or vnfaſhioned fayth as they doe: nor ment
too ſet downe charitie as the cauſe of our righteouſneſſe: but onely
intended to ſhew that we haue inough to ſerue God with, without
ſnarling of our ſelues in a ſort of pelting trifles. Howbeit, that wee
may fare the better by this texte, (for wee muſt nowe come too
an ende, and the tyme wyll not ſuffer vs too proceede any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
if the Papiſtes nowe adayes doo make their bragges that they
haue a more apparant ſeruice of God than wee, and a ſeruice that
hath a gayer gloſſe: let vs on our ſide bee well aduiſed that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpyſe
euerywhit of it. For why? God will not bee ſerued after me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
lykings. Marke that for one poynt. Beſydes this, the things which
the Papiſtes call Gods ſeruice, are pelting trifles imagined and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in their owne brayne, ſo that it is all reiected, notwithſtanding
that men doo greatly delight in them and lyke well of them. And
therefore let vs haue an eye too ſerue God as he commaundeth.
VVherin wil he haue vs to be occupyed? Not in needeleſſe things:
but he will haue a true tryall of vs, which deceyueth not. And what
ſhall that bee? To walke vprightly and faithfully with our neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
euery of vs to helpe where neede is according to his abilitie:
that no man be giuen wholly to himſelfe: that wee be truſtie: that
we deale ſoundly and faithfully: that wee liue peaſably: and that if
wee ſee any man deſtitute of ſuccor and too ſtand in neede of our
helpe, wee in that caſe doe as it were offer a ſacrifice vntoo God,
knowing that he calleth vs too it, to ſhew what loue we beare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
him. For if we loue not our neybours which are as it were
viſible groundes too worke kyndneſſe vpon, howe ſhall wee loue
God (ſayth S. Iohn in his Epiſtle) whom wee ſee not,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 4. d. 20.</note> and which is
abſent from vs and hath no neede of any thing? Therefore if wee
wyll ſerue God well: let vs learne too yeelde him ſuch obedience
as he lyketh of: that is too ſaye, let vs walke in ſuche faythfulneſſe,
and freendlineſſe as none of vs beguyle, fleece, or ouerreach hys
neyghbour: and moreouer that wee not onely abſteyne from all
wrongfull or wicked dealing:<note place="margin">Math. 23. c. 23.</note> but alſo that all ſuche as are called
Chriſtians, do well bethinke them of our Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſaying,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:266"/>
which is, Curſed bee you that haue your ſeuerall deuotions alone
by your ſelues, and occupy your heads about ſmall trifles, making
conſcience of euery thing, and yet in the meane whyle leaue the
principall poynts of the lawe vndone, that is too wit, faithfulneſſe,
Iuſtice, rightuouſneſſe, and mercie. As if he ſhould ſay, Is it not a
ſtraunge thing that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould ſo mocke with God, making a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to honour him, as though they tooke him but for a babe?
God wil haue me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to walk faithfully and vprightly, he wil haue eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pitie &amp; to ſuccor the needie, he wil haue no man to do his
brother wrong: and behold, they on the contrary part will needes
buzie themſelues about Mooneſhine in the water, and things of no
valew. They will bee full of crueltie craft and maliciouſneſſe: and
yet thinke to pacifie God with things of nothing. Therefore let vs
learne to ſerue God with charitie, that is to ſay, let vs learne to giue
ourſelues to the things that he calleth vs to, &amp; to hold ourſelues as
it were at a ſtay too the rule which he giueth vs by his woord. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we walk vprightly after that faſhion, we muſt not for
mens ſakes forget God. For (as I ſaid afore) that is the thing wherin
he trieth our charitie: and by that meanes we ſhew the reuerence &amp;
loue that we beare towards him. And therfore we ceaſſe not to call
vpon God when we loue our neyghbors, nother intend we to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
God vnder colour of doyng them ſeruice, but he is alwayes
our marke on whom we haue our eyes faſtened. Neuertheleſſe, too
conclude, like as wee indeuer to liue as God commaundeth by his
word, and paſſe not for the gawdies, gewgawes, and Ceremonies of
the hypocrites, but walke rightly in pureneſſe of life, and in al faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
and vpright dealing (as I ſaid erſt) knowing neuertheleſſe
that when we haue done all, it ſerueth not to iuſtifie vs or too pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace
vs fauor in his ſight, and that although wee be ſure that he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in good worth the willingneſſe which we haue to honor hym,
yet his ſo dooing is but bicauſe he accepteth vs in our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, (as I haue declared heretofore) &amp; bicauſe we repoſe the truſt
of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in him. Euen ſo alſo ſhal we walk in charitie &amp; labor
to diſcharge our duetie, knowing that by reaſon of our feebleneſſe
we be not able to come neere that which God pointeth vs to, but
yet that we be in the way thitherward, &amp; that he muſt be faine too
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:23060:266"/>
take vs to mercy, wherupon we doubt not but that all our workes
do like him wel, when they be ſo dedicated too him by the blud of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: for he is the true preeſt that offereth vp our
oblations &amp; maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> acceptable to God, &amp; he muſt be faine to
ſtep in, to make our works pleaſant to God his father, ſpecially ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our prayers &amp; the very prayſes which we yeeld vntoo
him ſhould be but filthineſſe, if they were not purified by our Lord

we offer vp vnto God the Calues of our lippes, that is to ſay, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
of praiſe wherby he is glorified.</p>
            <p>But now let vs fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God

it may bring vs to true repentance, and that wee may ſeeke all our

in vs, that being vtterly brought downe, &amp; hauing put away al falſe
preſumptuouſneſſe wherewith wee may bee deceiued, wee may not
tend to any other end than to be receiued through the mere mercie
of our God, ſo as we may come to the euerlaſting inheritance, and
in the meane while indeuer to walk in ſuche wiſe in his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
as it may pleaſe him to beare with our frailtie, till he haue

for vs too liue by, that if wee giue eare too his
word, wee ſhall not be ſubiect to walking at ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
but ſure to hold the right way. And that is
a thing wherein the faythfull differ from the
faithleſſe. For all ſuch as ſubmit themſelues to
Gods word, are not in any doubt or diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with themſelues, whither their doyngs are allowable or no: for
who hath power too iudge of that matter but onely God? But he
hath giuen his ſentence alreadie. So then foraſmuch as mans life is
lykened too a race: let vs learne too followe whither ſoeuer God
calleth vs, and then ſhall wee not ſtray as wretched wanderers that
do greatly ouertrauell and tyre themſelues without any profit. And
for that cauſe alſo doth Sainct Paule in this text ſet downe a dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
race, the one good which hath a right direction, and the other
wandering and vncerteine. Now it is not ynough for men too take
great peynes: but they muſt alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame at a certeine end. Moreouer
we ſee herewithall a true difference betwene the race that is to bee
counted good, and the race that doth but ouerlabor men in vayne.
For S. Paule layeth them foorth certeinly and infallibly, ſaying that
all ſuche as obey the truth doo runne well. Lo heere a ſaying of
greate weyghte. For therevppon wee may gather, that when
menne bee gyuen too theyr owne fancies, or walke only by geſſe,
or receyue all that is tolde them wythout diſcretion or skill:
they maye runne ſwiftlye ynoughe, but they ſhall come neuer
the neerer vntoo God. VVhen they haue ſpent all theyr lyfe
in traueling, they ſhal fynde themſelues further off than they were
at the firſt. And therfore let vs learne to begin at this poynt, that is
to wit, to giue eare vntoo God who dooth vs the grace and honour
too teache vs, aſſuring our ſelues that there is none other truth but
that which proceedeth of him, and that when me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> follow the deuiſes
of their owne braine, it ſhall bee but vntruth and leaſing. Yee ſee
then that the waye for vs too fare the better by this ſaying of S.
Paules, is firſte of all too conſider, that all the deuotions whyche
men doo frame of theyr owne heades, are but mere illuſions of
Satan, and that all ſuch as doo w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at they lyke beſt themſelues, may
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:23060:267"/>
runne faſt inough, howbeit they ſhall be neuer the further forward
in the right way, but rather the further backe. Then is nothing too
bee taken and allowed for a good courſe or race, but only the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
which wee yeelde vnto Gods truthe. VVere this throughly
well knowen to the world nowe a dayes, there woulde not bee ſo
muche trouble and contention as is ſeene. For what is the cauſe
that wee drawe not all by one lyne, and that euery of vs reacheth
not out his hande to his neighbour? It is for that moſt men cannot
be perſuaded to obey God. Therefore the true courſe of the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
is well ſhewed to vs by the Prophet Eſay when he ſayth,<note place="margin">Eſa. 2. a. 3.</note> that
euery man ſhall take his fellow by the hand, and ſay, Go we, let vs
go vp too the Lords hill, and he will teache vs his wayes. Nowe
were wee fully reſolued of this poynt, ſo as wee were altogither
willing and deſirous to ſubmit our ſelues to God: it is certayne
that wee ſhoulde all of vs runne togither, and the formoſt ſhould
helpe forward the hindermoſt, and the weaker ſort ſhuld not enuy
ſuch as were their guides, yea and that would giue them courage
to go on. But although we ſee the world full of ſtubborneſſe, and
euery man giuen to his own liking, yet muſt we profite our ſelues
by this doctrine: that is too wit, by impriſoning our ſenſes, that
wee take not a licentious libertie too doo what wee liſt, but that
wee obey the truthe, aſſuring our ſelues that the foundation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
it behoueth vs too buylde, is the ſayde faythfull obedience
which wee yeelde vnto Gods worde. And whereas S. Paule vſeth
this worde <hi>Truthe,</hi> it is ſpecially to beate downe all fooliſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſneſſe
and ouerweening, bicauſe men beare them ſelues
in hande that they be wiſe inough to order their owne lyfe. And
out of this ouerboldneſſe ſprang alſo the Seagulfe of all ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
For if men knewe them ſelues too bee ſuche as they bee in
deede, that is to wit, to be poore, blinde, and ignorant: it is certein
that they woulde with all humbleneſſe hearken vntoo God, and
then ſhould not there be ſo many partakings and ſectes as there
bee. But what? As I ſayde afore, men will needes bee ouerwyſe.
Now S. Paule, too pull downe all loftineſſe, and to ridde vs of all
pride and preſumption, ſayth that there is no truthe to be founde
but in the doctrine that commeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> God, and that howe ſure ſo
<pb facs="tcp:23060:268"/>
euer wee weene our ſelues to bee, there is nothing but mere follie
in vs, except God gouerne vs, and Gods word reigne wholly ouer
vs. Further let vs vnderſtande, that to yeeld our ſelues techable is
a farre greater vertue without all compariſon, than to enter into
diſputation, and to be inquiſitiue of things that belong not to vs,
nor are lawfull for vs. It is true that fayth is not a dotage or ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſſe
to receyue and beleeue without gaynſaying, whatſoeuer
ſhall be tolde vs: but yet when God ſpeaketh, it behoueth vs too
yeeld him ſo much honor, as to keepe our mouths ſhut, &amp; to open
our eares to herke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aduiſedly to that which he telleth vs, &amp; to frame
our ſelues ſimply to the ſame. Yee ſee then that the good race
wherin we can not go amiſſe, nor bee caried aſide one way nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
is to follow the way that god ſheweth vs by his word. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
(as I ſayd) wee ſhall but roue, according alſo as S. Paule vſeth
the ſelfe ſame ſimilitude, in taunting all the things that the ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
and vnbeleeuers doo to ſerue God withall. For although they take
neuer ſo much payne, yet they doo but looſe their labour. But by
the way let vs marke alſo how he blameth the Galathians for tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
aſide in the middeſt of their race, ſaying that their faulte is ſo
much the leſſe to be excuſed, in that they had begon well, and not
hild out likewiſe to the end. True it is that euen the ignoranteſt in
the world ſhal not fayle to be condemned if they follow not Gods
word: but howſoeuer they fare, we offend much more groſly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
God hath once bin ſo gracious vnto vs as to call vs vnto him, &amp; to
ſhewe vs his will. Then if wee turne head, and forſake oure holy
calling from heauen after we haue bin taught in Gods ſchole, and
entred into the way: ſurely our fault is double, &amp; we deſerue much
ſorer puniſhment. This is it that S. Paul ment in this text by ſaying,
<hi>how now? You ran well.</hi> Surely this forwardneſſe of fayth is a great
vertue, namely when we be readie to anſwere God as ſoone as he
ſpeaketh the word to vs: but yet is it nothing worth without hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
out. Then if we be ſo fickle and inconſtant, that when we haue
gone forward a ſtep or twayne, we be readie to runne back ageyne,
or elſe to ſtart out on the one ſide or on the other: ſuche vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
is much more ſhamefull, than if we had neuer harkened to
God at all: for we can not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:23060:268"/>
as they doo which are bred &amp; brought vp in errour and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
who will ſay, if we knew which is the truth, we would
not doo ſo as we ſhould neede to be pulled by the eare: but we be
in doubt, and we wote not on which ſide to turne vs. Then if they
which haue begonne to followe God, yea and haue had ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
and infallible inſtruction by his worde, doo afterward ſtarte
aſide, or go backe agayne: doo they not ſhew that they doo it not
of ignorance, but of wilfulneſſe and ſtubborneſſe, as though they
mente of ſet purpoſe to ſpyte God? Now it behoueth vs to marke
well this thing, ſpecially for ſo muche as God is ſo gracious vnto
vs, as too ſhewe vs whiche is the waye of ſaluation, whiche thing
he dooth not too the reſt of the worlde. For wee ſee many blinde
wretches, that runne and trotte vp and downe, and wote not what
they doo: but yet they ſhewe ſome deſire of ſeruing God. If a
man aske them whether they thinke they doo well, or no, they
anſwere, yea: howbeeit it is but a weening, they bee not ſure of it.
But wee on our ſide haue the warrant of the holy Ghoſt, whiche
oughte too bee ſealed in our hearts, that the doctrine whiche is
preached vnto vs is not deuiſed by men, but that God is the very
author of it. The holy Scripture is ſufficiently proued: wee know,
without adding of any thyng, that God is oure guyde, ſo that
nowe a dayes there is not ſo very a dullarde or idiote, but
hee is iuſtly too bee condemned, if hee receyue not the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
that is preached and ſet foorth, and maye vppon hys owne
knowledge iudge that hee dooth manifeſtly make wylfull warre
agaynſt God. Seeing that oure Lorde hathe doone vs the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue
too call vs too him, and dooth ſtill dayly allure vs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corage
vs to come forwarde, till wee bee come to our races ende:
if wee bee weery to heare him, and euery of vs would fayne take
his owne ſcope, to followe whatſoeuer his owne luſt liketh: what
excuſe or ſhift can wee hope to haue, that we ſhould not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
with the Galathians, for falling to our owne byaſſe after
wee haue runne well, and bin well forwarde on our way? Yea and
wee muſt alſo marke this ſaying which S. Paule interlaceth, <hi>Who
hath letted you,</hi> ſayth he? He might haue ſayde ſimply as he ſayde
in the begynning of the Epyſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they were quyte gone
<pb facs="tcp:23060:269"/>
away, yea and vtterly reuolted as Apoſtates or backſlyders. But
he vſeth the worde <hi>Let,</hi> too ſhewe that it is not inough for vs not
to turne quite and cleane away from God, but that if wee doo but
ſtoppe or linger that wee go not right foorth on ſtill, nor continue
alwayes ſtedfaſtly in comming neerer and neerer vnto God: it is
alreadie a very dangerous matter. So then let vs be ware of Satans
wyles, and not onely be afrayde of vtter reuolting from the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of oure God, but alſo beare well in minde, that when
the Diuell ſhall once haue cooled vs, and made vs too ſlake our
pace, ſo as wee fall to loytering in our gooing: he ſhall haue gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ouer much at our hands. Thus ye ſee in effect what we haue to
gather vpon this text. Now to condemne the vnthankfulneſſe of
the Galathians the better, he addeth, <hi>that that counſell came not of
him that called them.</hi> In the firſt chapter he had ſayde, I maruell that
yee bee ſo ſoone caryed away from Ieſus Chriſt which called you
to the grace of his Goſpell. For it is good reaſon that God ſhould
be heard when he openeth his holy mouth to teach vs. VVhat are
wee? VVretched wormes of the earth, and rottenneſſe: and yet
notwithſtanding our Lorde maketh his voyce to ring from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
to aſſure vs that if he inlighten &amp; guyde vs, we can not do amiſſe,
and therefore that wee muſt depende wholly vpon him, and reſte
vpon his truthe. But if wee giue eare to this and that, and when
God ſpeaketh wee be ſoaring in the ayre, and hearken to one that
whiſtleth, and to another that ſingeth: Is it not too ſhamefull an
vnthankfulneſſe? If a Scholemaſter ſee his ſcholers prattling togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
while he ſpeaketh to them, or buylding of Caſtles in Spayne,
ſo as they heare not what he ſayth: the rodde muſt bee fayne too
walke among them, and good right it ſhould ſo. Verily a man can
not abide that his mate or companion ſhoulde muſe vppon other
matters when he is talking with him, but he will take it in ſcorne
and deriſion. But beholde, God calleth vs, and yet if there come
any deceyuer to whiſper vs in the eare, wee hearken too him and
followe his counſell: which is a token that there was neuer any
knowledge in vs too diſcerne the maieſtie of oure God, and too
yeelde him the reuerence that he deſerueth. VVee knowe that the
chief honor that he requireth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, is to haue our wittes &amp; minds
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:23060:269"/>
bent to vnderſtande what he commaundeth and appoynteth. For
that cauſe therfore S. Paule ſayth, that the ſayde counſell came not
of God, who had called the Galathians. Now it is certayne that he
had called them long afore that time: Neuertheleſſe he thinketh
it not inough to haue tolde vs once for all how wee ſhould walke:
but alſo he holdeth on ſtill, according alſo as wee haue neede too
haue the remembraunce of that doctrine to be renued dayly. Then
ſeeing it is ſo that God is alwayes at hande with vs, yea (as the
Prophet Eſay ſayth,<note place="margin">Eſa. 65. a. 2</note> both early and late, that is to ſaye, ſeeing he
hath a continuall care to bring vs to him ſelfe, and to draw vs nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
and neerer: it is certayne that our fault is ſo much the haynou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
if wee haue one of our eares in the fielde, and the other in the
towne, as the Prouerbe ſayth, and that we be not wholly giuen too
him and to his worde. To be ſhort, we ſee heere that the true per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Gods children, is too offer vp themſelues wholly vnto
him, and to ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be gouerned after a peaceable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
with all teachableneſſe, ſo as none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay, this is mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
this is my fancie, this haue I lerned of men: but alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the obedience of fayth before all things. For there is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lampe to guide vs aright, than Gods word. Mark that for one
poynt. Now after that S. Paule hath ſpoken ſo: he addeth, <hi>that a
little Leuen marreth a whole lumpe of Dowe.</hi> This ſerueth to confirme
the matter which I touched not long ſince: which is, that it is not
inough for vs, not to make any full reuolting from God, &amp; to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
him vtterly, &amp; to renounce al his word: but that we muſt alſo
continue pure &amp; ſound, &amp; be as it were vntruſſed to put ourſelues
more &amp; more forward, and although Satan deuiſe and practiſe too
caſt blocks and barres in our wayes to ſtoppe vs, yet muſt wee not
ceaſſe to go on foorth ſtill. And this is to be marked the better, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the diuell ſhewe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h not his hornes at the firſt (as they ſay) to
withdrawe vs away from God, but transformeth him ſelfe into an
Angell of light, and creepeth vpon vs by bypathes and mines vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ground. And by that meanes are we beguyled. For to our
ſeeming, this or that is no great matter, by meanes whereof wee
ouerleape it lightly, and ſtrike ſayle as they ſay. But wee bee vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
amazed when the Diuell holde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> vs masked in his nettes. Too
<pb facs="tcp:23060:270"/>
bee ſhorte, S. Paule ment too ſay here, that when men haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Goſpell, it is not inough for them to profeſſe the recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of the doctrine that is conteyned there: but they muſt alſo
haue a pure, ſound, and ſubſtantiall fayth, and not ſwarue aſide too
the right hand nor to the left, nor be corrupted with any error, nor
admit any mingling, but holde faſt the pure truth which God ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
vs. This is the ſumme of the matter which we haue to gather
vpon this text. But if euer this warning were neceſſarie, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
at this day. For Satan ſtraynes him ſelfe too the vttermoſt,
too intangle, yea and too imbrace Gods worde, too the ende that
men might no more diſcerne betweene white and blacke, but that
al Religions whatſoeuer men liſt to haue, might be taken for good.
And ſuch as vſe that cunning do ſerue the diuel, and haue no more
feare of God nor Religion, than dogges haue. Nowe a dayes they
that be the beſt vpholders of the Pope, perceyuing well that their
abuſes haue bin ſo groſſe and out of all ſquare, as it is impoſsible
to maynteyne them, ſay, very well, yet muſt yee not ſeeke ſuche a
reformation, as to breake of the Eele by the waſt as they ſay: men
muſt bee contented with ſome good meane. And all this is but too
couer their filthineſſe, as if a man that woulde plucke vp a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
weede, ſhoulde but nippe off ſome leaues of it, and ſay, Lo,
nowe it is as good as cut vp. Yea but the roote is ſtill behinde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
with the reſidue of it, which is able to doo harme inoughe,
and that is all one as if it had not bin touched at all. Neuertheleſſe
the world now a dayes is full of ſuch vermine and corruption: for
wee ſee that theſe ſticklers and neuters which rowe betweene two
ſtreames, would fayne diſguize our Lord Ieſus Chriſt after ſuche a
ſort, as he ſhould be Iacke out of office, and be no more knowen,
and that the doctrine of the Goſpell mighte bee mingled lyke a
hotchpotch. And ſo muche the more dooth it ſtand vs in hand to
marke well the thing that is tolde vs heere by the holy Ghoſt,
namely that a little Leuen ſoureth a whole batch of Dowe. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
this ſimilitude is applied to men: for one ſcabbed ſheepe is
inoughe too infect a whole flocke, as they ſay. But Sainct Paule
ſpeaketh nowe of doctrine, as if he ſhoulde ſaye, that wee muſte
holde our owne, and not ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> any thing to bee added to Gods
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:23060:270"/>
pure worde,<note place="margin">2. Co. 11. a. 3</note> according as we haue ſeene in the ſeconde to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,
how he ſayd that ſuche as giue eare to Satans illuſions,
are like a woman that hearkeneth to a baude, whoſe comming is
to beguile &amp; abuſe hir. Now as ſoone as we be ſo corrupted in our
fayth: by and by we be alienated from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and
we break the promiſe of mariage which is made betwixt him &amp; vs,
as ſoone as we ſwarue aſide from the ſimplicitie of the Goſpell.
And like as in that place he vſeth the word <hi>ſimplicitie</hi> of ſet purpoſe:
ſo in this place he ſayth, that if we mingle neuer ſo little leuen with
the dow, by and by it is all made ſowre. VVhat muſt we doo then?
VVhereas it pleaſed God to ſhewe the Iewes by his lawe the true
meane to walke in ſuch wiſe as they ſhould not be harried heere &amp;
there: in the Goſpell he hathe taughte vs yet with muche greater
perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bicauſe that there he hath made an end of all propheſies.
Then ſeeing it is ſo: let vs now frame our ſelues therafter. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Satan whiſper vs on either ſide, let vs not be as reedes that
are ſhaken with euery winde, but let vs be ſo rooted in our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt, as he may make vs to indure al winds and wethers by
the power of fayth, and all aſſaultes that can bee put vnto vs. To
bee ſhorte, if wee will bee taken for Diſciples of oure Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt: let vs not hearken too any other maſter or teacher than
him: for we can not do him greater wrong than to adde any thing
to that which he bringeth vs. For it is ſayd that it is he whom the
father hath ſet ouer vs with full preheminence, and whiche is the
good ſhepherd,<note place="margin">Iob. 10. a. 4</note> and that they which are of his flocke, will heare his
voyce, &amp; eſchue the voyce of ſtrangers. Howſoeuer the world go,
we muſt ſtand whiſt at that ſtay, &amp; without reſiſtance follow whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſoeuer God calleth vs, and ſuffer our ſelues to be ſo turned &amp;
returned by, as we may deſire nothing but too ſubmit our ſelues
to his worde as I haue declared before. And therefore althoughe
that nowe and then men finde fayre clokings to verniſh the ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
withal which they put foorth: yet let vs hold vs to that which
is ſayde heere, namely that a little Leuen is inough too marre
a whole batche of dowe: according as wee ſhall ſee manye,
who too make vs ſwarue aſide, wyll alledge, what? It is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of Ieſus Chriſt, ſo wee holde the groundes of the
<pb facs="tcp:23060:271"/>
Goſpell, that wee be iuſtified by the free goodneſſe of God, &amp; that
wee can call vpon him in the name of him that hath promiſed too
bee our mediator. VVhen wee haue done amiſſe wee flee too the
onely and euerlaſting ſacrifice of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte; and if
there bee any ſmall ſpottes or wemmes beſide, they muſt be borne
with and winked at. And ſpecially ſuche as woulde winne by their
pride, will ſay, yea mary Sir, and what elſe ſeeke wee but concord?
For wee be contented that euery man ſhould walke in the doctrine
of the Goſpell: but yet is not that a matter of ſo great importance,
that it ſhoulde bee ſoo greatly ſtoode vpon. Therefore when the
Diuell goes about to beguyle vs with ſuche baytes, let vs alwayes
ſet this buckler agaynſt him, that a little Leuen ſowreth a whole
lumpe of Dowe. And in very deede euen experience (whiche is
termed the miſtreſſe of fooles) hathe well ſhewed in our time how
true this Sainct Paules ſaying is. For wee ſee nowe a dayes that
where the Goſpell hath bin preached purely, there are ſo many
diuers opinions as it is horrible too thinke, ſo as it ſeemeth day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that all ſhoulde go too ruine, and Gods truthe is as it were
torne in peeces. And whereof commeth this, but of mens lazineſſe
in that they woulde maynteyne them ſelues in reſt, and haue their
commodities and eaſe at wyll, too take their pleaſure euerywhere,
and ſo haue conſented too ſuche as came too diſguyſe the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Goſpell? God therefore hathe yeelded them their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
hyre. For aſmuche then as wee ſee ſuche examples, let vs
bee ſo muche the warer, and let vs ſo walke in the pureneſſe of the
Goſpell, as wee may refuſe all mingling, and vtterly abhorre it.
Nowe heerevpon Sainct Paule addeth further, <hi>that hee trusteth
of the Galathians, that they wyll not bee otherwiſe mynded.</hi> VVe haue
ſeene howe the rebukes that he did ſet downe hitherto heretofore,
were rough and ſharpe. Nowe when men exceede meaſure, it is
alwayes daungerous for diſcoraging of men, and for caſting them
into a melancholie. For this cauſe S. Paule moderateth him ſelfe,
and ſeeketh ſtill too bee at one agayne with the Galathians. And in
good ſooth that is the order which all men ought to keepe, that are
deſirous too builde vp Gods Churche. It is true that mens vyces
ought not to be ſpared, &amp; ſpecially if there appere any hinderance
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:23060:271"/>
of the pure doctrine, or too the ouerthrowing of fayth: then muſte
wee haue a firie zele too fight manfully, and to maynteyne the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
of our God. Yet notwithſtanding we muſt labour to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte
of our power to bring thoſe backe that are gone aſtray, and to
keepe ſtill thoſe that are yet in good way, though they be weake and
go not forwarde with ſuch ſtrength and corage as were requiſite and
to be wiſhed. Ye ſee then what the duetie of thoſe is which haue the
charge to beare abrode Gods woord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto them: that is to
wit, that in reprouing ſuche as were gone aſtray, their vſing of ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
&amp; rigour ſhould be ſuch, as yet neuertheleſſe they ſhould ſhew
ſome good hope, to the intent that their hearers be not vtterly ouer
greeued, and therevpon fall intoo wilfulneſſe, and ſhake off all good
doctrine. But euery of vs muſte apply this too his owne vſe. For
what cauſeth vs now and then to gnaſh our teeth when God rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
vs, and to be forepoſſeſſed with ſuch ſtubbornneſſe that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
agaynſt him? It is bycauſe wee be paſt hope, and therevpon play
double or quit as they ſay. Therefore our Lord laboreth too bring
vs backe when he ſeeth vs ſo forlorne, or rather in the way of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and he would ſtill fayne win vs too himſelfe againe, howbeeit
that in the meane whyle wee knowe not the end and intent that he
ameth at. By reaſon whereof wee ſhet the gate agaynſt him, ſo as he
can not by any meanes compaſſe vs. So much the more then ought
we to minde well the thing that is ſhewed vs heere by Sainct Paule
which is that if our ſores bee rubbed, although it greeue vs and ſting
vs too bee ſharply rebuked: yet wee muſte not ceaſſe too abyde it
patiently, bycauſe God meeneth not too throwe vs headlong intoo
the bottomleſſe pit, but rather calleth vs home too himſelfe. And
nowe according herevntoo, let vs marke that there is none other
remedie for all our vyces, than too yeeld our ſelues too that which
God telleth vs. For Sainct Paule preſuppoſeth that which was true:
namely that he had preached the doctrine of the Goſpell purely,
and that he had not intruded himſelfe too put foorth his owne
dreames and dotages, but had purely diſcharged his duetie and the
commiſsion that was giuen vntoo him. He ſayeth now that the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians
will thinke all that too bee ſo. And ſo he ſheweth vs gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
that if we haue bin ouerſeer <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd the Diuel haue troubled our
<pb facs="tcp:23060:272"/>
mindes, and the deceyuers alſo haue thruſt vs out of the way: there
is none other help but to hold our peace and to anſwere Amen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our God, and too ſuffer our ſelues too bee guyded by his woord,
ceaſsing not too yeelde him true obedience though he come not
downe from heauen in viſible ſhape, nor ſende any of his Angelles
that beare the badges of his Maieſtie, but ſpeake too vs by frayle
men, that are not of any greate eſtimation. Lo heere in effect what
wee haue too beare in mynde. Nowe heerevpon Sainct Paule tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
aſide the ſoreſt matters vntoo the Couſiners that had ſowen
their darnell in the Churche of the Galathians. <hi>He that hath diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
you</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>ſhall beare his iudgement, whatſoeuer he bee.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he declareth that if there bee any whom Satan hath ſo ſore poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,
that they wilfully prouoke Gods wrath vppon their heades:
wee muſt not bee ſhaken downe nor moued therewith. This war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is very neceſſarie. For though wee be hard and ſlow too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
the things that God telleth vs: yet notwithſtanding on the
contrarie part, when wee ſpie any errour, wee bee ready too runne
after it, and ſo yee ſee a froward inclination, which is common wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere
euerywhere, and a vyce more than ordinarie. Furthermore to
our ſeeming wee bee well at eaſe, if wee can get any couert, too ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
Satan too beguyle vs though he ſeeke nothing but our deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Therefore it behoueth vs ſo much the more too marke well
how it is ſayd heere, that ſuche as trouble the Churche ſhall beare
their owne iudgement. For thereby S. Paule doth vs to vnderſtand,
that there are many deſpyzers of God, which make no conſcience to
peruert all things: ſo they may win themſelues eſtimation with the
world, and purchace themſelues credit, all is one with them, for they
paſſe for nothing but to exalt themſelues. Such maner of men doo
trouble the church a thouſand waies. There are others who through
vayne glorie and too ſeeme skilfull and ſharpwitted, forge new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.
That is one other kind of Couſiners. And there are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
ſo malicious and ſpitefull, as they can not brooke any peace
and concord,<note place="margin">Gen. 16. c. 12.</note> according as it is ſayd that the hande of Iſmaell ſhould
bee againſt all men, and all mennes handes agaynſt him. Then there
are a ſort that ſeeke nothing but diſſention and variance. Seing then
that wee perceyue that the Diuel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hath ſo many bolſterers to turne
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:23060:272"/>
vs from the right way: had not euery of vs neede to looke well to
himſelfe, leaſt he be ſhaken downe: and too continue alwayes ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
in the thing which wee knowe too bee of our God, whatſoeuer
this man or that man doo babble or prate? Yee ſee then that the
thing whiche Sainct Paule ment, is that wee ſhoulde not one of vs
looke at another, lyke ſheepe which leape one after another intoo
a riuer or a pit when one is leapt in afore them, or lyke Cranes and
other byrdes that flie all on a rowe one after another, no wee may
not doo ſo: but wee muſte alwayes bee conſtant without ſwaruing
aſide from the woorde of God. Marke that for one poynt. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all things Sainct Paule telleth vs, that wee muſte not bee da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeled
at mennes gay ſhowes, when they peruert Gods pure truthe
vnder colour of their owne skill: but that when wee ſee them too
haue no regarde of any thing, nor religion, no feare of God, no awe,
yea and that ſometymes they bee woorſe than paſte ſhame, ſo that if
they once come ſo farre foreward as too get the Lawe in their owne
handes, they paſſe for noman, but do after a ſorte ſpit euen in Gods
face: I ſay when wee ſee them become ſuche Monſters, wee muſte
wayt that God ſhould execute his iuſtice vpon them, and ſhew how
much ſtore he ſetteth by the ſoules which he hath bought ſo deerly.
And that is the cauſe why he addeth purpoſely <hi>whoſoeuer he bee.</hi> For
heere he intended too deface all the gay titles whereof men vaunt
themſelues, in ſetting vp their briſtles againſt God. Like as at this
day, whereas the Pope turneth Gods truthe vpſide downe, and
through Diueliſh pryde mingleth and mangleth all things: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
he ceaſſeth not too call himſelfe the Seruant of Gods
Seruantes, the Succeſſor of Ieſus Chriſt, and the Vicar of Sainct Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The Biſhops alſo ſuppoſe themſelues too haue a very lawfull
tytle to ſuppreſſe all knowledge of the truth, in naming themſelues
Prelates. But Sainct Paule telleth vs heere, that when men are ſo
diſguyzed, they bee but Idolles for all that, and God is vnchangeable
and altereth nother his nature nor his minde. Then ſith it is ſo: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
men were exalted too the third heauen, yet ought wee too
take them for ſtarke Diuelles, if they go about to mingle aught at al
of their owne deuizing, with the pure ſimplicitie of Gods woord. To
bee ſhort, we ſee heere all worth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eſſe of man beaten downe when
<pb facs="tcp:23060:273"/>
the obedience of fayth commeth in preſence. True it is that in ciuill
caces there hath alwayes bin ſuperioritie: but yet muſte God not
withſtanding gouerne ſtil by his woord, and his ſeruis muſt be ruled
thereby, that our fayth may be wholly conformable therevnto: and
though all the world ſhould ſet it ſelf againſt it, and heape vp neuer
ſo huge and high mountaynes of moſt excellent titles euen vp too
the cloudes, all muſt be hild but as ſmoke, yea and as filth and dung.
Thus yee ſee in effect what Sainct Paule ment to ſay. Yet doth he it
not too excuſe the Galathians of their vnaduized ouerſhooting of
themſelues, but too giue them courage to returne vnto God. There
are many too bee ſeene now adayes which thinke themſelues to bee
ſcaped out of Gods hands, and too be quite diſcharged, when they
can ſay that their Prelates and Shepeherdes haue taught them ſo.
But S. Paule admitteth no ſuch excuce, but ſayeth that the way for
them to ſcape the damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is prepared for the deceyuers, is to
returne to Gods pure truth, &amp; not to refuze to be brought backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
though they haue ſwarued from it for a time. And herewithall
alſo for a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion, he doth vs to vnderſtand how deere our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is to God, and how great ſtore he ſetteth by it. For whereof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
that which S. Paule ſayeth heere, namely that all ſuch as trouble the
Churche ſhall giue a reckening of it, and bee ouerwhelmed at Gods
hand: but of that wee be his heritage, and he taketh all his pleaſure
in vs, as in them whom he hath chozen and adopted, and for that we
be as it were his accompliſhment, as S. Paule termeth vs? Seing it is
ſo: let vs learne to truſt in God, ſeing he hath ſo fatherly care of our
ſaluation. And ſo let vs learne to put from vs all falſe doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
and with ſuch ſtoutneſſe as we ought to do. For wee ſee that
God is chafed and moued too anger, telling vs that he will neuer
pardon thoſe that haue ſo troubled his. For aſmuch then as wee ſee
that God powreth out his indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon them that haue troubled
his Churche: let vs haue a zele anſwereable therevnto, and let vs
abhorre all falſe doctrines. And when wee ſee men deſirous of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but too ſowe ſome troubles: let vs take them as our mortall
enemies, let vs make warre valiantly agaynſt them, and let vs fight
too the vttermoſt for the truth of our God, aſſuring our ſelues that
that is the thing wherein lieth all our happineſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:23060:273" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Thus yee ſee in effect what we haue to gather vpon this ſtreyne.
And ſo for aſmuch as God hath once called vs too him, and ceaſſeth
not to pricke vs forward dayly by exhortations: let vs hold vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his obedience. And although we ſee many troubles, diſſentions,
and debates in the world: yet let vs alwayes ſticke ſtedfaſtly to the
truth which cannot deceyue vs. And for aſmuch as we may be ſoone
ſeduced and deceyued: let vs pray God too giue vs wiſedome and
diſcretion: and alſo let vs giue diligent eare to his woord, as whiche
is able to ſtrengthen vs againſt all Satans illuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and let vs no more
be led too daunce after other mennes pypes, as S. Paule warneth vs
in the end of this Epiſtle. Seing then that we haue the meane which
God hath ſtabliſhed too holde vs alwayes too bee of his houſe and
Church: let vs ſtand ſtedfaſt therein. And if we happen too bee tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
aſide through the fooliſhneſſe and vnaduizedneſſe of our fleſh:
let vs by and by herken to the warnings that are giuen vs heere, let
vs mourne for our faults, and when wee haue mourned, let vs ſerue
our God, knowing that he is euer readie too receyue vs. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we ſee neuer ſo great a number of deſpyzers and worldlings
which ceaſſe not to corrupt and peruert the doctrine of the Goſpel,
yea and too bee vtterly ſotted in their corruptions: although (I ſay)
that we ſee ſuch ſtumblingblockes: yet let vs take good heede, that

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is ſeene that men are ſo giuen to their owne
profit in all their doings, that alwaies they bow
crookedly and ouerthwartly without reſpect
of equitie &amp; vprightneſſe. For mens couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and the reſpect which they haue eyther
to their profite or too their eaſe, doth ſo blind
their eyes, as they can diſcerne nothing. Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when Gods woord is to bee caried abrode, then if a man forget
not himſelf, and ſhet not his eyes agaynſt the things that may turne
him away in this world from walking purely before God: ſurely he
ſhall neuer hold on his courſe, but bee ſtill ſtarting out, now on the
one ſide and now on the other. By meanes whereof Gods doctrine
is oftentimes corrupted, bycauſe that they which ought too beare it
abrode, are inclyned eyther too hatred or fauour, and are afrayde of
purchacing themſelues ſome diſpleaſure, or of prouoking ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
againſt them. Therefore it is vnpoſsible too ſerue God purely
in our ſtate of calling, vnleſſe wee bee fully reſolued, yea euen with
an inuincible conſtancie, not to be greeued if we be driuen to ſuffer
for the doctrine which wee beare abrode: but to fight luſtily vnder
the ſtandard of our Capteyne Ieſus Chriſt, knowing that we cannot
come to the glory of his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but by ſuffering aforehand with
him after his example. The faithfull muſt be fayne to faſhion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
vnto that. But the cace of ſuch as ſhould teach and haue the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:23060:274"/>
office of preaching Gods woord, is more particular: for it is certaine
that the Diuell is alwayes practizing too put vs out of hart, and he
ſhall finde furtherers ynough in this worlde, according as there are
full many that cannot abyde that Gods woord ſhould bee preached
purely and vncorruptly. They will not ſay with open mouth, that
Gods name ought to be buried: but yet would they fayne deuyze a
faſhion of doctrine too their owne lyking. Now therefore it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs too looke ſimply too that which God commaundeth, and to
harden our ſelues throughly to it: according alſo as we ſe how Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
was willed to fight,<note place="margin">Ierem. 1. d. 18. 19.</note> and God promized too giue him a forehead
of braſſe, to puſh againſt thoſe that ſhould come to aſſayle him. And
for that cauſe doth S. Paule ſay now, that if he liſted to preach circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cizion,
and to make ſuch a minglema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gle as the deceiuers went about
to do: he could rid his hands of al vexation, and make euery man to
clap their hands at him, or at leaſtwiſe he could bring too paſſe that
no man ſhould perſecute him and trouble him. For the Iewes would
eaſly hue graunted that Ieſus Chriſt ſhoulde haue bin preached, ſo
they might haue hild ſtil the ſtate of Elderſhip, and the Ceremonies
haue bin vſed ſtill, and the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles haue bin as little vntimely borne
things to come in aray in theyr trayne behind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yee ſee then what
the Iewes deſire was. Sainct Paule could haue pleaſed them well in
ſo doyng, but that he minded too ſerue God faythfully and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially.
But on the contrary part S. Paule ſheweth, that they whiche
labored too ouerthrowe the doctrine that he had preached, ſought
more the fauour and frendſhip of men, than too diſcharge their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Nowe then wee ſee what is ment by this ſentence where he
ſayeth, <hi>My brethren, if I preached Circumcizion ſtill,</hi> that is too ſay, if
I would agree too make a minglemangle, that Ieſus Chriſte might
bee diſguyzed, and euery man haue what he woulde aske: no man
would be any more offended with mee, I ſhould be welcome euery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
and I ſhould haue credit by it. But now, is it likely that I will
bee at defiance with all the worlde, of purpoſe too bee tormented?
You ſee then at a woorde, that I ſeeke not mine owne profite.
For what moueth theſe goodly doctors to make ſuch a mingleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
as yee ſee, but that they would fayne pleaſure euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and are
loth that any man ſhould trouble <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>em in any wiſe? Seyng that their
<pb facs="tcp:23060:275"/>
ſeeking is for eaſe and commoditie: you ought of good right to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
them. Now then wee ſee here, on the one ſide the thing that I
touched not long ſince: namely that all ſuch as are called of God to
the preaching of his woord, ought to be fully determined vpon this,
that although the whole world ſhould ſtep vp againſt them, yet they
would not bow, but abide all aſſaultes, beyng well aſſured that God
will maynteyne them at their neede, and alwayes giue them victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
ſo they followe their vocation in pure ſingleneſſe. For wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doo God any greater wrong and outrage, than too ſubmit our
ſelues too mens likings, by turning away from his woord, eyther to
the right hand or to the left. Nother is it for vs to leaue any peece
of our duetie vndone, but wee muſt ſtedfaſtly maynteyne the truth
of God which is vnchaungeable, and ought not in any wiſe to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
though men be neuer ſo variable and vnconſtant. And this is
to be marked well, bicauſe that although men haue ſome good wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe
that God ſhould be knowen, and that his truth ſhould bee
preached accordingly: yet the moſt part will commonly bow, when
they ſee the ſlaunders that are rayzed of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and heere mens grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings
&amp; repinings againſt them, ſpecially whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſometimes there ſhall
bee ſo great broyles, that all is like to go to wrecke. For if we mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
Gods quarell as wee ought too do, by and by the ſlaunderers
will giue it out that we be wilfull. Like as at this day the Papiſts do
charge vs, firſt of all with great raſhneſſe, that we, (who be but a ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in compariſon of themſelues whiche are ſo houge a multitude,
yea and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſo great experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which haue ſeene ſo much, and are
had in ſo great eſtimation and reputation,) will take vpon vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll
all the ſtates of the world: and ſecondly that we be to precyze,
yea and to malapert, in that wee will haue all mens heads vnder our
girdle, and do ſeeke nothing elſe but to ouermayſter all men, and to
make euery man to ſtoupe to our lure. Lo how wee bee wrongfully
ſlaundered. Neuertheleſſe we muſt rather ſwallow vp this ſlaunder,
than forbeare the doing of any peece of our duetie. For why? in this
behalfe it is not for vs to make any compoſition as it were betwene
man and man. For if twoo parties bee at variance for ſome ſumme
of Money, or for ſome Lande, an vmper may ſo qualifie the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on eyther ſide, as peace ſhall ſoone bee made betwixt them.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:23060:275"/>
But if we graunt Gods enimies their owne asking, ſpecially to the
preiudice of him that will haue his owne right throughly mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned
(as good reaſon is that it ſhoulde bee:) what a thing is that?
So much the more then behoueth it vs too marke well this leſſon,
where Saint Paule telleth vs, that to ſerue God we muſt not ſhun,
neither trouble, nor vexation, nor repinings, nor reproches, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing elſe, inſomuch that if it ſtande vpon the hazarding of our
life, we muſt go through with it. And though there be great frailtie
in vs: yet let vs conſider that God calleth vs vnto him, and that he
is able to remedie al our weakneſſe, and to giue vs ſufficient ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth
to holde out to the vttermoſt. Howſoeuer the cace ſtande, ſeeing
hee imployeth vs in his ſeruice, (vs I ſay which are nothing of oure
ſelues:) we muſt not diſhonour him ſo much, as to make him ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to mens luſtes. Thus ye ſee what wee haue to conſider in the
firſt place. Furthermore we bee warned therewithall, to ſuſpectall
ſuche as ſeeke their owne aduauntage and profite, and all ſuche as
diſguiſe themſelues, rowing betweene two ſtreames, and falſifying
Gods pure truthe at euerie turne, too pleaſe men withall. For as I
haue tolde you alreadie, we muſt prepare our ſelues to many bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
if we minde to ſerue God ſimplie. And we muſt call to minde
this ſentence where Saint Paule ſayde,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. b. 10</note> that if his minde were too
pleaſe men, hee muſt of neceſsitie forſake the ſeruice of our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt his maiſter. For as I haue tolde you before, the diuell
will not ceaſſe to make warre vppon vs on all ſydes: and againe,
men are naturally diſpoſed therevnto: euerie man coueteth to bee
ſoothed and vphilde, and to haue all his vyces cloked. To be ſhort,
there is none but he deſireth too bee foded and mainteyned in hys
rechleſneſſe. And therefore if wee will bee freendes with men too
frame our ſelues vntoo their willes and deſires: Ieſus Chriſt can
haue no more mayſterſhip ouer vs, and wee ſhall not onely become
vnprofitable for him, but alſo vtter peruerters of all. Nowe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when wee ſee that theſe which pretende great zealouſneſſe of
chriſtian religion, doo ſeeke their owne profite: let vs hardily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that they deſerue not to haue any authoritie. Of which ſort
are they whiche nowadayes keepe a barking to mainteyne popiſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes,

to bring it in diſcredite with the blinde and ignorant, and yet
notwithſtanding what is it that the moſt part of them doo ſeeke?
Some to maintaine themſelues in their eſtate, with their red hattes,
horned cappes, and croſſes: Others runne after them like houndes
in a chace, and theſe poore ſtoruelings plie them apace that they
may haue their wages. Beſides this, all that euer is done of theſe
pelting hypocrites, and of all the whole ſtinging and ſtinking rable
of ſhauelings, (what pretence ſo euer they make) tendeth too none
other end, but to haue their diſhes alwayes ful, ſo that all their figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is but for their bellie. Alſo there are a great number of Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which are contented to haue the Goſpell preached by halues,
but to go too it with ſo great rygour and ſeueritie, ô (ſay they) it is
no reaſon at all, for the worlde cannot awaye with it. And why
ſhould not men paſſe much for Ceremonies (ſay they?) Although
they ſprung of ſuperſtitions and abuſes, yet ſhoulde wee not go too
worke ſo roughly: for that were too importunate dealing. All they
then which cannot abyde too haue the filthie dregges and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Poperie cutte off to the quicke, do certainly ame at none
other marke, than too eſchue perſecution, and too ſhrinke awaye
from it. And woulde God that examples of it were not too ryfe.
But nowadayes ye ſhall ſee an infinite number of ſuch as would be
aſhamed to withſtande the Goſpell in all reſpects, conſent well y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
with vs to ſay, In deede it is true, but yet many things had
neede to be borne withall, and we had neede to go to it with gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and modeſtie. And what moueth them to this? VVhat foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
haue they? See I pray you what they alledge. O (ſay they)
wee ſee fires kindled euerie where: and what a thing were it too
moue yet further troubles that ſhoulde make them greater? It
ſhould ſeeme that we bee bent of ſet purpoſe to prouoke thoſe that
are alreadie enemies to the Goſpell, and haue the ſworde in theyr
hande, and are able to rende all vp by the roote: were it not better
too beare with things awhile, till God had giuen ſome reſt too his
Church? It is certaine therefore that ſuch folke as deſire too make
truce with thoſe that fight openly againſt our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, are
ful of treaſon. And ſo ſee ye the ſecond warning that is to be marked
vpon this text. Furthermore whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

blocke of the Croſſe ſhall be done away</hi> he meeneth that the world
ſhall no more be ſo prouoked to refuſe the doctrine of the Goſpel:
for when we preach Ieſus Chriſt crucified ſimply without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that doth he purpoſely name the preaching of the Croſſe. Now
the worlde woulde alwayes fayne haue ſolemnities, and firſt of all
wee ſee that many mennes eares itche, and they deſire nothing but
that men ſhoulde flouriſh in Rhetorike and painted ſpeach, and ſuch
other like things. Again we ſee that many are aſhamed of the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie
of the Goſpell, bicauſe that if the great and ſmall ſhoulde
bee coupled togither, it might ſeeme that it tendeth too the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
downe of all highneſſe. And ſhoulde menne bee ſpoyled and
robbed after that maner of all theyr glorie [thinke they?] Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
therefore are aſhamed of that. Nowe for this cauſe Sainct
Paule ſayeth, Go too, it is the preaching of a Gibet or Gallowes.
It is true: for to the intent to open vnto vs the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
the ſonne of God was fayne to ſuffer our curſe, and to indure
that death which is ſo ſlaunderous before men, yea and to be curſed
of Gods owne mouth according to the ſaying of the Lawe, Curſed
is hee that hangeth on tree.<note place="margin">Deut. 51. d. 23.</note> Then was our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt faine
to come to that poynt, that hee might be our borrow. To be ſhort,
hee was as good as ouerwhelmed. And we ſee howe the Prophete
Eſay ſayth of him,<note place="margin">Eſa. 53. a. 2.</note> that he was diſfigured like a poore Lazerman, ſo
as men vouchſafed not to looke vppon him, or to count him in the
number of men.<note place="margin">Pſa. 22. b. 7</note> Alſo wee ſee howe the .xxij. Pſalme ſayth, I am a

ſort: inſomuch that the theefe did ſcorne him and ſcoffe at him.
VVell then, at the firſt ſight this doctrine ſeemeth vnworthie to be
receyued.<note place="margin">1. Co. 1. c. 21.</note> But wee muſt bethinke vs what Saint Paule ſayth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
text: that is to wit, that the world knew not God in true wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and therfore he was fayne to vſe another faſhion of teaching,
which is by fooliſhneſſe. For were wee throughly wiſe, as wee
woulde bee taken too bee: wee haue as good an inſtruction as can
bee, in beholding the skies and the earth. VVe ſee there a mirrour
wherin god ſheweth vs his infinit goodneſſe, power, rightuouſneſſe,
mercie and wiſedome. And ſo wee ſee there the great treaſures
of Gods wiſdome, which ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> rauiſh our wittes to wonder at it.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:277"/>
But who fareth the better by it? Nay contrarywiſe wee ſee men
cobble vp Gods benefites and fill their panches with them, without
any thinking vppon him at all, and not onely that, but alſo to kicke
agaynſt him that hath pampered them. And when they weene too
do God ſeruice, they plucke away the honor that belongeth to him,
and ſet vp Idols after their owne fancie. Seing then that the world
hath not knowne God in true wiſedome, and by the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
God was fayne to trie another way, as he did. For if we iudge
after our naturall wit, it is a kind of ſtarke folly to ſay, that the ſonne
of God, the heade of the Angelles, the Lorde of glorie, the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
of life, the perſone to whome all maieſtie belongeth, was not
onely made a mortall man, and clothed with our ſtate: but alſo vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
abaſed,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. a. 7.</note> (as Sainct Paule ſayth in the ſeconde too the Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)
yea and became ſubiect too our curſe, and bare the name of
ſinne, which is more. VVhen a man ſpeaketh to vs in ſuch phraze
of ſpeech, it muſt needes ſeeme ſtraunge to vs as it is in deed. But
we muſt ſubmit our ſelues with al lowlineſſe, and conſider that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as we haue not profited by the things that god hath ſhewed
vs from the beginning both in heauen and earth, we muſt bee fayne
to come to this other ſchole. Thus much concerning this ſtreyne
where Saint Paule ſayth, <hi>then is the ſtumblingblocke of the Croſſe put
away.</hi> But to be ſhort, we muſt gather vpon this Text, that if there
be any abſurditie in the Goſpel according to our vnderſtanding, the
ſame muſt not make it out of taſte with vs, but we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that
God intendeth to trie our obedience, by ſending vs to the death of
of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and that there we ſee as it were the gulfe
of hell, ſeeing that the ſonne of God is there to beare our condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and is become our ſuretie there to pay all our dettes. Againe
let vs conſider further, that from death there was a goodly paſſage
vnto glorie, which appeared in his reſurrection. For the Sonne of
God hauing ſuffered through infirmitie, (that is to ſay, according
to the ordinance of God his father, and according to his owne good
will alſo, wherby he conſented to ſubmit himſelfe to ſuch bondage)
and hauing ſuffered in ſuch wiſe that hee ouercame death by the
power of his holy ſpirite: he obteyned ſuch a victorie, as all knees
muſt nowe bow before him, and he hath a name aboue all names,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:23060:277"/>
and men muſte knowe that all the Maieſtie of God appeared and
ſhone forth in his perſon. Thus yee ſee that wee neede not to bee
aſhamed of the Goſpell. And aboue all things let vs holde faſte that
which Saint Paule in the firſt to the Romaines calleth the power of
God to the ſaluation of all beleeuers.<note place="margin">Ro. 1. b. 16.</note> Then as for the worldlings
and ſuch as are ſwolne with pryde and ouerweening like Toades,
let them deſpize the Goſpell as much as they liſt, and let them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
in their owne curſedneſſe: and in the meane while let vs with
all humbleneſſe of fayth imbrace the ſonne of God, who offereth
himſelfe to vs of purpoſe, to lift vs vp to the glorie of the kingdom
of heauen. But heere is yet more: namely that Saint Paule mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<hi>Stumbling,</hi> and the preaching of the Goſpel togither as things
inſeparable. It is true that wee muſt eſchue all ſtumblingblockes as
much as is poſsible:<note place="margin">Mat. 18. a. 7.</note> for wo be to him by whom ſtumblingblockes
come. But yet muſte Ieſus Chriſt raigne, and haue his full ſcope,
though all the whole worlde ſhoulde ſtumble at him. The woorde
<hi>Stumblingblocke,</hi> importeth a ſtoppe, hinderance, or let, as if there
were a rough and ſtonie way that had ſome thornes and buſhes, or
ſome other comberances in it, the ſame were a meanes too make
men ſtumble. Nowe it were to be wiſhed that Ieſus Chriſt might
go on freely, and that all the worlde would receyue him, and that
nothing might ſtoppe the preaching of the Goſpell from the one
ende of the worlde to the other. I ſay we ought to wiſhe it as much
as in vs is. Howbeeit let vs learne that God intendeth to trye the
obedientneſſe of our fayth, by giuing Satan the brydle who caſteth
many ſtumblingblockes and cumberances in our wayes.<note place="margin">Eſa. 8. c. 14</note> Too bee
ſhort, our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is not without cauſe called a ſtone to
ſtumble at, and a ſtoppe for all men too daſhe agaynſt, and by that
meanes too breake their neckes.<note place="margin">Luc. 2 e. 34</note> And in the ende (as it is ſayde in
Saint Luke) they muſt be cruſhed by that ſtone, for it is to hard for
their ſtubbornneſſe. And this is verie much for our behoofe. For
we ſee many men ſo nice, that if men agree not to the Goſpell out
of hande, they thinke themſelues quite and cleane diſcharged and
ſet free before God, from mainteining the quarel or cace any longer.

ſet their tongues to ſale lyke harlots in a Brothelhouſe, and caſt out
blaſphemies agaynſt God and his woorde, finde any cloke eyther
too deſpize or too reiect the Goſpell: by and by many wretched
folke haue theyr tongues fyled to ſay, Alas, we ſee that this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
bringeth great ſtumblingblockes with it. Yea and Ieſus Chriſt
ſhoulde not bee that whiche the holy Scripture reporteth him too
bee, if the Goſpell cauſed not many ſtumblings. But yet muſte
wee not bee diſmayed at them: wee muſte rather ouercome them.
Thus ye ſee what wee haue too gather vppon this ſtreyne, where
Saint Paule ſayeth that wee ſhall neuer holde out in the fayth of
the Goſpell, except wee bee armed with ſuch conſtancio, as not to
turne out of the way, let Satan do what hee can. Verely (as I ſayde
afore) wee muſt (as much as wee can) eſchue all ſtumblingblocks,
and go on forwarde, and put the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:23060:278"/>
how euery of vs ought to behaue himſelfe, inſomuch that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
Eſay ſpeaking of the preaching of the Goſpell,<note place="margin">Eſay. 40. 3. 4.</note> ſayth that the
way muſt bee made leuell, and that the thing which was rough and
crooked before, muſt now be made ſmooth and ſtreyt. VVell then,
we muſt do what we can that it may be ſo. Howbeeit foraſmuch as
God wil haue vs to be humbled, and that there muſt needs be ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingblocks
and comberances, and it cannot be but that Ieſus Chriſt
muſt reigne in the mids of his enemies: let vs go forward and defie
all Satans practizes, and not miſlike of the Goſpell for it, though we
ſee neuer ſo many ſtumblings and ſtumblingblockes abrode in the
world. Now S. Paul hauing ſayd ſo, addeth, <hi>I would to God that al they
which trouble you were cut off.</hi> It may ſeeme at the firſt bluſh, that S.
Paule is moued here with to much choler, when he wiſheth that all
thoſe which ſow their darnell and errours abrode to peruert Gods
pure doctrine ſhoulde bee diſpatched, that the diuell might poſſeſſe
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that they might neuer find mercy at Gods hand. For ſo doth
the word <hi>Cut off</hi> betoken. But we muſt mark, that the zele which we
ought to haue of Gods glorie, forgetteth all worldly reſpects, when
they be put into the balance togither. Howbeeit before we go any
further, let vs firſt note that in this word <hi>Cut off,</hi> S. Paul hath ſpoken
by a ſimilitude. For thoſe raſcals that had corrupted and falſified the
doctrine of the Goſpell, ſtroue for Circumcizion. VVell then (ſayth
he) pare off and cut off as much as ye liſt, and yet all your ſeeking is
but to haue other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> buſied about ſuch pelting trifles as wel as your
ſelues. But as for me, I would that all ſuch deceyuers were quite and
cleane cut off, and that God would ſinke them or root the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out, &amp; ſo
caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off and damne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they might not haue any hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
Nowe let vs come to that which I haue touched. I tolde you
ſhortly, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men make war agaynſt God, we muſt become ſuch
deadly enemies vnto them, as we muſt vtterly put out of minde all
kinred and friendſhip, and al that elſe is: for otherwiſe we do not our
dutie in any wiſe vnto our God, who, ſeing he beareth the name of
our father, and doth vs the honor to take vs for his children, ought
at the leaſt to haue his glorie eſteemed of vs aboue all things. But
wee muſte paſſe on yet further. For what is the Maieſtie of God?
Agayne, howe precious ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:279"/>
Moreouer, ſeeing that he doth ſo ioyne his glorie with our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
as we cannot procure the one without the other: yea and that
we can neyther profite him nor diſprofite him, though we were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo zealous to mainteyne his quarell, for he hath no neede of vs,
neither needeth hee to borow our helping hand, but yet he maketh
vs his deputies or agents, too none other ende but that euerie of vs
ſhoulde ſeeke his owne profite, howbeeit not of this worlde, nor in
theſe corruptible things, but in the euerlaſting ſaluation of oure
ſoules: ſeeing (I ſay) that God imployeth vs after ſuch ſort, and we
notwithſtanding bee ſtill retchleſſe and colde: is this treacherie of
ours excuſable? Nay wee muſt come to that which is ſayde in the
Pſalme,<note place="margin">Pſal. 69. b. 10.</note> The zeale of thine houſe hath eaten mee vp, and the ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of them that rayled on thee, I haue taken to my ſelfe. Certes,
this was fully accompliſhed in the perſon of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,
as in the heade of the Church. And Saint Paule ſheweth that wee
muſt be faſhioned like vnto him as our patterne, ſo that whenſoeuer
we ſee Gods honour defaced by men, euerie of vs muſt ſet himſelfe
manfully agaynſt it. Thus yee ſee breefly that the rule which wee
muſt gather heere, is that wee muſt preferre Gods honour before
all things, yea euen before a whole million of liues if we had them.
Then is it not for vs to ſpare men, when they ſtreyne themſelues
to the vttermoſt of their power to trample Gods name vnder foot,
to turmoyl the doctrine of ſaluation, to bring to paſſe that we might
no more knowe what religion to ſticke vntoo, and to driue away all
peace vtterly out of the Church. Therefore if wee ſee men applie
their indeuers that way, is it not reaſon that we ſhould bee their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries?<note place="margin">Ro. 12. d. 18</note>
Truly if it bee poſsible, wee muſt procure freendſhip and
agreement with all men, yea on our owne behalfe, and ſo farre forth
as lyeth in vs, ſayth Saint Paule to the Romanes. But when wee ſee
theſe naughtipackes aduaunce themſelues agaynſt God, and thruſt
forth their hornes too doſſe at him: it is good reaſon that euery of
vs ſhould ſteppe forwarde, and ſhewe in deed that wee bee no more
our owne men, but that for as much as our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath
bought and payde for vs ſo deerely, hee ought of right to be Lorde
both of our life, and of our death. Ye ſee then why Saint Paule ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
heere ſo ſharpe a wiſhe, na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ly that they which had troubled
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:23060:279"/>
the Galathians might bee vtterly alienated from God, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the gulfe of damnation. Now if it be obiected that this wiſh
is agaynſt the rule of charitie: the anſwere is eaſie inough. For we
bee bound to loue our enimies, yea though they perſecute &amp; vexe
vs: and although they ſeeke nothing but our deſtruction, yet muſt
we procure their welfare &amp; ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the vttermoſt of our power,
and we muſt haue pitie &amp; compaſsion of them to ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo giuen
ouer vnto Satan. Thus ye ſee what charitie importeth. But yet for
al this, God muſt be aboue all, as I haue declared already. Therfore
Charitie is betweene man and man. VVhen any man ſhall haue
done me wrong, I muſt forget it. Though he beare me malice, yet
muſt I procure his welfare. But when it commeth to the mayntey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Gods quarel, there me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt be eſteemed leſſe than nothing
as I haue ſayd already. Yet notwithſtanding we doo cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
For what elſe is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon practiſe, than to ſtoupe and ſtryke
ſayle when God is miſdeltwith? And yet in the meane while euery
man will follow his owne right to the vttermoſt. As for example:
There is a man that hath committed a very haynous crime, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth
to be puniſhed: and if he be not corrected there is an euill
gap opened to bring in corruption. There is ſome ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of authoritie,
and (to go no further) they that ought to ſhew the way of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they that preach the worde of God, euen they I ſay are ſeene to
liue wickedly, they be ribauds and lewd folke that ſerue to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
but to make confuſion and debate. And yet for all this, they
muſt not be cut off, they muſt not be handled roughly will ſome
ſay. A drunkard, a whoremonger, a varlet ſhall be maynteyned. To
be ſhort, there ſhall be nothing but contempt of God, &amp; the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
ſhall be vnregarded euery where, and yet muſt all of it be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
vnder colour that there muſt ſome cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie be vſed: yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and in the meane while Gods honor muſt bee lefte at randon.
But if ye doo neuer ſo little touche theſe men that are ſo gentle, or
at leaſtwiſe pretende to be ſo: by and by they fall out into deadly
defiance, ſaying: why not? ſuche a man hathe doone mee ſuche a
wrong. They fight it out to the vttermoſt. VVell then, they indure
all things that can be at the har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Satans vnderlings,<note place="margin">2. Cor 11. c. 20.</note> yea euen
too bee buffeted and boxed about the eares by them with ſhame
<pb facs="tcp:23060:280"/>
inough, as Sainct Paule ſayth in the ſeconde to the Corinthians:
and yet in the meane while they can not abide that God ſhould be
auenged of the diſhonour that is doone vnto him. Nowe then wee
ſee that S. Paules zele was well ruled, and if any man had doone
him wrong in his owne perſon, wee knowe he woulde haue beene
pacient in that behalfe. But now that he ſeeth Gods Goſpell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to ſuche an afterdeele: he can not abyde that: but ſetteth
him ſelfe agaynſt it, wiſhing that ſuche men were damned. Yea ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily:
for he had no regarde of him ſelfe, but (as I ſayde afore) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
Gods honor before all the whole worlde. Thus ye ſee how
we may be ſafe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtraying: namely if we looke ſimply vnto God,
and giue not heede to our owne affections, but bee gouerned by
the ſpirite of vprightneſſe and diſcretion, ſo as God make vs too
diſcerne how farre foorth wee muſt fight, and how farre foorth we
muſt reſiſt. Then if wee once haue ſuch diſcretion, and bee gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 1 b. 8.</note> we may with S. Paule, with Dauid, &amp; with
the reſidue of the holy Prophets defie men, when they go about
to turne vs away from the pureneſſe of the knowen doctrine: yea
and wee might curſe the very Angels if neede were, according as
Sainct Paule hath ſayde heeretofore, where he defyed the Angels
of heauen, if they ſhoulde ſet them ſelues agaynſt the doctrine of
the Goſpell that he had preached. Not that the Angels doo euer
ſet them ſelues agaynſt it: but that if it were poſsible for them to
doo ſo. As if he ſhould ſay, put the cace that an Angell ſhoulde go
about to ouerthrow your fayth: yet ſhould ye rather ſende him to
hell, and holde him for a feende, and curſe him, than be turned aſide
from the right way by him. Yee ſee then that wee muſt in all reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
reſt wholly vpon God: and moreouer let vs bee afrayde of
that ſaying, as though we heard it thunder from heauen agaynſt all
ſuche as trouble the Churche. For thoughe it bee but Paule that
hath ſpoken it, yet dyd the holy Ghoſt guyde and gouerne hys
tung. For aſmuche then as he was the inſtrument of God to vtter
the ſayd ſentence: it is as much as if vnrepealable iudgement were
alreadie giuen agaynſt all ſuche as go about to breake the vnion of
fayth, and the agreement of brotherhood that ought to be among
all Gods children, and to ſowe errours and hereſies to falſifie the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:23060:280"/>
pure truthe. Furthermore God ſheweth how deerely he loueth vs,
(as hath bin declared this morning) wherein he giueth vs a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the fatherly care which he hath of our ſaluation, in that he
taketh ſuche vengeance on all ſuche as would diſappoynt the ſame.
And finally he ſayth, <hi>Brethren, yee bee called too freedome: onely make
it not an occaſion of fleſhlyneſſe, but ſerue yee one another in loue, bicauſe
it is the true fulfilling of the Lawe,</hi> and the very ſquire alſo whereby
wee muſt rule all our works. Heere Sainct Paule ſheweth, firſt that
his ſtriuing is not too bring too paſſe that men might lyue at their
owne eaſe, and euery body ſport as they liſt themſelues: but that
wee might bee free before God. And that is well woorth the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
For as ſoone as this worde freedome or libertie is ſpoken of,
euery of vs is ſo inclined to his fleſhly luſtes, that by and by wee
thinke with our ſelues, very well, then may I do what I liſt, I am no
more reſtrayned, I neede not any more to thinke my ſelfe ſo much
bounde, nor to make ſo great ſcruple of conſcience as I haue done.
Thus yee ſee howe that vnder the pretence of libertie, euery of vs
makes him ſelfe thrall to his owne affections. For it is a pollicie
of the Diuels, to deceyue and beguyle vs in the things that ſeeme
to bee good, yea and to turne them to the cleane contrarie. For
(as I haue declared heeretofore) it is certayne that al ſuch as couet
to liue after their owne liking, become wretched bondſlaues, and
are hild in ſtrayter bondage than ſuch as are ſet in the ſtocks or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles.
And why? Let vs conſider a little what tyrannie there is in
our luſts &amp; paſsions. If a man follow his owne luſts, ſurely he muſt
needes ſhake off al ſhame, &amp; forget himſelf, &amp; become a very beaſt.
Lo here the goodly libertie that all men ſeeke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly by nature.
But I haue tolde you that the libertie whervnto S. Paule exhorteth
vs, is another maner of thing. It is not that we ſhould runne a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
and haue no bridle to holde vs in awe: but that we ſhoulde
conſider what God requireth of vs, and be ruled by his holy word,
&amp; none of vs become ſo lordly as to ſay, this or that muſt be done.
For when men take vpon them to rule vs by lawes and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of their owne making, it is certayne that they doo but (as yee
woulde ſay) make infinite cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s to ſtrangle poore ſoules withall.
S. Paule then ſheweth that the libertie which he preached, &amp; for the
<pb facs="tcp:23060:281"/>
mayntenance wherof he ſtoode ſo ſtoutly agaynſt the deceiuers, is
not that men ſhould ouerſhote the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues &amp; take leaue to do what
they liſt, but that they might freely ſerue god, &amp; be no more racked
and tormented with vnquietneſſe, as we ſee poore ignorant ſoules
to be, who beeing hild faſt in ſuperſtition, are euermore in doubte
and grudge of conſcience, making queſtions of euery thing, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
beeing reſolued of any one poynt. Of which ſort alſo are the
Papiſts, who haue an infinite number of doubts among them. And
no maruell at all: for they knowe not too what maſter they muſt
yeeld their account. Euery of them talkes according to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of his owne brayne: [one ſayes] to my ſeeming ſuch a thing
would be good: [another ſayes] Lo this my deuotion telleth me:
[and the third ſays] it were good yet that this or that were doone
more. Now when they be once entred into ſuche a maze, at length
they fall to doubting whether they may kembe their heades or no,
and make a ſcrupulouſneſſe with whiche finger they ſhoulde feede
themſelues, and of euery thing elſe. To bee ſhort, there is neyther
ende nor meaſure of their fondneſſe.<note place="margin">Cal. 2. d. 21.</note> VVhen S. Paule intendeth to
ſhew what it is to be wrapped in mens traditions: he ſaith that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they haue once forbidden too eate fleſh, anone after they forbid to
taſt it: and when they haue forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to taſt it, ſoone after they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
to touch it. Yee ſee then that the way for vs to maynteyne the
libertie that is purchaſed for vs by the death &amp; paſsion of our lord
Ieſus Chriſt, is firſt too knowe in what wiſe God will bee ſerued
and honored, to the ende wee be not toſſed with ſo many ſcruples
of conſcience for want of diſcerning what is good or euill, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
fully and certenly with our ſelues, to follow Gods word,
aſſuring our ſelues alſo, that in ſo dooing wee can not doo amiſſe.
And ſecondly to ſerue one anothers turne, that none of vs bee ſo
addicted to his owne ſelfe as to ouermate his fellowes, but bee ſo
gentle &amp; kindharted as euery of vs haue an eye wherin he may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage
or ſuccor his neybour: abſteyning fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all offence giuing
ſo as it be not ſayd, I care not for ſuche a one or for ſuche a one, I
paſſe not whether he ſinke or ſwim: but that (for as much as our

and ſecondly that wee agree in ſuche wiſe togither, as wee labour
through meekneſſe to matche our ſelues one with another, and to
ſerue one anothers turne, notwithſtanding that wee be free ſtill to
Godwarde as in reſpect of our conſciences.</p>
            <p>And now let vs fall down before the maieſtie of our good God
with acknowledgement of our ſinnes, praying him to make vs ſo

may both forgiue and forget our ſinnes, till we be fully clenſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

what was taught vs and tolde vs: ſayth that
God will be loued of vs, as good reaſon it is
that we ſhould firſt ſticke vnto him &amp; be knit
vnto him, and afterward that there ſhould be
ſuch a bonde of friendſhip among our ſelues,
as we might bee knit togither as members of one bodie. And our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt alſo ſayth that that is the thing wherby his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
may be knowen:<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. d. 35</note> ſhewing therin that he brought not vp any
doctrine contrarie to that which god had always giuen to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of olde time. And for that cauſe S. Paule ſayth now, <hi>that the
fulfilling of the lawe conſisteth in this worde, that we loue our neibours.</hi>
Not that God ought in the meane while to be forgotten (as I haue
tolde you heeretofore) for it is good reaſon that hee ſhould be ſet
formoſt, and bee preferred before all his creatures, in ſo muche
that for his ſake wee ought to forget euen our father and mother,
our wife and children, and all that euer is in this world. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
to loue God, and to loue our neibours in their degree, are
not things contrarie. For when euery man walketh in charitie,
thereby he ſheweth the loue that he beareth to his God, according
alſo as I haue declared. And that is the cauſe why I ſtande no longer
vpon theſe poynts. To be ſhort, if wee be giuen to our ſelues, it is a
token that wee know not what it is to cary Gods yoke: for that is
the thing whervnto our own nature driueth vs. Now (as we ſhal ſee
anone) men are wholly inclined to all euil, &amp; therwithal they giue
the bridle to all their luſts, they make war agaynſt God, &amp; al their
whole life is nothing elſe but a rebellion, which ſheweth that the

vs, til we haue beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> down al that is of our own nature. Now then
we know that he which loueth his neibours, ſeeketh not his owne,
nor is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to himſelf. That therfore is a true &amp; certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profe that we
be deſirous to obey God, &amp; to rule our life according to his word.
Alſo our Lord Ieſus Chriſt beginneth at the ſame poynt whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
to ſhew briefly what his doctrine is: It is (ſaith he) a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to renounce or forſake ourſelues. For ſo long as we followe
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:23060:282"/>
our own trace, we muſt needes go ful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to Gods wil. So then
it is not without cauſe that S. Paule ſaith in this text, that the whole

of it: for ſome be ful of wilineſſe &amp; malice like foxes: ſome are
full of pride like lions: ſome are like rauening wolues, that ſeeke
nothing but to deuour al: and otherſome are ful of ſhrewd turnes
and harmefulneſſe [like Apes.] All theſe (as much as in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is) do
cut themſelues off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the aray &amp; companie of neibours: but in this
cace we may obſerue Gods order. And although men on their ſide
deſerue not to be counted &amp; taken for neibours: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in bearing them loue, wee ſhewe it is good reaſon that God
ſhould ouerwey our owne naughtineſſe. VVee ſee then that ſuche
as are our enimies &amp; labour to deuour vs, do notwithſtanding not
ceaſe to be our neibors, in reſpect of the order that God hath ſet
And for the ſame cauſe alſo our Lord Ieſus Chriſt telleth vs,<note place="margin">Matth. 5. g. 46.</note> that it
is no charitie to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence him that hath done vs a good turne or
ſeruice, nor to loue thoſe whom we like off, or at whoſe hands wee
looke for ſome profite. For the heathen do as much as that comes
too, but they do it not to obey God &amp; his law, and when we haue
regard of our own profite, it is rather a louing of our ſelues tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any
poynt of charitie. For the marks that chatitie ſhooteth at are God
and the communion or felowſhip that ought to be among vs, as I
haue ſaid afore. Now then we ſee it is a true proofe that we be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to loue God, when we indeuer to doo good euen too them
that are vnworthy of it. Moreouer the adding of this ſaying, <hi>as
our ſelues,</hi> is not to the intent that euery man ſhould firſt loue him
ſelfe, and then afterwarde loue his neybour nexte. But our Lorde
ment too rippe vp the ſore th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> hindereth vs too liue in charitie:
whiche is (as I haue tolde you alreadie) that if men were not
<pb facs="tcp:23060:283"/>
ſo giuen to ſelfeloue as they be, there would be good loue &amp; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
among all men: but foraſmuch as wee be ſo much giuen to
loue ourſelues, and the exceſſe of that affection blindeth vs in ſuch
wiſe, that it bereeueth vs of all reaſon, equitie, and vprightneſſe:
therfore God ſaith that we muſt loue our neighbours as ourſelues.
For were not that ſayd expreſly: we would talke muche of louing
our neighbours, &amp; ſay they ought to be loued: but all would be but
diſsimulation, after the maner of theſe hypocrites, whiche proteſt
that they would their enimies no harme, but rather that they wiſh
them good, and could find in their hearts to procure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good. But
let vs come to the triall that God ſetteth downe heere, &amp; let euery
man looke into himſelf, &amp; then let him iudge whether he loue him
ſelf to much or no, or whether the loue that he beareth towards his
neybours, be not ouerfaynt &amp; cold. To be ſhort, here God ment to
remedie the hypocriſie wherwith we be too much blinded. Alſo he
ment to waken men, that they might learne to leaue their flattering
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues when it is ſayd, it is not inough for you to loue one an
other, but ye muſt loue your neibours as your ſelues. And thereby
we ſee how farre we be wide from the perfection of the Lawe, and
that it ſtandeth vs in hande to fight agaynſt our owne nature that
we may obey God. VVhat is then the true exerciſe of Chriſtians? It
is to acknowledge &amp; bewayle their own ſinfulneſſe and infirmitie
in diſcharging their dutie towards God, and thervpon to labor and
indeuer to winne of them ſelues from day to day, ſo as their luſtes
may not ouermaſter them, but rather that God may haue ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie,
that in ſtead of louing our ſelues, we may labour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
our ſelues in dooing good wherſoeuer he calleth vs. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
S. Paule hauing ſhewed the perfection of the law, &amp; the mark
that wee muſte ame at to rule our life according to Gods worde,
addeth <hi>that if men doo bite and ſnatche one at another lyke Dogges and
Cattes, they muste needes bee conſumed in the ende.</hi> And this is too
ſhame them the more, whiche are ſo fleſhed in their quarellings
and brawlings, and doo ſo cloſe their eyes agaynſt all reaſon,
that they care not what come of it ſo they maye ſatiſfie their luſte
of reuenging. And what ſhall yee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ne by it ſayth Sainct Paule?
Naturally yee couet too preſerue youre ſelues: for that is
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:23060:283"/>
common too vs euen with the beaſts. Yee ſee that the beaſt which
hath nother reaſon nor vnderſtanding, doth notwithſtanding labor
to preſerue himſelfe, and ſhunneth harme. Much more reaſon is it
that men which diſcerne betweene good and bad, ſhould haue the
ſame indeuer of mainteyning themſelues, and of continuing ſafe &amp;
ſound. But now let vs ſee what followeth vpon hatred, quareling,
brawling, ſtrife, rayling, and ſuch other like things. It followeth that
wee muſt bee all conſumed in the end. Needes then muſt the diuel
haue vtterly bereft them of all reaſon, which rage and ruſhe foorth
after that faſhion in their exceſſyue hatred, and cannot by any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
bee moderated. Too bee ſhort, S. Paule ſheweth that although
there were no Lawe of God too make vs afrayd too offend him:
yet if wee were well aduiſed or had any droppe of diſcretion in
vs: wee ſhould haue ſome ſtay of ourſelues, ſo as wee ſhould not
quarell and brawle one with another as wee doo. But wee runne
wilfully and as it were of ſet purpoſe into our deſtruction: and that
is ageinſt nature. Yee ſee then how diueliſh men become whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
bee once chafed, inſomuch that they ſeeke their owne decay. And
why do wee hate our enemies? It is bicauſe wee will needes gyue
brydle to our affections. But marke our excuce: O (ſay wee) they
ment mee harme, they procured it, and they haue done it. Very wel-what
for that? VVhat ſhalt thou win by making two diuels of one
(as the prouerb ſayth)? or by ſeeking too make the fyre too burne
hotter which is kindled ynough and to much alreadie? It wyll but
dubble his rage and make him feercer than he was before. Seing it
is ſo: why wilt thou go about to end the matter with the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of you both? Howbeit, if wee ſhould do it in none other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
than that, it were not ynough: for therin wee ſhould bee too
fleſhly. For if I abſteine from all hatred, bycauſe I ſhoulde receyue
harme by it, I doo ſtill ſeeke mine owne profit. But God will haue
vs to ſhet our eyes continually in reſpect of our owneſelues, and
to ſhake of all ill will, and to tread all ſtrife vnder foote. And why?
To the end that he himſelfe may haue all mayſterhod ouer vs. And
although men giue vs cauſe too hate them for their naughtineſſe:
yet notwithſtanding foraſmuch a God hath knit vs together, let
vs abyde in that vnitie. Therfore the honour that wee muſt yeelde
<pb facs="tcp:23060:284"/>
vnto God, is to renounce ourſelues, to the end we may loue them
that hate vs. And as I haue tolde you alreadie, this warning is not
ſuperfluous. For Sainct Paules intent is too ſhame ſuche as are ſo
firie at the firſt daſhe, that reaſon can neither appeaſe them nor
ſtay them. Therefore when men be ſo hot, and fling themſelues at
al aduenture: things muſt bee alledged agreeable to their nature,
to make them aſhamed, that they may bee drawen too the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of God. S. Paule then ment heere to bring vs by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to the ouercomming of all our affections, which are to farre out
of ſquare, too the end that whenſoeuer wee bee prouoked to hate
any man, or to be reuenged of him, we may conſider thus with our
ſelues: what will bee the end of it, but that we ſhall one of vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
another lyke dogges and cattes? And when we haue conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that, wee muſt proceede yet further: which is, that althoughe
our hatred myght aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage vs neuer ſo much, although we might
alwayes haue the vpper hand of our enemyes, and although wee
could bring all our practizes and attempts to effect: I ſay although
wee might haue aduauntage by gyuing head to our paſsions: yet
were it but a prouoking of Gods wrath, ſeing we could not yeelde
ſo farre vnto him, as to loue thoſe that are vnworthie. Sith the caſe
ſtandeth ſo, let vs bee afraid &amp; ſubmit ourſelues with all humilitie.
And foraſmuch as it is a hard thing, let vs fight ſo much the more
manfully, tyll God haue gotten the mayſterie, and wee renounced
our ſelues as I ſayde, forſaking all our owne nature, too the ende
that wee may keepe the ſacred vnitie which he did ſet among vs,
when it pleaſed him that wee ſhould bee one fleſh. Now herevpon
Sainct Paule addeth, that if wee mind to reſtreine the luſtes of our
fleſhe from reigning in vs: wee muſte <hi>walke in the ſpirit.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
the battell is ryght harde: ſo that wee doo not what wee
would do: but although God haue reformed vs and touched vs to
the quick, ſo as wee would fayne pleaſe him in all poynts: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
wee ſhall not yet atteyne too perfection, bycauſe our
owne nature will alwayes leade vs vntoo euill. But before wee go
any further, wee muſt marke that by the word <hi>Fleſhe,</hi> Sainct Paule
meaneth all that is in man, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> what euer we bring with vs by our
birth. According alſo as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt declareth ſufficiently
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:23060:284"/>
in the third of Iohn.<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. a. 6</note> That which is borne of fleſhe (ſayth he) is fleſh.
By the woorde <hi>Spirit</hi> he meaneth not the Soule of man, but the
grace whych God giueth vs when he bringeth vs backe to his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
&amp; correcteth our vyces &amp; all that is contrarie to his word.
And the terming of men by the name of <hi>Fleſh</hi> in the holy ſcripture.
is in way of contempte. But yet in this texte it is a marke of vyce
and corruption. Sometymes when the Scripture ſpeaketh of fleſh,
it ſaythe:<note place="margin">Pſal. 78. d. 39.</note> verie well, what elſe are men but fleſhe? that is too
ſay, but rottenneſſe? Ageine, all fleſhe is graſſe. And ageine, what
are the Aegyptians?<note place="margin">Eſai. 40. b. 6.</note> They bee fleſhe and not ſpirit. Yee ſee then
that vnder this woord fleſhe, men are taught their owne frayltie,
and doone to vnderſtand that they be but earth and duſt,<note place="margin">Eſai. 31. a. 3</note> wormes,
and woormes meate. And this ſerues firſt of all to humble them.
But when fleſhe is matched ageynſt Spirite, then are not men
taken in their firſt ſtate as they were created of God: but it ſerueth
too ſhewe that they bee corrupted and full of infection and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,
ſo as there is no taſte at all in them to diſcerne aright,
but they are vtterly peruerted in all their luſtes. Yee ſee then that
whereas our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſayth wee bee fleſhe euen from our
birth: his meaning is that wee bee blind wretches, which haue no
wit at all too come vntoo God: and that although he haue put an
vnderſtandyng in vs to diſcerne good &amp; euill: yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
wee bee growen brutiſh, and cannot come to him, and al the reaſon
that we haue, ſerueth but to make vs vnexcuſable: and finally that
we couet nothing but vtter euil, &amp; that loke how many affections
wee haue, ſo many are the enemyes that fighte ageynſt all rygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe.
Lo how the holie Ghoſt blazeth our armes, wheras
moſt men bragge of their owne free wyll and of their vertues: it
is ſayd that there is nothing in vs but ſtarke corruption, &amp; that the
ſame is as an enmitie againſt God, and ſeparateth vs from his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe.
True it is, that our Soule or mind is oftentimes called
by the name of Spirit: for the woord <hi>Spirite</hi> or <hi>Ghoste</hi> betokeneth
an inuiſible ſubſtance, which cannot be ſeen nor felt as can a body.
The Angells are Spirites, and ſo are the Diuells alſo. Howbeit
theſe are corrupted ſpirites and alienated from God, ſo as there is
nothing but vtter wickedneſſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>em. So then our ſoules alſo are
<pb facs="tcp:23060:285"/>
Spirites, but yet they bee ſpirits infected with ſin, which thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
too them when wee were chaunged and abaced and Gods
image defaced in vs by the fall of Adam. Now then there had need
to be ſome renewment therof: and that renewment is called ſpirit,
which is when God reformeth vs and maketh vs new creatures by
his holy ſpirit. The firſt poynt wherof is, that we be inlightened ſo
as we conceiue the things that were hidden from vs by nature: for
faith is the ſpeciall gift of God, bycauſe it is impoſsible for man to
conceiue the things that are for his ſoule health, vnleſſe God haue
wrought in him. Yee ſee then that fayth is a gift of the ſpirit (as wee
ſhall ſee hereafter in due time and place) inſomuch that as wee haue
not one good motion to come vnto God, and to frame ourſelues
to his will, except he gouerne vs: ſo alſo foraſmuch as he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted
vs, he giueth vs his holy ſpirit, which is the true marke that
ſheweth vs to bee Gods children. Too bee ſhort, looke whatſoeuer
God putteth intoo his choſen and faithfull ones too correct theyr
wicked and ſinfull nature: the ſame is comprehended vnder the
word Spirit. Now S. Paule ſayth that wee muſt walke after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and then wee ſhall not fulfill the luſtes of our fleſhe. Hereby he
giueth warning too ſuch as delight too much in their owne vyces
and take leaue to do naughtily vnder pretence that they be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
too withſtand it. Heere he wakeneth them vp, and telleth them
that they be without excuſe: and that although they bee giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
naughtineſſe, yet they ought too ſeeke the remedie of it. And
what is that? Truely wee ſhall not finde it in ourſelues, but God
will ſupply in that behalfe, by giuing vs grace to fight in ſuch wyſe
againſt all our luſtes and wicked affections, as his holy ſpirite ſhall
reigne in vs, and get the vpper hande of them. God will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
vs in making vs ſuch promiſe: and therefore let vs hye vs to
him as diſeaſed folke to a Phiſition. To bee ſhort, S. Paule hath an
eye to the excuſe that men would bring, and are wont too bring in
this cace. O (ſay they) wee bee fleſhly, and charitie is an Angelicall
perfection: and how then can wee keepe it, ſeing wee be giuen to
all euill, and our owne ſinfulneſſe caryeth vs away? If ſinne reigned
not in vs, then it might be ſayd that wee ought to bee vnited vntoo
God: but our frayltie is to great. Thus yee ſee what excuce many
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:23060:285"/>
folke alledge, thinking to be quit by it. But S. Paule ſayth: It is true
that there is nothing but a gulfe of all naughtineſſe in vs, and that
as long as men ſlumber after that faſhion in their owne affections,
they muſt needes ſerue the diuell, and become euery daye more
beaſts than other: but ſeeke the remedie. God calleth you to him
by his Goſpell, he offereth you his holy ſpirit. So then, condemne
the euill, that yee may be ſorie for it, and God will ſo worke in you
as he will get the vpper hand of all your affections. Yee ſee then
what S. Paule ment in this text. Neuertheleſſe therwithall he ment
too giue an ouerthwart blowe to thoſe ageinſt whom he diſputeth.
For I haue tolde you heeretofore, that the deceyuers which had
troubled the Church of that Countrie, were giuen to many pelting
tryfles which were vtterly needeleſſe, in ſo much as they grounded
all holyneſſe vppon the Ceremonies of the Lawe. Now, it is true
that Gods inioyning of the Ceremonies for a time was not in vain:
for they were figures till the comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.
But now that he is come, they bee vnprofitable things, and things
that hinder vs from walking as we ſhould do. For the Ceremonies
and ſhadowes were helpes to bring the auncient fathers too our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt. But if wee ſhould holde them ſtill now adayes,
they would make vs to turne our backe to Ieſus Chriſt: ſo that it is
not without cauſe that S. Paule hath ſhewed heretofore, that the
keeping of ſuch things is no more of any valew: and he wil ſpeake
yet more of it hereafter. Now then foraſmuch as he had to diſpute
ageinſt ſuch as did ſet forth the Ceremonies, he ſayth vntoo them,
<hi>walke after the ſpirit.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, conſider which is the true
ſeruice of God: it conſiſteth not in Lampes, nor in Incenſe, nor in
Circumciſion, nor in the obſeruing of dayes, nor in forbearing too
eate any certeine kind of meates. Theſe are not the things wheron
God will haue his to reſt: but [he will haue them to reſt] vpon his
ſpirituall ſeruice. <hi>Therefore walke yee in the ſpirit, and then ſhall yet not
fulfill the lustes of the fleſhe.</hi> Howbeit, as I haue told you before, this
is not all. But yet by the way S. Paule doth after an indirect maner
glaunce at this, that the deceyuers ageinſt whom he ſtroue, were
graueled in thoſe ſmall and light <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ings, which are but as introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this world, and as traynementes of yong children. For as
<pb facs="tcp:23060:286"/>
much therfore as they were vtterly intangled in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: he telleth the
Galathians that they muſt walke in the ſpirite. Furthermore (as I
haue declared alreadie) here he ſetteth downe the true meane too
knit vs togither in loue. For it is vnpoſsible for vs too come vntoo
God and too forget all enmitie, till wee haue fought manfully [a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinſt
our owne affections] And the remedie therof (as I ſayd) is in
God. Therfore wee muſt pray him to increaſe the grace of his holy
ſpirit more and more in vs, and then wee ſhall finde that the fleſhe,
how furious ſo euer it bee, how great bubbles and boylings ſo euer
it caſt vp, yea and though it ſeeme like a wyld beaſt that cannot be
tamed: I ſay wee ſhall find that it ſhall not be ſtronger than Gods
ſpirit, and the grace that ſhal bee giuen vs from aboue, which ſhal be
able too bring vs backe, and too hold vs vnder the yoke and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of our God. Too bee ſhort S. Paule declareth, that the cauſe
why we cannot reſiſt our leaud luſtes, proceedeth of our own neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
and coldneſſe, bycauſe euery of vs fodeth himſelfe in hys
naughtineſſe by vaine ſelfſoothing, and wee go not too God with
ſuch affection and zeale as were requiſite. Then let vs conclude that
there is no excuſe for men when they ſinne. For they delight in it,
and woulde fayne that God ſhoulde let them welter in it, and (as
much as they can) they flee the remedie and amendment of it, yea
and they bee ſo ſotted in it, as they paſſe not too prouoke Gods
wrath, bicauſe they cannot in any wiſe abyde too bee taught. It is
true that ſometymes they will well ynoughe proteſt wyth theyr
mouth, that they would very faine haue their nature: and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
chaunged: but yet would they ſtill couenant with God, that he
ſhould let them alone as they be, without altering of any thing, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the faſhyon of a ſicke man, who if his diſeaſe doo preſſe hym,
wyll ſaye, ô I woulde fayne bee healed: but yet for all that, when
he commeth too receyuing of counſell at the Phiſitions hand, and
that he ſhould be appoynted a dyet: he will not yeeld to that. The
Phiſition giues him good Counſell, and hath helpes ready to heale
his diſeaſe: but yet notwithſtanding, the patient excuſeth himſelfe,
ſaying, O Sir, my hart will not ſerue mee too doo it. If a ſicke man
will needes drinke, and in ſtead <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> heate take colde, and bee ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
as he cannot bee brydled, but refuſeth all that is miniſtred too
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:23060:286"/>
him for his health, and playes the mad bedlem: he may well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
that he would fayne be cured, but the flat contrarie appeereth.
Euen ſo is it with them that reſort vnto God too pray him too go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
them in ſuch wiſe by his holy ſpirite, as they may bee chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and forget all their luſtes, and put them vnder foote: and yet
in the meane while will needes continue and welter in them ſtill.
Thus yee ſee in effect what wee haue to beare in mynd. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it is certeine that although wee pray to God earneſtly, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
of vs ſtreine himſelfe to ſubdue his wicked affections: yet we
ſhall not ceaſſe too haue infirmities ſtill howſoeuer the world go.
I ſpeake not of the hypocrites, I ſpeake of the true childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God.
For they that haue profited moſt in all perfection, go ſtill as it were
limping vntoo Godward, neither doo they what they would as S.
Paule will adde anon after, and as he ſheweth more at large in the
vij. to the Romans. Neuertheleſſe aſſone as the faithfull feele theyr
diſeaſe, they ſeeke the remedie of it in God, yea and they ſeeke it
earneſtly &amp; vnfeinedly, and perceiue that his ſuccor ſurmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth all
their owne leaud affections. According herevnto S. Paule ſayth, <hi>yee
ſhall not fulfill the luſtes of the fleſhe.</hi> He ſayth not, that of all our lyfe
long Satan ſhal not tempt vs to do any euill, nor that wee ſhall not
haue ſtore of prouocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for our fleſh ſhal alwayes haue his ſtings
to ſtir vs vp vnto naughtineſſe. Therefore we ſhal be tempted to all
vices: but yet ſhal we withſtand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Gods grace. And not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cauſe is this added: for if we were not warranted that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
our ſeruice though it be faultie &amp; we weake, &amp; though we
run not with ſuch corage as were requiſite: euery of vs ſhould be as
it were beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> down, and in the end wee ſhould fall into diſpaire as it
happeneth to diuers, who vpon the examining of their owne liues,
finding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſo vnperfect &amp; ſtill far off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
not to haue profited at all, and thervpon fall to chaſing &amp; fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
&amp; finally become ſtarke mad. Truly we ought to go foreward
to the ſayd perfection, and to labor continually for it: but yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
wee fare, let vs not ceaſſe to ſeeke God though we cannot
come at hym by reaſon of the great number of lettes and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
&amp; though we now and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> make falſe ſteppes, &amp; our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
luſtes hold vs backe, hinder vs, and lie ſore vpon vs (as I ſayd:)
<pb facs="tcp:23060:287"/>
let vs not forſake our way for all that, though wee bee ſhaken now
and then. Although then that by nature we cannot keepe our way
luſtily to come vnto our God: yet is it ynough that we fulfill not
the luſts of our fleſh: for although we feele them, &amp; although they
be ouerſtrong in vs: yet if we ouercome them God accepteth it, &amp;
forgiueth vs all the whole default. According wherunto S. Paul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting
the faithfull not to caſt downe their harts out of meaſure:
ſaith that the fleſh reigneth not in vs. He ſaith not that wicked luſtes
and ſinfull affections dwell not any more in vs: for we ſhall neuer
bee rid of them till it pleaſe God too take vs too himſelfe? Then
till ſuch time as wee bee out of this world, there ſhall alwayes bee
blemiſhes and ſpottes in vs, and wee muſt be fayne too ſtoupe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the fardell of our ſinnes and infirmities, and that is too the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to humble vs the more, and to ſhew that our lyfe is a continual
battell. Moreouer although ſin dwell in vs, yet muſt it not reigne,
but Gods ſpirit muſt get the vpper hand of it, and that ſhal be done
when wee flee vntoo God with an earneſt zeale, praying him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
the euil which paſſeth our power to amend, and in ſuch wiſe
too increaſe the giftes of his ſpirit in vs, as wee may ouercome all
things that do as it were hold vs downe. Thus ye ſee what S. Paule
ment by that ſaying in this text. And he addeth therevnto, <hi>that the
ſpirit lusteth ageinſt the fleſhe, and the fleſhe ageinſt the ſpirit, ſo as we doo
not the thing that we fayne would doo.</hi> Here his meaning is to quicken
vs vp to keepe good watch, yea and too haue our harneſſe alwayes
vppon our backes as they ſay, and too bee in a readineſſe ageinſt
the enemye. If wee were cleere from all vyces, and that all men
without gaynſaying dyd follow the thing that God commaundeth
by hys worde: wee ſhoulde not neede too ſtreine ourſelues much,
no more than the Angels of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who neede not to fight, for they
be ready to do al that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded them. Foraſmuch then as there
is no rebelliouſneſſe in the Angels: therfore alſo they haue no ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
when they ſhould giue themſelues to the ſeruice of God: for
they bee wholly bent and inclined thervnto. But S. Paule letteth vs
that wee muſt not bee ſlouthfull in ſeruing of God. And why? for
our nature draggeth alwayes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ke, and wee ſhoulde neuer loue
goodneſſe, except wee were inforced and compelled to it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:23060:287"/>
men muſt inforce and conſtreyne themſelues, and mainteyne
battell as againſt a deadly enimie, when they intende to go forward
in goodneſſe. And who bee our enemies? Truly the diuell is the
cheefe, and he giueth vs terrible aſſaults. But yet therwithall, all our
owne thoughtes, all our owne affections, all our deſires, are all
deadly enemies that labor to bring vs to deſtruction. Nowe if they
fight againſt God, it is certaine that they bee alſo againſt our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
VVe ſee then how S. Paules meaning here, is as though he had
cried out alaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſhew that if Chriſtians be either ſlepiſh or ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and think to ſerue God at their owne eaſe: they beguile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
&amp; that foraſmuch as they haue battell vpon battell to indure
without end or ceaſsing, and Satan tempteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> day and night, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
about one while with wiles and treaſon, and another while ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them by open force to driue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the way: they muſt
arme themſelues throughly, and enter into the incounter, and hold
it out to the end, &amp; not loke to haue any peace or truce, til God take
them out of the world. Ye ſee in effect what S. Paules doctrine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth.
And this exhortation is more than neceſſarie for vs, bicauſe
moſt men think it ynough, if they haue but ſome little deuotion or
willingneſſe to ſerue God: and although they welter in much filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
al is one to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and otherſome repine when they ſee how hard
a thing it is to rule their life wel. And how is that poſsible? God ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to preſſe vs out of meaſure, for he ſeketh not what may pleaſe
vs, but rather condemneth it. But how ſhal we bring to paſſe that we
may put our ſelues to it? For our inclination goeth clean contrary to
his will. It ſeemeth then that he mocketh vs when he preaſſeth ſo
vpon vs: and why doth he not giue vs another maner of nature than
that? Lo how diuerſe men blaſpheme God, in hauing an eie to their
owne ſinfulneſſe. Howbeit to the end that none of vs fall aſleepe, ne
thinke himſelf to haue performed al that God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth, when we
ſhall haue folowed ſome path halfe way, nor be vtterly thruſt out of
the way altogither: S. Paule ſayth that the fleſh luſteth againſt the
ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh. In ſaying that the fleſh luſteth,
he doth vs to wit, that we ſhall neuer be able to ſerue God without
diſquieting, bycauſe we ſhall haue many lets, and be continually te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto euill. Yea and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſelues wholy vnto Gods word and righteouſneſſe: yet neuertheleſſe
the diuell ſhall euen then haue his ropes to draw vs one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Again, he will in ſuch wiſe amaze vs, as our fleſhly deſires ſhall
ſtill be a hinderance to vs, and not only that: but alſo make vs too
draw backe the cleane contrarie way, ſo that when God calleth vs
on the one ſide, wee ſhall bee caried with a rage too the other ſide.
Nowe ſeeing that the fleſh luſteth after that maner againſt the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite:
let vs determine to fight manfully, and let it not greeue vs ſo
to do. Although we ought to wiſhe to bee as Angelles, ſo as there
might be no ſtriuing in vs, but that al our abilitie might be imployed
too the ſeruice of God, yet notwithſtanding, whenſoeuer wee bee
letted to do well, let vs learne to ſtreyne our ſelues, and to holde our
ſelues as priſoners: and althoughe the ſame fall out greatly to our
diſcontentment, yet neuertheleſſe let vs go on ſtill further, that
God may winne the vpper hande of vs. Let vs learne too hate our
ſelues, to take diſpleaſure agaynſt our ſelues, and to be reuenged of
our owne naughtineſſe,<note place="margin">2. Co. 7. c. 11</note> as Saint Paule ſayeth in the ſecond too the
Corinthians. For Repentance importeth that men ſhould condemne
themſelues, hate themſelues, and take vengeance on themſelues,
when they ſee their whole life corrupted, and that they ſhould vſe
an holy anger againſt it. In ſted of deſiring to be reuenged of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
when they haue done vs any harme, we ſhould be chafed &amp;
angry with our ſelues, yea and puniſh our ſelues for faults, when we
cannot frame our ſelues vnto Gods wil. But foraſmuch as we might
become deſperate, and euerie man replie, Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, how ſhould we fight
after that faſhion? VVhere is our ſtrength? For there is nothing but
weakneſſe in vs, and againe we ſee that the diuell is ſo mightie and
ſtrong an enimie, as wee can neuer bee able to ſubdue him, and our
luſtes are as mad beaſts, without reaſon, without meaſure, without
ſtay: by reaſon whereof we be as good as vanquiſhed, euen before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſtroke be ſtriken: S. Paule ſayth that the ſpirite doth alſo luſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
the fleſh: that is to ſay, tht whereas we be prouoked to do
euill of our owne nature, and the diuel thruſteth vs forward, it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs on hande to fight ſo much the more valiantly againſt all the
temptations wherewith we be pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d and ſpurred. And in ſo doing
we haue a good helpe. For who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all gaine the goale? VVho ſhall
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:23060:288"/>
haue the vpper hande and mayſtrie? Shall the corruption that is in
vs? or ſhall the power of God haue it? Therefore whenſoeuer God
liſteth to vtter the grace of his holy ſpirite, he ſhall alwayes bee the
ſtronger and win the field, how great hardneſſe ſoeuer there bee in
the matter. So then let vs do ſo much honour vnto God, as to truſt
that he will vphold vs, and make vs to winne the battel, and let vs
march on boldly vnder his banner, howbeit in calling vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him with
reuerence and wareneſſe. For (as I haue ſhewed alreadie) S. Paule
ment not to make it too hard a matter, bicauſe men are ouermuch
inclyned to ſlouthfulneſſe. He ment not to rocke men aſleepe: no,
but he telleth vs, firſt that wee muſt become enemies to our ſelues,
and fight agaynſt our owne thoughts, and agaynſt all our affections,
to ſerue God aright. But nowe, bicauſe we might be aſtoniſhed, and
euerie of vs might drawe backe bycauſe it is impoſsible for vs too
bring it aboute: hee ſayeth, Shall not Gods ſpirite get the vpper
hande? Yes, but wee haue it not. And of whome is that long, but
for that wee reſort not too him that is readie too giue it vs,<note place="margin">Eſa. 55. a. 1.</note> yea
verely in ſuch meaſure and portion as he knoweth too bee for our

athirſt, come to the water, take both wyne, water, and milke, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
money or ware: for I am readie too giue you bountifully as
much as you neede. Lo howe God ſpeaketh. Likewiſe our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt alſo telleth vs, that he is the true fountaine whereout
of it behoueth vs to draw,<note place="margin">Iohn. 7. f. 37.</note> and that we ſhall bee ſatiſfied with his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
according as he ſaith in the .vij. of S. Iohn, that whoſoeuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to him, ſhall drinke his fill of water, yea and haue ſuch a well
in himſelfe, as Riuers ſhall guſhe out of it, ſo as hee ſhall not onely
haue ynough to ſerue his owne turne, but alſo the waters ſhall flow
out of his bellie, if hee ſuffer Ieſus Chriſt to poure out his ſpirite
vpon him, for he is preſt and readie to do it. So then although Gods
ſpirite bee a great waye off from vs: yet ſhall wee receyue y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of it, and God is readie to giue it vs, and hee will doo it by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath promiſed it, and foraſmuch as hee allureth vs ſo gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
wee ſhall receyue as muche as ſhall ſted our turne. Therefore
like as wee bee warned heere too fight, yea euen wyth myght and
mayne: ſo on the other ſyde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhewed vs that our victorie is
<pb facs="tcp:23060:289"/>
moſt certaine and infallible, ſo we ſeeke ſuccour at Gods hande, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
our own weakeneſſe, and confeſsing humbly that we
can do nothing. If wee repayre to our God, and deſire him to bee
our Phiſition: his holy ſpirite ſhall not be ſo weake, but he ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
all the paſsions of our fleſhe, and giue vs the grace too go
through with all the battels that ſhall bee ſet agaynſt vs. And nowe
againe Saint Paule ſayeth, <hi>that the faythfull do not what they woulde:</hi>
and that is to giue them courage ſtill, that we may learne to go on
forwarde, though we can not bring all the things to paſſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and perfectly which God ſheweth vntoo vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this is needfull
as I ſayde: for elſe wee ſhoulde bee hypocrites, and beare our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
in hande that nothing were amiſſe. But ſuch pride were intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable:
of which ſort we ſee ſome maſtife dogges, in whome there
is neyther feare of God nor Religion, and yet they preach that the
faythfull ought to be perfect. And that is a diueliſh blaſphemie, and
ſuch a one as wee ought too abhorre. There are others that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre
when they ſee that they cannot diſcharge their duetie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God. To the end therfore that we may neither be hypocrites
nor yet faint, S. Paule ſayth that we do not all that we woulde. But
howſoeuer wee fare, wee muſte come backe to that which he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
not long ſince: namely that we fulfill not the luſts of the fleſh
when wee bee gouerned by the holy Ghoſt. So then, firſt let vs
vnderſtande, that wee bee ſo giuen vntoo euill, that a man cannot
wring out one drop of goodneſſe out of our thoughts &amp; affections,
but they alienate vs quite and cleane from it. Marke that for one
poynt. Secondly let vs truſt in God, that notwithſtanding our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
yea, and rebellions, he will make vs to walke in his obedience.
For wee ſhall be gouerned by his holy ſpirite, who will make vs too
feele ſuch a working in vs, as we ſhall not be hilde backe nor hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
too go forwarde in our good race, but keepe on ſtill to the mark
that wee ame at. Thirdly, if wee ſee yet ſome reſiſtance in our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
and that wee had neede too bee inforced more and more, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that many ouerthwart things doo let vs, inſomuch that wee
doo euen fall, or elſe happen too runne aſtray: let vs not bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
for all that, but let vs followe the holy calling of God,
and ſtill learne effectually to cut o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> our vyces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:23060:289"/>
And to bring that to paſſe, let vs be ſorie for them, and confeſſe
them willingly before God. But howſoeuer wee fare, let vs not
thinke our ſelues forſaken of him, though our life be neuer ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.
Thus ye ſee that the thing which we haue to beare in mind,
is that all the imperfections and infirmities that wee feele as yet in
our ſelues, ſhall not reſtreyn our indeuering to ſubmit our ſelues to
our God, and to frame our ſelues more and more in his feare, &amp; yet
notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that in the meane while we ſhall not haue any towel
of flatterie before our eies to blind our ſelues withall, but we ſhal be
hartily ſory, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſsing our ſelues to be excedingly indetted vnto him
and yet neuertheleſſe aſpiring ſtil to the perfection wherevnto we
muſt go onward all the time of our life, and therwithal acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
that we are all forlorne and damned, vnleſſe that he of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
goodneſſe do beare with vs for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſtes ſake.</p>
            <p>But now let vs fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God
with acknoledgement of our faults, praying him to make vs feele
them more and more, ſo as wee may not onely confeſſe them with
our mouth, but alſo be touched with ſuch true repentance and pure
zeale, as we may indeuer to giue our ſelues wholly vnto him, and to
cut off all the ſuperfluities that are in vs, and as the ſame may cauſe
vs to frame our ſelues to his holy wil, and to ſerue him in ſuch vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and concord, that we may be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to magnifie him with one hart,
and with one mouth, thereby ſhewing that we be rightly knit vnto
him in the adoption which he ſheweth vs by his Goſpel, wherby he
ſheweth himſelfe to be our father, as faine as we would be his true
children. And therfore let vs al ſay, Almightie God our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly. &amp;c.</p>

Now if God bee the rule of all perfection, then
of neceſsitie all that is contrarie to his nature &amp;

that the fleſh is at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall war agaynſt the

Seeing it is ſo, we muſt needes conclude, that there is nothing in vs
but vtter lewdneſſe and ſinfulneſſe. Nowe when we heere ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

in their ſelfweening, that they paſſe not of prouoking Gods wrath

ſaid this morning that men in all their thoughts &amp; affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do fight
againſt God: addeth this declaration which we haue now preſently
heard, as though he brought forth the fruites, to the ende that men
might thereby iudge what the tree is, bicauſe the roote which is the
cheef thing lieth hid. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like as the tree is knowne by his fruits, ſo
alſo the ſinfulneſſe that reigneth in vs, and in our nature is founde
out by the workes that come of it. And ſo we ſee why S. Paul addeth
here, <hi>that the workes of the fleſh are manifest.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, men
ſhet their eies that they may not perceiue their owne naughtineſſe,
and beare themſelues in hande that there is nothing but vertue in
them, when notwithſtanding, their vices are ſo huge and exceſsiue,
as they be readie to burſt with them: when they haue pleaded their
beſt, &amp; ſought al the ſtarting holes that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue wrung
their mouth awry, &amp; turkined things neuer ſo much, yet muſt they
in the end come to this point, that our life crieth out loude &amp; ſhirle
what we be. Therfore the works of the fleſh are all manifeſt. So then
this is inough to diſproue ſuch as would faine cloke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues &amp; vſe
painting, as though they were not giltie before God. Truth it is that
S. Paul doth not make here a ful beadrol of al the vices that god co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
in his law: but only ſetteth forth ſome examples wherby a

if he had intended to haue made ſuch a reckning vp of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but
this was inough, that ſuch as wene to gain by their hipocriſie might
be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uicted here, as ye ſee they be. And for the better vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
hereof, we haue to mark breefly, which is the rule wherby to walk in
obedience towards god,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. c. 11.</note> according to the. 2. of Tit. wher it is ſaid that
gods grace appeered to the ende we ſhould lead a holy conuerſation
here beneath in this world, in modeſtie &amp; rightuouſnes wayting for
the hope of the life that is promiſed vs, &amp; for the comming of the
great Sauior, which muſt gather vs vp to himſelfe into the kingdom
of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ye ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the thing wherein chriſtians muſt exerciſe
themſelues &amp; wherto they muſt wholly apply themſelues, is firſt to
know that they haue not their euerlaſting reſt &amp; heritage here, but
that the worlde is but as a ſtrange Countrey wherethrough they
<pb facs="tcp:23060:291"/>
muſt paſſe, and therefore that they muſt alwayes haue their eyes
lifted vp to heauenwarde. That is the chiefe poynt. But that cannot
be done, but the faythfull muſt needes therewithall call vpon God,
and reſort wholly vnto him. And as touching theyr life Saint Paule
ſayeth that it hath three things in it: namely, holyneſſe, that wee
ſerue God ſoundly and ſubſtancially with a pure heart, vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
all the vnclenneſſe of this worlde. That is the firſt point.
The ſeconde is, that wee muſt not bee wanton and vnhoneſt, but
that we muſt leade an honeſt life. The thirde is, that we wrong no
man, nor vſe any deceyte or crueltie, but that we indeuer to do our
neighbor good. Lo what the life of Chriſtians is. But S. Paule ſayeth
heere, that if men will not acknowledge themſelues to be vtter eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
too God, and full of all naughtineſſe and rebellion: let them
but make a ſhort inquirie, and loke into their life, and they ſhall find
that ſome of them be whoremongers, ſome drunkardes, ſome giuen
to all ribawdrie, ſome murtherers, ſome Sorcerers, ſome ſedicious,
ſome full of ambition, and otherſome deſirous to ſowe abrode dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell
and troubles, and to bring vp ſects to peruert Gods truth with
their corruptions. Thus ye ſee what is to bee found in men if theyr
liues be well ſerched. But what ſhall they win by going to law with
God, and by labouring to couer their lewdneſſe with ſhifting? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at al. Howbeit they confeſſe not it with their mouth: it is their
life that muſt ſpeake it: their life togither with al their workes that
are knowne in it, beare record of the things that I haue ſayd, and ſo
there needeth no more diſputing. Furthermore, when as S. Paule
ſayth that the workes of the fleſh are manifeſt: he meeneth not that
all thoſe whom God ſuffereth to follow their naturall ſwinge, and
whom he gouerneth not by his holy ſpirit, are atteinted with all the
vices here named: but that there is not any man which is not ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
that he abandoneth himſelfe ſometime to one naughtineſſe
and ſometime to two or three at once, as occaſion ſerueth. Yee ſhall
ſee many heathen men and vnbeleeuers, in whom there is no feare
of God, nor any knowledge of his word, which haue ſome outward
ſhew of vertue and honeſtie: yet is it no conſequent that they bee
not corrupted, howbeit that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ection is hidden and ſettled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
and there is an impoſtun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> that rotteth all within. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:23060:291"/>
the cace ſtand, there is nother rule nor meaſure in mannes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but all is out of order and confounded there. You ſee then that
the thing which we haue to gather vpon this ſtreyne, is that we muſt
not bee beguyled with our owne hypocriſie, but euery of vs muſte
haue an eye too himſelfe, and examine his owne life throughly, and
then ſhall wee all haue cauſe to caſt downe our eyes, and to ſhet our
mouthes, and therewith to acknowledge that wee be wretched, and
that there is nothing but damnation in vs. Truely although none of
the things that S. Paule rehearceth heere doo appeere in vs, ſo as we
be blameleſſe before men, yea and ſeeme too bee little Angelles: yet
ceaſſe we not too be wicked and vntoward, till God haue reformed
vs. Neuertheleſſe God giueth euery of vs ſufficient recorde in our
liues, whereby to caſt vs quite downe, and to make vs giue ouer our
pleading of our owne accord. Thus ye ſee in effect, that the meane
to put this leſſon in vre, is that if wee thinke our ſelues to bee any
thing woorth, and perceyue not the wantes that are in vs: we muſt
ſift our life, and compare our workes with the things that God bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
or forbiddeth: and then wee ſhall haue a fayre lookingglaſſe,
wherein to behold our leudneſſe and filthineſſe: and whereas it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
erſt that there was nothing but all pureneſſe and perfection in
vs: God will ſhew vs to our faces, that wee be full of wickedneſſe.
And yet neuertheleſſe when wee ſhall haue conſidered this diuerſe
and many times: let vs therevpon conclude, that it is not the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth
part of it. For we ſhall alwayes be dimſighted in finding out
of our owne wantes. Although God conſtreyne and reproue vs in
ſuch wiſe as we cannot denie it: yet will he ſhewe in the ende, that
for euery poynt that we haue knowen, there are a hundred that were
hidden from vs. And verely when wee ſee our woorkes layd open
before vs: it is to make vs go to the welſpring of them. Many men
are ſo groſſe, that if they haue not committed whoredome, if they
haue not playde the drunkardes openly, or if their filching and pilfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
haue bin ſo couertly and finely conueyed as noman could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
them, they thinke themſelues quite and cleere. But S. Paules
intent in ſaying that the woorkes of the fleſh are manifeſt, is not to
flatter men as though a ſinne were not to be condemned till it were
openly ſeene in deede. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> told you) wee muſt proceede from
<pb facs="tcp:23060:292"/>
the one to the other. Then if whoredome, drunkenneſſe, robberie,
murther, treaſon, blaſphemie againſt God, troubleſomneſſe, &amp; ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
be deteſtable things in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: we muſt alſo conclude ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon,
that the wickedneſſe which lurketh within the hart, (as ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and pride, when men eſteeme &amp; like of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues too much) is
deteſtable likewiſe. Alſo couetuouſneſſe when we haue a minde too
other mens goodes, and all other like things are to bee condemned
likewiſe. To be ſhort, our outward doings beare witneſſe that we be
full of infection before God. And where is that infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d?
In our deſires, in our intentes, in our thoughts, &amp; in all our doings,
wee ſee there is euen as it were a well ſpring of all naughtineſſe. So
then, let vs bee drawen to ſuch an acknowledgment of our ſinnes, as
wee may be hartely ſorie for them before God. And wee ſee that in
the Law there is ſuch a faſhion of teaching. God in his Lawe forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but aduoutrie: yea &amp; at the firſt ſight he forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not fraud and filching: what forbiddeth he then? Theft or rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie.
He forbiddeth not lying, but only falſwitneſſe. Now then it
ſhould ſeeme to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which know not the power of the law, that they
haue well diſcharged their duetie, when they haue well eſchewed
thoſe crimes.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. b. 6</note> And that is the cauſe why S. Paule ſayd that for a time
he thought himſelf to be throughly rightuous, and that God could
not haue blamed him for any thing. After the ſame maner do the
hipocrites ſotte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in their own ſelfweening, and thervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
mad if God find fault with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bicauſe they thinke he doth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
great wrong. And why? for they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyue not what the nature of the
Lawe is.<note place="margin">Rom. 7. c. 14.</note> It is ſpirituall (ſayeth S. Paule): that is too ſay, wee muſt be
wholly reformed to frame our ſelues thereafter. But ſo long as wee
follow our owne fleſhly nature, all that we think, and all that we can
ſay or do, ſhall be no better than ſinne before God. So then, we muſt
not looke only at the bare woordes that are ſet downe in the Lawe,
[but too the things that are ment and conteyned in them.] God by
ſetting downe the particular kind of Aduoutrie, ment too make all
kind of whoredome hatefull: for if mariage co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue not whole and
ſound without impeachment, it peruerteth all order and ciuill poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
among men. God therefore vnder the woorde <hi>Aduoutrie,</hi> hath
ſhewed that all whoredome and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>chaſteneſſe diſpleazeth him.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:23060:292"/>
Againe he ſayeth, Thou ſhalt not kill. Is it then lawfull too beate a
man?<note place="margin">Iohn. 3. c. 15</note> No, nor yet to hate him: for (as S. Iohn ſayeth) he that hateth
his neybour ſecretely is a murtherer before God, though he nother
torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him nor touch him with his finger: So then, vnder the woord
<hi>Murder,</hi> God condemneth all wrong that we do to our neyghbours.
Although then that we ſtirre not a finger to do them harme: yet if
we hate them or beare them ill will, wee be condemned of murther
before God. In like cace is it with Theft. For not only they that are
whipped, ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, or which haue their eares cut off are theeues before
God: but alſo euen all thoſe that beare the countenance of honeſt
men and are in credite &amp; eſtimation, are theeues too, if they deceiue
and beguile their neighbors. VVhat countenance ſo euer they carrie
to the worldward, though men be not able to accuſe them of robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
yet are they theeues before God. As much is to bee ſayd of all
the reſt. Likewiſe in this text, when S. Paule ſayeth that the deedes
of the fleſh are manifeſt: he giueth vs ſuch an inſtruction, as leadeth
vs from the great to the ſmall. And when wee ſhall haue bin conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
of our wretchedneſſe and vices, and our ſhamefulneſſe is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
as we can no more replie too it: let vs then enter into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
triall, that is to wit, of examining all our luſtes which tempt vs
vnto euill: and whither it be theft, crueltie, guyle, periurie, hatred, or
enmitie, all thoſe things are too bee condemned alike. For the Tree
ceaſſeth not too bee euill, though men ſee not the fruytes of it at the
firſte daſhe: but yet menne iudge of the nature of the tree by his
frute, howbeeit that the tree keepeth his owne nature ſtill. And
this is too bee marked well, bycauſe that (as I ſayde afore) although
God dryue men too condemne themſelues, yet they doo it but by
halues, and for all that he can doo too them, they would fayne ſtill
that their faultes which are not ſeene too the worldward, ſhould bee
releaſed them and neuer bee ſpoken of. As for example, he that is
condemned for dooyng ſome wicked acte, will not excuſe himſelfe
of it, for aſmuch as he is inforced too confeſſe it whither hee will
or no: But in the meane whyle, as for any entering intoo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
to thinke vpon Gods Iuſtice and his owne deſert, and to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that he had many te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations before he came to the deede doing,
and that he offended God a <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>dred times before his faulte came
<pb facs="tcp:23060:293"/>
to light: it is no part of his thought. So much the more therefore
doth it ſtand vs in hand, too marke well this warning whiche I haue
touched already. And verely here we ſee the ouer groſſe doltiſhneſſe
of the cheefe teachers of Papiſtrie, in that they ſay it is no ſinne too
thinke euill or to bee tempted, ſo wee conſent not too it. A man
(ſay they) may bee tempted to do his neighbour ſome wrong, he
may haue ſome hartburning and malice againſt him to bee reuenged
of him that hath diſpleaſed him, and if occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were offered, he might
incontinently be ſharpe ſet: but yet none of all this is ſinne (ſay they)
ſo there be no full conſent and reſolute purpoſe too do it. They doo
but wring their mouth awry like harlots, or ſnuffe vp their ſnoutes
lyke ſwyne that haue wallowed in dirt &amp; filth. Though a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grudge
and chafe againſt God, yea and doubte whither he haue any care of
him or no: and though he bee toſſed and turmoyled with much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
ſo as he cannot by any meanes reſort too God for refuge: all
theſe things are no ſinne among the Papiſts. And I ſay not that only
the common ſort are thus abuſed: but it is the reſolute doctrine and
determination of all their Vniuerſities, that ſuche things ought not
to be counted ſinne. They can well ynough ſay that before baptiſme
all is ſinne: but when wee be once baptized, then all is vertue: and
although we doubt of God, although we haue much hartburning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and although we be tempted with much impaciencie: yet
notwithſtanding, be wee neuer ſo much prouoked vnto euill doing,
or be we neuer ſo much ſhaken too and fro; all is well. To be ſhort,
though we be inclined to al things that God condemneth and diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
in his lawe, and which are not lawfull for vs to do: it makes
no matter at all. But they be well worthie to bee caſt into ſuch bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſhneſſe.
For like as they haue ſet vp Idolles and puppettes to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
ſo is it good reaſon that they ſhould be ſotted with their Gods,
and make but a ſport and play of rightuouſneſſe and vncorruptneſſe,
as if a man ſhould play with a little childe. No maruell then though
ſuch maner of folke be harried away after that faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for in aſmuch
they haue defaced Gods glory and brought it to nothing: they muſt
needes become ſtarke beaſtes. But let vs on our ſide marke what I
haue alledged already vpon the other <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>exte of S. Paule, namely that
the Lawe is ſpirituall, and therefore <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat if our manifeſt deedes doo
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:23060:293"/>
proue vs too be rebelles againſt God: then ſurely as oft as wee bee
tickled with any wicked luſtes inwardly, although the ſame bee not
knowen of men to make vs faultie to the worldward: God wil find
an infinite number, yea euen a whole ſea of them. Therefore let vs
conclude that we be vtterly drowned in curſedneſſe to all reſpectes,
till God looke mercyfully vpon vs and drawe vs out of it. Thus ye
ſee in effect how wee muſt apply this ſaying of S. Paules too our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
namely that for ſo much as we conſider not by the vyces
that are hidden in vs, that God commeth to examine our life: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt learne to humble our ſelues. And ſecondly that when
we ſee our ſinnes to be ſuch as are knowen and manifeſt to all men
and vtterly vnexcuſable, yea euen before children: we muſt be led
further thereby: that is to wit, we muſt ſearch our ſelues to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
and vnderſtand that all our luſtes and al our thoughts are vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
rebelliouſneſſe againſt God. Now if euery man were diligent in
examining himſelf after this faſhion: ſurely we ſhould all of vs haue
cauſe to ſigh and grone, all pryde &amp; loftineſſe would be layd downe,
yea and we would be aſhamed of our whole life. But it is ſeene that
euery of vs turneth away as much as he can from the conſidering of
his owne ſinnes: wee caſt them quite and cleane behind our backes.
Yet notwithſtanding God forgetteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not: howbeit if we would
that he ſhould forget them, it would behoue vs to remember them
our ſelues. And that is the thing wherevnto S. Paule incourageth vs
in this text. Furthermore wee ſee what fondneſſe and ignorance, or
rather beaſtlineſſe hath bin in the Popiſh doctours, in that they haue
thought this woord <hi>Fleſh</hi> too be token nothing elſe in man but fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
or ſenſualitie as they terme it. For thus do they part it. They
bee contented to graunt that there is nothing but corruption in all
our luſtes which they terme by the name of inferiour or lower: but
in the meane while (ſay they) we haue our will free, yea euen in ſuch
ſort as there remayneth ſome [ſound] reaſon and vnderſtanding in
vs. Ye ſee then, that in the opinion of the Papiſts, man is then ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall,
when he behaueth not himſelf according too reaſon, but yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to much eyther to whoredome, or to drunkenneſſe, or to glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie,
or to ſuch other like things. But S. Paule muſtereth Ambition
or vaynglorie heere in the ſame it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nke with them. For whereof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb facs="tcp:23060:294"/>
it that men beare ſuch ſpite one to another, and heaue one at
another to ſurmount eche other, and to be counted wizer or wittier
than other men? Is it not for that euery man coueteth to be a iolly
fellow to the worldward? And is that fault leſſe to be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned than
whoredome or drunkenneſſe? VVhen a poore wretch that deſireth
but to eate &amp; drinke, hath well filled his belly, he goes his way as he
was wont, he deſireth to be nother King nor great Lorde, he paſſeth
away his time. Another that is giuen to play, goes to ſport him with
vnthriftes like himſelfe, and is not tempted with ambition or deſire
of honour. Thoſe then which ſeeme moſt honorable, &amp; make moſte
of their paynted ſheath, are moſte fleſhly ſayeth (S. Paule), according
alſo as we haue ſeene in the firſt Epiſtle too the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. a. 3</note> where
he blamed them as fleſhly, bycauſe they were at variance one againſt
another about the doctrine, and were ſo fond &amp; curious to be ſeene
and had in eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men, in reſpect whereof alſo he mencioneth
ſectes &amp; hereſies. If a man trouble Gods Churche by falſe doctrine,
whither it be in deſpite of ſome men, or to purchace himſelf reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; renowme: after the opinion of the Papiſts it is not to be ſaid
that it is fleſhly dealing, it is to be ſayd that it was but too ſuttle dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Yea, but S. Paule ſayeth that hereſie, vayne glorie, and ſtrife or
ſpiting, are workes of the fleſh. Now then we ſee the thing that wee
treated of this morning: to wit, that vnder the woord <hi>Fleſh</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
all that is a mannes owne, and that we muſt be chaunged
and faſhioned new againe, or elſe we ſhall be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all naughtineſſe.
It is true (as I haue touched already) that although God ſuffer the
Paynims and Infidelles to runne vpon the brydle, and haue not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
them againe by his holy ſpirit: yet they may after a ſort bee
counted vertuous, and a man ſhall find ſome honeſtie in their liues,
at leaſtwiſe all of them ſhall not bee whoremongers, drunkardes, or
theeues.<note place="margin">Ier. 17. b. 9.</note> How then doth S. Paule call them fleſhly? Bycauſe mans
hart (as ſayeth the Prophete Ieremie) is a deepe gulfe of iniquitie,
whereof there is nother banke nor bottom to be found, and that doth
the Prophet well bewray in ſaying, what a gulfe is the hart of man,
and who is able to ſound it? None but God (ſayeth he). For we ſee
how men flatter themſelues, and are ſo feſtred in their naughtineſſe,
and ſo hardened in their ſinnes, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ey heape miſchiefe vpon miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:23060:294"/>
and ſinne vpon ſinne, and beare themſelues in hand that their
vyces are vertues, but yet their lyfe ſhall haue ſome fayre ſhew and
gloſſe vppon it. But yet doth it not therefore followe, that ſuche as
haue not bin taught are iuſtified. For when as Sainct Paule in the
firſt too the Romanes ſayeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. c. 20.</note> that all the worlde is condemned of
wickedneſſe and vnthankfulneſſe, in aſmuch as God had ſo ſhewed
himſelfe to all men without exception, as ſuffizeth too take away all
excuce from them: he addeth, that bycauſe they honored not God
as they ought to haue done when they knewe him, therefore he did
caſt them vp into a lewde minde, and giue them ouer too ſhamefull
and outrageous luſtes: and therevpon he reherceth horrible things.
Among whiche, he ſetteth downe whoredome, murther, and other
wickedneſſe and vncleanneſſe, ſuch as ought not to be once named
among men. After them, he ſetteth downe enuie, lewde dealing in
buying and ſelling, guylefulneſſe, periurie, hatred, ſtryfe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.
Go too now, all this geere was not knowen among the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers,
and yet notwithſtanding Sainct Paule ſayeth that all of
them from the greateſt too the leaſt, were thankeleſſe towardes
God, and had defrauded him of his due honour, and therefore were
all traytors, for they had plucked from him the thing that was his
owne, and therefore he payde them their deſerued wages, namely
bycauſe the ſeede of all ſinne is too bee found in mannes nature. All
men then are fraught with as many vyces as can bee deuized: but
yet dothe God holde them ſhorte, ſo as he ſuffereth not men too
giue ouer themſelues to all naughtineſſe. And for proofe thereof,
many Infidelles whiche haue not naturall reaſon to gouerne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
withal, are notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding chaſte &amp; ſhamefaſt, they ſpoyle not
otherme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their goods, they be ſober &amp; honeſt, and to be ſhort, they
haue many vertues after the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world. And why then are
they condemned as whorehunters, theeues, and drunkardes? It
is bycauſe they haue not thoſe vertues in obedience vntoo God,
nother is there any ſoundneſſe in their harte: but they bee reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with feare of ſhame, or hilde in the way by ſome other meanes
vnknowen too vs. But yet doothe God by that meanes ſpare
mankinde, too the ende that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>gs ſhould not go too hauocke, nor

               </gap>eaſtes. God then dooth ſo rule
<pb facs="tcp:23060:295"/>
the vnbeleeuers, as that their vertues (howſoeuer the worlde go)
ceaſſe not to be ſinfull ſtill. And therefore vpon euery light occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they giue themſelues too all naughtineſſe, whenſoeuer God giueth
them the brydle. If it bee ſayd that the faythfull alſo do ouerſhoote
themſelues: I graunt it: but yet hath God promiſed to ſtrengthen
them, ſo as they ſhall holde out too the end. Againe there is great
diuerſitie betweene Gods children that are gouerned by his ſpirit,
and the faythleſſe that are ſtill fleſhely. For the intent and drifte of
Gods children, is to dedicate themſelues wholly vnto him, that they
may be made pure through his grace: but the other ſorte walke at
rouers, and when they doo any good, they ſcarſly haue the skill too
know why they do it. They may well haue the woord vertue in their
mouthes: but yet for al that, their goyng is not to godward, but they
keepe ſtill a loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e from him. This in effect is the thing that we haue
to gather vpon this ſtreyne. Nowe on the otherſide S. Paule ſayeth,
that the frutes of the ſpirit are <hi>ioye, peace, meekeneſſe, gentleneſſe, patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and ſuch other like.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering our great
frowardneſſe and that there is nothing in vs but corruption and
naughtineſſe: we haue ynough wherewith to keepe our ſelues oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied,
ſo as we ſhall not neede to be idle all our lyfe long, if wee do
nothing elſe but fight agaynſt our owne vices: we ſhall finde ynough
there, to buzie our ſelues with bothe day and night. Againe on the
otherſide, ſith we be commaunded to be meelde and gentle, to liue
ſober and chaſte in all reſpects, to keepe our ſelues from all defiling,
to offer our ſelues as it were in ſacrifize vnto God, to forbeare from
all harme or anoyance, and in ſtead of ſeeking our owne profite too
ſtreyne our ſelues to the vttermoſt to ſuccour and help ſuch as haue
neede of vs: ſith we ſee that all this is commaunded vs: is it poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for vs too bring it to paſſe? No: and yet the matter concerneth
our catching vp into heauen, that we might be neere vnto God. For
the holyneſſe that is required in the lawe, and all the good workes
that God commaundeth vs, are as a knitting of him vnto vs, and of
vs vnto him. But where are now the winges that ſhould carie vs vp
ſo high? For wee can be nother chaſte, nor kindharted, nor gentle,
nor modeſt, nor ſober: vnleſſe we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:23060:295"/>
that paſſeth all our abilitie. Then is there heere wherwith to abaſhe
vs. But mark how S. Paule for concluſion ſayth, <hi>that there is no lawe
ageinst ſuch things.</hi> That is to ſay, if we be once gouerned by Gods
ſpirit, then ſhall we no more bee ſubiect too the lawe. It is true that
heere he giueth corage to all the faithfull, bicauſe they ſhal alwayes
feele infirmitie in themſelues, till they bee quite rid of this mortall
body. But howſoeuer the cace ſtand, ſeeyng that God holdeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vp, and ceſſeth not too accept theyr ſeruice thoughe they bee not
throughly and perfectly reformed: therfore they may bee able too
hold out, wheras otherwiſe they ſhould bee combered and fall into
diſpaire. S. Paule then ment too exhort vs heere vntoo conſtancie,
ſaying that if we bee gouerned by Gods ſpirit, we be no more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
too the lawe. But yet therwithall he did alſo gyue an indirect
taunt to thoſe ageinſt whom he diſputeth, as wee haue ſeen already
this morning. For the things which they had for their vertues were
but gewgawes. Like as in theſe dayes in poperie, if a man ſpeake of
their holineſſe and their ſeruing of God: it is nothing elſe but a
making of moppes and mowes, and a ſort of Ceremonies that is to
ſay, a deele of pelting traſh. VVhen a Papiſt mumbleth vp his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,
when he hayleth or greeteth a puppet, when he gaddeth from
altar to altar, when theſe hypocrites haue lighted vp their candles,
when they haue ſprinkled themſelues well with holiwater, when
they haue well croſſed and recroſſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues both before &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
when they haue faſted Lent wel, &amp; to be ſhort whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue
ouerlabored themſelues to redeeme themſelues eyther by Maſſes
or by other abhominations: that is their ſeruing and honouring of
God. Beſides this, if there be a faire Lamp in the Church, if the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes
pipe merily, if there be ſtore of gay copes and veſtimentes, if
the puppets bee well gilded, if men perfume them throughly and
ſeeke their fauor with many other ſuch dotages: that is all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Papiſtes. And yet is it but ſtarke leaſing, yea and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
gewgawes, or rather vtter abhominations, how great vertues
ſo euer they eſteeme them to be. But we on our ſide ſay that Gods
ſeruice is ſpirituall and that he regardeth not the things that are
ſeene of men,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4. c. 23.</note> but require <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>

of harte,<note place="margin">Iere. 5. a. 3.</note> accordyng as it is ſayde in the fyfthe of Ieremie.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:296"/>
Contrariwiſe men perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues that they ſhall content God
after their owne faſhion &amp; after their owne cuſtomes, &amp; therefore
they tranſforme him, imagining him too bee like themſelues too
followe their luſtes and likings. And no maruel though they do ſo.
For although they profeſſe themſelues to bee learned in the lawe:
yet doo they not ſet their minds vpon it, neither wote they what it
conteyneth. Therfore let vs learne, that if wee mind too giue our
ſelues too the ſeruing of God, wee muſt not buz about our owne
liking &amp; good intents (as they terme them) which are nothing elſe
but illuſions of Satan: but wee muſt looke what God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth
vs, and wherein he will haue vs to occupie ourſelues, which are the
true ſtudies that will bring vs too the yeelding of obedience vntoo
him. And it ſtandeth vs on hand too marke well the text that is ſet
downe heere: which is, that if wee weerie ourſelues neuer ſo much
in our owne inuentions: wee cannot ſay that God accepteth any
whit of it: for wee continue ſtill in our owne nature, which is fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
VVheraboutes then doth God imply vs? VVhat is it that he
requireth of vs? Firſt that wee ſhould forſake all frowardneſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
rancor, diſſenſion, guyle, harmefulneſſe, blaſphemie, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,
crueltie, feerceneſſe, treacherie, ſpytefulneſſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enmitie.
Thus yee ſee how wee may become good men of warre,
too gyue our ſelues too the ſeruing of God, namely by fyghting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geinſt
the woorkes of the fleſhe, not ageinſt the woorkes that are
manifeſt, &amp; which the world condemneth or alloweth: but ageinſt
the luſtes that lurke in couert. Let vs firſt clenze ourſelues from
the filthineſſe that lyeth feſtering within our hartes: and afterward
apply our whole indeuer to the other, Not that we can do it of our
ſelues: but let vs bee diligent in praying vntoo God, let euery of
vs ſtirre vp himſelfe earely and late, morning and euening, and
vppon knowledge of our vices, let vs be moued too ſorineſſe, and
ſeeke ſuccour from whence it ought to come: that is to wit at Gods
hand who muſt remedie the ſore that he hath made. Then if we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuer
our ſelues too the vttermoſt to leade a bliſſed lyfe, too bee
meeke and meelde, too bee patient in aduerſities and too put vp all
wrongs and outrages without <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

idleneſſe. And as for the Papiſtes, let vs let them alone ſeing they
dally ſo with God. For why doo they trot vp and downe after that
faſhyon? It is bycauſe they neuer knewe howe God will be ſerued
and honoured: and therefore (too theyr ſeemyng) all that God
hath ordeyned is nothing woorth in compariſon of their own foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe
inuentions. As for example, if a man trauell honeſtly for hys
liuing, although he haue not his fil of browne bread, yet ceaſſeth he
not to call vppon God in the morning, and too yeeld him praiſe at
night. And if he haue children, he ſpareth al that he can too feede
them and clothe them withall. Ageine if God ſende him afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in his houſe, he beareth them patiently. If the bee a handicrafts
man, or haue ſome other trade of occupying: he abſteyneth from
deceyuing of his neybors, and he had leuer dye than doo any man
wrong. Now when a man walketh after ſuch ſort, ſo that he is firſt
of honeſt conuerſation, and ſecondly there is no pryde in him too
aduaunce himſelfe aboue other out of meaſure, he is not giuen too
looceneſſe, but is ſober in eating and drinking, and patient in al ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities:
what is ſuch a man among the Papiſtes? He is (ſay they) a
ſecular man: that is too ſay, a man of the world. Thus yee ſee what
they eſteeme to bee pureneſſe in the ſeruice of God. But we know
that the cheefſeruice which God requireth, is that we ſhould whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drawe to his Lure, that we ſhould glorifie him both in weale and
wo, that wee ſhould walk euery man in his owne calling, and that
there bee neither pride, vainglorie, nor enuie in vs. Thoſe are the
things that God alloweth. But according to the Papiſts definition,
they that behaue themſelues ſo, are of the worlde. And where are
the popiſhe Angells in this while? In ſome Cloyſter. VVhen theſe
ſhameleſſe hypocrites haue glutted themſelues too the full, and
made luſtie cheere: they wote not whereaboutes to occupie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
but eyther in gaming, or elſe in all manner of wickedneſſe:
for it is well knowen that all the Couentes of the Popedome are
ſtarke brothelhouſes. And woulde God they were not woorfe
than brothelhouſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for there are committed ſo outrageous and
beaſtly deedes, as would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

ſtate of theirs is horrible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:297"/>
And yet for all that, they be Angells in reſpect of the poore ſoules
that behaue themſelues after the manner aforeſaid. And why? By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſing mattins very deuoutly, &amp; chaunt maſſe by note, and
are ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt of the world, ſo as they be not put to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the earth, nor meddle not with ſhoomakers craft or tailers
craft, nor with any trade elſe: but giue themſelues (ye may be ſure)
to a contemplatiue life, and to the ſtate of perfection. Is it not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
that the world hath bin vtterly ſotted with them? But ſuch
people as haue ſo transformed God into puppets, are well worthy
to be plundged in ſo groſſe &amp; vnreaſonable errors. But for our part
let vs aſſure our ſelues that we haue a God which is a ſpirit, &amp; will
be ſerued ſpiritually as he ſheweth vs by his word. Therfore let vs
be afrayd too bee vnder the fond fancies wherwith thoſe miſerable
wretches are bewitched: &amp; let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating
of himſelf vnto vs, is to the end that we ſhould repaire vnto him in
al holineſſe, rightuouſneſſe, and faithfulneſſe, and therwithall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
our liues by his law, &amp; not by our owne opinion, or by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the world. Agein let vs alſo haue an eye to that which he
alloweth or forbiddeth, for it is he to whom we muſt yeeld vp our
account, and we ſhal haue none other iudge but him alone. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs looke to all theſe things &amp; exerciſe ourſelues in them,
knowing that we ſhal not loze our labour in being ſo occupied: and
let vs let the Papiſtes alone, which breake both their legges &amp; their
necks, &amp; know not what they do, ſauing that they grieue God and
prouoke him more &amp; more. To the end then that we trauel not in
vain, nor wander heere &amp; there after opinions, without hauing any
certen mark to ame at. Let vs exerciſe ourſelues in the thing that S.
Paule teacheth vs in this texte, &amp; then ſhal we not be condemned
for buzying of our heads about things of nothing, which God bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

But God ſetteth the ryght way before vs in his lawe: and if we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

begin at the forſaking of ourſelues, bycauſe there is no wiſdome in

the lawe hath no more power ouer vs, for wee be ſet free from it,

be any one drop of goodnes in vs, the ſame is not of our own gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing,
neither can we chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the praiſe of it, without doing wrong
and iniurie vnto God. For they be all of them frutes of his grace, &amp;
he is faine to put them into vs by his holie ſpirite. Ye ſee then that
here againe we be humbled, to the end that none of vs ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
himſelf in thinking that he hath any vertue or ſtayedneſſe, or
louingneſſe, or any other like thing of his own. For vntil ſuch time
as God haue ſhaped vs new ageyne, we be like a peece of grounde
that is barrein yea and ſtarke naught. For we not only beare not
any good thing: but alſo bring forth exceeding much euill, till our
Lord haue rid vs of it: like a naughtie grounde, whiche not onely
is vnprofitable too the owner in that it yeldeth him neither corne,
wine, nor other neceſſary things: but alſo bringeth foorth thiſtles,
thornes, &amp; wicked weeds. Euen at the ſame point are we. And now
wee haue to marke, (according alſo as S Paule hath declared heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore)
that loue is the ſumme and ſubſtance of the lawe: which he
hath ſet down here in the formoſt ranke, not to make vs forget the
calling vpon God, nor the affiance which we oughte to haue in all
his promiſes, and the whole ſeruice that is conteined in the firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the law. S. Paule holdeth not ſcorne of thoſe things, neither
would he haue them reiected: but the matter that he treateth of, is
how men may giue ſure proofe to the worldward, whether they be
rightly mynded to the obeying of God or no. And I haue told you
alreadie, that ſuch proof is ſeene by our louing of our neyghbours,
when wee bee not giuen euery man too his owne profyte, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure
in common too nouriſhe good peace and vnitie, and put to
our helping hande alſo ſo farre as God giueth vs abilitie &amp; meanes
wherwith to do them good to whom we be bound by his woorde.
Thus yee ſee why S. Paule ſetteth downe the woorde Loue in the
firſt place. It is not to the intent we ſhould ſo loue our neyghbours,
that God ſhould be thruſt backe behynde vs: but bycauſe that in
hauyng mutuall loue and frendſhip one with an other, wee ſhewe
ourſelues to be rightly giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; dedicated to god: which thing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not

               </gap>n. Furthermore ſeing that all the
things which beare the name of vertue, and are iuſtly commended
<pb facs="tcp:23060:299"/>
among me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are called the frutes of the ſpirit: ſurely it is much more
likely that when we ſhould come vnto God, and bee armed ageinſt
all temptations, and be earneſt in praying by meanes of faith: we be
not ready for it if the holy Ghoſt worke not in vs. Then of natural
inclination there is not any thing in vs wherby we take hold of the
doctrine of the Goſpell: neither are wee ſo lightſome as to mount
vp vnto God, to talke familiarly with him by prayer and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but the holy Ghoſt muſt diſpoſe vs too it, by inlightening our
harts with his grace, &amp; by mouing our harts to cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. Lo what
we haue to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber heere. Now wheras S. Paule matcheth ioy with
loue, it is not only to do vs to vnderſtand that we ſhall be quiet to
Godward, and haue cheerfull hartes, when he ſhall haue receyued
vs to mercie and ſhewed himſelfe too fauor vs: but he ſpeaketh of
another kind of ioy, which is that there bee no hartburning among
vs to make vs lowre one at another, nor ſpite to withdrawe vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
our neybors: but that we be gentle &amp; fellowlike, yea and that we be
glad when wee can ayde and ſuccor them that haue neede of vs. In
the .xiiij. to the Romans S. Paul ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. c. 17.</note> that the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is
ioy of ſpirit: howbeit he taketh that word in another meaning. For
wee may reioyce in God when he witneſſeth vnto vs that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs for our Lord Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, and without that, we muſt
needes be vexed and turmoyled with ſuch vnreſt, as we ſhal liue in
continual trouble. It is true that the deſpiſers of God do ſport the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
as much as may be in their iollitie: but yet haue they neuer
any reſt or ioy: for they bee faine too ſuffer much hartburning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
and God dooth ſo ſting them with ſundry hartbytings, as
they be alwayes in heauineſſe and vexation: in ſo much that when
they would be merrie, they be faine to play the brute beaſts, and to
ſhake off al vnderſtanding, ſo as the diſcerning of good and euill is
quite and cleane daunted in them. Now it is a curſed ioy when men
ſtray away after that faſhion from God, and forget what they bee.
But (as I haue told you already) S. Paule ſpeaketh heere of the ioy
that we haue in being conuerſant with our neybors. And after the
ſame maner alſo is the word fayth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and ſoundneſſe of hart. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is a faith that reſpecteth God,
and that is the ſure beleef which we haue of his promiſes, according
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:23060:299"/>
wherevnto it is ſayde that wee bee iuſtified by fayth,<note place="margin">Rom 5. a. 1.</note> bicauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
that God aboliſheth and mortifieth in vs whatſoeuer is of
our owne nature. Therefore [in that fayth] wee muſt bee groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon Gods onely mercy which is ſhewed vs in our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. But howe come wee to the poſſeſsing of ſo great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite?
By truſting vnto Gods promiſes, and by receyuing them
with all obedientneſſe, acknowledging our ſelues to bee damned
and forlorne, and reſting onely vpon him. Yee ſee then that oure
fayth which reſpecteth God, is an aſſurance whiche wee conceyue
of his goodneſſe and loue towards vs, to the ende wee may preace
vnto him, not doubting but that he heareth vs. And for that cauſe
alſo S. Paule ſayth, that thoſe whiche haue ſuche fayth, doo truſt
boldly in God, and therewithall doo alſo freely and boldly pray
vnto him. But in this preſent texte, S. Paule taketh fayth for the
faythfulneſſe which wee perfourme one to another when we walke
vprightly, ſo as wee go not about to deceiue our neybour through
lewdneſſe or ſuttletie, nor vſe any double dealing, nor any diſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
to wind about the ſimple, but do the ſame to other folk
which wee would haue done to our ſelues. Thus yee ſee howe S.
Paule meeneth that fayth is a frute of the ſpirite. Nowe he addeth
<hi>Meekeneſſe and gentleneſse,</hi> bicauſe that without them it were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that there ſhould bee any vnitie or concorde among vs. For
if euery man ſhould bee terrible and voyde of gentleneſſe, it were
muche better for vs that wee were wylde beaſtes. Therefore wee
muſt ſhewe a willingneſſe to communicate with thoſe to whome
God hath linked vs. Too bee ſhorte, Loue is maynteyned by thys
meekneſſe, goodneſſe, and gentleneſſe whereof S. Paule ſpeaketh
heere. And now immediatly he addeth, <hi>Temperance</hi> [or <hi>ſtayedneſſe.]</hi>
which is not onely an abſteyning from other mens goods, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
a ſober behauiour, and a keeping of our ſelues from all looce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
exceſſe, and outrage. To bee ſhorte, S. Paule hath ſet downe
theſe vertues whiche he rehearſeth, for Chriſtians, as if he ſhoulde
ſay, that if we be gouerned by the ſpirite of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,
it may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap> ſhall not runne at rouers as theſe
looce lyuers doo, but we ſhall be charitable and kindharted one to
<pb facs="tcp:23060:300"/>
another, ſo as there ſhall be no wrangling, no guyle, nor no extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in vs, but euery of vs ſhall content him ſelfe with his owne, &amp;
indeuer to ſerue one anothers turne. But yet notwithſtanding wee
ſee that all good commeth of Gods ſpirite. Neuertheleſſe wee ſee
alſo that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is the fountayne out of whiche wee
muſt draw. And that if wee be his, and belong vnto him as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers
of his body, he will ſhew in all our whole life, that his receiuing of
vs, and his auowing of vs to be his children, is not in vayne. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
S. Paule concludeth,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>that agaynst ſuch vertues,</hi> (or agaynſt the
men that are indued with them) <hi>the law hath no power nor force at al.</hi>
And therfore he ſayth in the firſt to Timothie, that the Lawe is not
giuen to the righteous, but to the vnrighteous, and to ſuch as ruſh
out into offences and miſdealings. Then if the deceyuers that
troubled the Churche at that time, had knowen well what is the
ende of the Law and the Goſpell: they would not haue preſumed
to bring the faythfull in bondage after that faſhion. And therefore
S. Paule ſcorning theyr hypocriſie which was matched with ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe,
ſheweth that they pretended great zeale of the Lawe, and
yet bewrayed all maner of wickedneſſe and contempt of God in
their lyfe: lyke as now a dayes the Hypocrites in the Popedome
crie out lowde agaynſt vs, that wee ouerthrowe all good workes,
and intende to bring in a licentiouſneſſe of all euill, and to thruſt
out all deſire of ſeruing God. And why ſo? Bicauſe wee vncace
men out of all their fonde preſumption and ſelfe eſtimation, and
ſhewe them that there is none other meanes to truſt in God, than
by reſting vpon his meere goodneſſe in the name of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. VVee ſay flatly that all that euer is termed by the name
of merite or deſerte, is ſtarke abhomination before God. For ſo
muche as they beare them ſelues in hande that they bee their owne
Sauiours. Yee ſee then that all loftineſſe of man is pulled downe
by our doctrine. But yet dooth not that importe, that euery man
ſhould take leaue to doo lewdly, and haue no more care of ſeruing
God, nor of ſtanding in awe of him. But contrariwiſe wee ſay that
Ieſus Chriſt is giuen vnto vs, not one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap> hand by his meanes: but
alſo to the end that beeing regenerated by his holy ſpirit, we ſhould
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:23060:300"/>
walke in newneſſe of lyfe. And nowe in ſooth what maner of men
are they that maynteine the deſert of good works ſo ſtoutly? VVe
ſee there is nothing but all kinde of curſed filthineſſe in their whole
life. For if a man would ſeeke for ſcoffers that are altogither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holie,
and neuer haue ſo muche as any one feeling that euer they
ſhall come to account, but are vtterly doted by Satan: ſurely thoſe
are euen they. Agayne, when as they magnifie good workes: what
are the things that they would haue men to giue them ſelues vnto.
To babble much, to go to mattins and euenſong, to trot from altar
too altar, too worſhip puppets, too decke them trim, too buy ſtore
of pardons, too gad on pilgrimage, and (too bee ſhort) too mocke
God too his face, as though all the ſeruice of God were but a play
of young children. True it is that they dare not ſay but it is a good
and commendable thing to bee diſcrete, chaſt, ſober, and ſo foorth:
but yet they can eaſily forbeare all thoſe things, ſo a man keepe
their ſuperſtitions. Too bee ſhorte, all Gods commaundements
are thruſt vnder foote, and as it were troden vpon, and to their ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
it is no deuotion nor holineſſe, excepte a man doo all their
gay gewgawes and things of nothing. Thus yee ſee howe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
that S. Paule had in his tyme, indureth ſtill at this day. And
for that cauſe he ſayth, that if his aduerſaries agaynſt whom he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth,
will maynteyne Gods Lawe, they muſte conſider well to
whom it ſpeaketh, and they muſt begin at them ſelues: and that if
they intende to make good ſchollers, they muſt teach them ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
meekneſſe, chaſtitie, patience, &amp; ſuch other things, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
to renounce all their owne wicked luſts. Theſe (ſaith S. Paul)
are the true exerciſes wherin it behoueth vs to imploy all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuer.
And in the meane while let vs not ſhutte the gate agaynſt
Gods children, in bereeuing them of the priuiledge that God hath
giuen them. For when he gouerneth them by his holy ſpirite, he
will not haue them ſubiect any more too the yoke of the Lawe.
Nowe therevpon S. Paule addeth, <hi>that all they whiche are in Ieſus
Christ, haue crucified their fleſh, with the lusts therof.</hi> Here he ſheweth
that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> to haue a fleſhly libertie, and ſuche a one as
the deſpiſers of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> that he requireth chiefly, that ſuche
as talke of chriſtian libertie, ſhould ſhewe in deede that they haue
<pb facs="tcp:23060:301"/>
crucified all their luſts and concupiſcences, to the intent thereby to
proue them ſelues the true members of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And
this is needefull for vs: to the ende wee may holde vs to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
order and marke which God pointeth vs too, when we would
knowe what true libertie is. Nowe a dayes there are many Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
from the teeth outwarde, as farre as comes too the eating of
fleſhe vppon frydays and in Lenton: they can welinough mocke
at the pelting toyes of papiſtrie: they can welinough ſay, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
reſtraynt bee made of one thing or other vnder payne of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſinne, it is but an abuſe and mockerie: and they ſay truthe, ſo
they buyld vpon a good and ſure foundation. But what? they that
are ſo great talkers, know no whit of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſtes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and power: they knowe not why he came downe into the
worlde, nor what grace he imparteth vnto vs by his Goſpell: they
knowe not, neyther what fayth, nor what prayer is: and yet for all
that, they will needes haue leaue to doo what they liſte, and that
folke ſhould lay the bridle looce in their necke. Of theſe wylde
Chriſtians there are tootoo many nowe a dayes. In the meane
while the doctrine of God is blamed by their meanes. For the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the truthe vpbrayde vs with all ſuche as are looſe liuers
now a dayes, and ſay that the ſame ſpringeth of our preaching. For
this cauſe S. Paule hath anſwered his aduerſaries, and alſo armed
and fenced vs to anſwere them, to the ende to ſtoppe the mouthes
of all raylers, and of all ſuche as doo falſly ſlander the doctrine of
the Goſpell. Firſt of all therfore when the wicked ſort ſay, that we
giue an inordinate libertie to all ſuche as ſeeke nothing but to doo
lewdly: Let vs looke backe to S. Paule, who telleth them that the
libertie which we ſpeake of, ſerueth for none but ſuch as are a law
to them ſelues, namely through the working of the death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. But yet notwithſtanding this ought
to ſerue for a warning to all ſuche as imagine a libertie after their
owne liking. Therefore let them vnderſtande, that firſt of all it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth
them to become members of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. VVil
we then eate quietly without making any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
VVill wee bee exempted from all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> whiche doo nowe a
dayes vexe the ſimple and ignorant ſorte in the Papacie? Let vs
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:23060:301"/>
vnderſtande what Ieſus Chriſt is, and let vs bee throughly his. Let
him gouerne vs, and let his death and paſsion ſhewe their power
and effectualneſſe in our whole life. Thus yee ſee what we haue to
beare in binde in this text. And heere S. Paule ſheweth agayne, that
the true perfection of Gods children conſiſteth in abacing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
ſo as they followe not the rule of their owne brayne and
affections: for wee bee vtterly corrupted. Then can wee not bee
but rebels agaynſt God all the time of our life, till wee haue kyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
all the ſinfulneſſe of oure owne nature. Marke this for one
poynt, that our lyfe ſhall neuer bee framed to the will of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte
wee bee vtterly chaunged, bothe in our thoughts, and in our
affections. Secondly, S. Paule ſheweth that that can not be done,
but by communicating with our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: for it is not
without cauſe that he vſeth this worde <hi>Crucified.</hi> For thereby he
declareth, that ſo long as wee bee ſeparated from our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, and caſt off from him, and not knit vnto him by fayth, our
nature will alwayes bring foorth hir owne frutes, that is to ſay, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but all maner of naughtineſſe and vice. Thus ye ſee that firſt
of all Freewill is beaten downe. Secondly it is ſhewed vs that wee
can not be partakers of any of Gods giftes, nor of his holy ſpirite,
but by the meanes of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, according as I haue
tolde you alreadie, that wee muſt all drawe of his fulneſſe, for he
is the onely fountayne that is able too ſuffice vs. And if wee ſeeke
neuer ſo farre aboute elſewhere, wee ſhall finde nothing but
drythe, and wee ſhall continue a thirſt ſtyll: and if wee thinke too
fill our ſelues, it will bee but wyndineſſe and miſweening, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
wee ſhall burſte, and yet not gather any good nouriſhment
or ſubſtance. Nowe heerevppon Sainct Paule concludeth, that if
wee liue after the ſpirite, wee ſhoulde alſo walke after the ſpirite.
And it is a more eaſie declaration of the thing that I haue touched
alreadie. It had beene inough too haue auouched that wee can not
bee ſet free, but by crucifying all oure wicked luſtes: howe bee it
for as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Hypocriſie is ſo great, that they doo alwayes

               </gap>man would bee eſteemed as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,
though his life bee out of order: therefore Sainct Paule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for a confirmation too adde this ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>that if wee liue after
<pb facs="tcp:23060:302"/>
the ſpirite, wee must therewithall walke after the ſpirite.</hi> As if hee
ſhould ſay, that it is not inough for men too proteſt them ſelues to
haue Gods ſpirite dwelling in their heart: but they muſte ſhewe
that he is there: for he is not idle. Therfore if a man will diſcerne
whether Gods ſpirit dwell in vs or no, he muſt come to our works
and to our life: and according as our conuerſation is, ſo may he ſee
what we be, and what is within vs, and giue iudgement by our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
workes that are apparant. As for example, if one would
beare mee in hande that a blocke were a liuing a man too ſee too:
It ſtirreth neyther head nor foote: thruſt at it, and ſhoue at it, and
yet there appeareth no lyfe in it: and ſhall he then make mee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
that a peece of ſtone remoueth from place too place, or hath
any power in it, or is a creature that hath a ſoule? Euen ſo is it
with thoſe that boaſt them ſelues to be ſpirituall. For although the
vnbeleeuers and enimies of God be aliue as in reſpect of the body:
yet are they dead in reſpect of the heauenly life, bicauſe their ſoule
is vtterly corrupted: but wee liue to Godwarde through the grace
of his holy ſpirite. And if this grace be in vs, it can not bee idle, as
I ſayde afore. And that is the cauſe why S. Paul ſayth, that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
will ſhewe whether we liue in the ſpirite or no. The
worde <hi>walke</hi> is very rife in the holy ſcripture, when the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of our life is mentioned: neuertheleſſe heere is not onely
walking. The worde that S. Paul vſeth importeth more: that is to
wit, too walke orderly, as if he ſhould ſay, that we muſt frame our
ſelues to the thing that is conformable too the will of God, and of
his holy ſpirite, and that our life muſt bee ſo well ruled, as it maye
bee knowen that God gouerneth vs in deede, and that our Lorde
Ieſus Chriſt holdeth vs too him ſelfe as the members of his body,
and that he hath truly witneſſed that he dwelleth in vs by his holy
ſpirite. Therefore at a worde, this thing muſte needes bee knowen.
Nowe to bee ſhorte, S. Paule ment heere to bewray the hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
of all ſuche as make fayre proteſtation with their mouthe, and
woulde haue men to beleeue wonderous well of their zeale: and
yet in all their whole lyfe doo ſhew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> at
all too come neere God, nor any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of hys worde. All ſuch folke
then are heere condemned of lying and vnfaythfulneſſe. And
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:23060:302"/>
therefore that wee may diſcerne which are Gods children, let vs
come to the examining of our liues. True it is (as I haue touched
heeretofore) that ſometimes the ignorant wretches and ſuche as
neuer had any inſtruction in the Lawe, ſhall haue ſome apparance
of vertue. But if a man ſounde them throughly, he ſhall finde it is
but a ſhadowe, and that they bee not well bent, eyther too loue
their neibours, or to walke according to Gods will. To be ſhort the
examining of our lyfe can not lye. And heerewithall S. Paule ment
alſo to confirme the thing that he ſpake afore: that is too wit, that
if our lyfe bee to be gouerned by Gods ſpirite, then muſt wee tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
earneſtly that way, and not in tryfling things that are neyther
heere nor there before God: according as I haue declared alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
that ſuche as will needes bee moſt deuout, haue neither ende
nor meaſure of their ſuperſtitions: and when euening co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth they
thinke God to bee greatly beholden to them for their trauelling
too and fro, and yet notwithſtanding all is but loſte labour. And
therefore S. Paule telleth vs, that ſithe wee knowe that our life is
ſpirituall (as truthe is) and that God alſo is a ſpirite: wee muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande
alſo that he will be ſerued faythfully, and that men muſt
not occupie them ſelues about ſmall trifles which are but as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
bables: but that he will haue vs to vſe faythfulneſſe, loue,
peace, and concorde one with another, ſo as there bee no deceipt,
no malice, nor no rauin among vs. Then if we knowe that the lyfe
which God alloweth, and whereby wee bee ioyned vnto him, is a
ſpirituall life: Let vs foorthwith (ſayth he) walke in the ſpirite,
that is too ſay, let vs aſſure our ſelues that God alloweth not any
thing but that which is agreable to his Lawe (which for the ſame
cauſe is called ſpirituall by Sainct Paule in the ſeuenth to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes)
and let the proofe of the ſame doctrine ſhewe it ſelfe in our
conuerſation. So nowe whereas other folkes runne on pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage:
let vs occupie our ſelues in the ſeruing of God, and our nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
VVhereas theſe wretched hypocrites waſt al their ſubſtance
in Idolatrie: let vs conſider that the true ſacrifices &amp; holy offerings

               </gap>ondly that we ſhuld ſo diſpoſe the
goods that he hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs &amp; put into our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds as we might ſhew by
<pb facs="tcp:23060:303"/>
ſo the ſame may ſerue to the glorifying of Gods maieſtie, and [too
the inlarging of] the dominion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. Let all
looke at him, let all ſticke too him, and let all know that it is he from
whom all goodneſſe proceedeth. Lo wherevnto S. Paule ment too
bring vs. Now to the intent too make vs the more too abhorre all
vayneglorie and pryde againſt God, and the ſayde deſire of hauing
credite among men: he ſayeth <hi>that wee must not ſeeke too byte one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
nother must we malice one another.</hi> It is as much as if he had ſayd
that ambition or vayngloriouſneſſe cannot reigne in vs, but incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently
there will be hartburning, and euery man will prouoke his
neighbour. For if wee bee giuen after that faſhion to vayneglorie,
euery of vs will couet too bee greateſt, and it will ſeeme to himſelfe
that he hath not his right, till he ſee his neighbour brought in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
Thus yee ſee what pryde bringeth. It tendeth not onely too
the aduauncing of a mannes ſelfe againſt God: but alſo too the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing
of ſuch as we ought to honour, at leaſtwiſe if they be our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours.
For when we haue looked well to all, it is certayne that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the leaſt ſort ought to bee honorable in our eyes. Therefore if
we bee led with ambition (as I ſayd afore) euery of vs will bee clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
to get higher and higher. Now hereof muſt needes ſpring ſtrife
and debate, hartburning, quareling and contention, and finally dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enmitie. To be ſhort, ſo long as ambition hath his full ſcope, and
is let alone vnbrydled, wee muſt needes bee at warre, as experience

there is cauſe for vs too reioyce, and if wee bee rightly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified

aduauntage and profite of our neyghbours. There will alwayes be
repining and ſpiting in our hartes, when God ſheweth himſelf boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
towardes thoſe whom wee would keepe vnder feete.</p>
            <p>Thus yee ſee that the thing whiche wee haue to remember in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in this ſtreyne, is that wee muſte learne what it is too belong
too our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, to the ende that wee take not his name
in vayne, ne bee reproued of falſehood and leaſing before God and
his Angelles, for glorifying our ſelues ſo fooliſhly before menne.
For too the intent wee may bee our Lorde Ieſus Chriſtes, wee muſt
mortifie our luſtes and affections, knowyng that of our ſelues wee
bee inordinately giuen too all euill, and our nature wholly incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
therevntoo. Therefore it ſtandeth vs in hande to turne a new
leaſe. And of a truth that cannot bee done of our owne power: but
the Sonne of God is Prieſt and readie to helpe vs. VVhat letteth vs
too bee made partakers of the giftes of Gods holie Ghoſt, that wee
might proue by our lyfe that wee haue a true beleefe in him? It is
our flattering of our ſelues in our owne wretchedneſſe. Then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is nothing but corruption in vs, lette vs learne too la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and lette vs yeelde our ſelues too our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte,
that he may kill all wicked luſtes and diſordinate affections in vs
by the power of his death and paſsion. And therewithall lette vs
conſider the grace that God graunteth vs in that he will haue vs

(for that woulde bee an intolerable burthen too vs), but bee
gouerned by his holie ſpirite, knowyng that he alloweth of our

Ieſus Chriſte, and that it is he that gouerneth vs, by reaſon whereof
the fruyte of it redoundeth immediatly too our neyghbours, in ſo
much that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods name is ſo glorified by vs, &amp; we haue yeelded
true proofe of our chriſtianitie, men knowe that whereas wee were
taught, it was to the end that all others ſhould reape profit by it. For
God hath a reſpect to the whole bodie of his Church,<note place="margin">Math. 5. g. 45.</note> and like as he
maketh his ſonne to ſhyne both vpon good and bad: ſo will he haue
the faythfull to do good to ſuch as are not worthie of it. Therefore
let vs acquaynt our ſelues with it, and moreouer acknowledge that
we be nothing, and that all the goodneſſe which wee haue is none of
our owne, but that we haue it of Gods meere grace. And for aſmuch
as we bee not yet come to the perfection that were requiſite, let vs
not ſurmiſe our ſelues too be in Gods fauour for any other reſpect,
than that he beareth with vs till wee bee come intoo his kingdome,
where we ſhall haue the fulneſſe of all holineſſe.</p>
            <p>Now let vs caſt our ſelues down before the Maieſtie of our good
God, with acknowledgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our faults, praying him to make vs ſo
to feele them, as wee may bee ſorie for them before him, yea euen
with a true repentance, and deſire to be rid more and more of them,
and practize the doctrine that we haue herd, that whereas the blinde
and ignorant wretches doo now adayes martir and tyre themſelues
to much in exceſſe of their fonde deuotions: we may learne to hold
our ſelues too the pure ſimplicitie of his woord, knowing that there
is none other rule but that, and that the ſame is it wherein he will
haue vs to exercyze our ſelues, and wherevnto it behoueth vs too

Here is now another vyce very neere of kinne
to the other: namely when wee ſnatch at ſuch
as haue done amiſſe, to the intent to aduaunce our ſelues in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon

his putting of vs in mind of our infirmitie by nature, is too
the end that none of vs ſhould climbe to high. And furthermore he
addeth the woorde <hi>ouertaken,</hi> meening thereby that it alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth
gentleneſſe at our handes when we ſee a man ſurpryzed by
the wylineſſe of Satan. For S. Paule ſpake not heere of ſuch as haue
rooted malice in their hart, which are vtter deſpyzers of God, which
are altogither heatheniſh, &amp; which are ſo full of poyſon throughout,
that they cannot alledge for themſelues that they fall by ouerſight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for why, they bee madde beaſtes, ruſhing wilfully agaynſt God,
according as wee ſhall ſee many that manifeſtly deſpize all order,
and would haue all the worlde put too confuzion. Suche maner of
men are not compryzed in the number of thoſe whom Sainct Paule
ſpeaketh of heere. But although a man feare God and be willing to
giue himſelf to his ſeruis: yet notwithſtanding Satan hath his ſnares
ready layd, and catcheth vs oftentimes ere wee thinke of it. And ſo
you ſee how wee bee ouertaken or ſurpryzed. Nowe S. Paule tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs, that yet in ſuch faultes wee muſt bee pitifull ſtill, and beare
with ſuche a man through the ſpirite of meekeneſſe. Howbeeit wee
muſt marke well all the woordes that are ſet downe here: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee ſhall gather the meening of the Apoſtle. For in very deede
heere is nothing ſuperfluous, but euery woorde hath his weyght.
For in ſaying that wee muſte indeuer too amend him agayne that is
fallen: he ſheweth that the gentleneſſe whiche many men vſe in
flattering ſuche as haue done amiſſe, ſauoreth nothing at all of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie.
Therefore mennes vyces muſte bee rebuked, and wee
muſte labour too bring backe the partie intoo the right way, which
is ſtrayed out of it. For if a man vpholde him in his naughtineſſe,
and foade him in it: he betrayeth him, bycauſe he rocketh him a
ſleepe, and by that meanes ſinketh him the deeper in deſtruction.
Yee ſee then that the meane whiche Sainct Paule hath appoynted,
is that if a man haue done amiſſe, he ſhoulde bee amended, howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
that the ſame muſte bee done with the ſpirite of gentleneſſe and
meekeneſſe. He could well ynough haue vſed the woord <hi>Meekeneſse</hi>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:23060:305"/>
they haue committed a fault: and therewithall he ment alſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
that the ſame proceedeth of God. For like as he is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
of all goodneſſe: ſo alſo doothe he giue his children ſome
meekeneſſe, too the intent they ſhoulde followe him and frame
themſelues after his example.<note place="margin">Eſai. 11. a. 2</note> VVee knowe that the maner of the
holy Scripture is to terme the giftes of the holy Ghoſt, the ſpirit of
truth, the ſpirit of the feare of God, the ſpirite of wiſedome, &amp; ſuch
other like, bycauſe the fulneſſe of all goodneſſe is in him. Yee ſee
then that the ſumme of that whiche S. Paule teacheth heere, is that
we muſt not onely loue vertue and like well of ſuch as walke in all
perfection, and in whom wee can find no blame: but ouermore wee
muſt be gentle, in bearing with the faultes of ſuche as are not yet ſo
well confirmed in the feare of God as were requiſite, too the ende
we may bring them backe agayne into the right way, that are turned
aſide or thruſt out of it. For if there ſhould be no meeldneſſe nor
gentleneſſe in vs: as ſoone as a man had committed any faulte,
wee ſhoulde as it were plundge him in deſpayre, and this is
ſeene too much, for that cauſe therefore Sainct Paule telleth vs that
the meekeneſſe or meeldneſſe of Gods children muſt trie it ſelfe by
releeuing ſuch as are fallen through weakeneſſe, yea and that in ſuch
ſort, as it may be knowen that their ſaluation is procured. Nowe I
haue tolde you that there are two extremities or two vyces wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
wee muſte beware. The one is, that we winke when any of our
freendes haue offended God, in ſo muche that euen when he hath
giuen ſome cauſe of ſtumbling, wee let it ſlippe bycauſe wee be loth
too purchace his diſpleaſure by rebuking him. And now adayes yee
ſee that the common way of maynteyning freendſhip in the world,
as too giue leaue and licence of all miſdoyng, through Diueliſhe
diſsimulation. For no man can abide too haue his galled backe rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
nother doo any menne take warnings in good woorth, ſauing
they whom God hath touched, and to whom he hath giuen the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of obedience too yeelde themſelues teachable. Therefore ſuche
maner of men as theſe,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 14. c. b. 5.</note> will ſay with Dauid, that they had leuer too

in their vyces. Neuertheleſſe ye ſhall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſee, that all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> couet
<pb facs="tcp:23060:306"/>
to be borne withall, and to haue no woord ſpoken to them what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they do, nor to haue their heads troubled with their vices and
miſdoings. Euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> verifieth this, in ſo much that God is forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
&amp; (as the Prophet Eſay ſayeth) there is no defender any where that
maynteyneth the truth,<note place="margin">Eſay. 59. c. 16.</note> for there is as great confuzion and diſorder
as may be, and yet men do let all ſlip. True it is that if wrong be done
to any man, he will not ſticke to ſay that ſuch licentiouſneſſe ought
too be redreſſed: but he ſayeth not ſo for any zele he hath to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
the honour of God, it is but onely for his owne peculiar ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage,
and for the regard that he hath to himſelfe. Thus yee ſee
that God hath not any proctors or Aduocates to pleade his cace, but
euery man is for himſelfe. Therefore when wee ſee any man doo
amiſſe, let vs learne that it is no loue nor charitie too cloke his euill
doings, ſo as wee ſhould diſſemble them and make no countenance
at all of them: but that if wee haue a care of him that is ſo fallen,
wee muſte turne him away. If a man bee in the myre, wee will
reache him our hande too helpe him out: and if wee paſſe by him
and will not ſeeme too ſee him, ſhall he not ſay it is too ſhamefull an
vnkindneſſe? Euen ſo is it when wee ſuffer a man too fall a ſleepe
in his ſinnes: for by that meanes he is ſunke downe too the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of perdition. Then is it too greate a trayterouſneſſe, if wee
doo wittingly ſuffer a man too vndoo himſelfe vtterly: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
wee ſhewe alſo that there is no zele of God in vs. For if he
bee our father, ought it not at leaſtwyze too greeue vs and make vs
ſorie, when wee ſee wrong and iniurie offered vntoo him?</p>
            <p>So then, if the ſoules whiche our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath bought
ſo deerly bee precious vntoo vs, or if wee ſet ſo much by Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
as it deſerueth: it is certayne that wee will not ſo beare with
mens faultes, but that we will indeuer too amend them. Marke that
for one poynt. But there is alſo a contrarie vyce: namely ouer
greate rigorouſneſſe. For this is a propertie of the Hypocrites, that
if they ſpie a mote in their neighbours eye, they crie out alarum vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
him,<note place="margin">Math. 7. a. 4.</note> and they muſt needes follow him with hew &amp; crie, whereas
in the meane while a great beame in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap> as our
Lorde Ieſus ſpeaketh of them. For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> therefore as there are
many that wyden their conſciences to ſwallow vp a whole Oxe [in
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:23060:306"/>
their owne caces,] and in the meane ſeaſon can ſtreyne at a gnat
when it toucheth other men: therefore we muſt beware that wee
bee not to rough and ſharpe in rebuking of our brother. Beſydes
this, there are alſo that haue an vnaduiſed zeale, ſo as they bee too
ſowre and bitter, and they are of opinion that they diſcharge not
themſelues, except they proclayme mens faults alowde, as it were
by the ſounde of a trumpet. And howe many warnings are made
nowadayes with an vpright carefulneſſe? If a man ſee any of his
neighbours fall to naughtineſſe, he ought (if he can haue acceſſe and
enterance to him) too tell him his fault: but wee will none of that.
For (as I ſayde) euerie man vnderpryeth other, and lyes in wayt for
him like a ſpie, too ſee if he can finde any thing amiſſe in him, and
then vſeth he ſternneſſe to the vttermoſt. True it is that ſuch as are
handled ouerroughly after that faſhion, cannot complaine of it. For
whereof commeth the naughtineſſe that is too ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e nowadayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, that no man is warned ſecretly to the ende he might be
brought backe vnto God, but that the vices which were done in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
are blazed abrode, yea euen to the diffaming of the partie? It is
for that euery of vs ſhetteth the gate, bycauſe our eares are too it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
and we cannot abide too bee tolde the truth, but will needes
keepe the poſſeſsion of all naughtineſſe, as though God were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
from his authoritie, and had no prerogatiue of iudgement o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vs. Foraſmuch then as euery man woulde exempt himſelf from
correction: therfore all are worthie to be handled hardly after that
faſhion, and too bee delt with like enemies, and not like brethren.
For there can be no brotherhod among vs, vnleſſe correction take
place, ſo as euery man be ſubiect to it, yea euen willingly. And by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we will not in any wiſe be rebuked, therefore we deſerue well
to be handled with ſuch exceſsiue rygour. For this cauſe Saint Paul
ſetteth downe the meane, which is that we muſt haue a care one of
another, ſo that if any man ſtumble, he may bee helped vp againe.
And howe? By good warnings. For that is the remedie which God
hath ſtabliſhed for vs by his worde, Howbeeit that in the meane
while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo eager in rebuking other mens faults, as too
forget to put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> that is to ſay, to vſe the ſayd ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of meekeneſſe. For it were to ſmal purpoſe to haue Suger in our
<pb facs="tcp:23060:307"/>
mouth, as many men haue, and in the meane time to beare poyſon
in our heart. And therefore Saint Paule ſpeaketh not here alonely
of the tongue, ne ſayth that we muſt haue intioing wordes: but that
in rebuking mens faults we muſt alwayes be led and moued therto
by an earneſt deſire to our neighbours ſaluation. For it is certaine
that if we couet the ſoule health of ſuch as do amiſſe, wee will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
our ſelues ſoberly, and that ſoberneſſe will bring with it the
moderation that Saint Paule ſpeaketh of, ſo as wee ſhall not bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereager,
nor depart from the fountaine, which is too beware that
wee bee not too haſtie in fynding fault wee wote not why, nor too
what ende, but that wee haue a care too fetche him backe againe
that is in an euill-trade, and be deſirous to bring him with vs vntoo
God. To be ſhort, wee muſt couet to haue him our brother, that
God may bee ſerued of vs all and mainteyned in his ſtate. If wee
bee ſo mynded, ſurely the reſt will followe after. But vnder the
woorde <hi>Spirite</hi> wee bee warned moreouer (as I ſayde euen nowe)
that we muſt be faſhioned lyke vntoo God, forſomuch as hee hath
vouchſafed too chooſe vs for his children, accordingly as our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt telleth vs, ſaying: Bee yee lyke vntoo your heauenly
father,<note place="margin">Math. 5. g. 45.</note> who hath pitie euen on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are vnworthie of it. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we deſire to be hilde and auowed for Gods children: let vs
haue an eye to the nature of him which calleth vs too the likeneſſe
of his owne Image, which is that we be meeld and gentle. Now God
in his gentleneſſe flattereth not ſuch as haue done amiſſe. For he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
iniquitie, and muſt needes alwayes ſhewe himſelfe an enemie
to it. But we ſee the thing that is ſayde, namely that God dooth in

haue to conſider, is that we muſt faſhion our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

we ſee any infirmitie, but rather labour to winne them, bycauſe they
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:23060:307"/>
bee as loſt ſoules. And heerevpon we may alſo gather, that ſuch as
nowadayes woulde haue vyces cloked, yea and borne oute vnder
pretence that God is pacient and gentle, do falſly corrupt the holy
ſcripture. For nowadayes, if neuer ſo deteſtable crymes bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
by and by they alledge mercie, ô they muſt be pitied: yea,
but ſuch folke blaſpheme God in that they woulde haue vs too bee
more mercifull than hee is. Surely wee knowe him too bee the

               </gap> of all goodneſſe, and it is ynough for vs if wee can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
him a great way off, and it were a thing to be greatly deſired
that we coulde come neerer and neerer vntoo him. But when wee
haue ſtreyned our ſelues too the vttermoſt, it is verie much if wee
can haue in vs but ſome little ſparke of the mercie which is infinite
in God.<note place="margin">Zach. 1 a. 3.</note> Neuertheleſſe God promiſeth not his grace, but to ſuche
as returne vntoo him. True it is that hee toucheth them with hys
holy ſpirite, and chaungeth their myndes: but yet muſt repentance
alwayes bee matched with forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. Now after what
maner is it that men would be pitifull? It is that they might mocke
God too his face, that men ſhoulde winke at their lewdneſſe, yea
and ſooth them vp in it, that God ſhould be reiected, and that ſuch
as are readie to do ſtill worſe and worſe, ſhoulde bee borne withall
and borne out. But I haue tolde you that it is too curſed a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
when men tranſforme good intoo euill after that faſhion. Then
according to Saint Paules exhortation, let vs lerne to bring a meke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that may be of Gods ſpirite, not too allowe of the euill, or
to deface the good, but too amende things modeſtly with diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Therewithall let vs learne alſo to pray God to gouerne vs when
the cace requireth that we ſhoulde correct our neighbours, aſſuring
our ſelfe that of our owne nature wee ſhall neuer be able too doo it.
VVee knowe that to ſerue God, and to imploy our ſelues faythfull
in that behalfe, wee muſt firſt receyue of him the things that wee
want. Nowe then, let a man ſtreyne himſelfe as farre as hee liſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and hee ſhall not finde himſelfe able to bring one droppe of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of his owne. But when wee come too correcting, there wee

in the name of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:308"/>
Nowe then, ſeeing it is ſo that we execute Gods office in rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
ſuch as haue done amiſſe: how ſhall we be fit for that purpoſe,
except he guide and direct vs therevnto? Therefore let vs learne
to deſire him to guide and rule vs by his holy ſpirite, when any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
is to be made, to bring ſuch backe againe as are gone out
of the right way. And herewithall wee muſt marke alſo (as I haue
ſayd afore) that Saint Paule ſpeaketh not heere of ſuch as are ſaped
in wickedneſſe, in contempt of God and in rebelliouſneſſe, but of
ſuch as are ouertaken, ſo as they haue ſome good will to doo well,
and yet notwithſtanding doo fall through infirmitie. Therefore
this matter muſt be handled very skilfully and diſcretely. For if we
will deale alike with all men, it is certaine that we ſhall oftentymes
do wrong too ſuch as haue neede too bee borne withall, and in the
meane while doo nothing but inflame the deſpyzers of God, and
make them more malapart than they were before. Then (as I ſayd)
we muſt put a difference betwene the one and the other. For when
the Prophete Ezechiell ſpeaketh of the good ſhepheard:<note place="margin">Eze. 34. a. 4</note> hee ſayth
that he muſt beare with the ſhepe that are weake, and if any of them
be infected, he muſt heale them by good medicins. But if he ſhould
keepe one maner of vſage without putting a difference betweene
one and another, howe ſhould he ſhewe himſelfe to be a ſheepherd
in ſo doing? In like cace is it with all ſuche as deale with the rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of their neighbours that haue done amiſſe. As for example, if
there be a ſhameleſſe naughtipacke, that dayly runneth headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all naughtineſſe, which maketh none account of Gods woorde,
nor doth any thing but [marre others] like a ſcabbed Ramme that
ſpreadeth his infection through the whole flocke: or if there bee a
varlet that is giuen ouer to all wickedneſſe: ſuch a one is not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
with ſinne. And why? For he hath alreadie giuen ouer the
ſeruice of God, he hath vtterly ſhaken off his yoke, and (as I ſayde
afore) is become a mad beaſt that puſheth with his hornes agaynſt
heauen. Such maner of men deſerue not too bee borne withall by
gentleneſſe: and in this text Saint Paule doth quite cutte them off
and ſhet them out of doores. But when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne
by infirmitie, and that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> hath caught him vnwares,
and yet that the good ſeede of the feare of God which he had is not
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:23060:308"/>
vtterly waterſlaine in him: it becommeth vs too haue pitie and
compaſsion on him. And foraſmuch as we may ſlyde euerie houre,
let vs learne to call yet earneſtlyer vppon God, that hee may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
vs, yea and let vs alſo beare well in minde howe Saint Paule
addeth, <hi>looke to thy ſelfe that thou alſo be not tempted.</hi> Heere he chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
the number. He had ſayd, <hi>Brethren if any man be ouertaken, helpe
ye to amende him.</hi> And now he turneth his tale too euery man parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly,
ſaying: <hi>Looke to thy ſelfe:</hi> and that is too the ende that thys
warning ſhoulde bee the more vehement, and touch vs the nearer.
For we ſee that when one ſpeaketh in generall termes, euery man
thinketh it to be ſpoken to other men, and there is none of vs all
but he would ſhift out himſelfe as much as is poſsible. Then if it be
ſayd, behold, all are inclyned to this or that? verie well, he ſpeaketh
to the whole companie, but in the meane while no man is touched
with it as he ſhould bee. Saint Paule therfore doth expreſly change
the number here, and he thinketh it not ynough too warne all the
faythfull and the bodie of the whole Church in common: but hee
draweth euerie man aſyde and ſayth, looke to thy ſelfe, and examin
what is in thee: for thou alſo mayeſt be tempted. Truly there is not
any reaſon that ought ſooner to perſwade vs to be gentle towardes
ſuch as haue done amiſſe, than when we knowe that we our ſelues
alſo haue neede too bee borne withall. And euen the verie heathen
men haue alledged the ſame. For they haue ſayde, that it is a great
crueltie in a man if hee cannot finde in his heart to beare with the
infirmityes of his companions, ſeeing there is not any man whiche
is not weake himſelfe. It were impoſsible that anye twoo men
ſhoulde liue togither in the worlde, if they bee not pacient to beare
one with another. Then were twoo men ynough too ſet all the
whole worlde on a broyle, if they woulde not beare one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And euen they that thinke themſelues to be moſt perfect, ſhal
finde that they themſelues had neede to be borne withall. For ſurely
if we be not vtterly blockiſhe, wee will hate the euill that is in our
ſelues. And we neede not any man to trouble and vexe vs: euerie
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> in himſelfe by beeing greeued at his
owne imperfections. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it is ſo: what remayneth but that the
ſame ſhould induce vs to deale meeldly and gently with ſuch as are
<pb facs="tcp:23060:309"/>
falne through infirmitie? Thus ye ſee what we haue to marke well
here. And ſoothly if we ſearch well the cauſe why many are infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with ſuch inordinate zeale, and ſtorme ſo extreemely agaynſt
ſmall faults: it is that they thinke not vpon themſelues. Now then
the order that we muſt keepe in this behalf, is firſt to condemne the
euill whatſoeuer it is: marke that for one point. For if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne
the euill but in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ouerſlip it in others: it is a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that we be not led with a right meening minde to the end that God
ſhould be ſerued &amp; honored, but that there is ſome ſecrete roote of
malice in vs,<note place="margin">Prou. 10. b. 12.</note> according as Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſayth, that enmitie bewrayeth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and euery man findeth fault with him to whom he beareth any
grudge. Ye ſee then that the firſt rule which we muſt keepe, is too
condemne the euill whereſoeuer it be found, euen bicauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to Gods will. That is one poynt. The ſeconde is, that euery
of vs muſt examin himſelfe. For ſurely the neerer that any euill is
to our ſelues, ſo much the more muſt wee haue it. If I ſee a deſpizer
of God, it will greeue me more than if he were tenne leagues off
from me, and that I knewe not his faults. Nowe then it ſtandeth vs
on hand to haue an eie to our ſelues. For let vs take this ſimilitude,
the neerer neibours that we be, and the more familiaritie that there
is among men, the more muſt we put the thing in vre which I haue
ſpoken of: that is to wit, the more muſt euerie of vs ſhew other hys
faults when he hath offended. For God hath knit vs togither with
condition that if I haue a freend, I muſt reforme him rather than a
ſtraunger. But nowe when euill is to be condemned, who is neerer
too mee than my ſelfe? Yee ſee then wherein a man ſhall knowe
whether wee ſeeke the honour of God and the clenzing away of
vice or no: namely, if wee be rough and ſharpe in bridelyng of our
ſelues, and that when we rebuke others, wee firſt condemne all our
owne vices, and ſhewe that we miſlyke them, and that we ſeeke too
amende them as much as we can. Ye ſee then that the way for vs to
iudge of our neighbours, is firſt of all to condemne our ſelues. And
this warning ſerueth not onely for the things paſt, but alſo for the
things to come. S. Paule therefore ſayth not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
haſt offended heretofore: but he ſay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>

               <hi>that thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
tempted heereafter.</hi> And truly we ought to walke continually in feare
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:23060:309"/>
and carefulneſſe, not that wee ſhoulde not alwayes reſt vppon
Gods grace and fauour, but that wee muſt not be retchleſſe. For
fayth importeth not that we ſhould bee careleſſe of all things: but
rather (as Saint Paule ſheweth vs in the ſecond to the Philippians)
that foraſmuch as we be not able to do any thing of our ſelues: God
muſt be faine to guide vs by his ſpirite, and when he hath giuen vs
will, he muſt alſo giue vs power to performe it. Forſomuch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as we holde all of God: it behoueth vs to walke in feare and
carefulneſſe. And ſo when wee conſider our faultes paſt, and looke
well vpon our preſent ſtate, we haue continuall cauſe to caſt downe
our eyes. In deede when God vouchſafeth vs the courage to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
goodneſſe, and too condemne naughtineſſe, hee graunteth vs
great grace in making vs iudges, notwithſtanding that we deſerue to
haue our mouthes ſtopped. Yet neuertheleſſe it behoueth vs too
learne to be lowly mynded in rebuking the faultes [in other men]
which we haue alreadie condemned in our ſelues, ſeing that we our
ſelues maye dayly and hourely, yea and euerie minute of an houre
fall. Then ſith the cace ſtandeth ſo: let vs pitie ſuch as offende, for
they be all of them myrrours of our owne frailtie, bycauſe wee ſee
there what we our ſelues are furtherforth than God holdeth vs vp
by the grace of his holy ſpirite. Moreouer, in admoniſhing ſuch as
haue done amiſſe, we may yet (as I tolde you before) offend God in
being too haſtie, too rygorous, and too vnkinde. Although then that
it be a commendable vertue to admoniſh our neighbours: yet if we
be too lauiſh, all will turne into vice, except our Lorde doo ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreyne
vs, as wee keepe an euen hande and ſwarue not aſyde too
any of the twoo vyces that I haue touched afore. Thus ye ſee what
wee haue too remember concerning this ſaying of Sainct Paule.
Nowe hee ſayeth expreſſely, <hi>you that bee ſpirituall:</hi> meening to do
vs to wit, that we bee the more bounde too heare with the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
when God hath ſtrengthned vs by his power, according alſo
as is declared in the fourtenth too the Romanes. And in deede if
God diſtribute his grace more too one man than too another: it is
not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> or that man with all, but rather too
hold vp ſuch as are not able <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> go: like as if two men do go a iourney
togither, and the one feeleth himſelfe weary, ſo as he is not able too
<pb facs="tcp:23060:310"/>
draw his legges after him: it is certaine that he which is ſtrong and
luſtie will not runne before him as it were to ſpite him, but will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayne
himſelfe to his companion, yea and he will toll him forward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
ſaying, Go too man, plucke vp a good heart, and let me helpe thee
my ſelfe. To be ſhort, he will do all that he can to cheare vp his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that is ſo faint. After the ſame maner alſo muſt wee beare one
with another, ſith we ſee that God hath called vs all in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, and
chozen vs with condition that we ſhould go all together with one
accord, and euery man reache out his hand too his neybour (as the
prophet Eſay ſpeaketh of it) and ſay,<note place="margin">Eſay. 2. a. 3.</note> Go we, let vs go vp to the hill
of the Lord. It is no reaſon then that ſuch as haue receiued a larger
meaſure of Gods giftes, ſhould go about to oppreſſe others: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that they ſhould beare with their infirmities, and bee touched
with the meeldneſſe that we haue ſpoken of. Thus ye ſee howe S.
Paule ſayth expreſly, that the more that our Lorde hath ſet vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
the more ought we to drawe others after vs. And herevpon
he addeth for a concluſion, <hi>Beare ye one anothers burthens, and ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
the lawe of Christe.</hi> VVhen as hee ſayth that wee muſte beare
the burthens [of our neighbours:] he doth yet better expreſſe the
thing that I haue tolde you heretofore: that is to wit, that he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
not here of the deſpizers of God, which runne into all licenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
and are ſaped in malice and ſturdineſſe: but of ſuche as
trauell and go forwarde in all goodneſſe, and haue an earneſt good
will too attaine to it, and whiche do euen grone vnder their ſinnes,
as vnder a burthen that is to heauie for them. For the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
hereof, wee will ſet downe a ſimilitude contrarie too
that whiche is ſet downe heere by Sainct Paule. He ſayth that
ſuche as are ouertaken with their ſinnes, are made as it were too
ſtoupe vnder the burthen. And why? Bicauſe they are angrie with
themſelues. Not that they fret or chafe agaynſt God through pride
and diſdeyne: but bycauſe they bee not able to withſtande Satan ſo
ſtedfaſtly and ſtoutly as they faine woulde. But as for theſe royſters
that are giuen too all euill, they be ſo farre off from ſtouping vnder
their burthen, that they rather ryde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
triumphing and vaunting themſelues, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> though they would vtterly
defie God. Thus ſee yee the diuerſitie that is betwixt them which
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:23060:310"/>
are to bee borne with, and thoſe agaynſt whom all rigour may bee
vſed. For the one ſorte is bowed with the weight of the burthen
which dooth in maner wey them downe: and theſe are the ſame
whom our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt calleth to him, ſaying: Come vnto
mee all yee that labour and are heauie loden, and I wil refreſh you,
and you ſhall finde reſt for your ſoules.<note place="margin">Math. 11. d. 28.</note> Our Lorde Ieſus calleth
not all men without exception vnto him, but giueth a marke too
ſuch as may haue acceſſe to obteyne fauour, namely that they bee
ouerloden: that is to ſay, they welter not in their ſinnes, ne take
pleaſure in them, neyther doo they boaſt of them as folke paſte
ſhame: but they would fayne haue eaſe, and can finde none in
them ſelues. Therefore he ſayth he is readie to deale gently wyth
them. And for the ſame cauſe alſo dooth S. Paule in the ſeuenth to
the Romanes ſay, that he dooth not the good whiche he woulde,
but the euill which he would not. Nowe S. Paule ſpeaketh there of
him ſelfe: in ſo much that although he were as an Angell of God
in reſpecte of his conuerſation in this worlde, and as a myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of all holyneſſe: yet dooth he mourne ſtill, and ſay he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.
And why ſo? Bicauſe he was hilde as a captiue in priſon, in
ſo muche as he was not at libertie too giue him ſelfe fully vnto
God: for he was hindered by his owne ſinfulneſſe. Nowe if S.
Paule were in that taking: howe ſhall wee doo? By the way wee
ſee howe this worde <hi>Burthen</hi> is to bee vnderſtoode, where it is
ſayde that wee muſt beare one anothers burthens. Heerein Sainct
Paule exhorteth vs to holde vp one another: and if any man miſſe
of his duetie, wee muſt not therefore giue him ouer, but bee incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to pitifulneſſe ſtill, and vſe the forementioned meekeneſſe.
To be ſhort, he ſayth that wee be knit togither with ſuche condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that if any of vs be ouerloden or waxe faynt, the reſt muſte
ſupply his defaulte and weakneſſe (as I ſayde) euen as inclined
therto by nature, without beeing incouraged by the worde of God.
If wee be going of a iorney in a companie togither, and ſee any of
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> euery of vs will helpe to harten him: and

               </gap> vnlode him, and euery man take
a peece of his burthen. In like wyſe let vs conſider that the ſinnes
whiche wee commit through infirmitie, are burthens, and that in
<pb facs="tcp:23060:311"/>
ſuche caces it behoueth vs too put vnder our ſhoulders, too eaſe
ſuch as are welneere wayed downe with them. Not that we ſhould
vſe any flatterie, as I haue ſayde afore: but that wee ſhould helpe
too amende them. And for proofe heereof, if a man offende God,
and I ouerpaſſe it, ſo as he continueth in his naughtineſſe: the
burthen increaſeth in ſuche wiſe, as it is inoughe too breake hys
necke. For whereas he had but one burthen: beholde now are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mo added, too beare him downe to the grounde, euen for want
of warning. In ſo muche that if he had bin admoniſhed at the firſt,
he had bin eaſed of his lode: where as nowe by cloking of his vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
wee bee the cauſe that the poore wretche can neuer bee relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
And therefore it behoueth vs too vſe the foreſayde meane:
whiche is, that in bearing with the weaklings, wee muſt not fayle
too touche them to the quicke, that they maye bee made too ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their faults, too the ende too amende them. Nowe for
a concluſion Sainct Paule ſayth, <hi>that wee must by that meane ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
the lawe of Christ.</hi> It is not too bee doubted but that S. Paule
ment heere after a couert maner too nippe thoſe agaynſt whome
he diſputed heeretofore. For wee haue ſeene howe that in thoſe
dayes there were many that woulde haue had men too keepe the
Ceremonies of the Lawe: for that was all their holineſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Therefore bicauſe they euer had the worde Lawe in their
mouth, and bare men in hande that they ſhould diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

of the Lawe: wee muſte not ſeeke it elſewhere than
in Ieſus Chriſt, who is the euerlaſting wiſedome of God, and was
ſente too bring vs all perfection of wiſedome. Seeing it is ſo: let
vs aboue all things looke what he commaundeth vs, and conſider
what yoke he layeth vpon our backes or neckes: which is, that we
ſhould loue one another, as it is ſayde in the .xiij. of Sainct Iohn,

wee muſt apply all our whole minde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely to beare with ſuch as

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:23060:311"/>
to releeue them. By what meanes then we ſhall fulfill Chriſtes
Lawe: and when wee haue ſo fulfilled it, wee may defie all ſuche
as condemne vs. Thoſe therefore which fulfill the Lawe of Chriſt,
ſhall be no more ſubiect to the ceremoniall Lawe as they terme
it. It is true that wee ſhall neuer fulfill the Lawe of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, neither in this reſpect, nor in [any] other. But S. Paule
ſheweth vs the marke that wee muſt labour too come at. Although
then that wee bee continually on our way ſo long as wee be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant
in this world: yet muſt wee not runne at aduenture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing whither wee go. For wee haue our marke ſet vp afore
vs, and thither muſt wee inforce our ſelues. So then, that wee may
ſerue God according to his owne will, let vs learne too giue oure
ſelues wholly vnto him: and to the intent it may bee knowen that
his will is too holde vs in ſuche vnitie one with another: like as
he hath knit vs togither in an inſeparable bande, ſo let vs ſeeke to
drawe our neybours vnto him, and therwithall let vs bee patient
and meeke when aught is to be corrected: and yet not bee willing
that vice ſhould be nouriſhed through flatterie &amp; diſsimulation.</p>
            <p>Now let vs kneele downe before the maieſtie of our good God,
with acknowledgement of our faults, praying him to make vs feele
them more and more, ſo as it may make vs to mourne before him
with true repentance, and to aske him forgiueneſſe of them, and to
labour always to be knit vnto him, and to be rid of all the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of our fleſh, and to be clothed with his righteouſneſſe: and
that in the meane while he will beare with our feebleneſſe, till he
haue fully deliuered vs. And ſo let vs all ſay, Almightie God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly

they be not vtterly wilfull in wickedneſſe.
And ſo yee ſee in what caces wee ought to be
pitifull. But when wee ſee men ſo proud, that
they deſpiſe God with ſtubborne outrage: it
is not for vs too vſe any meeldeneſſe or gentleneſſe in that cace,
but for as muche as they bee ſeene too praunce ſo in their braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that loftineſſe of theirs muſte bee plucked downe, when they
exalte them ſelues after that faſhion agaynſt God. Alſo I tolde
you therewithall, that too keepe a good meane in rebuking ſuche
as haue doone amiſſe, euery man had neede too bethinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
for wee muſt firſt of all condemne oure ſelues: that is the
poynt which wee muſte beginne at. And when wee ſee what wee

ſhuts his eyes when he ſhould thinke vpon his owne ſinnes. Of a

by this meanes he bringeth vs too the very welſpring (as I ſayde
this morning) whiche is that if men were not vayneglorious and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:23060:312"/>
deſirous of eſtimation, ſurely there woulde bee another maner
of modeſtie and ſoberneſſe than is too bee ſeene. But for as much
as euery man is puffed vp with pride, therefore wee couet ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie
aboue all men, and ſeeke occaſion too treade them vnder
foote, or elſe to ouercountenance them in ſuche wiſe, as they may
ſeeme our vnderlings. Therefore it is vnpoſsible to redreſſe thys
outrage of coueting after that ſorte too carpe and bite men: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we be firſt rid of this fonde deſire to be had in eſtimation, and
to bee as it were aduaunced aboue others. No doubt but men can
talke well inough of humilitie: but there are very fewe that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande
what the worde meaneth and importeth. Neuertheleſſe
S. Paule ſheweth vs heere, which is the true humilitie: that is too
wit, that men ſhould vtterly abace them ſelues, and conſider that
they bee nothing woorth, for then ſhall they bee rightly humbled.
VVhen humilitie or lowlyneſſe is talked of in common ſpeeche:
it is taken to bee but a deuice. For euery man can well inough ſay
by his honeſtie, that he is nothing: but in the meane whyle they
ceaſſe not to ſwell lyke Toades with the poyſon of pride. But S.
Paule teacheth vs heere a farre other leſſon: which is, that wee
muſte put away all opinion of our owne wiſedome, and of all the
vertues that wee can imagine our ſelues too haue. For it is ſayde
heere in one word, that wee muſt thinke our ſelues to be nothing.
And in very deede, the ſaying that is ſet downe heere muſte bee
layde foorth thus: Seeing that men are nothing at all: they that
preſume vpon their owne vertues, and glory of them, beguile them
ſelues willingly. Therefore let vs take this parte, namely that wee
bee nothing. It is true that God hath lefte ſtill ſome markes in vs,
whereby it may bee perceyued that hee hath exalted vs in worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and excellencie aboue the brute beaſtes, in as muche as it
was his wyll to create vs after his owne image. Then if wee haue
reſpecte too the thing that God dyd put into vs, the ſame oughte
too bee eſteemed ſtill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but yet for all that, in reſpecte of oure
owne perſons wee bee nothing. For wee bee wholly bounde vnto

<pb facs="tcp:23060:313"/>
increaſe our ſhame, bicauſe that all the vnderſtanding, iudgement,
and diſcretion that is in vs, is corrupted and marred by our owne
naughtineſſe. Too bee ſhorte, wee bee like a ſtinking and rotten
veſſell, and Gods giftes are as good wine that is put into the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell:
and ſo by that meanes all is marde. Euen ſo is it with vs. VVe
bee veſſels. And what maner of veſſels? Veſſels infected wyth
the corruption of ſinne. God putteth of his giftes into vs, too the
ende he mighte bee glorified by it. Nowe, maye wee deſerue too
haue any prayſe thereby before men? No, but rather blame,
bicauſe that wee by our ſinfulneſſe doo marre the good thyngs
that God hathe put intoo vs. Moreouer, where as it is ſayde that
wee bee nothing: it is bicauſe wee can not but apply all oure
vnderſtanding and reaſon vntoo euill, and for that wee wyll
needes bee counted wyſe,<note place="margin">Gen. 6. b. 5.</note> [when as notwithſtanding] God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoweth
that there is nothing but naughtineſſe in vs, and that
all oure thoughtes, are but vanities, leaſings, illuſions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptes.
Agayne, where as too our ſeeming wee haue a wyll wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
wee chooſe bothe good and euill: the ſame will is a bondſlaue
too ſinne, ſo as wee doo nothing elſe but fighte agaynſt God.
As muche is too bee ſayde of all oure affections. And if we haue
any thing elſe that ſeemeth commendable, God diſtributeth it too
euery man as it pleaſeth him ſelfe, and moreouer he is fayne too
continue the thing that he hath begonne, as wee ſee by experience.
VVhat cauſe then hathe he too boaſt, whiche hathe a ſharpe and
ſuttle witte, ſeeing it is not he that hath made him ſelfe to excell,
as though he had bin his owne maker? Therefore wee muſt holde
all things of God, and doo him homage for them. Agayne we ſee
that euen they which take them ſelues to bee iollyeſt fellowes, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they that are moſt honored in the world, who muſt not be replied
agaynſt when they haue once ſpoken the worde, I ſay wee ſhall ſee
euen them made brutiſhe when it pleaſeth God. So then, let vs
conclude that Sainct Paule dooth iuſtly aboliſhe heere all the
power that men preſume to haue, to the ende that they maye bee
rightly humbled, that is to wit, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap> our

               </gap> or one poynt. Now here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
he mocketh the fonde vaynegloriouſneſſe whiche rauiſheth
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:23060:313"/>
their wittes, bicauſe there is not any man that would willingly bee
beguyled. And in very deede it is a greefe to vs when wee ſee any
man go about to winde vs in by wylyneſſe and diſsimulation, and
we can by no meanes brooke it: and yet for all that we ſhall finde
no greater deceyuers in the worlde too vs, than our ſelues. Euery
man deceyues himſelfe, euery man ouerthrowes him ſelfe, yea and
that in a manner willingly: and what a follie is that? Nowe then
wee ſee S. Paules drifte, and alſo the leſſon that wee haue too ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of that ſentence. For as much as euery of vs will needes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
him ſelfe by abacing his fellowes: therefore S. Paule tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs, that if wee make a good and righte tryall of the things that
are in vs: there will not bee founde ſo muche as one drop of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
that deſerueth prayſe, at leaſtwiſe in reſpecte of our owne
perſons. For wee bee nothing, and there needed but one blaſt too
make cleane diſpatche of vs. Therefore it is but a fooliſhe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening
that letteth vs too walke in ſimplicitie. And ſo let vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande
firſt of all, that wee can not chalenge any thing too our
ſelues without treaſon to God, bicauſe it is a robbing of him of the
right that belongeth to him, and which ought to be reſerued vnto
him, and that is to our owne deſtruction. For in good fayth what
ſhall we gayne by it when we ſhall haue abuſed men, and when we
ſhall haue bin taken for other than we be? To be ſhorte, when we
ſhall haue bin as Idols, what will bee the ende of it but our owne
decay and confuſion? Then ſeeing it is ſo: let vs learne too bee
caſt down &amp; layde flat vpon the ground, that we may be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grounded in our God. And to bring that to paſſe, let vs learne
to magnifie him only. And in the meane while, if it pleaſe him to
exalte vs, let vs not ceaſſe to keepe our ſelues in continuall awe
with ſoberneſſe and modeſtie, knowing that wee haue nothing of
our owne, and that whatſoeuer God hath giuen vnto vs, he muſte
be fayne to preſerue it in vs from time to time, and that wee muſt
ſo holde all things of him, as to make a willing ſacrifice and obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them vnto him, indeuoring to imploy ourſelues in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap> the meaſure of grace which wee
haue receiued of him, &amp; yeelding the prayſe thereof too him vnto
whom it belongeth. This is in effect the thing that wee haue too
<pb facs="tcp:23060:314"/>
remember vppon this ſtreyne. Truely it is harde too bring vs too
this reaſonableneſſe. And in good ſoothe wee ſee the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
that are nowe a dayes about Freewill and mens owne
vertues, as though men were able to aduaunce them ſelues, and to
take the grace of God, and by that meane to deſerue well. But all
this proceedeth of this, that men are forepoſſeſſed with ſuch diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe
pride, as they wyll euermore needes bee ſomewhat of them
ſelues. And therefore it ſtandeth vs ſo muche the more on hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
too put this doctrine in practiſe. Certaynely wee can not profite
at all in Gods ſchole,<note place="margin">Pſ. 143. b. 6</note> nor in the holy Scripture, till we haue kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
that wee bee nothing at all, too the ende wee may come too
drawe out of the fulneſſe of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. But that can
wee not doo, excepte wee bee firſt vtterly dryed vp in our ſelues;
and confeſſe with Dauid that wee bee as the earth that is ſcorched
and clouen with heate, and haue no whit of wetting or moyſture,
other than it may receyue from heauen. Herevpon S. Paul addeth,
<hi>Therefore let euery man trye his owne worke, and then ſhall be haue prayſe
in him ſelfe, and not of other men:</hi> that is to ſay, not by comparing of
him ſelfe with other men. Heere S. Paule remedieth yet one other
vice which is to common, and yet notwithſtanding we will all of vs
graunt it to be deadly of it ſelfe, and that al of vs are attainted with
it: namely that we eſteeme our ſelues as little Angels, when other
men are worſe than we, or at leaſtwiſe when we find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not better.
And that is the very thing that rocketh ſo many wretched ſoules
aſleepe nowadays, making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to forget the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, ſo as they make
no reckning neither of God nor of their owne ſaluation. It is bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſee that the whole world tag &amp; rag doth go that trace.
If wee take a whole towne, and aske them from one to an other
how they behaue themſelues, ſurely euery man will haue his excuſe
and they will all pretende this for a buckler, Tuſh wee muſt doo as
other men doo. As much will they ſay in cities &amp; countreis. To be
ſhort, we wil needs be like coliars ſacks (as the Prouerbe ſayth) one
of vs maketh another black. And agayn, we beare our ſelues in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d;
that we be quite &amp; clere before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> is as
bad as I, wee ſee that the world is no better, it is apparante that all
men doo ſo. Howebeeit, beſides that theſe ſhifts can not purge vs,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:23060:314"/>
they be an occaſion too harden vs in all naughtineſſe, and to make
vs rebelliouſly to deſpiſe Gods iuſtice, as though wee ſhould neuer
come to account of our doyngs. So haue we a very good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
exhortation in this text, when S. Paule ſaith that euery man
muſt trie his own worke. True it is that the word which he vſeth,
might be taken for to approue or allow: but it agreeth not with the
matter: for he ſpeaketh heere of the tryall or examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man ought to make of himſelf, without comparing himſelfe with
others:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10. b. 7.</note> according as we ſee how in the ſecond to the Corinthians,
he taunteth ſuch as had meaſured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by others mens yardes.
For S. Paule ſayd vntoo them, Euery one of you conſider what he
hath done, and when yee haue well layd all your percells togither<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
what will you ſhewe? Therfore euery one of you muſt come and
as it were lay himſelf vpon the racke, that it may be ſeene what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of man he is, and what he hath done: and then may iudgement
be giuen of him. Euen ſo is it ſayd in this text, that euery man muſt
try his owne worke. As if he ſhould ſay, we will needes be aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
one aboue another, but if it bee caſt in any of our teeth that we
haue done amiſſe, by and by his cloke ſhall be, that he hath a great
ſort of fellowes: but that ſhall neuer go for payment before God
(ſayth S. Paule:) euery man muſt ſhole out himſelfe, and ſet himſelf
alone aſide from the reſt, and vnderſtand that he ſhall be acquit or
condemned before God, not therafter as another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall be found
to bee better or worſe than he, but after the rule of the iudge, that
is to ſay, after his woord. For God hath on the one ſide his owne
word, &amp; on the otherſide our life. Therfore the true balance wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
we muſt come: is not too ſet downe the multitude [for our
excuce] and to ſay, ſuch men or ſuch haue miſinſtructed me, I haue
followed that which I ſawe, it was the common faſhion, I was faine
to doo ſo whithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I would or no: for I was caryed away, bycauſe I
was not able to ſtand ageinſt a multitude. No, none of theſe things
will go for payment before God, it will not ſerue our turne to ſay,
that we haue many fellowes. But (as I haue ſayde already) the true
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Counterpeyſe, and [to conſider]
that although the whole world draw vs vnto euill, yet wee ſhal not
bee excuſed if we preferre not God and his word before all mens
<pb facs="tcp:23060:315"/>
doyngs. And heere firſt of all, in following the matter that S. Paule
layeth forthe, when account is to be entered into, we muſt call our
ſelues home to examine our owne lyues throughly. For a man ſhall
neuer bee touched with true repentance, nor neuer acknowledge
his ſins without hypocriſie, till he haue ſhet his eyes ageynſt al the
doyngs of other men, and fall to conſidering thus with hymſelfe:
Go too, what is it that my God commaundeth mee? After what
manner may I appeare before hys iudgement ſeate? Howe wyll he
iudge mee? Accordyng too hys worde. Beholde heere in effecte
howe wee may be touched with the true feare of God: behold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
howe wee may miſlyke of our ſinnes, and finally bee humbled:
namely, not by looking vppon this man or that man, but by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
truely what wee ourſelues are, and therevppon by reſoluing
our ſelues fully, that only Gods word ſhall beare ſway with vs, &amp;
that it is not for vs to giue iudgement by the things that are ſeene
in the world. Let that ſerue for one poynt. And herevppon alſo we
may gather a generall leſson: namely that it is to groſſe an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
too thinke too burie our faultes and too ſcape vneſpyed, by
hauing a great number giltie as well as our ſelues. And yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
it is the common excuce nowe adayes, as I haue touched
alreadie: but yet for all that it is but a tryfling excuce. If a manne
aske why the Papiſtes are ſo dull, and why they giue no eare too
any reaſon, tell them what yee can, but account it as nothing: it is
bycauſe they iudge by compariſon, ſaying: Al the world doth thus.
Too bee ſhorte, God ſeemeth vntoo them too bee barred of all
libertie, when the worlde behaueth it ſelfe otherwyſe than he hath
commaunded by hys woorde. But it is too no purpoſe for them
too ſet downe and obiect ſuche examples: for they cannot preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
God, that he ſhuld not alwayes condemne ſuch as haue done
amiſſe. Thoughe there were a thouſande worldes, yet ſhoulde
they all go to wrecke before him, ſpecially if men came wyth ſuch
ſtatelyneſſe, as too ſaye, Thus and thus doo wee. And who are

let the reſt alone: but that lyke as God hath written all in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes,
ſo wee on our ſide ſhould ſearch throughly by parcelmeale
wherin we may haue offended, and what vices and infirmities there
are in vs. That is it that S. Paule ment by the word <hi>woorke.</hi> For it
may happen now &amp; then, that in ſome one point we ſhall haue ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
God faithfully, but yet howſoeuer it be done, there is ſtil ſome
infirmitie in it. Agein wee be faultie of ſo many imperfections, as
it abaſheth vs too ſee it, and wee cannot but euen lothe ourſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.</p>
            <p>Therfore let vs learne to examin our owne liues well, before we
iudge of other mennes. For ſeeyng that God dooth vs the honour
to make euery of vs his owne iudge: wee do but increaſe our own
damnation before him, when wee be ſo rough and ſeuere towardes
thoſe that haue offended, and forget our owne ſinnes. Now wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
S. Paule ſaith that euery man ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> haue praiſe in himſelfe only: it
is not ment when men examine themſelues, they ſhal find cauſe in
them wherfore to be prayſed: but that the true praiſe is that which
hath ſome ſubſtantialneſſe in it ſelfe: which is, that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know
what he himſelfe is, and iudge of himſelfe without comparing with
others. As for example: it is alwayes ſayd that a purblind perſon is
cleerſighted, among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are ſtarke blind. And among the black
Moores, he that is tawny will ſeeme white. If iudgement bee giuen
of a white man when he is among a dozen Moores, there will be no
whiteneſſe vnto his. But if he bee brought ageine among his owne
countrymen, he will bee found to bee a farre other than he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to bee. If it bee ſayde, Lo heere a man that is cleerſighted, and
yet he is but purblind: his cleerſightedneſſe ſhall bee but in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of them that are ſtarke blind: for his eyeſight is not cleere
and ſound in deede. Euen ſo, too iudge by compariſon is a very
fond thing. Thus yee ſee in effect what Sainct Paule ment to ſay.
He ment not that when wee haue examined our lyfe, wee haue
wherefore too commend and eſteeme our ſelues: but that all the
prayſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> chalenge too themſelues, are but wynde
and ſmoke, and ſtarke lyes, bycauſe their gazing is at themſelues,
as if a man ſhould bee in loue with his owne image.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:316"/>
Marke me a little chyld when one ſheweth him a glaſſe, he knowes
not whither it be himſelfe or another, whom he ſees there, and yet
is he altogether fond of it. Euen ſo is it with all ſuche as beleeue
themſelues to be wonderous fellowes. And why ſo? VVherevpon
do they ground themſelues, or what reaſon moueth them, but that
they ſeeme to themſelues to be of more valew, than they that were
able to ſhewe them the way? For ſee heere what they will alledge.
O (ſay they) ſuche a man is well eſteemed, but yet he hath ſuche a
fault and ſuch a fault in him. So that when a mans vyces are ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
out, if they be condemned, ye ſee it is but a ſport of little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Therfore not without cauſe doth S. Paule ſay, that to make a
a good tryall, that wee may haue a well grounded prayſe and ſuch a
one as may ſtand before God, wee muſt try ourſelues. If a man ſay,
yea: but may a man prayſe himſelfe? It is ſo certeine that we muſt
be voyd of all glorie, to put in vre that which wee haue ſeen in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
text, where it is ſayd that we muſt glorie in God. The queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then is not whither men may bee prayſed or no: but S. Paule
hath ſayd condicionally, that if any man will be praiſed of God, he
muſt withdraw himſelf as it were into his ſecret chamber, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what maner of one he is: and then will he be no more ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe
as to commend himſelfe or to ſay, tuſhe, I am woorth as much
as ſuch a one, I am as good a man as he. VVhen this greere is pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
downe: then ſhall a man ſee whither he ought to be prayſed or
no. Now of a truth, it is certein that there is not one ſparke of praiſe
in vs, at leaſt wiſe that we may chalendge as our owne. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
wee ſhall not fayle to haue prayſe in our God: which is much
better than if wee were hoyſſed aboue the Cloudes. For when me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
deceiue themſelues with a vayne opinion, or that the whole
world laugheth vpon them: it ſeemeth to them that they flie in the
aire: but it is the next way to make them tumble downe &amp; breake
their neckes. Lo wherevntoo all this preſumption that blindeth vs
ſerueth vs. But when we once know what it is too ſeeke prayſe in
God: then are wee in the way too bee rightly knit vnto him, and
ſo ſhall wee ſtand vppon a good and ſure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and
eſteemed. According wherevnto wee ſee how S. Paule glorieth in
his good conſcience and in his vprightneſſe. He ſayth that they who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:23060:316"/>
he hath wonne vnto Ieſus Chriſt by the Goſpell are his Crowne or
garland. And all Gods ſeruants may ſay as much. Neuertheleſſe, it
is not ment that they muſt part ſtakes with God, as they do which
alledge their own vertues and deſeruings, who out of all doubt do
make as it were ydolls of themſelues: But that the faithful hauing
confeſſed themſelues to be nothing at all but by Gods free good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
reioyce in the things that he hath giuen them, alwayes reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
too him his due. Therfore when wee deſire not too haue any
thing too ourſelues alone from God, but depend vppon him and
vpon his meere grace: then ſhall wee haue praiſe, howbeit in our
ſelues (ſayth S. Paule) and not in other folke. Nowe whereas it is
ſayd <hi>But in ourſelues:</hi> it is not ment that the praiſe ſpringeth in our
ſelues, and that wee bee not ſinners: but he hath an eye too that
which I haue told you alreadie: which is, that ſo long as men ſtand
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> comparing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues wyth other folks, they do but deceiue
themſelues. For it wyll ſeeme that wee bee little Angells: and yet
for all that, wee ſhall bee neuer a whit better than Diuells. And
why? For wee lyken ourſelues but too ſuche as are ſtarke nought
and vtterly corrupted. Nowe if euer this warning were neceſſarie,
it is moſt neceſſarie nowe adayes. For althoughe there haue bin
muche corruption euen euer from Sainct Paules tyme hytherto:
yet at this day it is come to the full heygth of it. And in very deede
it ſeemeth that all ſtates and degrees haue conſpired ageynſt God.
VVee ſee then that the worlde ruſheth foorth as it were into a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
rage, too make warre ageynſt all equitie and vpryghtneſſe:
and yet wee ceaſſe not too ſleepe ſtill in ſuch confuſion. And why?
Bycauſe euery man dooth ſo. And by that meanes God is as it
were driuen backe. Thinke wee that wee by our iniquities ſhall
thruſt him out of his ſeate, or bereeue him of his authoritie of iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the whole world? No: For all of vs without exception muſt
appeare before him, and there wee cannot ſhocke ourſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
too ſay, Sirs let vs ſticke too our tackeling, for wee bee too
great a multitude God wyth one blaſt of hys mouth is able too
ſincke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo, let vs put the thing in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
which is ſpoken heere by Sainct Paul, and let euery man keepe
good watche ouer himſelfe. And when wee ſee blaſphemie, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:317"/>
wantonneſſe, Looceneſſe, drunkenneſſe, gluttonie, pyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and polling, periurie, treaſon, enuie, and ſuche other lyke
things haue theyr full ſcope: Let vs bee ſorie for it, and yet let vs
not thinke that bycauſe the thornes among the which wee walke
doo ſcratch vs, therefore wee bee diſcharged: nor that it may
auayle vs when wee can alledge, that other men haue bin the cauſe
of our ſtarting out intoo lewde behauiour, or of that wee haue bin
caryed away in deede as it were wyth a whirle wynde. I ſay let vs
not thinke that that can auayle vs: but let vs followe Gods word
when it is preached vntoo vs: Let that bee all our wyſedome. Let
that bee all our counſell, accordyng as it is ſayde in the hundred
and nyneteenth Pſalme, that Gods commaundementes are the
Counſellers of a faythfull man. VVhen a young man that is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
too fall too vnthriftineſſe hath a gouernour too holde hym in
awe, he will bee reſtreyned for a tyme. Nowe truely Satan hathe
great ſtore of allurementes, and infinite meanes and occaſions to
breake our neckes withall: But God of his grace gyueth vs coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
he ſetteth hys word before vs.</p>
            <p>Therfore it is good reaſon he ſhoulde win ſo muche at our
handes as too bee herde of vs, and that wee ſhould frame our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
too hym: for what ſhall it aduauntage vs too haue alledged a
hundred thouſande tymes that wee haue doone as other men did?
It is all one as if wee ſhoulde ſaye, Tuſhe ſirra, wee paſſe not ſo muche for GOD as for menne, wee haue preferred the worlde,
whyche ledde vs too vnthriftineſſe, and withdrawen our ſelues
from all goodneſſe. Is thys a reaſonable excuce? No: Is it not
all one as if wee ſhoulde ſpit in hys face, and bid hym backe and
get him hence, that men maye haue full ſwaye among vs, for wee
muſt doo as they doo and frame our ſelues too the bent of theyr
bowe? Thus yee ſee in fewe woordes too what vſe wee ought
now adayes too put thys doctrine of Sainct Paules. And for the
ſame cauſe alſo he addeth, <hi>that euery man ſhall beare his owne bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi>
As if he had ſayde, euery man ſhall bee combered ynoughe
for hymſelfe, wythout helping <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap> this
ſentence may bee applyed too many vſes, yea euen wythoute
turning of the woordes from Sainct Paules owne meaning. For
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:23060:317"/>
if thys reaſon that euery manne ſhall beare hys owne burthen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
GOD, bee alleaged as a generall matter: then vſeth he the
woorde <hi>Burthen,</hi> too cutte off all excuces, too the ende that men
ſhoulde thinke that all theyr ſhyftes and ſtartingholes cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle
them: and that is well woorthie too bee marked. For wee
ſee what malapertneſſe is in vs: wee woulde bee aſhamed to ſtand
in contention wyth creatures as wee doo with our GOD, and
for proofe thereof, if God preſſe vs, wee wyll neuer leaue oure
replying and murmuring, till wee bee more than conuicted. Yee
ſee then that Sainct Paules ſetting downe of thys woorde <hi>Burthen,</hi>
is as if he ſhoulde ſaye that wee cannot accuſe GOD, nor winne
any thing by ſtanding in contention with him. For why? VVhence
commeth the condemnation that preſſeth vs? Is it of that God
ſtretcheth oute hys arme too make vs feele hys power in ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmyng
vs? No, but euery manne ſhall beare his owne bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
            <p>Nowe it is verie true that Gods wrathe is lykened too a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

commeth the wood of the fyre that conſumeth vs? VVhat kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth?
VVhat maynteineth it? It is wee our ſelues: Our ſinnes
are (as yee woulde ſaye) the wood, and our wicked luſtes haue
kindled the fyre. Euen ſo is it as in reſpecte of the woorde <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi>
It is true that it is Gods hand which preſſeth the wicked: but
yet notwithſtanding if they looke vppon the verye cauſe, they
ſhall fynde it to bee their owne ſinnes. Thus much concerning the
worde <hi>Burthen.</hi> Now after that S. Paule hath ſtopped all mouthes,
&amp; ſhewed that wee muſt quietly receiue the iudgement that God
ſhall giue vppon vs: he telleth vs that euery man ſhall beare hys
owne burthen. And thervpon wee haue to gather the thing which
I haue touched alreadie, namely that euery man ſhal bee combered
ynough with himſelfe. And S. Paule doth purpoſely ſay ſo, bycauſe
that when I referre my ſelf to cuſtome, and ſay, the faſhion or guiſe
is ſo, and euery man dooth ſo: it is all one as if I would vnburthen
my ſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

to beare my burthen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:318"/>
Behold, God calleth mee, and I muſt bee fayne to yeelde vp an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of my lyfe: and I ſhall go ſeeke warrantes too anſwere for
mee. And who be they? Euery man ſhal bee combered ynough in
anſwering for himſelf: there is not that man which hath not faults
ynow of his own alreadie. And how then could they beare my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
if I ſhould caſt it vpon them, ſeeing they bee ſo ſore loden al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
with themſelues, as is able too wey them downe a hundred
times? Is it not then a great folly for mee to bring ſuch warrantes
before God? I am giltie of a hundred thouſand faultes, I ſhall bee
put there into the throng among the reſt, and if I examine my ſelfe
rightly, I ſhall finde my ſelfe worſe than giltie as I ſayd, and yet for
all this, I will ſatiſfye God with ſaying, I haue followed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
trace. VVhile I go about to diſcharge my ſelfe after this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
vppon others, a thouſand perſons or twayne ſhall fall vpon
mee, and by that meanes my burthen which was too heauie already
ſhall bee increaſed and bee made much heauier: and ſo yee ſee wee
ſhall ſtill abide in confuſion. Nowe therefore wee ſee what folly it
is too alledge men, as thoughe they could defend vs ageynſt God,
or that wee could bee exempted from our deſerued condemnation
by making a number of bucklers after that ſort, too ſheelde ourſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
ageinſt God: as who ſhould ſay, the matter were doubtfull who
ſhould get the vpper hande,<note place="margin">Eſai. 40. b. 8.</note> whither Gods woord whych muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
for euer and cannot bee impeached, or elſe our luſtes whiche
are fleſhely. For whereof commeth cuſtome, and faſhion, and all
that men terme lawfulneſſe, and antiquitie or preſcription and ſuch
other things? Of nothing elſe but that men will needes be wiſe in
deſpite of God: and moreouer are caried away with their own wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
luſtes, &amp; euery man would haue the bridle ſlaked, to take leaue
too do all maner of lewdneſſe. Yee ſee then that wee cannot bring
any warrantes too ſet ageynſt God, but wee make open warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geynſt
him. To bee ſhort, if euery of vs conſider that he is ouerlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with his owne faultes, he ſhall haue cauſe to humble himſelfe.
For there is not any man which is not beaten downe to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
if God liſte too enter intoo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

ſhall haue ſomewhat continually in them that is woorthie of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:23060:318"/>
blame, ſo as they ſhall bee confounded. Let vs acknowledge this,
and yeelde God the whole prayſe, ſuffering our ſelues to bee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
by him. And let vs go backe againe to that which S. Paule
tolde vs heretofore: that is to wit, [to beware] that wee deceyue
not our ſelues wilfully, when we would ſhew our ſelues hardie and
bolde in correcting, rebuking, and amending one man or other. Let
vs not bee ſo fooliſh as to iuſtifie our ſelues by compariſon, as who
ſhould ſay that God ought to hold himſelfe contented with our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking
of others after that maner, and for that there is ſome ſhewe
of vertue in vs. Let vs not ſtay vpon any of theſe things, as is told vs
vs heere, but let vs marke alſo by the way, that whereas it is ſayde
that euery man ſhal beare his own burthen, we haue right great need
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſts helpe,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2. d. 24.</note> and that he ſhould take all our bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
vpon him, according as in very deed hee hath borne all our
ſinnes vpon the croſſe, as ſayth S. Peter in his firſt Epiſtle. True it is
that the matter which S. Paule handleth here, is none other than the
ſame that I haue declared alreadie: that is to wit, that we muſt not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin
that men are able to warrant vs, for the rightuouſeſt man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue
is combered ynough with himſelf. And furthermore, that if our
Lord had not regard to hold vs vp, wee ſhoulde be oppreſſed vnder
our burthen. Yet notwithſtanding euery man muſt anſwer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and Gods word muſt haue the maiſtrie as I ſaid afore. Thus ye
ſee what S. Paule intended to tell vs. But yet further, let vs thinke a
little vpon our ſelues. If euery man ſhould be faine to beare his own
burthen, who were able to indure it? VVe ſhould needes be borne
downe. For if a man had but ſome one ſinne in him, behold hel were
readie too ſwallowe him vp. Surely the weight of one ſinne is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier
than a ſtone that were able to cruſh all our limmes and bones a
peeces. Nowe it is no talking of any one, nor of a hundred: the
multitude of them is infinite. How then ſhall we ſtande in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before God when he bringeth vs to account? VVho can ſay
that hee commeth franke and free? To be ſhort, we ſee that if there
were not a remedie in the matter that S. Paule telleth vs heere: we

               </gap> we muſt repayre to our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, for it is hee that hath borne all our burthens, as I haue
alledged alreadie. Truly the redeeming of vs did coſt him deere,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:319"/>
and if we ſeeke heauen and earth throughout for the price of a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
we ſhall not finde any other than him, that is able too pacifie
God. Then had we neuer bin ſanctified, except the ſonne of God
had giuen himſelfe for vs.<note place="margin">Eſay. 53. b. 45.</note> And in very deed the prophete Eſay ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
how hee bare our burthens. Namely that he felt the paynes of
death, and that the father was faine to wreake himſelfe vpon him, as
though hee had bin an offender and giltie of all the ſinnes of the
worlde. Now therefore we muſt reſort vnto him, according alſo as
he allureth vs to him. And by the way, if any man alledge that here
ſeemeth to be ſome contrarietie, conſidering how Saint Paule ſaith
that euery man ſhall beare his owne burthen: the anſwere thereto
is eaſie. VVhen the Scripture ſpeaketh too vs of Gods iuſtice: it
ſayth that euery man ſhall bee recompenced according to his owne
workes. After which maner Saint Paule ſpeaketh in the .xiiij. to the
Romanes. According as euerie man ſhall haue walked in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
in this world (ſayeth he) and according as hee ſhall haue
wrought in his bodie: ſo muſt he receyue his rewarde. That is the
order which the ſcripture keepeth in ſpeaking of Gods iuſtice. Yea,
but in the meane while it excludeth not the remedie that is giuen
vs in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, whereby men are ſuccoured. Lo how
God ſuccoureth his elect, and ſuch as hee hath reſerued too ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
that is to wit, after he hath chaſtized them, he reacheth them
his hande, and lyfteth them vp againe when hee hathe caſt them
downe. And truly we ſhoulde not knowe of what value the grace
of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is, neyther coulde wee taſte of it, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
coulde wee euer bee partakers of it, vnleſſe wee were vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confounded in our ſelues. Therefore let vs learne to feele our
burthen in ſuch wiſe, as too bowe vnder it, (as hathe bin declared
this morning) and let the ſame leade vs too true humilitie. And
afterwarde, when wee haue felt the burthen more than wee are
able too beare: let vs repayre too oure Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, who
promiſeth too eaſe vs,<note place="margin">Math. 11. d. 28.</note> ſo wee ſeeke oure whole reſt in hym. So
then, wee ſee that Gods grace is not excluded when hys iuſtice is

meaſureth his owne otherwiſe, that is to wit, that after he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
them in themſelues, and made them to feele their diſeaſes
thereby to bring them to true lowlineſſe: then he ſetteth them vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
Then muſt we firſt be ſtriken downe with Gods hande, and
afterwarde be lifted vp againe by his gracious promiſes, in that hee
telleth vs that in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt wee ſhall find all that wee
want. Thus ye ſee in ſumme, after what maner we muſt practize this

to the ende that we be no more deceyued with hipocriſie, but labor
to withdraw our ſelues from the worlde, to the intent we ſurmize
not that we ſhall ſcape Gods iudgement by our ſhiftes. So then, let
vs beare all theſe things in minde, that we may ſubmit our ſelues to

And he proteſteth that he was fain to labor day &amp; night with

without ſuſpition to call vpon the negligent ſort to do their dutie,
as we ſee in this text. He commaundeth men <hi>to find their teachers, &amp;
not to ſuffer them to want any thing.</hi> Nowe if Saint Paule (as I ſayde)

haue bin tolde him that he ſpake for himſelfe, and that it had bin
no giuing of himſelfe to the ſeruice of God. But foraſmuch as he had
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:23060:320"/>
ſhewed ſufficiently by experience, that forgetting himſelfe and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no regarde of his owne perſone, he ſought nothing elſe but to
aduaunce the kingdome of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and to edifie his
Church: therefore he might rebuke the vnthankefulneſſe of ſuch as
behaued themſelues amiſſe towards their ſheepherdes, in abridging
them of ſuſtenance for their bodies, whereas by their meanes they
had food and ſuſtenance for their ſoules. Now it is a verie vnkinde
dealing, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man conſidereth not that he which bringeth him the
doctrine of ſaluation, is as a foſterfather ſent vnto him of God, and
at leaſt wiſe findeth not in his heart to giue him bodily food. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when men are ſo retchleſſe in that behalfe, they bewray a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Gods worde. For nature ought to teach vs, that when we
be in any mans dette, wee ſhoulde ſtreyne our ſelues to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
to requite him the like: and if we be not able to do it: then at
leaſtwiſe to ſhewe that it is not for want of good will. But in this
cace, lyke cannot bee requyted for lyke. For Gods worde findeth
not any thing in the worlde that may be layde in balance agaynſt it.
Yet notwithſtanding, ſuch as are taught, ought at leaſtwiſe not to
ſpare theyr temporall goodes, for the finding of thoſe at whoſe
hande they receyue the ineſtimable treaſure of the Goſpell. And
verely we ſee howe it hath alwayes bin the pollicie of Satan, too
ſpoyle Gods Church of good Sheepherdes and miniſters, by after
a ſort ſtaruing of them. Satans vpholders ſhall alwayes haue y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to cramme themſelues withall: according as wee ſee howe
that in the Papacie, theſe ydle bellyes which do nothing elſe but
barke oute theyr Maſſes and Mattins, are crammed too the full.
Though all the worlde ſhoulde hunger and thirſt for it, thoſe kinde
of people ſhall neuer feele penurie: yea and they ſhall haue good
ſtore of prouiſion though all the worlde ſtarue in the meane while.
But cleane contrarywiſe, when ſuch as ſerue God ſhall haue ſhewed
the ſingular zeale and care which they haue for the health of mens
ſoules: men let them alone, and thinke them greatly bound vnto
them that they giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heering. VVell (ſay they) we haue heard

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> him well, he hath done his dutie. And how many
are there nowadayes that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> contribution when they come too
heere a Sermon? They could find in their hearts that God ſhoulde
<pb facs="tcp:23060:321"/>
neuer be ſpoken of, bicauſe it is a melancholike matter too them.
VVhereby wee ſee, that the Diuell hath by that meanes gyuen a
puſhe, too ridde away all teaching, and too bring to paſſe that there
might bee none but Idolles, nor any man care howe hee behaued
himſelfe. Then was it not without cauſe that Saint Paule was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to remedie ſuch inconuenience, ſaying, that hee which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
ought at leaſtwyſe to bee nurriſhed and mainteyned, and that
hee which receyueth the doctrine of ſaluation, is bounde at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to giue of his goodes and ſubſtance, to him that hath miniſtred
ſpirituall foode vntoo him. And Saint Paule ſpeaketh here expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Gods woorde. For whereas humane ſciences haue alwayes
bin ſo highly eſteemed, that ſuch as haue profeſſed them, haue bin
mainteyned: the woorde of God, whiche ſurmounteth all other
things, is as it were caſt downe. Therefore Saint Paule blameth
mennes naughtineſſe, ſaying: See what a worthie thing it is to haue
Gods worde brought vnto you: See what fruite redoundeth vnto
you by it. For we be all miſerable and curſed, ſauing that God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs to him by meanes of his worde: for that is the power which
he ſpreadeth ouer vs to gather vs intoo his kingdome. Sith it is ſo
then: howe can you bee nigardly of the tranſitorie goodes of thys
worlde, that ſuch as trauell for your welfare and edifying, ſhoulde
not at leaſtwiſe bee ſo mainteyned, as they might giue themſelues
wholly vntoo that, and not bee drawne awaye by cares that might
ſtoppe them and hinder them of doing their duties? The woorde
that Saint Paule vſeth heere, is <hi>Cathechiſe,</hi> whiche ſignifyeth too
teach, traine, or inſtruct, and therof commeth our word <hi>Cathechiſme,</hi>
which ſignifieth a Teaching, Trainment, or Inſtruction. Then <hi>he that
cathechyzeth,</hi> ſayth hee: that is to ſay, he that is a faythfull Teacher
to edifie the people in Gods worde, let him be mainteyned by ſuch
as are Cathechyzed, that is too ſay, by ſuch as are taught, or as are
brought as ſcholers vnto God. Now we ſee Saint Paules meening:
and therevppon we haue to gather, firſt of all that we muſt not take
any nowadayes for Miniſters and Herdmen of Gods Church, but
ſuch as bring his woorde. Marke that for one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
for our behoofe ſo to do. For the Papiſtes boaſt that they haue
the Church on theyr ſyde. But it is certaine that it cannot be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:23060:321"/>
of Gods children, that they ſhoulde bee a flocke without a
guide. Then what are the markes of the Churche? That there
bee a flocke gathered togither, and that therewithall there bee a
ſheepeheard too leade the ſheepe too our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And
in good ſoothe the Papiſts alledge alſo that they haue a Hierarchie,
that is too ſay, a holy and ſacred Soueraintie, but in the meane
while the marke that Saint Paule ſetteth downe heere, is not too
bee founde among them. For wee ſee that all the horned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
and all the route of the Popiſhe Clergie, haue no more but
the bare tytle. For where is the ſayde worde of God? They thinke
that that were a ſteyne to theyr ſtate: it is ynough for them to doo
their Ceremonyes and gewgawes, and they beare themſelues in
hand that they haue very well diſcharged their dutie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue
ſo played an enterlude: and ſo thoſe Hipocrites doo nothing elſe
but fill the worlde full of their abuſes and Illuſions. Therefore let
vs learne to diſcerne Gods true Churche, from all the Synagogs
that Satan hath builded in the worlde, and wherewith he dazeleth
our eyes nowadayes. That is to witte, when Gods worde is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
faythfully, let vs conclude that God alſo dooth both knowe
and acknowledge the flocke that is aſſembled there. And heere yee
ſee howe they ought to diſpoſe the goodes of the Church, as Saint
Paule ſheweth. Furthermore whereas hee ſayth, <hi>Let thoſe that are
taught impart all good things:</hi> it is not ment that they ſhould beſtow
ſuch abundance vpon the preachers of the doctrine of ſaluation, that
they ſhould bee readie too burſt with it. For the ſuperfluitie of ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
hath bin a deadly plague, when a number of men were moued,
and driuen by fond deuotion, to giue their ſubſtance to ſuch as they
thought woorthie to poſſeſſe the greateſt part of the world, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they brought all to horrible confuſion. And therefore wee muſt
not thinke that Saint Paule ment too inrich he Miniſters of Gods
worde in ſuch wiſe, as they might haue wherewith to ryot with all
exceſſe, or as they might haue wherewith to mainteyne a diſſolute
life in pompe and brauerie: Saint Paule ment not to open a gappe
for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap>: but onely ment to do men to vnderſtande, that

be driuen to extreme penurie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:322"/>
And it behoueth vs to beare in minde how that in another place
he ſayth,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 6. b 8.</note> if we haue wherewith to feede and cloth our ſelues, let vs
be contented. Alſo we know that God hath a care of all creatures:
and therefore much more of his faythfull ones. So then let vs liue
ſoberly, as if we had but a day to liue, and let vs not make a hoord of
the tranſitorie goodes of this world. VVhen the miniſters of Gods
worde beare this leſſon in minde, namely to liue ſoberly and thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
and not too haue a care ſo full of vnbeleefe as ſhoulde tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
them and burne them, and prouoke them to heape vp vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurably:
then wil they content themſelues with a little, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
men will be bountifull and liberall too them without
their crauing of it, ſo as they ſhall alwayes haue wherewith to be fed
&amp; clothed. And in good fayth, beſides this that hath bin ſayd, we ſee
that Saint Paule did not onely practize this doctrine himſelfe, but
alſo exhorted his brothers and companions to the ſame. For in the
twentith of the Actes he alledgeth principally, that he had trauelled
and taken paynes with his handes to get part of his liuing: howbeit
that it is much better to giue than to take: for (ſaythe he) the thing
that wee ought to haue learned in the ſchoole of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, is that we ſhoulde be better apayde when we haue occaſion
to do good, and to giue to the releefe of others: than when wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
to become rich our ſelues. For it cannot agree with Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
that they ſhould couet to hoord vp. To be ſhort, now we ſee
whereat Saint Paule amed: namely that he ment not to giue bridle
to the preachers of Gods word, to haue a delicate and deintie table,
or to be braue to the worldward: but that they ſhould haue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſoberly according to their degree. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
alſo he blameth the vnkindneſſe of the world, for that they
which are bound to their Shepherdes do ſhewe themſelues ſo nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly,
that it ſeemeth to be as it were a plucking out of the guttes
out of their bellies, when they be ſpoken too for the releefe of the
neede of thoſe to whom they be bounde beyonde meaſure. Nowe
foraſmuch as that vyce hath reigned at all tymes in the worlde, and
the diuell (as I ſayde) hath by that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the miniſters, that there might bee no more teaching and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
let vs learne that Saint Paule hath not without cauſe ſet
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:23060:322"/>
downe this rule, that they whiche take peines in preaching of Gods
worde, muſt haue wherwith to fynd and mainteyne them. And wee
ſee nowadayes a greater churliſhneſſe in the world, than that which
S. Paule blameth and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth. For they that are at no charges at
all with them, will not fayle too grunt and grudge when the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Gods woord bee talked of. O (ſay they) theſe fellowes muſt
be nurriſhed in idleneſſe: verily as who ſhould ſay it were idleneſſe
too ſerue God and the whole Churche. Againe, the Apoſtles (ſay
they) did nother ſo nor ſo. No, but it is apparant that the Apoſtles
were fetched a farre off: and euery man did ſtreyne himſelfe for the
ſame, not onely in his goodes, but alſo in his owne perſone. If any
Apoſtle were too bee accompanied, it appeereth that the riche and
welthie men paſſed the ſea with them. And now adayes there ſhall
bee nothing but murmuring and grudging at Gods ſeruants, though
they bee enterteyned nigardly. But this diſcouereth and ſheweth
the wickedneſſe of thoſe repyners, and bewrayeth them to be Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh
folke, that could finde in their hartes too liue in barbarouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and beaſtly conuerſation, without hauing any doctrine of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
and that all were thruſt vnder foote, that euery man might
liue after his owne luſtes. So then, let vs beare in minde the thing
that S. Paule telleth vs heere, to the ende that ſuch as are called too
the ſtate and office of preaching Gods woord, may know that where
as they bee founde and maynteyned, it is bycauſe they ſhoulde take
payne, and profite the whole people with their ſeruis, and be thereby
the more prouoked to do their duetie warely and carefully, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
bee quickened vp to become ſo much the more diligent. And
let not men enuie them nor grudge agaynſt them when they haue
conuenient finding and interteynment, ſeyng that God hath ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned:
and we our ſelues alſo doo ſee reaſon why it ſhould bee ſo.
Now herevpon S. Paule addeth, <hi>Bee not deceyued, for God is not moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and looke what a man ſoweth, that ſhall he reape.</hi> S. Paule, in willing
men not to bee deceyued, ſheweth ſufficiently that men haue at all
tymes had ſtore of ſhiftes, and that when they intended too doo or
ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, they haue euerpret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> ſome cloke. But heere he citeth
them to Gods iudgement, as if he ſhould tell them that they might
well ynough content men and ſtoppe their mouthes: but yet for al
<pb facs="tcp:23060:323"/>
that they muſt bee fayne too come to account before the heauenly
iudge. And therefore all your ſhiftes (ſayeth he) will ſtand you in no
ſtead. It is true that theſe excuces will eaſely bee admitted among
men, and (as I haue touched alreadie) many men will hold their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
at the ſtaues ende, and there ſhall bee nothing but quareling
with them. For their eares are ſo itching, that a man ſhall hardely
finde one of a hundred which will not be glad to heere ſuch matters,
and to adde ſome skoffe beſides, or elſe too make the ſauce ſharper.
This is too common a cace. Neuertheleſſe Sainct Paules doctrine
extendeth generally too all the excuces that wee bee wont to make
when wee would iuſtifie our euill doing, or make men beleeue that
the Crowe is whyte. Firſt of all therefore let vs haue an eye too the
grounde that Sainct Paule treateth of heere. Now the cace concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the finding of the miniſters of Gods woorde. He willeth men
that they ſhoulde not beguyle themſelues. And why ſo? For it is a
fonde thing to ſay, why ſhould not the Miniſters of Gods woord la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for their liuing, ſeing they ought to giue example vnto others?
VVhen they come out of the pulpet, can they not ſpend the reſt of
the time in ſome labour, that they might not burthen the Churche?
This will eaſly bee receyued of ſuche as gabble after that faſhion,
thinking themſelues too haue a good cace, and too bee very zelouſe
of the common welfare and of the order of the Churche. But ſuche
men deceyue themſelues. For there is nothing in them but malice,
and Satan thruſteth them foorth therevnto, to the end to make the
world to lothe the doctrine of ſaluation, or at leaſtwyſe too ſet light
by it and to skorne it. [That is the very welſpring], thither muſte
we go, and there muſt we holde vs. So then, it is not without cauſe
that S. Paule warneth the Galathians, too beware that they beguyle
not themſelues in vſing theſe fayre colours. And ſecondly we muſt
alſo apply this warning of Sainct Paules generally to al the couertes
which wee take in going about too diſguize things, for wee will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
haue wherewith to cleere our ſelues, if men will beleeue vs:
And there is not ſo very a naughtypacke but he will ſtill haue ſome
ſhifte too conceale his owne ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> if
wee were a hundred times conuicted, yet the Diuell would euer put
ſome deuyce in our minde, too ſet a good face vpon a foule matter.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:23060:323"/>
And bycauſe we be inclyned thereto by nature, and hardened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
by cuſtome: it ſtandeth vs the more in hand too marke the thing
that S. Paule telleth vs heere: which is, too beware that no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyle
himſelfe, and that wee erre not wilfully. For it is certaine that
hypocriſie ſhal neuer deceyue men, till they beguile themſelues wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
and wittingly. The hypocrites ſhal now and then be deceyued,
and yet notwithſtanding bee conuicted therewithall, and they ſhall
haue ſuch hartbitings, that they ſhal be the firſt that ſhall condemne
themſelues, though all men elſe did acquit them. But there are that
fall aſleepe, and beare themſelues in hand that nothing is amiſſe in
them. Yet ceaſſe they not therfore to haue ſome pricking within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
and although they be blinde, yet doth God make them vnexcuſable,
bicauſe he quickneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp, &amp; they ſeeke ſhifts ſtill to intangle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in, ſo as they themſelues perceyue not the miſchief, that they
might repent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it. Ye ſee then that the woorſt kind of Hipocriſie
that can be, is when men deceyue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues by fond flatterie in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
this &amp; that, &amp; in ſeking to ſhift off the matter, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo before God. Now S. Paule ſayeth heere, that God
will not be mocked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if he ſhould ſay, that ſuch as beguyle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
after that faſhion with their fond excuces, are mockers, yea &amp;
very mockers of God. For if wee bare ſuch reuerence too God as
we ought to do: it is certaine that when we be cyted before his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,
we would ſound our ſelues to the hard botto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our thoughts
and affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſo as there ſhould not be any thing that were not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to the quicke. All they then which make ſo light a matter of
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming before God, as though he were but ſome litle babe &amp; might
play with him at their pleaſure, do thereby ſhewe themſelues to bee
full of vngodlineſſe. Now therfore we ſee how profitable this texte
is for vs, where S. Paule hauing warned men that they ſhoulde not
beguyle themſelues, addeth <hi>that God cannot bee mocked.</hi> This ſhould
ſeeme not too make too the purpoſe. For what though wee bee

Yea ſayeth Sainct Paule. And for proofe thereof, yee ſeeke vayne

               </gap> your ſelues to them. But if you looked rightly vpon
the deede, and were not wrapped in your owne maliciouſneſſe:
ſurely you ſhoulde haue a righter iudgement than you haue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:324"/>
VVhat cauſeth you then to fall aſleepe in your ſo fond excuces? it is
bycauſe yee conſider not that wee muſte all of vs appeere at Gods
iudgement ſeate, and that it is he whiche ſearcheth mens thoughts,
and from whom nothing is hidden. But you take him too bee but an
Idoll: you would beare him in hand that he ought to be contented
with your fooles bables: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye haue beguiled men &amp; laughed
them to skorne, yee thinke that God is of the ſame ſtampe, and vſe
yet greater boldneſſe towardes him. Therefore it is certaine that all
ſuch as flatter themſelues and ſeeke ſtartingholes, are Infidelles, and
the thing it ſelfe ſheweth them to be playne mockers of God. Now
although this ſaying be ſhort: yet ought it to make vs quake, for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as we heere ſo great a thunder, or ſee ſuch a lightning co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming

when men that are but ſtarke rottenneſſe, do ſo vaunt themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
God, yea euen to mocke at him? Surely wee knowe it is the
greateſt reproche and ſpite that can bee done vnto a man, too laugh
him to skorne after that faſhion. If it be intollerable among vs that
are nothing: will God ſuffer himſelfe to bee mocked? Sainct Paule
therefore hath well giuen vs occaſion heere to looke neerely to our
ſelues, and to walke playnely, and not too vſe our skoffing trickes, as
though we thought to mende our market by it, for aſmuch as God
is prouoked by it, as though wee defied him, or as though we inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
too diſpoſſeſſe him of his right, and to make him beleeue that a
man might plucke him by the noze, and doo all maner of villanie to
him and he not perceyue it. VVere this ſaying well marked, wee
would walke in another maner of awe than we do: but we ſee how
men become Heatheniſh, yea euen wilfully, and wex ſo hardharted,
that they regarde nother ſhame nor honeſtie when good or euill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

ſhall ſee then now adayes that all Tables, all houſes, and all ſtreetes
are full of mockers of God. And whereof commeth that? It is true
that there are many Hypocrites and ſelfe ſoothers: Howbeeit, the

is too ſay, they defie God without any remorſe of conſcience, and
thereby it appeereth that they bee giuen vp too a reprobate minde,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:23060:324"/>
and ſpirit of madneſſe. And whence proceedeth ſuch malapertneſſe
of aduauncing mennes ſelues ſo againſt God? As I told you before,
it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of the ſayd hypocriſie, when wee thinke to diſguiſe things
in ſuch wyſe by our ſuttle ſlightes and fayre replies, that there is no
more difference betwixt white and blacke. So much the more ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dooth it behoue vs too beare well in minde this warning of S.
Paules. Now herevpon he proceedeth with the matter that he had
touched, in ſomuch that he extendeth it yet further, in ſaying <hi>that
looke as wee ſowe, ſo ſhall we reape: He that ſoweth in the ſpirite ſhall of
the ſpirit reape euerlasting lyfe, and be that ſoweth in the fleſh, ſhall reape
corruption.</hi> To be ſhort, heere S. Paule likeneth all the ſtudie, care,
and paynes that we take, vntoo ſeede which husbandmen ſowe. For
wherfore do men buzie themſelues about this or that, or wherefore
doo they trauell and take paynes, but for ſome end which they haue
purpozed to themſelues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, euen bycauſe they hope for fruyte
to their commoditie: that is the very cauſe why they be not weerie
of their labour. As for example: he that intendeth too get muche,
will ſuffer hunger and thirſt, cold and heate, and nothing will appall
him. And why? For his couetouſneſſe carieth him on ſtill, ſo as he
forgetteth all things elſe, and tormenteth himſelfe more than if he
were in his enemies handes: nay, his enemies woulde not torment
him ſo much. So then, when a man taketh great paynes too gather
goodes, it is lyke the ſowyng of a husbandman: and he hopeth that
harueſt will come, and that he ſhall gather it vp againe in the ende.
He that woulde aduaunce himſelfe too the worldward, dares not
ſleepe half his fill: and what ſeeketh he by his watching? To come
to ſome honour or worſhip, and to winne credite. VVell then, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
is the harueſt of them that couet worldly honour. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
is to gather. And what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The thing that their owne nature liketh
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ongeth for. Euen ſo is it in all other things. Like as an vnthrift
will labour too ſatiſfie his appetite, and he will not ſticke the rather
to do ſome lewd pranke, as too play the bawde; or ſome other lyke
thing. And to what ende? To the end he may eate his fill and fare
delicately or elſe play the drunkard. And otherſome fall too rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
and murther that in fine they become arrant Theeues. Lo
wherevnto mennes luſtes bring them. For they purpoſe with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb facs="tcp:23060:325"/>
to make a harueſt: that is to ſay, to haue the thing that they
luſt for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though it be to their ruyne and confuzion. But howſoeuer
the world go, if ye conſider why men giue themſelues to one thing
or other: ye ſhall find that they alwayes hope for a harueſt. So then,
the things which they do, are the ſeedes of the labour whiche they
hope to gather frute of. Heere S. Paule ſayeth, that after as we ſowe,
ſo ſhall we reape. And afterward he openeth himſelfe in ſaying, that
the one ſort ſoweth too the ſpirite, and the other ſort too the fleſhe.
Now to ſowe to the ſpirit, is too withdrawe a mannes ſelfe from the
worlde and from this tranſitorie lyfe, and to know that we be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not too tarie heere beneath, but too paſſe foorth on till wee bee
come too our inheritance: and that our life is not to bee heere but
for a little whyle, and to walke away (as hath bin ſayd in the Pſalme
that hath bin ſong and ſhall be ſong againe),<note place="margin">Pſal. 90. a. 5. 6.</note> ſo as our beyng heere,
is not too abide heere for euer, nor as though wee had an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
dwellingplace: but God giueth vs as it were a ſhorte walke,
and cauſeth vs too make but a turne or twayne, and ſtreytwayes
after ſayeth vntoo vs, Come away Sirs and returne yee intoo duſt,
as Moyſes alſo ſpeaketh in his ſong. Seing it is ſo, if wee bethinke
our ſelues well to renounce all our owne luſtes, then ſhall we ſowe
too the ſpirite, that is too ſay, wee ſhall ſee that it behoueth vs too
apply all our ſtudie too the heauenly lyfe wherevntoo we be called.
Yee ſee then howe the one ſorte, of whom the number is very ſmall
and ſcant, doo ſowe too the ſpirit, bycauſe they ſtarte not out intoo
worldly cares too bee tied too them, but conſider that God calleth
them higher, and therfore prepare and indeuer themſelues to come
thither. The other ſorte doo ſowe to the fleſh: that is to ſay, they
bee ſo wholly poſſeſſed with a beaſtly affection, that too their ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
there is nothing too bee compared too this lyfe. And truly if
yee marke at what marke men ſhoote, yee ſhall finde that the world
holdeth them backe well neere all. Yee ſhall ſcarce finde one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
a thouſand that goes any further, too conſider that this world
is but a ſhadow that vaniſheth away, and too bend themſelues ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
and rightly too the heauenly lyfe. Therfore all men wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere
doo ſowe to the fleſhe. True <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> that their reſpectes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>-what
differ. For one is a whorehunter, another a drunkarde, the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:23060:325"/>
thirde a niggardly pinchpennie, and another a ſpendall. Then if yee
looke vppon the humours of the menne, they bee diuerſe and as it
were repugnant, ſo as the one hateth the other. And wherefore?
Bycauſe (ſayeth he) he is not of my nature, he and I cannot agree.
But howſoeuer the worlde go, if a man ſifte them, he ſhall finde that
all of them ſowe too the fleſhe. Therefore there are many ſortes of
of ſowyng: but yet notwithſtanding all of them ſticke faſte heere
beneath, ſo as they cannot conſider wherevntoo God calleth them,
and wherevntoo they ought to apply themſelues. For ſome would
bee riche, ſome would haue honour and credite, ſome would lyue
at their eaſe, and take their pleaſure, ſome woulde haue this, and
ſome that: but in the meane whyle all of them poare vppon
this tranſitorie lyfe, and cannot lift themſelues vp. Nowe Sainct
Paule ſayeth, it is good reaſon that wee ſhould reape according too
our ſowyng. They then which do ſo giue themſelues to the worlde
and ſowe too the fleſhe, ſhall (ſayeth he) reape corruption: that is to
ſay, in the end they ſhal perceyue that al the things which they eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
ſo highly, were but ſmoke. True it is that this woord <hi>Corruption</hi>
might be taken for euerlaſting death: but that is not Sainct Paules
meenyng. For he intendeth to ſay that men are deſtitute of wit and
diſcretion, when they wil needes intangle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in their blockiſh
and groſſe cares. For why? if a man aske them: go too, what is the
world? They will ſay, it is a ſhadowe that ſlippeth away. And what
is our life? It is nothing. And what are the goodes of this worlde?
They be but a dreame. All of them will ſay thus much, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
they bee ſo rauiſhed, as a man cannot tell how to plucke
them from it, and the Diuell holdeth them as it were bewitched, ſo
that God crieth out at their eares, wretched men where are you, and
yet they go on ſtill too plundge themſelues deeper in the quamyre.
And although they knowe well ynough that all their luſtes are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
&amp; that this life ſlippeth ſwiftly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them: yet will they needes
bee wedded to it ſtill. Although then that God doo crie too theſe
vnaduized folke to bring them intoo the right way: yet are they ſo
dulled that they cannot obey <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>er the Counſell nor the warnings
whiche they heere. Thus yeeree why S. Paule ſayeth, that ſuche as
haue ſowen after that maner, ſhall of the fleſhe reape corruption.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:326"/>
But they (ſayeth he) which ſowe to the ſpirit, (that is to ſay, whiche
know that there is a much preciouſer life than this wherein we bee,
and ſet their whole affection and minde therevpon) ſhal reape of the
ſpirit euerlaſting life. That is to ſay, bycauſe they haue bin gouerned
by Gods ſpirit, and haue labored to come vnto him and too bee knit
to him: therefore is their reward alſo ready for them. Now heere
firſt of all wee bee warned, to thinke better vpon all our thoughtes,
doings, attempts, wiſhes, and indeuers, and to conſider well too what
end they tend. For this ſimilitude ſhall alwayes be found true, that
we do then ſowe, when we apply our labour or trauell to any thing.
Therfore let vs looke well to our ſelues, and conſider that although
God will haue vs to gather Corne and wyne in this worlde for the
ſuſtenance of our bodies: yet notwithſtanding he calleth vs yet
higher, and will not haue vs to be hild ſtill heere. VVherefore let
vs learne to ſeeke firſt that God may reigne, and beare rule, ſo as we
may yeeld our ſelues wholly to him and his rightuouſneſſe, and that
the care of this tranſitorie life dull vs not, as I haue ſayd afore: but
but that it may be as an income to the principall wherevnto we muſt
go, that is to ſay, to the kingdome of God. To be ſhort, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that God hath put vs into this world to ſowe, that is to ſay, not
to be idle nor vnoccupied. And how? Truely the Miniſters of Gods
woord ought to ſowe, to the end to gather in ſuch a harueſt, as they
may offer vp to God as an holy offering. And their ſowing is too
teach faithfully, to the end that Gods woord may bring forth frute,
and his name be glorified and bliſſed, accordingly as our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt ſayd to his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Iohn. 15. c. 19.</note> I haue chozen you to the end you ſhould
go and bring forth abundance of frute, and ſuch frute as ſhall laſt for
euer. The miniſters then haue this peculiar to themſelues: howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it
all of vs in common muſt ſowe to eternall lyfe, that is to ſay, wee
muſt paſſe through this worlde as ſtraungers, lifting vp our mindes
to the heritage where wee ſhould reſt, and wherevnto alſo it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs to apply all our indeuer. And euen when wee trauell for the
ſuſtenance of our bodies, let it be alwayes with tending to the ſayde
marke, according as it is ſayd that we muſt not liue to eate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
but eate and drinke to the end to be conueyed to another life: and
that our liuing in this world is not to ſettle heere, but to atteyne to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:23060:326"/>
a higher thing, that is to ſay, to the heauenly life. Sith it is ſo, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
any man buzieth himſelfe to get his liuing, whither it bee by
tillage, or by ſome handicraft, or by trade of merchandiſe, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
it bee, in all the cares that wee take for ourſelues or for our
houſholdes, let vs alwayes ſhoote at a higher mark. For ſurely it is a
naughtie thing, if a man buzie himſelf but only about the getting of
his liuing, and haue no regard of Gods ſeruice. For in the getting
of his liuing he ought too conſider thus with himſelfe: Howe will
God allow of my dooyng? How will he accept my ſeruice? True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that will he doo if I walke not after myne own luſtes, if I looke
that I doo no man wrong, and if I buzie my ſelfe faythfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the thing that I am bounde too doo. This (I ſay) is the way
for vs too ſowe: that is too wit, that wee bee not wedded to the
worlde, nor hilde downe heere beneathe, but that wee may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
mount vpwarde too the lyfe of heauen. Now then let vs
looke well vppon the meane of ſowing after that ſorte: that is to
wit, of ſowing too the ſpirit, ſayth Sainct Paule. VVherefore let
vs conſider that wee bee not as Aſſes and Oxen that toyle and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and afterwarde doo eate and drinke, and are fed as reaſon
and good right require: but that God hath adopted vs too come
to the life of heauen. Therefore let vs ſowe to the ſpirit; and cut off
all that may hinder our mounting vpward, let vs ſhake them off as
hurtfull things, and aſſure our ſelues that al ſuch as labor to get re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
in this world, ſhall in the end finde themſelues diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
VVhy ſo? For they ſhall ſee plainly that it is but corruption.
VVhen he that ſhal haue gathered great abundance of goods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
vnto death, he hath ſo much the more greef, bycauſe he made
this world his paradiſe. Therefore he then gnaſheth his teeth at
God, and he ſtormeth and tormenteth himſelfe, much more than if
he had not take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo much peynes to gather. Thus ye ſee that ſuch as
haue ſowed in the fleſh, perceiue [at length] that they haue ſowed
to corruption, bicauſe they gather nothing elſe but corruption: but
it is all to late, and therfore let vs bethink ourſelues. And although
we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap> men beguile themſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

that it is a happie life to haue all thing that they wiſhe, as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
euerie man is ruled by his owne lyking: although wee ſee men
<pb facs="tcp:23060:327"/>
ſtorme after that faſhion: let vs learne to do otherwiſe &amp; conſider
that God calleth vs to an euerlaſting life, which he ſetteth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
before vs by his Goſpel. Let vs ſet our whole mindes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that,
and let al our intents &amp; deſires tend thitherward, &amp; let vs indeuer
to profit more &amp; more in the doctrine of ſaluation, that he may lift
vs vp and drawe vs hence from beneath,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. c. 15</note> according alſo as S. Paule
ſayth when he telleth vs what the weapons of Chriſtenfolke are,
making the doctrine of the Goſpell to bee our ſhooes. For it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs on hand to be armed from top too toe, or elſe wee ſhould
ſoone be wounded with the aſſaultes that are giuen vnto vs in this
world. After he hath declared this (ſay I) he ſayth that the Goſpell
muſt lift vs vp, and drawe vs from the corruptions wherein wee be
plunged, ſo as wee may atteine too the kingdome of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
he calleth vs. Ye ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what we haue to beare in mind. Now
as touching that S. Paule ſaith, that they which haue ſowed in the
ſpirit ſhall reape euerlaſting lyfe: he meaneth not that wee in ſo
doyng deſerue ſo woorthie and excellent a thing as the kingdome
of heauen is: but he ſheweth that the faithful hauing knowen their
owne calling, ſhall neuer fynd themſelues deceyued, though they
ſeeme wretched too the worldward. VVee know that God adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vs of his owne free goodneſſe: that is the groundworke of
our ſaluation. He forgyueth vs our ſinnes: and that is our rygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe.
For if he ſhoulde conſider vs in our owne nature, he
coulde not but caſt vs away as lothſome and accurſed: So can we
fynde no grace at his hande, excepte he admitte vs of hys owne
free goodneſſe. And wee knowe alſo that our workes are euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
vnperfect and blemiſhed with ſome vyce, ſo as they cannot
be accepted of God. VVee are ſure that when we ſhould go about
too ſerue him and to doo good, oftentymes wee go cleane backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
ſo that we are euermore in his daunger. But howſoeuer the
world go, when God hath once adopted vs to bee his children, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
all our ſinnes, and ſhewed that he lyketh well of our ſeruice
though it be vnperfect: then declareth he further &amp; addeth as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerplus,
that we ſhal not be de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

laugh vs to ſcorne. Behold theſe fondlings ſay they: ſee how they
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:23060:327"/>
martyr themſelues? And wherfore? for the kingdome of heauen.
And who hath brought them tydings of that? It is I wote not what
a kinde of Religion that beguileth theſe folke, and in the meane
while they be poore outcaſtes, in whom there is neither corage nor
any thing elſe. According whereuntoo wee ſee now adayes, that
ſuch as ſtand vppon their reputation, do rayle vppon vs ſaying: as
for theſe wretched ſillie ſoules what thinke they to doo? Lo how
wee bee ſcoffed at, bycauſe wee couet not too aduaunce ourſelues
nor too bee in reputation of the world. Although then that wee
bee ſo ſcorned, let vs gyue eare too the promiſe that is made vs
heere: which is that if wee followe our vocation ſimply, wee ſhall
perceiue that God who hath begonne is faythfull, and that hys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of winning vs vntoo him is our ſouereyne welfare, and that
he not only ſeeketh our profit in al reſpectes: but alſo will through
his infinite goodneſſe ſhewe himſelfe a father and Sauiour towards
vs. VVherefore let vs ſtreyne our ſelues too the vttermoſt too
come vntoo him, let vs dedicate ourſelues wholly to him, and let
vs giue ouer all worldly things that may hinder our comming vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, I ſay let vs giue them all quite and cleane ouer, ſeeking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
the things that may guide vs vpward, &amp; let vs continue in
them to the end. And if we do ſo: ſurely our Lord Ieſus Chriſt will
ſhewe that there is a harueſt prepared for vs, not of theſe worldly

Paul exhorted vs to do good, ſo long as God
giueth vs tyme in this world. For whyle wee
bee heere, wee ought to apply all Gods giftes
too the ſeruice of him and of all his, yea and
generally of all men. For after as God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth
any abilitie or gifte vppon any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

he byndeth him too ſuche as haue neede of him and as he is able
too helpe. Therefore wee muſt bee fully reſolued of this, that
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:23060:328"/>
none of vs muſt bee ydle or vnprofitable, but haue an eye too
the meane that God hath gyuen vs, too the ende that euery of
vs maye make as it were a ſacrifice of it vntoo hym. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon,
too gyue vs the better corage, Sainct Paule ſaythe that
in ſo dooyng wee doo ſowe: and God will not ſuffer vs too bee
diſappoynted, when wee ſhall haue indeuered too occupie our
ſelues about the things that he commaundeth. VVee are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that all is loſte, if euery man ſeeke not his owne profit, and
bee giuen wholly too himſelfe. But it is cleane contrarie. For
althoughe that he which ſuccoureth his neyghbor forgo the thing
that he beſtoweth vppon him: yet he putteth it in good keepyng,
as he doth which layeth his ſeede intoo the ground, that is, to reape
fruite of it in conuenient ſeaſon. Contrarywiſe there is a way for
all to periſhe: namely if we be too gripple of the riches of thys
worlde, ſo as wee haue no care nor regarde but of our owne
profite: wee ſhall gather corruption, that is too ſay, all ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe,
as in very deede the worlde and the faſhion thereof muſte
needes paſſe and vaniſhe awaye. Thus yee ſee what all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
is which they can ſcrape together, that indeuer too make their
hand in this worlde. For as their lyfe is flyghtfull and tranſitorie,
ſo are all the goods that they ſhall haue hoorded vp, and all ſhall
go too deſtruction. But if wee can diſcharge our ſelues of earthly
cares, and looke vp too the kingdome of God, although we ſeeme
too bee diminiſhed and made poore by dooyng good: yet ſhall not
our treaſure periſh, but ſhall be well kept in Gods hand till the laſt
daye. Howbeit for as muche as the Diuell offereth vs many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
too coole vs, or too make vs turne heade backe ageine,
Sainct Paule addeth a verye needefull incoragement, which is, that
wee ſhoulde not bee weerie of well dooyng. And afterwarde he
addeth that wee muſte bee patient, in wayting for the ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
time of gathering. Therefore where as hee ſayeth that wee
muſt not bee weerye, it is bycauſe that ſuche as haue any good
will or deſyre too doo good, ſhall bee plucked backe by Satans

he will caſt in theyr way. If a man walke abroade for his owne
pleaſure, he needeth not too bee warned that he wearie not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:329"/>
And why? For he chozeth ſome faire beaten path, he keepeth
a meaſurable pace, and he goeth at his eaſe: for he is not ſtinted to
go thus many leagues in a day, but returneth ageine as ſoone as his
iourney is not to his mind.</p>
            <p>This warning therefore is for ſuch as haue long iourneys to go,
and not onely one or two, but continuall trauelings. They ſhall
perchaunce haue hard paſſages, they ſhall haue ſtonie and ſhrubbie
wayes, or wayes that are myrie and dirtie, they ſhall haue hils and
dales. Such haue neede too bee quickened forward, that they may
bee cheered and plucke vp a good harte, that they tyre not nor
quayle not in the middes of their iourney. Euen ſo is it with vs
when God toucheth vs wyth his holy ſpirit, ſo as wee be diſpoſed
to ſerue him and to doo good to ſuch as ſeeke ſuccour at our hand.
But on the one ſide wee bee plucked backe by vnbeleefe, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
wee bee afrayde that the earthe wyll fayle vs: and if any
manne bee too bee releeued, wee caſt with our ſelues that the like
want and penurie maye befall our ſelues. Thus yee ſee wee bee
plucked backe, wee bee ſnarled in that ouercarefulneſſe, and are
vnſatiable in our luſtes, and thinke wee ſhall neuer haue ynough.
Herevppon alſo wee bee tempted too ſeeke excuces. For wee will
alledge [on the one ſide] that wee cannot tell whither the partie
that complayneth haue ſuche neede as he ſpeaketh of, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he bee ſo greatly too bee pitied: and on the otherſyde that
the worlde is ſo wicked and vngracious, that a man cannot tell
too whom too doo good, and that oftentymes the good turne is
loſt, and there is ſuche vnthankefulneſſe, that it were better too
let thoſe complaynants to endure hunger and thirſt, than to giue
them occaſion too offende God, in beguyling men after that ſort
and in laughing them too ſcorne for their labour. There will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
bee founde excuces and ſhiftes ynow too eſcape from wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dooyng,
as experience ſheweth too muche, ſpecially conſideryng
that wee bee ſo lazie and faynt by nature. So muche the more
therefore dooth it ſtande vs in hande too remember thys leſſon
which Sainct Paule ſetteth down <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ere, which is, too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
ſtill without beeyng weerie, yea verily in dooyng good.
This matter concerneth the inlarging of our hartes, and of the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:23060:329"/>
imploying of our goods (if wee haue any) to the releefe of our
needie neyghbors. And wee know that Sainct Paule hath begon
at the miniſters of Gods woorde. Neuertheleſſe he exhorteth vs
all generally, for ſo much as God hath knit vs all togither, and
ſet vs in the world with condition that euery of vs ſhould conſider
wherein he may bee able too helpe ſuch as haue neede of him. Let
vs apply our lyfe thervntoo, that wee peruert not the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Furthermore for as much as wee bee ſo lither and colde, and
ſhall alſo finde many occaſions too hinder and breake off the zeale
that wee haue too diſcharge our duetie. Let vs ouerleape all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comberances,
and plucke vp a good harte that wee quayle not.
And the more that the worlde is nowe adayes come too the top
of inquitie, vnthankfulneſſe, and malice: the more doothe it
ſtande vs in hande too treade downe ſuche temptations, rather
hauyng an eye vntoo GOD, than to the vnworthineſſe of the
perſons that are too bee ſuccoured. For howe muche lewdneſſe
ſoeuer there bee throughout the whole world: yet will God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
alwayes vnchaungeable in his purp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe: that is too wit, he
will haue euery of vs to conſider his owne abilitie, and the meaſure
that is giuen vnto him, and that wee bee not borne too ourſelues,
(for God hath not created vs to that intent) but he will haue euery
of vs to thruſt forth and as it were too conſtreine himſelfe to helpe
ſuch as deſire ſuccour of him: and although they craue it not, yet if
wee ſee them in neceſsitie, he will haue vs too releeue them by
ſuche meanes as he offereth. The verye heathen men had skill y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
too ſpeake ſuche language. Therefore it is dubble ſhame
too vs if wee knowe not wherefore God hath created vs, and
wherfore he ſheweth himſelfe ſo bountifull towardes vs. Truely he
coulde well haue diſpoſed the worlde in ſuche wiſe, as no manne
ſhoulde haue wanted, and euery man might haue forborne other.
But he offereth vs matter of pitie and compaſsion, too ſhewe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there bee any kyndhartedneſſe in vs or no. Nowe we muſt
alſo marke well the promiſe that Sainct Paule addeth: which is,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> wee ſhall reape or gat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> in ſeaſonable time. True it is that
wee were not too bee excuſed, thoughe there were no rewarde
at all, but that God ſhoulde ſaye ſimply that he wyll haue it ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:330"/>
for it is ſufficient that he hath ſet vs in the world, and fed vs wyth
his bounteouſneſſe, and it requireth at leaſtwiſe that wee ſhoulde
bee wholly at his commaundement: howbeit for as muche as he
ſeeth our feebleneſſe and ſloweneſſe, he addeth this ouermore too
make vs plucke vp a better harte, ſaying, that none of all our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
ſhall bee loſt. For he dooth as it were take them intoo hys
keepyng, and will deliuer vs them ageyne, yea euen with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
profite than we coulde haue hoped or wiſhed for in the world.
He that hathe money in his powche, and ſees a commoditie offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him, wyll lay it out on all ſydes: for he preſuppoſeth that he
ſhall loze nothing by it, but that beſides the returne of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall,
he ſhall be much increaſed by the profite that will ryſe to him
of it. Truely if a man bee about to lend money, or too put it too
ſome traffike, he will looke twyce or thrice too it that it may bee
ſure: but finally if he ſpie a riche man that is able too paye and of
good credit: he concludeth by and by that he may well truſt him.
But thoughe God aſſure vs as much as may be that whatſoeuer we
put intoo his handes ſhall returne ſafe vntoo vs, and that wee ſhall
haue greater gayne of it, than of all the things that wee can doo in
the worlde: he hath not ſo muche credit among vs that wee wyll
truſt too his woorde: no, wee bee deafe on that ſyde. Firſt of all
therefore,<note place="margin">Math. 10. d 42.</note> too the ende wee ſhould not bee thruſt out of the way
by meannes vnkindneſſe: our Lord ſayth, whatſoeuer yee doo too
the leaſt, or to the moſt deſpyſed of theſe, I accept it and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it as done to my ſelfe. Too bee ſhort I receiue it as of myne
owne hand. Lo how God ſpeaketh as in reſpect of the word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite.
Alſo he addeth a promiſe, that there is no vſurie nor gayne ſo
great, as the profit that is to be hoped for at his hand, ſo wee ſhet
our eyes ageynſt worldly things, that they hold vs not backe, but
beſtowe the things that he hath put intoo our handes, and whiche
he hath committed to our charge, as he appoynteth by hys woord.
But whereas God ſpeaketh after that manner, not once or twyce
but manie times, ſo as if there were but one drop of truſt in vs,
ſurely wee ſhoulde bee fully reſolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>

            <p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:23060:330"/>
Therefore it is not without cauſe that S. Paule ſetteth downe the
promiſe, that wee ſhall gather or reape, as if he had ſayde, yee
wretched men, yee ſtande vpon thornes when any profite is ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
you, and although the iſſue be vncertayne, yet your coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe
driueth you to it, and euery of you is willing to disburſe
your money. Lo heere, God which is true and can not lye, aſſureth
vs oftentimes, yea and warranteth vs that whatſoeuer wee put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his hande ſhall yeelde vs ineſtimable gayne: and yet wee can
not finde in our hartes to beleeue him for all his promiſes whiche
he makes vnto vs. And can wee doo him a greater wrong? He
for his owne parte oweth vs nothing: whatſoeuer he promiſeth
vs, is of his owne good will without beeing in any wiſe bound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, and yet can not any thing induce vs to ſerue him. Therefore
marke well what Sainct Paule telleth vs, to the ende that euery of
vs may indeuer too amende this curſed roote of couetouſneſſe,
which is ſo deepely ſetled in our hearts, that wee muſt bee fayne
to inforce our ſelues when wee ſhoulde followe whither ſo euer
God calleth vs, and ſpecially when wee ſhould play the faythfull
Stewards in dealing foorth the goods which he hath put vs in truſt
with. How be it, let vs marke the words which he addeth, <hi>in conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
ſeaſon,</hi> ſayth he. And this ſerueth to confirme and ſtrengthen
vs in patience. For wee would haue God to ſhewe vs to day or to
morrowe, or rather out of hande, what the profite is that he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of. The husbandman will holde him ſelfe quiet when he hath
layde his ſeede in the grounde. Afterwarde he ſees froſt and ſnow,
winde and rayne, heate and colde: and yet neuertheleſſe he way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
ſtill for the comming of harueſt. They that occupie the trade
of marchaundiſe, put foorth their money, yea and their owne
perſons alſo in great daunger: and in the meane whyle theyr ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
goes and runnes, and is ſhifted too and fro: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
bicauſe they bee accuſtomed to buying and ſelling, they
knowe well inough that they ſhall not receyue any profite at the
firſt day, but muſt be fayne to wayte till the time come. Howebeeit

ſelues out of all doubt of it, in ſo muche that the time ought not
<pb facs="tcp:23060:331"/>
too ſeeme too long, if wee looke vp to the euerlaſtingneſſe of the
kingdome of heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet for all this, no man is pacient. VVe
will bee quiet inough ſo long as wee hazarde and aduenture our
goods: and is it not a very pitifull cace, that when as God telleth
vs that he will bee a faythfull keeper of the things that are too bee
ſpent [in his ſeruice] wee fall into ſorrowe and vnquietneſſe, and
beare our ſelues in hande that all is loſt, if wee ſee not the thyng
performed out of hande? Yee ſee then that the thing whiche wee
haue to marke vpon this ſaying, is that wee muſt bridle our ſelues
till the conuenient time be come. For it is not for vs to appoynte
the certayne day: that muſt remayne in the hande of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let vs be contented that he exerciſe our patience, and the time
ſhall not be prolonged further than is for our profite. Furthermore
S. Paule ment alſo to draw vs from the world, for we deſire tempo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall
profite. No doubte but wee will bee well contented that God
ſhoulde giue vs it: but yet therein wee ſhewe our ſelues too bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither
earthly. For if a man doo any almoſe deedes, althoughe
his intent bee too ſerue God: yet coulde he finde in his heart too
receyue by and by for euery pennie a ſhilling, or rather a Crowne,
and vnder colour of dooing ſome ſmall almoſe deedes, he woulde
ſeeke too rake into him ſelfe on euery ſide. For as muche then
as wee woulde chaffer ſo with God: Sainct Paule to correct ſuche
vyce, ſayth that wee muſt looke whether God calleth vs, that is
too wit, too the great day, at the whiche euery man ſhall haue hys
wages. So then althoughe all ſeeme to bee loſt as in reſpect of this
worlde, and of this preſent life, yet let vs not ceaſſe too truſt ſtill
in God, who is a faythfull keeper of our pawnes and gages, &amp; will
doo muche more for vs than wee can hope for, ſo that wee on our
ſide haue patience. Heerevppon he concludeth, <hi>that whyle wee haue
tyme and leyſure, wee must doo good too all men, and ſpecially to the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
of fayth.</hi> Nowe in ſaying that wee muſt labour to doo good
while wee haue leyſure: he ſetteth before vs the ſhortneſſe of our
lyfe. And wee ſee an vngracious maladie ſtill in vs in that behalfe:
for euery day ſeemeth as a ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
wee euer bee newe to beginne? Lo howe euery of vs thinketh the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:23060:331"/>
tyme to bee ouerlong that is ſpent in well dooing. And therevpon,
O (ſay wee) I ſhall come ſoone inoughe: for if I ſpende my ſelfe
to day, and one come to craue of mee to morrowe, I ſhall wante
wherewith, and therefore I were better to ſpare my ſelfe. Nowe
theſe delayes are ſuche as a man ſhall neuer finde time to do good.
For euery man would preferre his fellow before him, not of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to folowe him in dooing good, but to holde him ſelfe ſtill at
a ſtay. But contrariwyſe Sainct Paule telleth vs, that if wee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the matter aduiſedly as it is in deede, we ſhall finde our ſelues
too haue no great leyſure of all the tyme of our lyfe. For although
wee dyd neuer ceaſſe, but euery man inforced him ſelfe as muche
as were poſsible, too ſpende him ſelfe in the ſeruing of hys neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:
yet were it neuer a whit too muche. VVee ſee that as long
as wee bee in this worlde, wee muſte ſtyll bee in charge. VVee
ſee wee muſte bee fedde and clothed whyle wee bee children, at
whiche tyme wee can not earne the value of a pinne, and other
folkes muſt bee fayne too trauell for vs. Very well: are wee come
too yeeres of diſcretion? Yet haue wee neede too bee oftentimes
helped and ſuccoured, I meane euen the rycheſt ſorte of vs. For
there wyll come ſome ſickneſſe, or other aduerſitie, that ſhall
pull downe them whyche thynke them ſelues too bee luſtyeſt and
ſtrongeſt. Agayne wee ſhall haue neede of ſo many things and bee
ſo combered for our owne ſelues, as wee ſhall ſcarſly bee able too
imparte the hundreth parte of our duetie, too thoſe whome wee
owe it too by Gods appoyntment. They (I ſaye) whiche are riche
and haue ſtore of goods, euen they hauing alſo a good wyll,
(doo what they can, and trauell they neuer ſo much without ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing)
ſhall hardly or neuer bee able too diſcharge the hundredth
part of their duetie towardes thoſe whom they bee bounde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too.
Therefore when all is well conſidered, wee ſhall fynde
that wee haue no greate leyſure too doo good too oure neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
For when wee come too olde age, it is a returning agayne
too a ſeconde childehoode, ſo as wee ſerue too no more purpoſe
than little babes, ſauing that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
wee bee waywarde and vneaſie too content: euery body
muſt be combered with dooing ſeruice to vs, and when all is done,
<pb facs="tcp:23060:332"/>
wee bee vtterly vnprofitable. Heereby then wee ſee that wee haue
no great leyſure to doo well: and therefore it behoueth vs too
ſtreyne our ſelues ſo muche the more, whyle God giueth vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
time. VVhen a husbandman ſees fayre wether, Ply it ſirs,
ply it (ſayth he) wee can not tell whither it will rayne or no: wee
muſte go dig our vynes, wee muſt go tyll our grounde, wee muſt
ſowe our ſeede, wee muſt doo one thing or other whyle the we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſerueth, for wee can not tell howe long it will laſt. Likewyſe
dooth the marchantman when he hath a vyage too make, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
doo all other men. And nowe commeth that trauell or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in queſtion which God calles vs too. The cace concerneth
ſowing, yea euen to the ſpirite, and to the incorruptible lyfe: and
yet for all that wee ſay wee bee none of the haſtings: wee maye
well delay it yet a yeere hence, yea two or three yeeres hence, that
is too ſay, from hencefoorth for euermore: ſuche is our negligence
and coldneſſe. Therefore let vs learne too practiſe this warning
that is giuen vs heere by the holy Ghoſt: namely too doo well
whyle wee haue leyſure, for wee ſhall not haue it euer. And it is a
ſpeciall fauour that God graunteth vs, when he putteth into our
hands wherewith to ſuccour our neybours. And in ſo dooing he
giueth vs ſome token afore hande that he auoweth vs for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and if wee can finde in our harts to impart his giftes to ſuche
as haue neede of them, it is a marke of his image that he putteth
into vs. Nowe then if wee bee willing to ſerue their turnes which
craue our helpe, when wee haue meanes wherewith, and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
to doo it: ſurely God dooth vs great honor in it. And wee
wote not whether that leyſure ſhall laſte with vs ſtill or no: For
wee ſee how he plucketh away his goods from theſe Cormorants,
and from ſuche as are like Seagulfes: wee ſee howe he ſtrippeth

<hi>yea euen towards all men</hi> (ſayth S. Paule) <hi>but cheefly towardes the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:23060:332"/>
houſholde of fayth.</hi> Nowe when he ſayth too all men, it is to ſhewe
vs that although men diſcourage vs to doo them good, yet wee
muſt not ceaſſe to do ſtill as God commaundeth vs. For (as I haue
touched alreadie) wee muſt not looke what euery man is, nor
what he deſerueth: but wee muſt mount vp higher and conſider
that God hath ſet vs in this worlde too the ende wee ſhoulde bee
vnited and knit togither: and that for as much as he hath imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his image in vs, and wee haue all one common nature: the
ſame ought too moue vs too ſuccour one another. For he that will
exempt him ſelfe from releeuing his neybours, muſt get him a new
ſhape, and ſhewe that he intendeth too bee no more a man: for ſo
long as wee bee of mankinde, wee can not but beholde our owne
face as it were in a glaſſe, in the perſon that is poore and deſpiſed,
whiche is not able too holde out any longer, but lyeth gronyng
vnder his burthen, yea though he were the furtheſt ſtraunger in
the worlde. Let a Moore or a Barbarian come among vs, and yet
in as muche as he is a man, he bringeth with him a looking glaſſe,
wherein wee may ſee that he is our brother and neighbour. For
wee can not aboliſhe the order of nature, whiche God hath ſet to
bee inuiolable. So then wee bee bounde too all men without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
bicauſe wee be all one fleſh, as the Prophet Eſay auoweth,
ſaying:<note place="margin">Eſ. 58. b. 7</note> Thou ſhalt not diſpiſe thine owne fleſhe. As if he ſhould
ſay, they that are nigardly and pinching, and ſhrinke away when
they ſhould doo good, doo not onely deſpiſe God, and reiect his
worde: but alſo are vgly monſters, bicauſe they conſider not that
there ought too bee a communitie among all men. Thus yee ſee
why S. Paule ſayth expreſly, that wee muſt indeuer to doo good
to all men, yea euen to ſuche as are vnworthy, euen though they
were our deadly enimies. Truly this is harde, and contrarie to our
inclination: but yet therein God tryeth vs ſo muche the better.
For if wee doo good to ſuche as deſerue it, or to ſuche as are able
to recompence it: it is no declaration or proofe that wee bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to ſerue God:<note place="margin">Mat. 5. g. 46.</note> for it may be that wee had reſpect to our owne
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ofite. And as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt telleth vs, the Heathen men,
and the worſt men in the world doo as muche as that comes too.
How ſo? They conſider with them ſelues, I haue neede of helpe, I
<pb facs="tcp:23060:333" rendition="simple:additions"/>
muſt winne mee ſome freende. Then if wee ſnole out ſuche as are
worthy to haue good done vnto them, and ſuche as are able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
like for like: it is no right proofe nor certayne triall that wee
be willing to imploy our ſelues as God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth vs. But when
wee winke at mens vnthankfulneſſe, and are inclined to pitie, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in reſpect of their pouertie and miſerie: then doo wee ſurely
ſerue God. And if wee bee once at that poynt, certaynely (as I
tolde you before) wee ſhall indeuer too doo good to all men, ſo
as wee can not finde in our harts to breake the indiſſoluble bonde
whereby God hath knit and vnited vs togither. Therefore the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt
ſtraungers in the worlde are neighbours neere inough vntoo
vs, though they bee neyther our parents, our kinsfolke, nor our
acquayntaunce. And why? For wee bee all of one fleſhe, and wee
beare all one marke, which ought too perſuade vs too doo what
wee can poſsible one for another. But how ſoeuer the cace ſtande,
Sainct Paule commendeth vnto vs cheefly the houſholde folke of
fayth. And he vſeth the worde <hi>Houſholde folke,</hi> too touche vs
more to the quicke by that ſimilitude. For although nature teache
vs that wee oughte too ſuccour ſuche as are in neceſsitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
they that are of one houſholde are more inclined
and willing to doo good one to another. Yee ſee heere what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
are among men, how all knowe that there is a certayne mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
bonde, ſo as if they forſake euen the furtheſt ſtraungers of
the worlde, therein they forget them ſelues: yet notwithſtanding
foraſmuche as it is harde for a man to reache out him ſelfe ſo farre
and wide: therefore men are not ſo muche inclined to doo good
to vnknowen perſons, except it be in extreme neceſsitie. For then
howe hard harted ſo euer wee bee, euery of vs is moued to put to
his helping hande to ſuccour a man, when we ſee him in imminent
daunger. Yea and this pitifulneſſe is ſo ingrauen in vs, that it wyll
extende it ſelfe euen to the brute beaſtes: and therefore muche
more reaſon it is that it ſhoulde extende to thoſe that are created
after Gods image as well as our ſelues. But as I ſayde, if a man be
in extreme neceſsitie, then are we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

neede. And when wee be of one countrey and language, then wee
ſee our ſelues ſomewhat neerer one another, and that increaſeth
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:23060:333"/>
the affection whiche otherwiſe in generall woulde bee but colde.
But when there befalleth any freendlyneſſe and familiaritie of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood,
that is yet more: according as wee ſee that they whiche
bee of one Countrey will ſay, Seeing that God hath broughte vs
thus neere togither, let vs at leaſtwiſe indeuer too ſerue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
turne. Agayne wee ſee that the neighbours whiche dwell in
one ſelfe ſame ſtreete, and communicate familiarly togither, are as
kinsfolke and neere of alyance. Nowe then it is muche more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that they whiche are all of one houſe, and are gathered as it
were into one little corporation or bodie, ſhoulde bee hilde as it
were faſte linked togither by God: and that he ſhoulde imbrace
them as if a father ſhoulde holde all his children about him. For as
muche then as wee oughte too bee ſo muche the more moued too
imploy our ſelues with the better courage, ſeeing that God hathe
ſo knitte vs togither, and brought vs ſo familiarly neere one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Sainct Paule ſayth that all the faythfull, &amp; all thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe

that althoughe euery man bee at home in hys owne houſe, yet
God hathe in ſuche wyfe gathered vs togither too him ſelfe, that
wee bee as it were houſholde fellowes one with another, and wee
bee not onely Countreymen of one Realme or kingdome, but
there is yet a certayne neerer alyance, whiche oughte to holde vs

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:334"/>
Nowe then wee ſee that Sainct Paules meaning in effecte is, that
ſeeing God hathe bounde vs too doo good too all men, becauſe
they bee our owne fleſhe: no malice oughte too hinder any of vs
from indeuering too diſcharge him ſelfe generally towardes all
ſuche as God offereth too him, and in whome it is hys wyll too
trye our kindneſſe. And yet notwithſtanding that for as muche as
he hathe gathered vs into his flocke, and knit vs togither in hys
name, and wee call vppon him as our father wyth one mouthe:
it behoueth vs of dutie too bee as brothers one too another. So
that if wee minde that he ſhoulde allowe vs for his children, wee
muſt ſo aduaunce the adoption whereby he hath choſen vs, as wee
maye declare vnfaynedly by oure dooings, that wee mynde too
ſhewe that wee take them for our brothers, whome God hath ſo
gathered into his houſe and Churche. Thus yee ſee what we haue
too remember vpon this Texte. VVherefore let vs no more vſe
theſe fonde excuſes too ſay, I wote not who he is, I know him not.
But he is not knowen of God? yes: and yet notwithſtanding thou
diſdayneſt too open thine eyes to looke vppon him that is thine
owne image, yea and whom God taketh for one of his children.
Thou knoweſt not him, and yet beholde how God voutſafeth to
caſt his eye vpon vs which are moſt miſerable, yea euen he whiche
hath ſo high and terrible a maieſtie, that the very Angels of heauen
doo tremble before him with all humilitie. Yee ſee then that God
our ſoueraigne Lorde looketh downe vpon vs that are but wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
wormes of the earth &amp; filthineſſe: yea and he not only vout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth
to ſay, I know you: but alſo proteſteth, I haue adopted you
for my children, yee be my workmanſhip, yee be mine heires, yee
be after a ſorte my members. God voutſafeth too ſpeake after
that faſhion: and wee be ſo full of pride and ſtatelyneſſe, that wee
deſpiſe ſuche as are as good as our ſelues, and moſte commonly
muche better. So then who can beare with ſuch pride? To be ſhort,
they that are ſo ſtraunge in withdrawing them ſelues from their
brethren, and will not in ony wiſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with them, deſerue

of the Diuell who is their ſire, for he was a murtherer and full
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:23060:334"/>
of crueltie from the beginning. Thus yee ſee in effect what wee
haue too beare in minde, and how it behoueth vs too practize this
leſſon, wherein the houſehold folke of faith are chiefly commended
vntoo vs. And ſo, ſeing that God hath vouchſafed too call vs too
him, let vs ſhewe our ſelues too ſet more by that grace and honour,
than by all the goodes in the worlde. And in proofe thereof, let vs
ſhewe alſo that wee haue a brotherly affection too doo good too
ſuch as haue neede of vs, according to ſuch oportunitie as God ſhall
giue vs, and according too the meaſure of our abilitie. Nowe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon
Sainct Paule ſayeth, that the Galathians ought too conſider,
<hi>that he hath written them a large letter with his owne hande.</hi> And this
ſerues too make them the more attentiue, when they ſee what care
he hath of their ſaluation. For his commending of the largeneſſe of
his letter, was not too bee payed for it by the pounde (as they ſay)
but too the end that the Galathians might knowe, that he ment too
open his hart vnto them, and that for aſmuch as he ſawe them thruſt
out of the way into a wrong trade, and was lothe that they ſhoulde
periſh, therfore he had not only warned them in a woord or twaine,
but alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed his doctrine, ſo as they might perceyue themſelues
to haue bin miſledde before. Lo in effect whereat Sainct Paule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
And by this text we ought all to take warning, to confirme our
ſelues the more, according too the meanes and helpes whiche our
Lorde giueth vs to come to him withall. If God had but incled his
minde vntoo vs in one woord, yet had there bin no excuce for vs if
we could not beleeue him, to ſubmit our ſelues with ſuch obedience
as becommeth vs. But when wee ſee that beſides his giuing of the
Lawe, he hath alſo added an expoſition of it, and moreouer ſent his
Prophets too the ende that the doctrine ſhould alwayes bee of the
more authoritie, &amp; the things be made cleere which elſe would haue
bin darkeſome: and after his Prophetes, ſent his onely Sonne who
hath brought vs the full perfection of all wiſedome: and finally his
Apoſtles: ſo that he thought it not ynough too giue the Lawe, but
alſo willed the Goſpell too bee publiſhed, and that the ſame ſhoulde
continue to the end, and ſtirreth fit men ſtill to inſtruct vs: ſith

               </gap> (I ſay) that God doth ſo much for vs, and that he hath ſuch a
care of our welfare, quickening vs vp continually without ende or
<pb facs="tcp:23060:335"/>
ceaſsing: muſt we not needes be ſo much the more blameworthie,
if wee be negligent and all this ſtande vs in no ſtead? Therefore let
vs not looke at Sainct Paule here, how the Galathians had little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
of him: but let vs conſider that God had rayſed him vp, and
ment too ſhewe how deere we be vnto him, and how great ſtore he
ſetteth by our ſoules, in that he would haue his doctrine ſo confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
True it is that there are not paſt a ſixe or ſeuen leaues in this
Epiſtle, and at the firſt, it ſhould not ſeeme to be ſo great a letter. But
if wee marke the ſubſtance and contents of it, ſurely wee ſhall finde
heere wherewith to confound the Diuell, and all the wyles that he
can bring with him, ſo as Gods truth (whiche is our ſaluation) ſhall
haue the vpper hand. In ſomuch that if we had no more but this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle,
we might be [ſufficiently] fenced and armed, to fight againſt
all the lies, deceytes &amp; abuſes which the Diuell can alledge to bleare
our eyes with. But we haue not this Epiſtle alone: but we haue alſo
ſo many other of Gods teſtimonies, as are ſufficient (as yee would
ſay) to put out our eyes, if we liſt not to looke vpon them. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
wee haue ſo many confirmations to help vs: that although
we were the ſtubborneſt &amp; wildeſt creatures in the world, yet might
wee be drawen too ſome knowledge, ſeing that God trieth ſo many
wayes to winne vs to him. To be ſhort, he maketh vs too come vnto
him though wee would not come by our good will. And if wee go
backe wheras we ſhould come forward: muſt not the rebelliouſneſſe
that is in vs bee tootoo intolerable? So then, whenſoeuer and as oft
as wee reade this text, although it ſeeme not to touche vs, but too
haue bin ſpoken only to the Galathians: yet let vs vnderſtand that
god caſteth vs in the teeth, that his labour ſhould be loſt as vnauayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

ſhould I lie ſtil as aſleepe, without any more vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding or feeling

hand to take a better taſt of Gods woord, &amp; to apply all our indeuer
therevnto. And ſeing there is nothing ſuperfluous in it, and that wee
haue neede to bee prouoked to giue ourſelues to it: Let euery of vs
be moued too apply our ſelues thereto, &amp; not ſay that the repeating

the hyrelings and the woolues.<note place="margin">Iohn. 10. b. 12.</note> After he hath ſpoken of the good and
faythfull ſheepeherds which ſeeke the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welfare of the flocke:
he ſayeth, there are alſo rauening woolues or theeues whiche ſeeke
nothing elſe but too put all too ſpoyle, ruine, and confuzion. And
theſe are they which fight openly againſt God, laboring and indeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to ouerthrow the pure doctrine of the Goſpell. Neuertheleſſe
there are alſo which rowe betweene twoo ſtreames, who do make a
countenance to ſerue God. And truly ſome men builde, howbeit not
for any zele: for there is no ſoundneſſe of hart in them. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
ſo long as it is not to their coſte, they ſet a good face vpon
the matter, ſo that the world is oftentimes deceyued by them, and
taketh them too bee the miniſters of Ieſus Chriſt: but yet their ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
is but for wages, they bee wholly giuen too their bellies. For
proofe whereof, if yee do but threaten them, by and by they be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed,
and they will turne the cat in the pan, ſo that wheras yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
they ſeemed too maynteyne Gods woord, too day they bende
crooked and a croſſe. And why? For they ſee it is the way to pleaſe
the world, and to profite themſelues. And for the ſame cauſe doth
Sainct Paule nowe warned the Galathians to marke well, that ſuch
as had troubled them and thruſte them out of the right way, were
men giuen too their owne profite, and by that meanes had brought
their doctrine in ſuſpicion. Heeretofore he hath already ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcuſſed and ſhewed by reaſon, that if wee put our whole truſt in
Ieſus Chriſte, the Ceremonies of the Lawe are henceforth ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous:
for they ſerued but for a time, too ſhewe that it is not for
vs, too mingle any merite of their owne, or any fonde opinion of
purchacing rightuouſneſſe before God, if wee bee well ſettled vpon
the grace of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. Sainct Paule then hath han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
and layde foorth that matter as much as needed. And now too
the end that the ſimple ſorte may bee the more moued: he turneth

               </gap> that theſe men againſt whom I ſtriue heere, make ſuch a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

<pb facs="tcp:23060:337"/>
zele that moueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therevnto? or is it for that they be deſirous to
ſerue God? No: it is rather for that they bee lothe too put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in daunger of perſecution. Seyng then that feare cauſeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
too misfaſhion Gods woorde: yee neede not too make any long
inquirie too knowe what maner of men they bee, and whither they
bee to be credited or no: for yee ſee that their chaunging and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of themſelues after that faſhyon, is bycauſe they would
fayne ſhunne the battell. Nowe then ſeing that they bee ſuch tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
vnto God through their cowardlineſſe, deſerue they too bee
beleeued, or to haue any reuerence yeelded to their ſayings? Thus
yee ſee Sainct Paules meening. But heere all Miniſters of Gods
woord are taught to haue ſuch conſtancie and ſtedfaſtneſſe, as they
may not paſſe whither the doctrine that they bring bee hated or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
of the worlde, but go on ſtill in their race, and not ſtrike ſayle
at euery winde, nor be ſhaken like wauering reedes that bowe too
and fro: but alwayes hold on in ſeruing of God, what turnings and
chaunges ſo euer happen, and what troubles and diſorders ſo euer
befall.</p>
            <p>To bee ſhort, wee muſt practize the thing that we haue ſeene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
which is, that if wee will pleaſe mennes fancies, wee muſt giue
ouer the ſeruis of the Sonne of God. Marke that for one poynt. And
heerewithall alſo all the faythful may receyue a good and profitable
leſſon in this text: that is too wit, that they muſte looke well vppon
ſuch as ſeeke their owne profit and aduauntage, and are deſirous to
winne fauour with the worlde, and woulde fayne be prayzed: for a
man ſhall neuer haue any holde of ſuch folke. They will not ſhewe
themſelues too bee ſuch at the firſte brunt (as I ſayd afore): for there
are that play the Popeholy hypocrites, in ſomuch that it ſeemeth
that but for them the woord of God woulde growe odious: and ſo
long as it is well lyked, they caſt out fire at their mouthes, and yet in
the meane whyle yee ſhall ſee them chaunge their minde from day
too day. If any perill happen, and they ſee that they muſte witneſſe
with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt in good earneſt: then ſhew they their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlineſſe,
and in the end turne quite away, &amp; chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge their coates

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:23060:337"/>
and ſtart not out when they ſee the world co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues

they ſee the perilles preſent, doo neuertheleſſe continue in vpright
conſtancie: let vs marke ſuch men as Gods ſeruants. But as for ſuch
as be variable and counterfetting, which ſay now one thing and now
another to eſchew mennes hatred, or for feare of perſecution: let vs
beware of them, that we be not deceyued and beguyled by them, for
they bee deadly plagues. And it is certaine that wee ſhall neuer bee
firme and well ſettled, except we haue that diſcretion and wareneſſe
with vs, according as S. Paule ſheweth vs in this text. And this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
needefull now adayes. For what cauſeth ſo many hypocrites too
gabble agaynſt Gods woord, and too play the ſhameleſſe brothels in
maynteyning the outrageous abuſes that are too bee ſeene in the
Popedome, as their ſuperſtitions, idolatries, and errours: but for that
they knowe well ynough, that if they make not the pot too boyle
apace, they are lyke too ſtarue, and ſhould they not therefore holde

for yee ſee it is condemned of the Princes and great menne of this
world, and therfore it is good ſleeping in a whole skinne. See I pray
you howe an infinite number doo now adayes diſguyſe and falſifie
Gods truth, and maynteyne all corruptions, bycauſe they bee lothe
to ſuffer for Ieſus Chriſtes ſake. True it is that they bee not ranke
Papiſtes too blaſpheme Gods woorde openly: but yet they would
fayne haue a meane, yea of their owne deuiſing. For they blame vs
of ouermuch rigour and extremitie, in that wee condemne ſuche as
go to Maſſe, and beare themſelues in hand that they woorſhip not
ydols. O (ſay they), howe ſhould that be, ſo a man thinke it not in
his harte? Should men bee driuen ſo neere hand as too make it a
ſtumbling blocke, and a matter of lyfe and death? Too what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
were that? God ſetteth greate ſtore by our lyfe, and although
wee ſhould doo amiſſe, yet will he haue pitie of our frayltie. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they that ſpeake after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

ſo ſore inflamed agaynſt vs, and it ſeemeth that wee ſhould periſhe
<pb facs="tcp:23060:338"/>
and be quite confounded euery day. Thus ye ſee that they flee backe
and labour too imbattell themſelues alone from the reſt, when they
ſee any daunger appeering. But when we ſee theſe liuerharted folke
ſhun perſecution after that ſort, &amp; loth to come to any hand ſtrokes
for our Lord Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, and winding and transforming the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
after that maner, only to haue peace in this world: it ſtandeth
vs ſo much the more in hande too marke this warning of S. Paules,
and to diſcerne which are the true ſeruantes of Ieſus Chriſte: that is
too wit, they which regard not their owne profite, nor would haue
men too faune vppon them, nor ſeeke the belly cheere and honour
of the world: but do ſimply content themſelues with the doyng of
their duetie, and paſſe not what winde doo blowe, whither it be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous
and ſtormie, or whither it be fayre and calme: but to profit
their heerers, and to maynteyne in all pureneſſe the doctrine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If we follow the thing that is ſhewed vs heere, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our faith ſhall neuer ſtagger as many do now adayes, which know
not what to do, and yet notwithſtanding will ſay, I feare the troubles
and diuerſities of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and the bickerings that are in this world.
Some ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well ynough ſay, it were meete that I ſhould giue my ſelfe
wholly to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: but there are another ſorte which
take a much pleaſanter way, and would haue a reformation but onely
in half. And which of theſe ſhall I beleeue [ſay they Ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thine eies:
for all they that alledge any ſuch excuces, ſeeke not too followe the
truth, but are well apayde if they can get ſome ſhrowding ſheete too
hide their ſhame, and would fayne bee flattered: but in the meane
whyle, what gaine they by it? For Satan leades them to deſtruction,
and they be willing too follow him. Bicauſe they are afrayd of their
liues, they loue the couert, and bicauſe they bee giuen too pleaſure,
they ſeeke their owne eaſe. Therfore they muſt haue ſuch payment
as they deſerue. But how ſoeuer the worlde go, S. Paule declareth
that ſuche as wilfully become brutiſhe, are ſo ouertaken by Satan
and caſte in ſuch perplexitie, as they wote not what too do: bicauſe
they conſider not that ſuch as do ſimply beare abrode the truthe of
the Goſpell, are no wauering perſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, but ſuche as keepe on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
pace, and paſſe not whither the worlde like of their doctrine or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
but for aſmuch as God hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded them to ſpeake, they do ſo.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:23060:338"/>
Contrariwiſe, as for the nicelings which ſay it is good too beware,
and not to caſt themſelues out of the Saddle, and woulde haue men
to counterfeyt, and to beare two faces in one whoode: it is certain
that ſuch maner of men are not ledde with any zeale or affection to
ſerue God, nor haue any regarde of edifycation or of the welfare
of the Church: nor (to be ſhort) haue any other care or reſpect, than
to eſchew all perſecution, and too liue at their eaſe, ſo as no man
might faſten vppon them. Nowe then, ſeeing that this is manifeſt
ynough: it is certaine that all ſuche as nowadayes do keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
ſo in their neſt, do offende God, and are vtterly wythoute
excuze. VVhy ſo? For Saint Paule giueth vs heere an infallible
marke, which ſheweth vs who bee the true ſeruants of God, and
who bee the hyrelings whom we muſt eſchue, that is too wit, ſuch
as ſeeke but to feede their bellies, and too haue their commodityes
in this worlde. Herevpon he addeth, <hi>to the ende they might not ſuffer
perſecution for the Croſse of Christ.</hi> No doubt but that vnder the
woorde <hi>Croſſe,</hi> Saint Paule comprehendeth the whole doctrine,
howbeeit with a conſideration, that it is right harde for a man too
preache ſimply and plainly the things that are conteyned in Gods
worde, but that he ſhall haue many incounters. For although God
ſpare vs (vs I meane which preach his worde) and will not alwayes
put vs too ſo hard tryall, that our enemies ſhall haue their ſwordes
drawne vpon vs: yet the worlde doth neuer receyue the Goſpell
ſo obediently, but that there is ſtill ſome murmuring and ſpeaking
agaynſt it, as is too bee ſeene yet ſtill at this day, and muſt bee yet
hereafter. For our Lorde intendeth too trie the conſtancie of hys
faythfull ones, and therewithall to ſhewe the inuincible power of
his worde, in ouercomming all the lettes that Satan ſtyrreth vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
it:<note place="margin">Ier. 1. d. 19.</note> according too this ſaying of Ieremie, They ſhall fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
thee, but thou ſhalt get the vpper hande of them. Thus ye
ſee that God is glorified when the world and Satan ſtreining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to the vttermoſt, are not able too let the truth of his courſe.
For this cauſe Saint Paule ſayth, that they which be ſo variable, and
do diſguize Gods worde or falſifie it; do ſhunne the Croſſe, that is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ay, the true preaching of the Goſpell, euen too eſchue perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now here againe we haue a verie profitable counſel. For if we
<pb facs="tcp:23060:339"/>
deſire to ſerue God and his Church: wee muſt alwayes bee readie
to receiue alarums. And although the fire bee not yet kindled, or
the enemies not yet armed too make ſo cruell perſecution as they
woulde, or finally our Lorde do brydle all thoſe that are wearie of
his worde, and woulde faine ſhake off his yoke: yet muſt wee bee
ſcorned at many mens handes, we muſt be diffamed, there muſt be
murmuring and rayling agaynſt vs, and we muſt put it vp and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
our ſelues agaynſt it. Yea and wee ſhall ſee a thouſand backby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
againſt ſuch as imploy themſelues faithfully, euen where the
Goſpell is preached. Some ſhall bee arreigned as felons, and ſome
ſhall be indited of this and that, and yet all ſhall be but ſtarke ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
To be ſhort, all ſuch as minde to go through with their race,
muſt prepare themſelues too indure many temptations that might
make them reele, if they were not ſettled in this poynt, that God
muſt bee obeyed in ſpyte of the whole worlde. Marke that for one
poynt. And here withall we haue alſo to marke, that this extendeth
to the whole Church in generall. Therefore when wee heere the
meſſage of peace that is brought vs in the name of God: let vs not
thinke to be in reſt to the worldwarde, but too haue manie troubles
and incomberances continually. And he that determineth not vpon
that muſt needs ſhrinke away from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: for he can
neuer be any of his diſciples,<note place="margin">Math. 10. d 38.</note> according as he himſelf declareth with
his owne mouth, that ſuch a man is not worthie to be of his ſchole,
and ſo he ſhetteth them all our of the doores. VVherefore let vs
learne, that when we be once called to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, wee
muſt be partakers of his croſſe ſo long as he liſteth, according as it
is ſayde, that if we ſuffer with him we ſhall alſo bee glorified wyth
him,<note place="margin">Ro. 6. a. 5.</note> and be made partakers of the power that is ſhewed in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.
But yet notwithſtanding the ſufferings which he indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
muſt firſt be accompliſhed in vs that are his members. True it is
that he ſuffered as much as was requiſite for our ſaluation: but yet
muſt wee bee faſhioned like too his Image, as it is ſayde in the .viij.
too the Romanes. Nowe whereas God ſpareth vs, ſo as wee bee
not among Tyrantes that might t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ent vs: or if the wicked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee
not able too byte vs, but onely barke at vs: or if hee let vs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
in peace: let vs knowe that it is bycauſe he pityeth our feebleneſſe,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:23060:339"/>
and that hee ſpareth vs bycauſe hee ſeeth howe weake we bee. But
yet for all this let vs not flatter oure ſelues, but praye God too
ſtrengthen vs ſo by his holy ſpirite, that whenſoeuer hee ſhall call
vs intoo the aray too fight, wee may not bee lyke freſhwater ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyours,
but that wee maye haue mynded it a long tyme before
hande, that wee muſte bee made partakers of Ieſus Chriſtes ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
too come too the glorie of his Reſurrection. Nowe Sainct
Paule hauing ſpoken after that maner, addeth for a larger confyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of his matter, <hi>that they whiche are circumcyzed, and whiche
preache circumcizion, keepe not the Lawe: but onely ſeeke too glorie in
the fleſhe of thoſe whome they bring too that Iewiſhe faſhion.</hi> In thys
Text Saint Paule dooth ageine accuſe his aduerſaries of double
dealing and vtter hypocriſie. VVhy ſo? Circumciſion was the
marke of the ſame thing before the comming of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt, whereof Baptiſme is the marke vntoo vs at this day. For
the Iewes had recorde [thereby] that they were ſanctified by God
as his heritage. But yet for all that, they that mingled Circumcizion
with the Goſpell, were vtterly of opinion that the Lawe of Moyſes
was to be obſerued, foraſmuch as it was giuen of God, &amp; that it was
not at any time to be aboliſhed. Heere then yee ſee that the couert
which they tooke, was that Circumcizion ſerued for a ſigne of the
keeping of the whole Law. But now S. Paule layeth to their charge
that they kepe not the Law: and therfore they do but mock God &amp;
men in making a countenance by an outward ſigne, to do the thing
which they do not: for it is clene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie. Now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſee S. Paules
meening. And as touching this ſpech <hi>of keeping the Law,</hi> it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the doing or performing of all that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned in the
Lawe. But no man can keepe the Lawe, that is to ſay, no man can
diſcharge himſelfe throughly of all things that the law co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth.
For it is not for nought that it is called an intollerable burthen. Alſo
we ſee our owne infirmitie,<note place="margin">Act. 15. b. 10</note> and there God ſheweth vs an angelicall
rightuouſneſſe. How then is it poſsible for vs to attaine vntoo it?
So then, if wee take the worde Lawe for a perfect and faultleſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
no man keepeth it in effect. Neuertheleſſe the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
beeing guided and gouerned by Gods ſpirite, do keepe the Law,
that is to ſay, they walk according to the rule that is giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there.
<pb facs="tcp:23060:340"/>
Not that they run ſo ſwiftly as they ſhould do, nor that they attaine
to the marke at the firſt brunt: but yet they go on ſtill towards it,
and God beareth with them, and layeth not their faultes too their
charge. The faythfull then do kepe the Law. But here S. Paule ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of the Ceremoniall Lawe, howbeeit that by occaſion hee had
ſhewed heretofore, that all Gods commaundements coulde bring
nought els but condemnation, except we had refuge to the grace of
our lord Ieſus Chriſt: but (as I ſaid) here he ſpeaketh of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
&amp; ſhadowes. Now let vs ſee what he meaneth by it. They (ſaith
he) which are circumcized keepe not the Lawe: that is to ſay, they
haue in deede that ſigne as a ſtandarde too make men beleeue that
they be Iewes, to the intent that they might not be hated nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted:
but yet for all that, they keepe not the whole Lawe: for
they take leaue to deſpize all that ſhoulde bee matched with Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.
For he that is circumcized ought alſo to do ſacrifize, too
abſteyne from the meates that are forbydden by the lawe, to keepe
the dayes and feaſts appoynted there, to vſe the inioyned waſhings
and purifyings, and to do diuerſe other things. But theſe men make
none account of them. VVhen they be in corners and no man ſees
them, they paſſe not what they do, neyther make they any conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
at all to deſpize all the Ceremonies of the Lawe. Thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
that they do it not for any zeale, but only in reſpect of men.
Nowe it behoueth vs to marke, that Saint Paule ſpeaketh heere of
ſuch as ſtoode vpon the ſayde poynt,<note place="margin">Act. 16. a. 3.</note> that men ought of neceſsitie to
bee circumcized.<note place="margin">1. Co. 8. b. 6.</note> For at ſome tymes Saint Paule had a ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
to faſhion himſelfe like to the Iewes, and abſteyned from the
libertie which was permitted him, for eſchuing of offences: but did
he alwayes mainteyne that there was no bonde of neceſsitie in the
matter. So then, when Saint Paule ſubmitted himſelfe of his owne
accorde, he ment not to bring other men in bondage, according as
he proteſteth that he intendeth not to binde any bodie. True it is
that the cace is altered when hee ſpeaketh of mariage: but yet hee
ſayeth generally,<note place="margin">1. Co. 7. f. 35</note> that he will not lay any yoke of bondage vpon the
ſoules that are redeemed by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: And thus yee
ſee howe Saint Paule behaued himſelfe in that behalfe. Nowe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
ſayth here, They that conſtreyne you to bee circumcized, that is to
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:23060:340"/>
ſay, they that lode you with the lawe, and ſay you muſt keepe that
Ceremonie vnder paine of deadly ſinne: ſeeke nothing elſe but too
bring you in bondage without cauſe why. To be ſhort, we ſee here
whereof they be blamed which woulde ſubdue Chriſten folke too
the keeping of the Ceremonies and ſhadowes of Moyſes Lawe: that
is to wit, that they were double fellowes, and paſſed not vppon the
truth of the matter, whither God required ſuch things or no, but
had a minde to pleaſe and pleaſure the worlde, and by that meanes
to eſchue perſecution. And we nowadayes haue neede to bee war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thereof, as well as the Galathians needed then. And if we looke
vpon the ſtate and diſpoſition of our time, we ſhall eaſily perceyue
that this doctrine is not needeleſſe, and that the holy Ghoſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to prouide for the thing whiche he knew to be for our behoofe.
For what a number are to be founde nowadayes, which do ſtrongly
and ſtoutly mainteyne the Ceremonies of the Lawe, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
make none accounte of them? But (which is worſe)
they mainteyne the follies and traditions that are inuented by men,
yea and euen ſuch abuſes, errours, and deceytes as are ſo groſſe and
fonde as may bee. All theſe things ſhall be mainteyned with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treeme
rygour, by ſuch as will needes haue men to obey them. Like
as nowadayes, if a man charge theſe Hypocrites that the grace of
our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and the brightneſſe of his Goſpell are dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the great number of their obſeruations, and that wee bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as good as Iewes: (for in very deed the Papiſts haue borowed
ſo many things of the Lawe, that a man ſhall hardly diſcerne the
difference betweene the Iewes, &amp; them that call themſelues Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:)
I ſay if a man doo charge them with theſe things: yet wyll
they mainteyne to the vttermoſt, that men muſt do ſo ſtill, bicauſe
they haue bin kept time out of minde. If a man go further wyth
them, and ſay, howe ſo? Yee haue ſo many dotages, that the verie
heathen men were neuer ſo groſſe and fonde in their ſuperſtitions
as you be: O tuſh (ſay they) yet muſt we keepe ſtill the traditions
of our mother holy Church. And therewithall they crie, to the fire
with him. But nowe what doo theſe Hypocrites, which moue the

               </gap> of Princes and Iudges agaynſt thoſe that preach Gods worde
faithfully? So long as they be among themſelues, they make but a
<pb facs="tcp:23060:341"/>
mocke at theyr owne traditions. And when they diſpute of them,
they will ſay cleane contrarie too theyr preaching, and talking in
the Pulpit. VVhereby it appeareth that there is no zeale of God,
nor no ſoundneſſe in them: but that their whole ſeeking is to be
fedde and pampered fatte, and too liue in reſt, and too haue their
eaſe and commodities. Seing then that nowadayes there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men that haue not one whitte of the feare of God, nor of the
reuerence of his woorde in them, who notwithſtanding pretende
too bee verie zealous, and yet in verie deede doo but allure poore
ſoules with baytes or rather (as ye woulde ſay) choke them: it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs ſo much the more on hande too marke well the thing that
Saint Paule telleth vs heere: which is, that foraſmuch as wee ſee
that they which crie out and ſtorme at others: do nothing at all of
that which they ſpeake of, we muſt ſtande vpon our garde, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
whereat they ame which teache vs. True it is that although
the partie do cleane contrarie too that which hee ſayeth, yet muſte
not Gods woorde therefore bee of the leſſe authoritie towards vs:
For it is no reaſon that bycauſe the man is wicked, therefore God
ſhoulde bee diſpoſſeſſed of his ſoueraine prerogatiue. And though
a man leade a looce lyfe, or do ſome ſhrewde turne, yet ought not
that to deface the heauenly doctrine, ſo he preach faythfully. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a man be mutable, fleeting and variable, or though he bee
an hypocrite, and his life be not anſwerable to the things that hee
ſpeaketh with his mouth: the truth of Gods worde muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be imbaced towardes vs. Neuertheleſſe, I ſay now that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
we ſee men pretend great zeale, and yet let themſelues loce,
and take leaue to do contrarie to their preaching: we muſt conſider
of it, and haue the diſcretion not too bee ledde by theyr Pype nor
drawne by the noze, but to looke into theyr doctrine, and to make
a good and liuely tryall of it. And when we go ſo to worke, we ſhall
ſee that the doctrine of the Papiſtes is but a couert which they take
to liue quiet to the worldwarde, and as for to Godwarde they care
not how things go. For they would not abide any chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, but that
they be loth to put themſelues in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of any diſpleaſure: for they

this: it is an infallible marke to make vs beware of all Satans ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:23060:341"/>
ſo as it ſhall not be poſsible for vs to be deceyued, except wee
lyſt our ſelues, as I haue declared before. Furthermore, Saint Paule
addeth, <hi>that ſuch men deſire to glorie in the fleſhe of the ſimple.</hi> It is very
certaine that heere he hath an eye to the ſigne of Circumciſion, as
if he ſhould ſay, they intende to prynt their marke vpon you, to the
ende they may vaunt, VVe haue wonne them. Yea, but their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of men after that ſort, is to make them ſo much the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
for ſo abuſing the ſigne which God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
the adoption which he had made with Abrahams ofſpring, and
for corrupting the true and lawfull vſe thereof. For God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
the Iewes to be circumciſed. And why? To the ende they
might ſee that all mankind is accurſed, and that there is nothing but
vncleaneſſe in vs, and that wee muſt be faine to renounce all that is
of our owne nature, or elſe we ſhall neuer ceaſſe too bee filthie and
damnable before God. Lo what the Iewes ought to haue learned by
their circumcizion. Neuertheleſſe, therwithal they had alſo a record,
that by mans ſeede they ſhould recouer their ſaluation, according as
we know that we be bleſſed of God for our Lord Ieſus Chriſts ſake.
And therefore Circumciſion ſerued too humble the Iewes, and too
make them miſlyke of themſelues, and to be aſhamed, when they
ſawe there was nothing but curſedneſſe in their nature. That ſay I
was the true and lawfull vſe of circumciſion. Nowe what do they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt
whom S. Paule ſpeaketh? They knowe that Circumcizion is
no longer in vſe: that is to witte, that Baptiſme ſuffizeth euer ſince
the comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: but bicauſe the Iewes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
all them Apoſtates or backſliders, which were not circumcized:
therefore theſe raſcalles will needes hold ſtill the ſigne without the
truth [or ſubſtance.] VVe ſee then that they were verie falſaries,
and wreſted the doctrine cleane contrarie too Gods meening when
he ordeyned that ſpirituall Sacrament, bicauſe their deſire was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but to pleaſe the worlde. As much is done at this day. And
they that labour to ouerthrowe Gods truth, are much worſe than
Saint Paules aduerſaries. For they had yet ſome cloke of honeſtie
mainteyne Circumcizion and the figures of the Law, bicauſe they
were al ordeyned and ſtabliſhed by God. But as for theſe hypocrites
which crie out vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs nowadayes with full throte, [ſaying] ye muſt
<pb facs="tcp:23060:342"/>
keepe the olde cuſtome without chaunging of any thing: whereon
are they grounded? They cannot ſay that God is Author of any of
their ſtuffe. Men haue contriued them after their owne fancie, or
rather Satan hath blowne them into their eares: ſo that (at a word)
all that is termed Gods ſeruice in Poperie, is nothing elſe but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuzed
maze: all is but dreames of mens ſetting forth, and the diuell
is euer the cheefe Authour of them. And yet theſe naughtipacks ſay
that nothing muſt be taken from them. And wherevnto haue they
reſpect? Truly they will alledge that men muſte purchaſe Gods
grace by them, and that they ſtirre folke vp to greater deuotion. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
they giue the title of Sacrament too all the fooliſh deuices of
their owne heades, ſaying: ſuch a thing muſt bee kept, for it is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
But when all is iuſtly reckened, a man ſhall ſee that theyr
intent is to pleaſe the worlde, and to mainteyne themſelues ſtil. For
they be inforced ſpite of their teeth to confeſſe, that it maketh ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
here nor there as in reſpect of God, and that he paſſeth not for
their kinde of ſeruice, but vtterly diſlyketh it, bicauſe he will be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with obedience. But what? There will bee horrible confuſion
(ſay they) if men cut off all after that faſhion, and ſpeake plainly of
things. See I pray you, how they woulde faine diſguiſe themſelues,
and in ſuche wiſe corrupt and falſifie religion, as there ſhoulde bee
made a mingled confuſion of all: or elſe that there ſhoulde no more
be taken away but the groſſeſt and fondeſt things, and in the meane
while ſuch Ceremonies be let alone as may be any whit ſufferable.
It is certaine (ſay I) that all they whiche ſpeake ſo, deſire nothing
elſe but to haue fayre winde and weather to the worldwarde. Seing
it is ſo: let vs take warning at the holy Ghoſtes hande to flee ſuche
plagues: And although we cannot triumph in this worlde, although
we be nothing ſet by, although men rayle vpon vs with ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mouth:
yet let vs not ceaſſe too holde oure owne for Gods truth, and let it
ſuffice vs to be allowed of the heauenly iudge, though all the world
abhorre vs. Although then that we ſee all theſe things: yet let vs be
pacient, and tarie till our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſhewe himſelfe to bee

the Goſpell, whereof wee ſee too many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
yet ſtill at this day. For ſuche as ſee
that the pure doctrine and truth of God can not be brucked of the
world, but that the wicked ſort doo rage agaynſt it: they (I ſay)
would fayne finde ſome meane way, that they might not bee hated
nor incurre any diſpleaſure. And that it is ſo: if nowe a dayes yee
aske it of ſuch as haue but ſome little vnderſtanding: ye ſhal ſcarſe
finde one of them among a hundred, whiche will not graunte that
there are many abuſes in Poperie: but yet [they will ſay] that all
muſt not be cut off by the quicke, but that it is inoughe if ſome
of the ouergroſſe and exceſsiue ſuperſtitions bee taken away, and
ſo they would fayne ſtill nouriſhe a great ſorte of infections. And
why? For (as I haue ſayde) they woulde fayne bee in credite and

inaſmuche as we be inlightened by his holy ſpirite, and that
bicauſe we be weake of our ſelues, we muſt be ſtrengthened by his
power, and whereas wee be full of all filthe and iniquitie, wee muſt
recouer rightuouſneſſe by his gifte. But nowe wee muſt come to
the meanes. For it is not inough for vs to knowe that God is our
light, our rightuouſneſſe, our wiſdome, our ſtrength, &amp; finally that
the whole perfection [and fulneſſe] of our life, ioy, and happineſſe
is in him: that is not inough, for there is a very far diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene
him and vs, and therfore it ſtandeth vs in hande to know how and
by what meanes we may be partakers of all the graces whiche wee
haue to ſeeke in God. Howbeit wee knowe that the whole is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to vs in Ieſus Chriſt, verily for that he came downe
heere bilowe, and abaced him ſelfe, and was contented to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for vs. Seeing then that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is he out of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we muſt drawe all things that we haue neede of: now wee ſee why
S. Paule ſayth he will not ſeeke any glory but in the Croſſe of our
Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And why? For in as muche as he ſuffered ſo
paynefull and bitter a death, yea and was ſet agaynſt Gods iuſtice
for vs, and tooke all our curſedneſſe vpon him: therefore was he
giuen vnto vs to be our wiſdome, rightuouſneſſe, holineſſe, ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth,
and all that euer wee want. But firſt of all wee muſt learne what we
be, to the intent to beate downe all our owne glorying, and to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
our ſelues vpon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For we ſee many men
burſt with pride, and they wote not why. There is nothing but
winde &amp; ſmoke in all the things which they ſurmiſe of them ſelues.
Howbeit the very cauſe why they ſeeke not Ieſus Chriſt, is for
want of due examination of them ſelues: and ſuche are the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
and the Counterfetters, and thoſe that are puffed vp wyth
ouerweening of their owne works. Therefore (as I haue touched
alreadie) it behoueth vs to looke to our owne ſtate, and to ſee
howe wretched wee be till our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt pitie vs. That
is the way too prepare vs too come vnto him. And that ſhall
ſerue for one poynte. Howebeeit that is not yet all. For there

               </gap> that can graunte them ſelues too bee ſinners, and that there is
nothing in them but vanitie: and yet notwithſtanding they welter
neuertheleſſe in their own filthy dung. And why<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyue
<pb facs="tcp:23060:344"/>
not Gods iuſtice, but are (as yee woulde ſay) doted in this world.
None of all theſe vnthriftes whiche giue them ſelues ouer to drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe,
or to whoredome, or to ſuche other lewdneſſe, can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
their vilanies, but that they are fayne to be aſhamed of them:
and yet neuertheleſſe they delight in them, and continue ſtyll in
them as if they were hardened. And why? Bicauſe they bee made
drunken with this worlde, and the diuell hath ſo clozed vp their
eyes, that they ſee not howe they muſt one day come to account.
They play the amazed men, and beare them ſelues in hande that
they ſhall always ſtande at a ſtay, and ſo they go forward with their
naughtineſſe, and neuer ſighe nor be ſorie for the matter, but are
alwayes laughing at it, as though they ment to ſpite God wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
VVee ſee then that one ſorte is letted, yea or rather vtterly
turned backe from comming to Ieſus Chriſt, bicauſe they preſume
vpon their owne wiſedome, and are poſſeſſed with an imagination
that Satan hath put into their heade, ſo that too their owne ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
they bee wiſe inough without Ieſus Chriſt, and therfore they
holde ſcorne of him. The other ſorte (whiche are infinite in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
notwithſtanding that they knowledge themſelues to be wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
ſinners: doo neuertheleſſe not ſeeke the remedie. And why?
For this preſent worlde poſſeſſeth them, and they bee ſo wrapped
in it, as they can not lifte vp their eyes, nor their mindes, to ſeeke
the remedie that is readie for them in Ieſus Chriſt. So muche the
more neede therefore haue wee to mynde the thing that I haue
touched alreadie: that is too wit, that wee muſt ridde our ſelues
of all ſelfetruſt and ouerweening, and bee ſo greeued as wee may
neuer be in reſt till wee haue founde ſuccour in our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt. And let vs not only open our eyes to ſee our owne foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and to be aſhamed of it: but alſo let vs conſider that this life
is nothing, and that God hath ſet vs heere as in a wayfaring, wherin
he intendeth to trye whether wee will come to him or no. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let euery of vs ſummon him ſelfe euening and morning, and
as oft as we looke vpon our ſinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

brute beaſtes, nor be hilde backe in this world, but that our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
may alwayes driue vs too reſorte too our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:23060:344"/>
Thus yee ſee howe wee may glory in the croſſe of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt. And Sainct Paule hath purpoſely ſpoken here of the croſſe,
bicauſe the matter that he delte with, was the pulling downe, and
as it were the treading vnder foote, of all loftyneſſe which men aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
vnto. For wee will needes bee alwayes ſomewhat of our
ſelues, and holde ſtill ſome worthineſſe. To the ende therefore that
we might be diſcharged of that wicked affection: Sainct Paul tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
vs that Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of God can not be our glory, but
only in reſpect that he was crucified for vs. And heerevpon inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
that which he addeth, namely that we ſhall be crucified to the
world, and the world to vs, when wee ſhall haue learned to glory
in the only meere grace that is brought vs by our lord Ieſus Chriſt.
As how? ſurely they that are not crucified to the worlde, that is
to ſay, they that couet to bee in ſome authoritie, and to ſet out
them ſelues, they that deſire to bee honored and exalted, and (to
be ſhort) they that are drawen hither and thither of their luſts, doo
not yet knowe what it is too glory in the Croſſe of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt: for they ſhoulde haue begonne at the foreſayde poynt,
that is too wit, of beeing confounded in them ſelues. Therefore
not without cauſe dooth S. Paule ſay, that for as muche as he had
ſetled his glory in the croſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, he had quite
forſaken and giuen ouer the worlde. Nowe by the worlde he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
all that is delightſome to the fleſhe, as when men think ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vpon God, nor vpon the lyfe of heauen, ſo as one is giuen to
couetouſneſſe, another to ambition, and euery man is driuen by
his owne naturall ſway, and there is not any that paſſeth further
than this world. VVhen men followe their owne ſwinge, and God
hath not yet touched them with his holy ſpirite to draw them too
him: ſurely although they doo all fling ouer the feelds, and runne
aſtray: yet is there great diuerſitie in their affections, ſo that if the
matter come to triall, one drawes one way, and another another
way cleane contrarie: and to be ſhort, men ſeeme to differ quite &amp;
cleane one from another. But yet they be all alike in one thing, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> wit, that they would aduaunce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the worldwarde,
that they be giuen to their owne priuate profite or pleaſures. At a
worde, they be ſo intangled here, that they could find in their harts
<pb facs="tcp:23060:345"/>
too be ſeparated from God. But S. Paule ſayth that when wee ſhall
haue ſet all our glory in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, knowing that by
the meanes of his Croſſe he hath dedicated vs vnto his father, and
purchaced vs the kingdome of heauen: then it will be eaſie for vs
to withdraw our ſelues from the world, and to be as it were cut off
from it. And why? For it is certayne that whoſoeuer hath bin tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and wounded to the quicke with the feeling of his ſinnes, will
ſo purſue the grace that hath bin giuen him in our lord Ieſus Chriſt,
as the world ſhall be nothing with him. And in good ſooth wee
ſhew that al the ſpirituall benefites which God offreth vs, &amp; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
the calleth vs are as things of nothing vnto vs, in that wee
eſteeme them not in compariſon of the trumperie and inticements
of Satan. VVhat is this world if a man view it in it ſelfe? There is
no man but he ſeeth howe frayle our life is, and howe it is but as a
ſmoke that paſſeth and vaniſheth away: and yet wee ſee men frye
ſtill in their affections, and howe they bee vtterly caried away and
rauiſhed with them. God on his ſide crieth out. Ye wretched folk,
ye be more deſtitute of wit than little children. For ye buzie your
heads about mooneſhine in the water, and about pelting trifles
wherein there is nothing but fooliſhneſſe, &amp; ye be wholly wedded
vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and yet in the meane ſeaſon whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I offer you perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
ye make none account of it, all is one to you. Yee ſee then
that the cauſe why we be ſo cold &amp; negligent now a dayes in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the benefites which God offreth vs by his Goſpel: is for that
the world hath gotten the poſſeſsion of vs aforehand: and on the
other part we alſo do ſet too much ſtore by the world. And why do
we ſo? Bicauſe we know not the ineſtimable benefites that God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
vs. Therefore let vs ioyne theſe two togither, that is to wit,
that we be crucified to the world, and the world to vs, bicauſe we
haue our glory in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt crucified. But this is eaſier
to be ſayd than to be doone: and therfore euery man muſt ſtrayne
himſelfe in his owne behalfe, &amp; when he vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth this leſſon,
he muſt put it in practiſe. For if we couet to be taken &amp; auowed for

the holy Ghoſt in the thing that he ſetteth down here. And in very
deede if we were not too farre ouerſeene, wee haue occaſion of it
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:23060:345"/>
inough, as hath bin ſaid afore. For they that doo but only enter into
themſelues to conſider what they be, and what their ſtate is ſo long
as they be ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus Chriſt, muſt needs be ſcared with the
feling of gods wrath which they haue deſerued, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they perceiue
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be plu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged in ſuch curſedneſſe, that it were much better
for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if the earth had ſwallowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp a hundred times, than to
haue liued in that plight but one day, being in the meane while eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to their God, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whoſe hands they can not ſcape. Therefore
let vs lerne to looke to our ſelues. Such as intend to deck the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
to the worldward, &amp; ſpecially women, will looke in a glaſſe, &amp; that
ſhal be done with as much curioſitie &amp; wareneſſe as may be. But in
the meane while we looke not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſelues to ſpie our own wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
and filthineſſe, to the end we might humble our ſelues truly before
God, &amp; ſeeke our glory where it is to be had. Now, it is certen that
he which knoweth his own reproch &amp; ſhame, wil ſeeke to come to
the remedie of it, at leaſtwiſe of Gods ſpirite worke liuely in vs, &amp;
that we be not ſotted by Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as I haue ſaid afore. Let vs lerne, let vs
lerne to looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ourſelues, both without feining, &amp; without flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.
And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhall haue knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our own wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts &amp; miſeries, let vs
reſort to our lord Ieſus Chriſt. And foraſmuch as al loftineſſe, ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
&amp; vaunting muſt be beaten down by meanes of the Croſſe:
Let vs be truly crucified to the world, and let the world alſo be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
vnto vs. Now whereas S. Paule ſayth, that the world was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
to him, &amp; he to the world: it is true that he meeneth another
thing [than playn crucifying]. For therby he intended to ſhew yet
more ſtrongly, how we may renounce the world, and be ſeparated
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, namely by beeing crucified to ourſelues as in reſpect of the
world, that is to ſay, by mortifying al the luſts that fight one againſt
another within vs, &amp; haue too much force, &amp; inflame vs al wholly
like a burning fire, &amp; caſt vs heere &amp; there, bicauſe wee ſee that the
ſon of God was fayne to ſuffer ſo reprochful a death for vs. VVho
would now make his triumphes &amp; braueries in the world, when he
ſeeth that he which is the head of the Angels, &amp; vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g all

be mortified, and the death and paſsion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:23060:346"/>
worke ſo in our hearts, as our luſts may be no more ſo tickliſhe as
they haue bin. And that is for one poynt. Agayne, the world muſt
be crucified vnto vs. As howe? By eſteeming all worldly thinges
as chaffe and corruption (according as in very deede there is not
any thing in them whiche is not corruptible) in compariſon of
the ſpirituall benefites whiche Ieſus Chriſte hathe brought vs, and
whiche wee inioy by this meanes. For in very deede all worldly
things are corruptible. And moreouer, what elſe are all the things
whiche men couet ſo ſore and ſo vehemently that they bee vtterly
intangled in them, but ſnares that Satan hathe layde too catche
them withall? Are they not al of them illuſions &amp; trumperies? Yes
ſurely bee they. Seeing it is ſo then, let vs learne too ſet nothing
by the worlde, and too bee fully perſuaded and reſolued in oure
ſelues, that God is our freende, that he acknowledgeth vs for hys
children and heires, and that he bliſſeth vs, and that without thoſe
things wee bee miſerable. By this meanes then yee ſee wee maye
paſſe lightly through the world, and not be ſtayed not pulled back
by any thing, for wee will alwayes looke ſtill to that marke. VVee
knowe wee ought to make haſt too come too the place that God
calleth vs too: and if the affections of this world intangle vs, wee
ſhall be eſtraunged from our God by that meanes. Thus yee ſee in
effect what wee haue to remember vpon this ſtreyne. Now heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
S. Paule addeth, <hi>that in Ieſus Christ neyther Circumciſion nor Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion
auayleth any thing at all: but the newe creature.</hi> As if he
ſhould ſay, that they which dyd then trouble the Church, had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to moue them therto but their owne vayngloriouſneſſe. For
to ſtirre vp great troubles when the Church is not furthered nor
fareth the better by them, ſurely it ſheweth that men ſeeke nothing
elſe, but to ſet vp them ſelues in the roume of our Lorde Ieſus
Chriſt. For what ſhould be all our drift, but that the ſonne of God
might reigne among vs, and we be ruled by the worde of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and that his power might bee knowen, to the ende that bothe
great and ſmall might put their whole truſt in him? And therefore
according heerevnto, let vs bee reſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed in our whole life to obe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
God, and to ſubmit our ſelues to his word. For like as Gods ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple conſiſteth in fayth &amp; newneſſe of life: ſo faith importeth
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:23060:346"/>
that we ſhould do homage vnto God for all his benefites, that wee
ſhould haue our recourſe vnto him, that we ſhould blaze abrode his
praiſes, and that his holy name ſhould bee called vppon among vs.
That is the way for vs to be aduaunced to be Gods temple. Ageine
on the other ſide, we muſt alſo be renued in our life, &amp; by patience
learne to renounce ourſelues, and to dedicate ourſelues vnto God.
Lo what all teachers and preachers ought too procure. They then
which ſhoote not at that marke, do ſhew well ynough that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
is not to ſerue our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. So then S. Paule decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that nothing auaileth in Ieſus Chriſt, but the new creature: that
is to ſay, that wee muſt come too that poynt, according as wee haue
ſeene how he ſayd heretofore in the ſecond to the Corinthans,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. c. 17.</note> that
whoſoeuer will bee eſteemed in Ieſus Chriſt, muſt become a newe
creature. For if one man boaſt of his eloquence, another of his wit,
another of his great learning, and another of his trim behauiour or
goodly perſonage all this is but vanitie. Therfore let vs learne too
forſake our ſelues quite, and to forſake the world, and to gyue our
ſelues to him that hath bought vs, to the end that wee bee no more
looce. For it is good reaſon that Ieſus Chriſt hauing bought vs ſo
deerly, ſhould poſſeſſe vs and fully inioy vs. But that cannot bee
done, except euery of vs renounce himſelfe, and all things elſe that
may hold vs among men. Lo what we haue to marke. Now Sainct
Paule ſpeaketh of Circumciſion &amp; vncircumciſion, bycauſe that (as
yee haue ſeen afore) the diſputation and controuerſie which he had
was about the Ceremonies of the Lawe, which he comprehendeth
heere vnder the particular terme of Circumciſion. For the Iewes
would needes haue men to reteine ſtill all the ſhadowes &amp; figures
which ſerued but for a time. And therfore S. Paul ſcorning all thoſe
things, ſaith that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is not come to holde vs ſtill
in the old forworne figures, but that for as much as the veyle of the
temple is rent aſunder, and he hath in himſelfe the body and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of all the ſhadowes that were in the Lawe: men muſt holde
themſelues contented with him, and therfore Circumciſion was no

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> any thing worth. VVee ſhall profit our ſelues the more by
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> text, if we apply it to that which we ſaw yeſterday. For in pope
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they haue many pelting tryfles wherin they put all the truſt of
<pb facs="tcp:23060:347"/>
holineſſe. And if a man aske the Papiſts how they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſerue fauor
at Gods hand &amp; purchace remiſsion of their ſinnes, as they make
their boaſt: They will clap you in the mouth with their holywater,
their Tapers, their Sencings, their Organplayes, their chauntings,
their Pilgrimages &amp; with a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of other things. Agein they haue
their fooliſhe deuotions of trotting from altar to altar &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
to chappell. Moreouer they muſt buy good ſtore of Maſſes. To
be ſhort, all Gods ſeruice which is ſo termed in the popedome, is
but a maze &amp; gulfe of ſuperſtitions inuented of their owne heades.
But let vs conſider what thoſe things may auaile. God hath not
made mention of any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but men haue deuiſed them of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
yea or rather Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath whiſpered them into their eares, too
trouble Gods ſeruice withall. And yet notwithſtanding, the papiſts
imagin that there is neither Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor faith, nor ſeruice of God,
nor zeale, except a man be rauiſhed with their foolesbables. But S.
Paule ſpeaking euen of the ceremonies that God had ordeined in
his law, ſaith that they be henſforth as nothing. And why? For God
thinketh it ynough that we ſerue him with a pure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, &amp; that
hauing put our truſt in him, we call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, knowing that we hold
all things of him, and therwithal that we liue vprightly &amp; faithfull,
one with another, knowing that charitie is the fulfilling of the law
&amp; the end of the law: &amp; finally that we be ſo dedicated to our god,
as we may liue chaſtly &amp; in all holineſſe,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. c. 13.</note> waiting for the comming
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt as it is ſaid in the epiſtle to Titus. That the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is the firſt poynt of the holineſſe &amp; perfection which God ſheweth
vs by his worde. But the Papiſtes will on the contrary parte ſaye,
how ſo? what ſhall become of ſo many goodly deuotions? Shall
they all bee aboliſhed? Nay it were better that God ſhoulde bee
plucked out of Heauen. Lo what the doltiſhneſſe of the Papiſtes
is. But wee ſee howe Sainct Paule telleth vs, that if men bee ſo
ſore drowned in their owne fancies, as too ſurmize that they can
woorke woonders with God, and bee hild downe too their owne
pelting traſhe: all of it is nothi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
wee ſhoulde fall too examining of our lyues after ſuche a ſorte, as
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:23060:347"/>
wee myght bee vtter abaced in our ſelues: and therevpon offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too
God the ſpirituall ſacrifyces whyche wee owe vntoo him,
euen offering ourſelues too him to the end he may haue pitie and
mercie vppon our myſeries, and prouide remedie for them: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
bee ready too follow him whither ſoeuer he calleth vs, &amp; not
haue any other wiſedome than his only woorde, knowing that he
cannot bee ſerued with pompes and gay ſhowes of great glittering
too the worlde, but he is contented that wee ſhoulde ſimply offer
vp vnto him our thoughts and affections. And therfore it is long of
none but of our ſelues, that we knowe not what S Paule meeneth,
nor wheretoo this leſſon may ſerue vs. For it is certeine, that all
they which flatter not themſelues in their owne vyces, but looke
vp vntoo God, knowing that they muſt come before his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
ſeate will rid their handes of all glorie. And furthermore they will
conſider what God commaundes them by his word, how he wilbee
ſerued of vs, and what he alloweth, ſo as they ſhall no more bee in
daunger too bee deceyued, by thoſe tryfling toyes wherein the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
are plunged ouer heade and eares. For it is certeine that
whereas the Papiſtes torment themſelues (as wee ſee) to ſerue God:
it is too none other ende, but that he ſhould hold them acquit, and
they ſcape his hands, &amp; not be conſtreined to ſerue him as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth:
for they deſpiſe the whole law, &amp; yet in the meane while
haue a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of things to put into their account, which they would
haue God to allow of. But (as I ſaid) the end of all their dooings, is
to imagin themſelues diſcharged to Godward, and that he ſhould
not preſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſore, and yet notwithſtanding, that they might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their own ſwindge, &amp; take leaue to aſſoile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of al their
ſinnes, &amp; that God hauing I wote not what, (that is too ſay, ſome
faire countenance of their owne bringing) ſhoulde haue his mouth
ſhet and not bee ſo hardie as too ſpeake a worde. Now then wee ſee
whereat S. Paule amed. And he addeth in the wynding vp, <hi>Peace
and mercye bee vppon all thoſe that ſubmit themſelues too that rule, and
vppon Iſraell that perteyneth too God.</hi> In ſpeaking of the Rule, he
ſheweth that men may well ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> themſelues beleeue thys or that

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> yet in the meane whyle God wyl not bow, for he is not muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that he ſhould ſuffer himſelf to be led by our folyes, or be made
<pb facs="tcp:23060:348"/>
to ſwarue aſide: that is impoſsible ſaith S. Paul, and whatſoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall,
the Law that God hath ſtabliſhed muſt abide vnchaungeable as
he himſelf is. No doubt but we will admit this at the firſt ſight. For
who wil not willingliy abide that God ſhould be our ſuperior? Yea
and we perceiue ful wel, that to ſay the contrary were blaſphemie.
Yee ſee then that at a glaunce the whole world can wel graunt that
God ſhould be our ſouerein, and his lawe our rule, but therwithall
let vs ſee what libertie men take to themſelues. Euery man deuiſeth
one thing or other, and when he hath ſo done, he would haue all
other men too obſerue the ſame: euery man then woulde haue his
owne rule alone by himſelf. True it is that in the popedome all are
not of the rule of S. Frauncis or of S. Dominik: but yet for all that
there is not ſo doting an old foole, nor ſo ſuperſtitious an hypocrite
in the popedome but he hath his rule. Ageine, there is not ſo yong
a calfe but he hath his rule too. For all of them will ſay, that is my
deuotion. And their vſing of the worde <hi>Deuotion,</hi> is as much to ſay
with them, as, God is put backe, and I muſt haue my libertie to do
what I liſt, and God muſt hold himſelf contented with it. Thus wee
ſee how the diueliſh pride of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in fleeting to and fro, and in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
out at rouers, gadding now on the one ſide and now on the
other, is all one as if they made crooked and ouerthwart pathes, &amp;
that God ſhould therfore be faine to bow his rule, &amp; become ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to bend according to their fancies. So much the more therfore
behoueth it vs too marke well howe it is ſaid heere, that men may
well torment themſelues, but yet Gods rule ſhall continue ſtill, &amp;
hold on his courſe and keepe his pace. And what is this rule? It is
that it ſhould ſuffize vs to haue perfection in ſuch wiſe, as our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt ſheweth it vs in his Goſpell. Not that it can be fully in
vs: but that it behoueth vs too labour towardes it. For when wee
ſpeake of perfection it is not ment that we can atteine to it ſo long
as we liue: but that we muſt not ſwarue one way nor other, neither
to the right hand nor to the left, but keepe on ſtill to the mark that
God ſheweth vs. Yee ſee then that it behoueth vs to become newe
creatures: that is to ſay, wee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> renounce ourſelues and y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>lde
wholly vnto God. And ſith it is ſo: let vs bethinke vs too ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>
ourſelues to the ſayd rule, and to frame ourſelues therafter. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:23060:348"/>
man will ſoone ſet forth his legges and feete: but that ſhall be
but to fisk heere and there. And therefore to the end we ſtray not,
let vs learne to ſticke faſt to the things that God ſheweth and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs by his woorde. Now wheras S. Paule ſaith that peace and
mercie ſhal be vpon them: it is to ſhewe vs, that we may defye the
whole world, and that although wee be condemned by the follie of
men, yet wee neede not to paſſe for it, but may keepe on our race
ſtill: ſo God allow of vs, it is ſufficient. For ſurely we ſhewe that
wee yeeld him not the honor which is due to him, when wee be ſo
ſhaken downe by the fooliſhe iudgement of the worlde, and with
the opinions that men ſowe abrode of vs. If it bee ſayd of vs, theſe
fellowes behaue not themſelues well, and wee bee greeued at it, &amp;
thervpon would frame ourſelues to euery mans liking: it is certein
that in the meane while wee ſhall ſwarue aſide from God. So then
let vs marke well how S. Paule hath tolde vs heere, that althoughe
men condemne vs and finde fault in our doyngs: (as certeinly the
world will neuer agree with God:) yet notwithſtanding wee muſt
eſteeme it as nothing, and hold ourſelues contented that God bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
vs, and offereth vs heere all happineſſe vnder the word peace,
certifying vs that he will haue compaſsion vpon vs, how miſerable
ſoeuer we be. Although men ſhould ſpit in our faces, and although
there appeere no ſuch vertues in vs as were requiſite: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
if we keepe on our way ſtill vnto God, we ſhall euer finde
him pitifull to beare with our infirmities, and to releeue all our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.
VVhen wee be once at the poynt, it ought to ſuffyze vs. But
on the contrary part, let vs vnderſtand alſo that in bliſsing ſuch as
frame themſelues too the rule of God, the holy Ghoſt curſeth and
deteſteth, yea and vtterly ſhaketh off ſuch as runne at rouers after
that ſort, and ſet more by their owne fancies than by all lawes, and
will needes haue leaue to do what they liſt, and harden themſelues
in ſuch wiſe ageinſt Gods word. Although then that they be had in
reputatation to the worldward, and be in a maner drunken in their
owne pride and preſumption, and ſet more by themſelues than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>
would they ſhould: yet wee ſee that God doth alwayes holde
them as accurſed. So then the thing that wee haue to remember in
effect, is that we haue but one only rule, which is conteyned in the
<pb facs="tcp:23060:349"/>
Goſpell. And whither doth that rule leade vs? Euen to this, that we
bring not to God what we our ſelues think good, or what we haue
deuized of our own head: but that we ſubmit ourſelues wholly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him &amp; to his woord, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider alſo that ſeing we haue all perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, we muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with him alone,
ſpecially for aſmuch as we ſee God to be pitifull in hauing mercie
vpon vs, and that our life ſhall be happie and bliſſed of him, ſo we go
on foorth whither ſoeuer he calleth vs: Lyke as on the contrarie
parte, what ſoeuer opinion the worlde haue of vs, and how much
ſo euer it fauour vs, we muſt needes be accurſed, if we haue not the
rule that Sainct Paule ſpeaketh of heere. And hee addeth <hi>Iſraell
that belongeth too God:</hi> too ſhewe that they whiche ſerue God after
that ſpirituall maner, ſhall alwayes bee acknowledged of him for
his people. For Sainct Paules enemies agaynſt whom he diſputed
in all this Epiſtle, woulde needes haue all the Ceremonies kept, and
that they ſhoulde bee the markes of the Churche, as they ſurmy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.
Likewiſe in theſe dayes the Papiſtes woulde haue men too
keepe [Oyle and] Creame and diuers other things. But Sainct
Paules enemies had much more colour than the Papiſtes haue, and
their cace was much better in compariſon. Neuertheleſſe Sainct
Paule reiecteth all thoſe things, and ſayeth that God muzeth not
vppon any of thoſe ſmall toyes. True it is that he had ordeyned
the figures of the Lawe for a tyme, and they had alſo ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
in them, bycauſe they ſerued too leade the people too our Lord
Ieſus Chriſte. But nowe that wee haue the ſubſtance and pithe
of them in him: wee muſte gyue them quyte ouer. Then of
muche more lykelyhood they bee not the Iſraell of God, that ſet
foorth themſelues with greate pompe before men: but they that
haue the true marke of God. For when the Papiſtes ſpeake too vs
of the Churche, the Pope muſte needes bee there with his try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Crowne, the Biſhoppes muſte bee diſguyzed too playe their
enterlude, there muſte bee a ſorte of horned beaſtes, all muſte
gliſter, the Prieſtes and Monkes muſte bee preſent, and the eyes
of the ſimple ſoules muſte bee dazeled. Yee ſee then wherein the
Churche of God conſiſteth after the opinion of the Papiſtes: that
is too wit, in pompe and in tryfling and vnprofitable gewgawes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:23060:349"/>
And what ſay they too the Sacramentes? They muſt haue this and
that: and to bee ſhorte, they haue their ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kes whych they take to
bee good ſtuffe. But in the meane whyle let vs come too the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.
VVhat ſhall a man fynde there? Nothing but plaine ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
God will not haue the preachers of his word and the miniſters
of his ſacramentes too bee diſguiſed, nor too make ſo many murli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewes:
neither is it his will that his ſacramentes ſhould bee defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with mennes inuentions, for all that is nothing before God.
Therefore let vs beare well in mynde the definition of the true
Churche whiche Sainct Paule ſetteth downe heere, too the end we
bee not ſhaken when men ſay too vs. How nowe? See I pray you
how goodly things they bee. They bee ſo in deede according too
our naturall vnderſtandyng. For after as a man is fleſhly and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
ſo will he be alwayes inclined to followe the thing that caryeth
a fayre ſhewe to his ſenſes. But it is not for vs too iudge of Gods
ſeruice: we muſt ſticke too that which he hath determined, for his
ſentence cannot bee repealed: which is that wee muſt ſeeke al our
whole wyſedome in Ieſus Chriſt, which thing wee then doo when
wee obey him, and not elſe. Furthermore let vs vnderſtand that
he will not haue vs any longer tyed too the outward things which
he ordeined in the time of the Law: but he will haue vs to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with Ieſus Chriſt alone, &amp; with the perfection that is in him.
And therevpon wee haue alſo too marke, how he wiſheth <hi>the grace
of our Lord Ieſus Christ too bee with their ſpirit.</hi> For it ſheweth that
the worlde by reaſon of his vnthankefulneſſe: is not worthie too
ſee the benefites that are offered it in Ieſus Chryſt. The Goſpell
ſhall [perchaunce] bee preached ynoughe, but yet in the meane
whyle we ſee how euery man ſhrinkes back and wrytheth aſide, as
thoughe wee had conſpyred too forſake the good way of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
too caſt our ſelues intoo ruine and deſtruction. And what
is the cauſe thereof? It is for that wee haue oure myndes emptie,
and the Diuel fynds always entrance into vs, and thervpon temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
and prouoketh vs too flitter in the ayre. Too bee ſhort, vntill
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> grace of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt bee with our ſpirit, it is certeyn
that wee ſhall alwayes bee as wayeryug reedes, ſo as there ſhall bee
neither holde nor ſtay in vs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:23060:350"/>
Yee ſee then that the point wheretoo wee muſt come, is not onely
that God ſhould poure out his grace vppon vs, but that wee alſo
ſhoulde ſo receiue it in harte and minde, as it may take roote, not
to hold vs downe heere beneath, but to lift vp our affections &amp; all
our ſenſes vnto God. And bicauſe this doctrine can neuer paſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken
ageinſt, S. Paule doth heere defie all ſuch as lift vp the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
ageinſt it, and ſaith: <hi>Hereafter let no man trouble mee, for I beare the
markes of our Lord Ieſus Christ in my body.</hi> VVhen he ſpeaketh of
the markes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, he ſetteth them ageinſt all the
cotes armours of Princes, ageinſt all their Crownes and ſcepters, &amp;
ageinſt all the cogniſances or badges, which they haue too honour
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues withal, or to purchaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues any maieſtie or reuerence
to the worldward. VVhen a Prince intendeth to keepe his eſtate,
he will furniſh and apparell himſelf in ſuch ſort, as men ſhal not bee
able to looke vpon him without dazeling of their eyes. And they
do it, oftentimes bicauſe they haue not in themſelues wherwith to
win eſtimation, but are faine to borrow it elſe where: and ſo yee ſee
it is the faſhion of worldlings to ſet out themſelues with pomp and
brauerie, and to vſe many things to get themſelues reputation. To
be ſhort, the world doth alwayes borrow of others, bicauſe it hath
nothing but vanitie in it ſelfe. But S. Paule telleth vs that the marks
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt are much better, preciouſer, and of farre
greater Maieſtie, than all the things wherwith the world is ſo raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
as wee ſee. But by the way wee muſt ſee what he ment by theſe
markes.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. e. 24.</note> He hath ſhewed it [in another Epiſtle] heretofore, where
he ſayth that he had bin often whipped, that he had bin once ſtoned
that he had bin caſt in priſon, that he had ſuffered hunger &amp; thirſt,
and finally that he had bin as an outcaſt and forlorne perſon. True
it is that ſuch reprochfull things would bee ſhunned to the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
But S. Paule ſaith that they be much better, than all the honor
and pompe that could be deuiſed to be done vnto him, and that he
caryeth thoſe markes, to the end that men ſhould not ſtop him of
his courſe, nor hinder him of diſcharging his duetie. Now then wee
ſee how S. Paules meaning is, firſt that if we bee Chriſtians and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
true Church of God, we muſt keepe this order, namely that we bee
vnited togither, or that wee bee all as one. And howe is that? Not
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:23060:350"/>
euery man after his owne fancie, as wee ſee ſome doo, who beyng
of a froward minde cannot poſsibly frame themſelues to others, but
will needes keepe alone by themſelues, like ſhrewde horſes, and it
were too bee wiſhed that there were Hermitages and Cloyſters for
ſuch maner of people, when they will not by any meanes ioyne with
the order of the Churche. Therefore when they doo ſo ſeparate
themſelues from the companie of the faithfull through their owne
pryde, they muſt bee made the Diuelles Hermites and Cloyſterers.
But howſoeuer the worlde go, men ſee why they bee ſo hidden:
namely bycauſe the Diuell holdeth and poſſeſſeth them, and their
deſire is nothing elſe but too haue I wote not what a ſeparation, too
turne quyte and cleane away from God. But Sainct Paule telleth
vs, that the rule which wee muſt go by is this, namely that we make
Ieſus Chriſt our ſhooteanker, laboring too faſhion our ſelues lyke
vnto him, ſo that whenſoeuer he ſpeakes, wee may yeeld our ſelues
too his ſaying, and euery of vs keepe his order: and afterward that
wee help one another. For wee may well brag of perfection and of
this and that: but if wee indeuer not too further the buylding vp
of the ſpirituall temple, ſurely wee ſhall ſtill ſerue Satan, and bee as
ſlaues vnder his tyrannie. Therefore let vs learne to haue one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
among vs, tending all togither too our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.
And furthermore let ſuch as haue ſtoutneſſe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancie to walke
in Gods Lawe, defie all theſe Cockerelles that mount vp in pryde
after that faſhion, too bring in this or that. For Ieſus Chriſt will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
knowe his owne markes. That is too ſay, although wee bee
deſpyzed too the worldward, yet ſhall wee alwayes bee auowed too
bee Gods children. And therefore let vs go on forewarde ſtill, and
let ſuch as would ſtoppe vs, be ſure that God will beate them down,
as wee haue ſeene heeretofore. Yea and it is good reaſon that they
ſhould bee ſcattered and confounded,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. b. 12.</note> ſith they breake the vnitie of
the Churche: and for aſmuch as they will not imploy their ſeruice
(according too their abilitie) too the furtherance of the kingdome
of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rt muſte needes ouerthrowe them how
glorious or prydefull ſo euer they bee. Thus yee ſee what we haue
too gather vppon this text, if wee minde too continue in the inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and poſſeſsion of the benefites that haue bin purchaced for vs ſo
<pb facs="tcp:23060:351"/>
deerely, by the death and paſsion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and are
ſtill dayly offered vs by the Goſpell.</p>
            <p>And now let vs fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God
with acknowledgment of our faults, praying him that wee may bee
ſo wounded with them, as they may make vs too bewayle them and
too craue forgiueneſſe of them, and alſo too reforme them in ſuch
wiſe by true repentance, as wee may fight manfully agaynſt all the
vyces and corruptions of our fleſhe, till he haue ridde vs quyte and
cleane of them all, too clothe vs agayne with his owne rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
And ſo let vs all ſay, Almightie God heauenly father &amp;c.</p>
