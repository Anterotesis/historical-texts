         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHat can be more
ſeaſonable, then
at this time, when
all the world is ſick of
Diſcontentment, to give
counſels &amp; Receits of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation:</hi>
Perhaps the
Patient will think it a time
ill choſen for Phyſick, in the
midſt of a Fit: But in this
<pb facs="tcp:109547:4"/>
caſe we muſt do as we may.
I confeſs, I had rather have
ſtayed till the Paroxiſm were
happily over; that ſo the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
being ſomwhat ſetled, I
might hope for the more kind<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
operation of this wholſom
Medicine. But, partly my
age &amp; weakneſs, deſpairing
to out-live the publick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper;
and partly my
judgment (croſſing the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
opinion for the ſeaſon of
ſome kind of Receipts) have
now put me upon this ſafe
and uſeful Preſcription:
God is my witneſs, that I
wrote this in the depth of
<pb facs="tcp:109547:4"/>
mine own afflictions, (the
particulars whereof, it were
unſeaſonable to trouble the
world withal) as one that
meant to make my ſelf my

my ſelf that courſe of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that I preſcribe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and, as one, who by

us; it ſhall be happy yet, if
we may find inward peace
in our boſoms: which ſhall
be, if we can reconcile our
ſelves to our offended God;
and calm our ſpirits to a
meek undergoing of thoſe
ſufferings, which the divine
Providence hath thought fit
to meaſure forth unto us:
This is the main drift of
this enſuing labour. Now
the ſame God, who hath, in
theſe bluſtring times, put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my heart theſe quiet
thoughts of holy <hi>Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
bleſs them in every

            <p>Were our afflictions long,
and our comforts rare and
ſhort, we had yet reaſon to
be thankful; the leaſt is
more then God owes us:
but now, when if heavineſs
endure for a night, joy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in the morning, and
dwells with us, ſo, that
ſome fits of ſorrow are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed

ſmall grievances, out of

            <p>But if we ſhall caſt up our
eyes to Heaven, and there
behold the glorious remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration

how ſhall we contemn
the worſt that earth can
do unto us? There, there
is glory enough to make
us a thouſand times more

are capable to endure; Yea,
if this Earth were Hell, and
Men Devils, they could not
inflict upon us thoſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which might hold
any equality with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which ſhall be revealed;
and even of the worſt of
them we muſt ſay with the
bleſſed Apoſtle; Our light
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109547:50"/>
affliction which is but for a

on the right hand of God;
do we think he cared ought

Oh poor impotent

ſhall find a few barly loaves,

proviſion of our Saviours
train: Yea, there we find
the moſt glorious Apoſtle,
the great Doctor of the
Gentiles, employing his
hands to feed his belly;
Buſily ſtitching of skins for
his Tent-work: Yea, what
do we look at any or all of
theſe, when we ſee the Son
of God, the God of all the
World, in the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant?
Not a Cratch to cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle

and he that could command
Heaven and Earth, can ſay,
The Foxes have holes,<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 20.</note> the

Who now can complain
of want, when he hears his
Lord and Saviour but thus
Provided for? He could
have brought down with
him a Celeſtial Houſe, and
have pitcht it here below,
too glorious for earthen eyes
to have lookt upon: He
could have commanded all
the precious things that lie
ſhrouded in the bowels of
the Earth, to have made
up a Majeſtical Palace for
him, to the dazling of the
eyes of all beholders: He
could have taken up the
ſtatelieſt Court that any
Earthly Monarch poſſeſſed,

now having laid him on the
ground, can Triumphingly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:109547:57"/>
ſay, O Death, where is thy
ſting? O Grave, where is
thy Victory? Five ſmooth
pebles there are, which if
we cary in our ſcrip, wee
ſhall be able to quel, not
only the power of Death,
but the terrour too.</p>
            <p>Whereof the firſt is a
ſure apprehenſion of both
the unavoidable neceſſity,
and certain benefit of death:
A neceſſity, grounded upon
the juſt and eternal Decree
of Heaven:<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 27.</note> It is appointed
to all men once to die; and
what a madneſs were it,
for a Man to think of an
exemption from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
condition of mankind?
Mortality is, as it were, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
to our Nature; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could we have had our
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:109547:57"/>
Souls but upon the terms
of a re-delivery, when they
ſhall be called for; If the
Holieſt Saints, or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
Monarchs ſped other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
we might have ſome
colour of repining: Now,
grieve if thou wilt, that
thou art a Man; grieve not,
that being Man, thou muſt
die.</p>
            <p>Neither is the benefit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to the neceſſity; Lo
here the remedy of all our
cares, the Phyſick for all
our maladies, the reſcue
from all our fears and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
earneſtly ſued for by
the painful, dearly wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to the diſtreſſed: Yea,
lo here the Cherub that
keeps the Gate of Paradiſe;
there is no entrance, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:109547:58"/>
his hand: In vain do
we hope to paſs to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Heaven, any other way
then through the Gates of
Death,</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of a well-led Life;
Guiltinefs will make any
Man cowardly, unable to
look danger in the face,
much more Death; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the innocent is bold as
a Lion: What a difference
therefore there is betwixt a
Martyr, and a Malefactor;
this latter knows he hath
done ill, and therefore if he
can take his Death but pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
it is well; the former
knows he hath done well,
and therfore takes his Death
not patiently onely, but
chearfully.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:109547:58"/>
But becauſe no mortal
Man can have ſo innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
led his Life, but that he
ſhall have paſſed many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
againſt his moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Righteous God; here
muſt be, Thirdly, a final
Peace firmly made betwixt
God and the Soul. Two
Powerful Agents muſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
in it; a Lively Faith,
and a ſerious Repentance;
for thoſe Sins can never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
againſt us, that are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
off with our tears; and
being juſtified by Faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 1.</note> we
have Peace with God,
through our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt. Now, if we have
made the Judge our Friend,
what can the Sergeant do?</p>
            <p>The fourth is the Power,
and efficacy of Chriſts
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109547:59"/>
Death applyed to the Soul:
Wherefore dyed he, but that
we might Live? Wherefore
would he, who is the Lord
of Life, die, but to ſanctifie,
ſeaſon, and ſweeten death to
us? Who would go any
other way then his Saviour
went before him? Who can
fear that enemy, whom his
Redeemer hath Conquered
for him? Who can run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from that Serpent,
whoſe ſting is pulled out?
Oh Death! my Saviour
hath been thy Death, and
therefore thou canſt not be
mine.</p>
            <p>The fifth, is the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
expectation, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a certain reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and an immediate Glory:
I do but lay me down to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109547:59"/>
my reſt, I ſhall ſleep quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and riſe gloriouſly: My
Soul, in the mean time, no
ſooner leaves my body, then
it enjoys God; It did lately
through my bodily Eyes ſee
my ſad Friends, that bad me
farewel with their Tears;
now it hath the bliſſe-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Viſion of God: I am
no ſooner lanched forth,
then I am at the Haven,
where I would be; Here is
that which were able to
make amends for a thouſand
Deaths; a Glory, Infinite,
Eternal, Incomprehenſible.</p>
            <p>This Spiritual Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhall ſufficiently furniſh
the Soul for her encounter
with her laſt Enemy; ſo as
ſhe ſhall not only endure,

although there were no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
pain in the diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
It will be requiſite for
us, ſeriouſly to conſider the
ſtate of this conjunction; &amp;
to enquire what good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the one of them doth to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109547:60"/>
the other, in their continued
union; for which they
ſhould be ſo loth to part:
And here we ſhall find that
thoſe two, however united
to make up one Perſon, yet
(as it fals out in Croſs mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches)
they are in continual
domeſtique jars one with
the other, and entertain a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
familiar kind of Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
betwixt themſelves;<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 17.</note> For
the Fleſh luſteth againſt the
Spirit, and the Spirit againſt
the Fleſh, and theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
the one to the other.
One ſays well, that if the
Body ſhould implead the
Soul, it might bring many
foul impeachments againſt
it; and ſue it for many great
injuries done to that Earthly
part: And the Soul again
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109547:61"/>
hath no fewer quarrels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Body: Betwixt
them both there are many
brawles, no Agreement. Our
Schools have reckoned up
therefore eight main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities,
which the
Soul hath cauſe to complain
of in her conjunction with
the Body: whereof the firſt
is the defilement of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Sin, wherewith the
Soul is not tainted as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
alone, from the pure
hands of its Creator, but
as it makes up a part of a
Son of <hi>Adam,</hi> who brought
this guilt upon Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
ſo as now this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
which we call Man,
is corrupt:<note place="margin">Job. 14. 4.</note> Who can bring
a clean thing out of that
which is unclean? Saith
<hi>Job.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:109547:61"/>
The ſecond is a proneneſs
to Sin, which, but by the
meeting of theſe partners
had never been; the Soul,
if ſingle, would have been
innocent; thus matched,
what Evil is it not apt to
entertain? An ill conſort is
enough to poyſon the beſt
diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>The difficulty of doing
well is the third; for how
averſe are we by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
from any thing
that is good; This clog hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
us from walking round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the ways of God: The
good that I would do,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 19.</note> I do
not, ſaith the choſen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
            <p>The fourth is the dulneſs
of our underſtanding,
and the dimneſs of our
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109547:62"/>
mental Eyes, eſpecially in
the things pertaining unto
God; which now we are
forced to behold through
the vail of Fleſh: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we mis-know, the fault
is in the mean, through
which we do imperfectly
diſcover them.</p>
            <p>The fifth is a perpetual
impugnation, and ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
either part labouring
to oppoſe and vanquiſh the
other. This field is fought
in every mans boſom,
without any poſſibility of
peace, or truce, till the laſt
moment of diſſolution.</p>
            <p>The ſixth is the racking
ſolicitude of cares, which
continually diſtract the Soul,
not Suffering it to reſt at
eaſe, whiles it carries this
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:109547:62"/>
Fleſh about it.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh is the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
of paſſions which
daily bluſter within us, and
raiſe up continual Tempeſts
in our Lives, diſquieting our
Peace, and threatning our
Ruine.</p>
            <p>The eight is the retarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Glory; for Fleſh,
and Blood cannot inherit
the Kingdom of God; we
muſt lay down our load if
we would enter into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 4.</note>
The ſeed cannot fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
unleſs it Die. I cannot
blame Nature if it could
wiſh not to be unclothed,
but to be clothed upon: But
ſo hath the Eternal Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
Ordered, that we
ſhould firſt lay down, ere
we can take up; and be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:109547:63"/>
deveſted of Earth, ere we
can partake of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Now then, ſith ſo many
&amp; great diſcommodities do

Whereof the firſt is true Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
under-valuing our

that he thinks every thing
too good for him, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

and worthy of the

not but ſit down thankful

As contrarily, the

makes God his debter; looks

Give me a man
therefore, that is vile in his

what belongs to that Sin
whereof he is guilty; this
Man ſhall think it a Mercy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109547:65"/>
that he is any where out of

reckon eaſie corrections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

the proud beggar is ready
to throw Gods almes at his
Head, and ſwels at every
laſh, that he receives from
the Divine Hand. Not
without great cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth the Royal Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
oppoſe the patient in
Spirit, to the proud in Spirit;
for the proud Man can no
more be patient, then the
patient can be diſcontent
with whatſoever hand of

the proud Man beſide his

But the meek Spirit is incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
and ſo throughly

Oh our infidelity, if we

guilty of our unquietneſs;
Every Man would be, and
have more then he is; and

It is not for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

            <p>What a cumber it is for

clogg'd with a weighty ſhel,
which we cannot drag after

that we can have no uſe of

It was the word of that old

a noble, and witty family,
<hi>Mediocria firma:</hi> There is
neither ſafety, nor true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in exceſs: It was a
wiſe and juſt anſwer of
<hi>Zenò</hi> the Philoſopher, who
reproving the ſuperfluity of
a Feaſt, and hearing by way
of defence that the Maker
of it was a great Rich Man,
and might well ſpare it, ſaid;
If thy Cook ſhall over-ſalt

If our appetite cary

taſted (as <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſt

the quantity offends, even
where the Food is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome;
and if heed be
not taken, one bit draws on
another, till Nature be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid;
Both Pleaſures and
profits (if way be given to
them) have too much power
to debauch the mind, and
to work it to a kind of inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiableneſs;

to the firſt unruly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

            <p>It is for the Chriſtian
Heart to be taken up with

there can be no danger of
immoderateneſs: Theſe are
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:109547:80"/>
the Holy longings after

            <p>Such is our ſelf-love, that

that cannot endure a frown,

he that doubles under a

that good Martyr pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
his whole Body for the

<hi>Seneca,</hi> in one of

that no proviſion was ready
for him; finding more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
in his own quiet

then trouble in that unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs:
And thus, ſhould we

Thoſe that promiſed

            <p>To this purpoſe, it will be
not a little expedient, to
thwart our appetite in thoſe

much delight; and to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
our curioſity in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
of thoſe Contentments,
which we too eagerly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted:
It was a noble and
exemplary Government of
theſe paſſions, which we
find in King <hi>David,</hi> who
being extreamly thirſty, and
longing for a ſpeedy refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
could ſay; <hi>Oh that one

but when he ſaw that
Water purchaſed with the
hazard of the lives of three
of his Worthies, when it was
brought to him, he would
not drink it, but poured it
out unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>Have I a mind to ſome
one curious diſh above the
reſt? I will put my knife to
my Throat, and not humour
my Palate ſo far as to taſte
of it: Do I receive a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of News from a farr
Countrey, over-night? It
ſhall keep my pillow warm

importunate <hi>recreations</hi> call
me away? They ſhall, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

Out of this ground
it was, that the ancient Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries

obſerved ſuch auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
