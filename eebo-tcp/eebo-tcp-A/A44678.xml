            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have perused the Papers which you sent me, and
find, as far as I can recollect, they contain in them
the Substance of what was delivered: With no more
mistakes than is usual, in writing from the mouth of
one who is not of the slowest speakers.</p>
            <p>Some things besides, which the limits of the time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
not to be spoken (having some short memorials of
them by me) I have added, conceiving they might,
also, contribute towards the good end you proposed to
your self, in so earnestly desiring this publication,
the assisting of their patience, and their good and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid
thoughts of God, who are exercis'd under Long and
Languishing Distempers. The observations which your
<hi>Profession</hi> hath occasion'd you to make <hi>in the cases
of many others,</hi> hath, I doubt not, let you see the need
of somewhat to this purpose; otherwise the example
<pb facs="tcp:56414:3"/>
you have had so long before your eyes of so calm and
compos'd a temper <hi>in this excellent relative of yours,</hi>
might have made you <hi>less apprehensive</hi> how great
an addition a fretful, unquiet spirit is, both to the
<hi>Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Affliction</hi> of a <hi>Sickly State.</hi> I am sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
your own affliction is great in the loss you now
sustain. The relief will be great, and suitable; which
the forethoughts of that State will afford, <hi>where
they neither Marry, nor are given in Marriage,
but are as the Angels of God in Heaven.</hi> I am,</p>

               <bibl>LUKE 13. 16.</bibl>
               <q>And ought not this woman, being a daughter
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom Satan hath bound,
lo these eighteen years, be loosed from this
bond, on the Sabbath day?</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>YOU will soon see the occasion, and connexion of these
words, by viewing over the whole Paragraph to which
they belong,</hi> verse 10. And he was teaching in one of the
Synagogues on the Sabbath. 11. And behold there was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and could in no wise lift up her self. 12. When Jesus saw her,
he said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. 13. And
he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and
glorified God. 14. And the Ruler of the Synagogue answered with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
because that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath day, and said
unto the people, There are six days, in which men ought to work, in them
therefore come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day. 15. The
Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each of you
on the Sabbath loose his Ox and his Ass from the stall, and lead him
away to watering? 16. And ought not this woman, being a daughter
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom Satan hath bound, lo these eighteen years, be loosed
from this bond on the Sabbath day? 17. And when he had said these
things, all his adversaries were ashamed; and all the people rejoyced
for all the glorious things that were done by him.</p>
            <p>Inasmuch as our blessed Lord spake these words, and did the
thing which occasion'd them, upon that which was, with the <hi>Jews,
their Sabbath day;</hi> it cannot be unfit for us to consider them <hi>upon
ours,</hi> they so fitly leading us to consider also, another release
wrought <hi>for a daughter of Abraham</hi> too on <hi>our Sabbath day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was formerly told you <hi>upon what occasion,</hi> and I doubt not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56414:4"/>
but you generally know, upon <hi>whose account</hi> we were to divert
from our usual course and Subject at this time. Nor could any
thing have been more suitable to the present occasion; for not
only was this Daughter of <hi>Abraham</hi> releas'd from her Infirmity
upon the Sabbath day; but the time, wherein it remain'd upon
Her (in a great and manifold complication) was (as her sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving
Consort hath acquainted me, and who therefore recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
this Subject) precisely <hi>about eighteen Years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ('tis true) disagreements between <hi>our case,</hi> and
<hi>that case in the Text,</hi> which do not therefore render both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
less instructive to us, but the more. And, to make way to
what may be so, you must here take notice, that these Words
are part of our Lords Defence of what he had done, in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
this work of Mercy, wherein what he says is <hi>justly severe,</hi>
and very <hi>clearly convictive.</hi> It is very deserved and just severity,
that he call'd him, who cavil'd in the case, by his own true
name, <hi>thou hypocrite.</hi> He, under pretence of <hi>great sanctity,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
the <hi>highest enmity,</hi> even against our blessed Lord himself,
who came (being sent) upon the holiest and kindest design in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this World. The zeal which he pretends for the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Sabbath, could not be the thing that he did really
mean, or that acted him in this case. For it was not likely he
could be ignorant of what was a known adjudg'd Case among
the <hi>Jews</hi> (as some of their own Rabbies<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Maimon. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitut. de fundam. c. 5. 9. cum Abrav. N. 13, 14. And, as our own Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> says upon that question of our Lords; <hi>Is it lawful to heal upon the Sabbath day?</hi> (quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting divers more of theirs to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,) he violated not the Sabbath so much as their own Cannons allow'd. See <hi>his Works,</hi> Vol 2.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
us) <hi>that all needful endeavours ought to be
used for the cure of the sick upon the Sabbath day.</hi>
So as that he very well knew, no rule could
be broken in this case. But this he reckons
was somewhat plausible, and he pleases himself
in it, that he could tell how to vent his spite
against Christ and Christianity, under a <hi>mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shew</hi>
of great Sanctimony. And our Lord justly
calls him what indeed he was, when he would
thus seem what he was not. It was not that
he cared for Religion, or for any thing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Sanctity, of which a due and just observation
of the Sabbath was a real part; but that he had
a mind, as far as conveniently he could, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
his displeasure at that evidence and lustre,
wherewith the glorious works our Lord wrought evinc'd him to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56414:4"/>
be <hi>the Messiah;</hi> while yet he was struck with that awe of him, that
he adventures not to direct his reproof to <hi>him,</hi> but <hi>the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is here by the way to be noted that <hi>they</hi> were not thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
to our Lord, and the Religion he was about to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.
No, but this Ceremonious Bigot, <hi>a Ruler of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,</hi>
was the ill-pleased, disaffected Person.</p>
            <p>I shall not trouble you with the discussion what sort of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
it was that belonged to that Office. Some well acquainted
with the <hi>Jewish writings</hi> say, that the <hi>Ruler of the Synagogue</hi> was
not wont himself to officiate, as Minister <hi>in Sacris;</hi> but his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
was <hi>circa Sacra,</hi> to regulate the Administration. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
not his <hi>Power,</hi> but his <hi>ill-will,</hi> and enmity against Christ,
and true Religion. The people, in the mean time, throng'd
after him in Multitudes, and beheld the great works he wrought
with joy, and glorified God. Only where was <hi>more power,</hi> and
probably <hi>more knowledge,</hi> there was more too of a peevish spite
and envy, that the interest of our Lord was, <hi>by so proper means,</hi>
growing in the World. A sad (and not a new) thing! that
Religion should have most opposition, whence it should have
most of countenance, and advantage to dilate and spread it self.
<hi>Do any of the Rulers believe on him?</hi> But the people (whom
they despised, and pronounc'd <hi>accursed</hi> for that reason) were
more apt and forward to receive the Gospel, <hi>Joh. 7. 48, 49. The
more there is of light, unaccompany'd with a pious Inclination, the
higher, the more intense and fervent, the finer and more subtle is the
venome and malice against Christ, and real Christianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Lord was not diverted from his kind and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
design, by any such obstructions as these. His love
triumphs over them; and he makes that discovery of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
which could not but carry the clearest conviction with
it, as his reproof carry'd the brightest justice. Why, what,
saith he, <hi>Do not any of you loose an Ox, or an Ass from the Stall on
the Sabbath day? and shall not I loose a daughter of</hi> Abraham?
'Tis like she was <hi>a Daughter of</hi> Abraham, not only as being a
<hi>Jewess,</hi> but as being a <hi>believer;</hi> as being, according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
language, of <hi>Abrahams Seed,</hi> in the <hi>Spiritual</hi> sense, as well
as the <hi>natural;</hi> and he was the more peculiarly compassionate
upon that account; and yet more, because her ail proceeded
from the malignant influence of the Devil. Shall not I loose
such a one whom <hi>Satan</hi> hath bound, that great enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56414:5"/>
Why should not I shew my self so much the more a Friend,
by how much the more he appears an Enemy, and give the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
relief the matter can admit?</p>
            <p>'Tis very true indeed, his compassion was never to incline him
to do unfit and unseasonable things, or things that were no
way subservient to his principal end. But such a subserviency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
supposed, his relief must be with the earliest, to day, before
morrow, though it were the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>And so now you have the ground of discourse plainly in view
before you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Devil cannot be more maliciously intent to afflict those that
relate to God (even, when it is in his power, with bodily distempers)
than our Lord Jesus is compassionately willing to relieve them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
distinction of time, when it shall be consistent with, and subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to his higher and greater purposes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In speaking to this, I shall</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Touch briefly upon what is here exprest in the Text,</hi> the
hand that Satan may have in the Afflictions, yea and in the bodily
distempers of men, and even of them that belong to God among them.</p>
            <p>2. What hand our Lord Jesus has in their relief or releasement.</p>
            <p>3. How far we may understand, or may reasonably expect his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
to influence him in such cases.</p>
            <p>4. I shall shew that however the release be wrought, it is done very
mercifully towards them that belong peculiarly to God. And so make use
of all.</p>
            <p>1. Somewhat briefly as to that first query, What hand it is
supposable the Devil may have in the afflictions of men, and more
particularly of them that belong to God; as this woman being a
Daughter of <hi>Abraham</hi> was to be considered, as one within the
compass of Gods Covenant, and not improbably as one, that, in
the strictest sense, was in Covenant with God.</p>
            <p>1. It is plain in the Text, the Devil had a direct hand in her
distemper, called <hi>a Spirit of infirmity.</hi> There were more evident,
and more frequent instances of this kind in that time, the Devil
<hi>then</hi> setting himself more openly to contend against the incarnate
Son of God, upon his more open appearance to rescue and recover
an Apostate World from under his Dominion and Tyranny. But
as to more ordinary cases we may further consider,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:56414:5"/>
2. That the Devil is a constant enemy to mankind, apt and
inclin'd, as far as God permits him, to do men all the mischief he
can.</p>
            <p>3. That as he first introduc't sin into the World, so he hath, by
consequence, all the calamities that afflict it. There had been no
Death, Sickness, or Distemper upon the bodies of men, but from
hence. Consider the Devil therefore, as the Prince and Leader of
the Apostasie, who first drew man into transgression, and thereby
render'd him liable to the Justice of his Maker, turn'd his Paradise
into a desart, and a region of immortal undecaying life, into a
Valley of sickly Languishings and death it self; So may he said
to have had a (remoter) hand, in binding not only this Daughter
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but every child of <hi>Adam</hi> in all the Afflictions, Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and Distempers which befall them here, and finally in the
bonds of Death too, whereof he is said to <hi>have had the
power.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 14, 15.</note> Tho the Children of the <hi>second Adam,</hi> (with
whom, for this purpose he was partaker of Flesh and Blood, and
became with them a <hi>Son of Abraham,</hi> and of his Seed) are, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so bound, releas'd and made free, both from Death, and the
bondage of fearing it, to which they were otherwise Subject all
their days, as we shall further see anon.</p>
            <p>4. Tho God do not ordinarily allow him <hi>more power,</hi> yet we may
well suppose him to have <hi>more malice</hi> against <hi>these Children of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
(who thereby pass into the account of his own Children
also) being more intent upon vexing and afflicting, whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
or suspects he shall never be able finally to destroy; and
always apt to use all the power shall be allowed him to this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
purpose. We find that the afflictions of the people of
God, <hi>in other kinds,</hi> and even in <hi>this kind,</hi> are expresly, often, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the Devil. In other kinds, <hi>Satan shall cast some of you
into prison,</hi> Revel. 2. 10. And divers think <hi>that thorn in the flesh</hi>
which the Apostle suffered, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. was some acute bodily
pain, and he says expresly, it was <hi>a messenger of Satan sent to
buffet him.</hi> He, 'tis said, <hi>smote</hi> Job with the <hi>tormenting boils</hi> that
afflicted him so grievously, and so long, and brought the other
calamities upon him that you read of in his Story.</p>
            <p>5. And again it is further to be considered, that whereas in all
Diseases, the Morbisick Matter, whether immediate in Mens
Bodies, or remoter in the incompassing Air, differs not from
other matter, otherwise than only in the various disposition, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56414:6"/>
and motion of parts and particles whereof it is made up;
inasmuch as the Devil is called the <hi>Prince of the power of the Air,</hi>
we know nothing to the contrary, but that he may frequently
so modifie that, as that it shall have most pernicious influences up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Bodies of Men, and upon those especially, so far as God
permits, that he has any greater malice against.</p>
            <p>6. And again, (supposing this) it is not a stranger thing that
God should permit him to afflict the Bodies of them that belong
to him, than to disturb their minds. Sure their Bodies are not
more Sacred. If we should suppose that he may some way or
other perniciously agitate the humours in humane Bodies, 'tis no
harder a supposition than that he should so variously from the
images in the fancy, by which he tempts: for herin surely he
comes nearer us, and is more inward to us.</p>
            <p>7ly. Nor is it less supposable that God should, in some
instances. permit the Devils to follow their inclinations in
afflicting his people, than wicked men to follow theirs, which,
in the general, carry them to the same thing; when he
knows how to turn the one to after-advantage, as well as
the other.</p>
            <p>But we have no ground to think, notwithstanding all this, that
the wisdom and goodness of Providence will ordinarily permit
that this Agency of the Devil, in the mentioned cases, should
be altogether in a contra-natural way; but only, by so moving
and acting with natural causes, that he may be also obviated,
through the ordinary blessing of God, by natural means, and
causes too. Much less is it reasonable that diseases should be
themselves reckon'd very <hi>Devils,</hi> as was the opinion of the Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks
of old, wherein they much concurred with the <hi>Manichees,</hi>
and whom, together with them, the more honest-minded Pagan
<hi>Plotinus</hi> so copiously confutes; (though that that was more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
a common Opinion, the <hi>Septuagints</hi> rendring the word
that signifies <hi>Plague</hi> by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in several places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
seems to intimate. But the commonness of such an Opinion
in a <hi>dark time,</hi> signifies nothing to sway ours this way or that.)</p>
            <p>But whatsoever hand the Devil may be supposed to have in
their afflictions, or sicknesses that belong to God, we are in
the</p>
            <p>2d. place sure, That our Lord Jesus has a most kind hand
(whensoever it is) in their release, which though it were here
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56414:6"/>
in a more extraordinary and immediate way, and besides the
course of nature; the disparity in this case signifies nothing to the
lessening of the favour, towards those whom he vouchsafes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in other cases; for the influence that he has in ordinary
cases is as truly divine. If the cure of a diseased person be wrought
by his blessing upon ordinary natural means, his cooperating with
nature is less amazing, but not less effectual, or less kind; as also
the efflux from God is (for his own part) as real, when he
works with second causes, as without them; and as immediately
reaches the effect, in both the senses of immediateness, whereof
so much noise is made in the Schools.</p>
            <p>And we must further know our Lord Christ is now the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Regent of all Nature, even as he is <hi>the Christ,</hi> the world
being devolv'd into his hands, and all power being given to him
both in Heaven and Earth. <hi>He is Lord of all.</hi> When therefore
any of you are sick, it is by his disposal, if you are recovered out
of that sickness. Nor is his Agency less or lower, whether it be
by blessing a Medicine, or working a Miracle. His power and
love are the same either way. And know, there is an honour,
and acknowledgment due from Christians to their great crucifi'd
Lord, who hath founded a dominion over this world in his blood,
<hi>who died, and revived, and rose again, that he might be Lord of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and dead.</hi> Therefore you are to reckon you are beholden to
Christ for all your recoveries, and all your refreshings that you
meet with amidst the many infirmities and frailties of this your
present mortal state.</p>
            <p>And if the release be by death, as the case is, which we now
have specially to do with, that universal power of his <hi>over all lives,</hi>
must be understood immediately to reach to that case too. It is
he that measures lives, that lengthens them out, and cuts them
shorter at his own pleasure. And, as to those that are more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly
his own, it is a more peculiar, and favourable superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendency
that he has over that affair, even of their very dying.
Their death is precious in his sight. He with a most gentle ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
hand unties the knot of <hi>Man,</hi> releases and receives the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodging
Soul. <hi>Lord Jesus receive my Spirit,</hi> as dying <hi>Stephen</hi> speaks.
But,</p>
            <p>3ly. We are to consider how far our Lord Jesus his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
<hi>concerns him</hi> in such cases; or wherein <hi>that</hi> may move
him to interpose in them so, as in this case he did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:56414:7"/>
And here two things are to be asserted.</p>
            <p>1st. That his compassion has not <hi>supream and principal</hi> influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in this Case.</p>
            <p>2ly. That yet it hath <hi>real</hi> influence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it hath not supream or principal influence in such Cases.</hi>
And this doth really require to be more principally insisted
on, as of greater importance to narrow, terrene minds, that
are apt to measure all things <hi>by themselves,</hi> and in reference to
their own little Sphear and compass; and <hi>to themselves</hi> only
in their <hi>present State,</hi> as they are inhabitants of this Minute
Spot of Earth; as if all things ought to bend, and yield, to
their present convenience, and accommodation <hi>here;</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they wonder when they are sick, and in pain, God doth
not presently relieve and ease them; and think they should do
so, for any Friend or Neighbour, if it were in their Power.</p>
            <p>Know, therefore, 'twas not from compassion, as the <hi>solitary,</hi>
or as the <hi>chief</hi> inducement, that our Lord did work this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
for this Daughter of <hi>Abraham.</hi> That cannot be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
For he can never be understood to make <hi>a creature,</hi> and
the advantages of a Creature his <hi>Supream</hi> end. That would
have been to invert the order of things, to dethrone God,
and deifie man, and had been, it self, a real sort of that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
which was one, among the many horrid evils, which he
purposely came to redress, and give remedy to in this apostate
degenerate World. He had a greater inducement, <hi>i. e.</hi> That
he might diffuse the Glory of God among the Children of
Men; and that he might give evidence thereby, to the Truth
of his own Mission, and prove most convincingly, that he was
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the very Person that was anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and sent about that great undertaking, to recover Gods
rights in this lapsed World, to bring about a reconciliation
between God and Men. And upon this account, when he
wrought cures upon mens Bodies, it was out of an higher com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
to their Souls.</p>
            <p>And tho' even this it self of saving Mens Souls was not
his highest design, but the <hi>Glory of God</hi> (as we shall see fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by and by) yet it being <hi>truly</hi> design'd by him, and <hi>more
principally</hi> than their bodily ease and relief, <hi>this</hi> was an apt
means to this his lower end. For, whereas, in order to this,
he was to manifest himself a <hi>Divine Saviour,</hi> 'twas requisite he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56414:7"/>
should give a joint, and an equal demonstration of the two
things, which his being so implies, his <hi>Godlike Power, and Love.</hi>
The former <hi>alone</hi> it did not serve his purpose to shew, which
he might have shewn as much by inflicting plagues on mens
bodies, as working cures, by striking them with blindness,
lameness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as by giving them sight and soundness. But it
was necessary to his end, his Miracles should be beneficent,
and that he should (as it is elsewhere said in the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Story he did) <hi>go about doing good,</hi> and not make men
afraid of him, by shewing the Power of a God in destructive
strokes and judgments; but, (which became a Saviour) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
a <hi>divine good-will towards men,</hi> and thereby make his way
into their Hearts, bring them to <hi>understand,</hi> and <hi>own</hi> a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and, <hi>as such,</hi> to fall in, and comply with his kind design
towards them. And this, as it serv'd to exalt God in the
World, chiefly induc'd him to work this present cure. If his
compassion towards a poor afflicted woman, labouring under
bodily infirmity, were his principal inducement, if therefore,
she must be presently cured out of hand, even on the Sabbath
day, because she had been now bound eighteen years; Why, I
pray you, was she to have been bound eighteen years? or why
bound at all? His Divine Knowledge of the case, and power to
have redrest, or prevented it, had as well serv'd his compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
inclination long before. Or why was not such a course for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
set on foot, and continued in the world, that men might
be cured of Blindness, Deafness, Lameness, Feavers, Dropsies,
or whatsoever other Maladies, easily, and by speaking a word,
in any former time? Why was it deferr'd to this time? Or
why hath not such a course been kept afoot ever since his
ascension? Hath Heaven render'd him less merciful, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate?
Is it so unkind and ill-natur'd a place?</p>
            <p>'Tis true that his apology for the cure he now wrought to
<hi>this Ruler of the Synagogue,</hi> seems to have no higher reference,
nor was he bound, unseasonably, to declare his utmost end and
design, to a prejudic'd, malicious Enemy. <hi>That</hi> was to <hi>speak
it self,</hi> to shine by it's own light, and, by such means, and
methods as these, gradually to make it's own way into less-obstructed
minds, insensibly sliding in upon them; which might
better be done (time being given at leisure to consider things)
by the <hi>real evidence</hi> which his works carry'd with them, than
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56414:8"/>
by industrious, and often-repeated <hi>verbal Commentaries and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He sometimes spake it out expresly, as he thought fit, to
competent, and more prepared hearers, that his great design was
to make <hi>himself,</hi> and <hi>his errand</hi> be understood; <hi>who he was,</hi>
and <hi>what he came into the World for;</hi> that he was the <hi>Son of
God,</hi> the <hi>promised Messiah;</hi> and that his business was <hi>to save them
that were lost;</hi> and to restore Gods interest in an Apostate lost
world (whose rights were to be cared for in the first place.
<hi>He redeemed us to God by his blood,</hi> Rev. 5. 9.) Or <hi>for the glory
of God,</hi> as he summ'd it up, in the case of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he was
told of his being sick, <hi>Jon. 11. 4. This sickness is not unto death</hi>
(<hi>i. e.</hi> it was not to terminate in a continuing death) <hi>but for the
Glory of God, that the Son of man might be Glorifi'd,</hi> the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
which <hi>this Evangelist</hi> gives of all these his great works, and
why they were recorded, that we <hi>might believe that Jesus was the
Christ, the Son of God. &amp;c. chap.</hi> 20. 30. And otherwise was it so
considerable a thing, that a man well got out of this fearful gulf,
as <hi>Lazarus</hi> now was, should be fetcht back again! that so mighty
a wonder should be wrought! that the inclosure of the grave
should be torn open! and the released Soul should be again drawn
down, as a bird escaped, caught back into it's former confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to converse a while longer amidst the impurities of a <hi>world
lying in wickedness,</hi> and with shadows, in a <hi>world the fashion whereof
passes away!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No; Miracles were not <hi>so cheap things.</hi> We may observe the
great and wise God hath, for great and weighty reasons, been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
very sparing in making very observable innovations upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or any considerable changes in the ordinary course and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of Natural Causes, and their Operations; as a thing less suitable
to <hi>a state of probation,</hi> wherein men were to be held in this world.
And hath only been wont to do it, where the inconvenience was
to be ballanced by preponderating greater reasons; which might
as much require that he should depart from the fixed rule <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,</hi>
as other reasons might, that he should <hi>not do it often.</hi> It
was equally necessary that miracles should not be common, as
that there should be any wrought at all, and in great part for
the same reason. For if they were common, they must lose the
only design, for which they could be at all useful. If God should
do, in this kind, what is <hi>not necessary,</hi> he should the less effect
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56414:8"/>
by it <hi>that which is.</hi> Inasmuch as they are only useful, as they are
strange, and, in the natural way, unaccountable. But there is
nothing so great in this kind, but ceases to be thought strange,
if it be common. Otherwise, is not the <hi>forming of the eye, in
itself</hi> as great a thing, as to give sight to the blind? Or the framing
such a world as this, as great a thing, as the most stupendous
miracle that ever was wrought in it?</p>
            <p>It was indeed necessary somewhat extraordinary should at first
be done to demonstrate <hi>that man,</hi> Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> to be <hi>the
Son of God,</hi> which it was impossible should otherwise be known.
When that was fully done, it was not necessary there should still
be a repetition of miracles, from age to age, to prove the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
were wrought, or the truth of the narratives, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
them. <hi>That</hi> was sufficiently to be known in the ordinary
way, as other matters of fact are, or other history, about which
there is no doubt made among men. And the history of <hi>these
things</hi> has greater advantages to recommend it to the certain
belief of after time, than most that ever were writ besides, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
many accounts. It was indeed most becoming the Majesty,
Wisdom and Goodness of God (taken together) to do what
might answer the real necessities of men whom he was designing
to save; but not to indulge their curiosity, nor their unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
dulness, sloth, or prejudice, whereby they may be unapt
to enquire about, or receive plain things.</p>
            <p>Therefore miracles were to be done, as rarities, sometimes,
not at all times, and at such a time, and upon such an occasion
most of all, to notifie, and signalize the Redeemer, at his first
appearance, to draw mens eyes upon him, that they might
take notice of him, and demean themselves towards him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
This was to be done sufficiently once for all. And the
<hi>great stupidity</hi> of the world made a matter which needed <hi>some</hi>
supernatural evidence, need <hi>so much</hi> in that kind. <hi>Except you
see signs and wonders, you will not believe.</hi> And if he did so far
comply with the necessity of degenerate humanity, as to give
<hi>once</hi> some signal convictive evidence that he was the Christ,
the divine Wisdom would take care it should not be so <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
done,</hi> as to become trivial, and insignificant to it's proper
end; the importance whereof was such, as that it ought to
<hi>transcend</hi> any regard to the welfare of mens bodies; but not
to <hi>exclude</hi> it; which we now come briefly to shew in the next
place. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56414:9"/>
2. That tho' compassion towards an infirm creature, under
bodily distemper, was not the <hi>principal inducement</hi> unto this cure,
it was a <hi>real one.</hi> Our Lord doth really compassionate the frailties
of those that relate to him, while they dwell in mortal flesh.
<hi>He himself bears our sicknesses.</hi> He has a tenderness towards them,
even while he doth not think it fit actually to release, and set
them free; which makes way to what was proposed in <hi>the last
place</hi> to be insisted on, as preparatory to the intended use.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>That in what way soever our Lord Jesus works a release for
them that are most specially his own, from their bodily distempers, he
doth it in mercy to them.</hi> He lets their affliction continue upon
them in mercy; greater mercy, indeed, than would be in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
deliverance. But when he sees it a fit season to give
them a release, that is an unquestionable mercy too; tho' it be
not in such a way, as appears such to vulgar eyes.</p>
            <p>It is more easily apprehensible to be from compassion, if he
relieves a poor, pained, weak, languishing, sickly creature, by
giving renewed strength, and ease, and health in this world.
But when the release is by death, as in the case we have under
our farther present consideration, it is hard to perswade that this
is done in mercy; that there is compassion in this case. There is 'tis
true in this a manifest disparity, but not a disadvantageous one.
Is it a less thing, to release an holy soul from <hi>the body</hi> than from
<hi>bodily distempers?</hi> It can only be so in the opinion of such blind moles
of the earth, as the children of men are now generally become.
But let the case be considered according to it's true and real
import. Why! a <hi>recovery from sickness</hi> is but <hi>an adjournment of
death;</hi> 'tis but death defer'd a while. When there is a release
wrought in such a way as this, in which hers was wrought,
whom God hath lately taken from amongst us; here is a cure,
<hi>not</hi> only <hi>of one</hi> bodily distemper, but <hi>of all;</hi> not only of <hi>actual
diseasedness,</hi> but of the <hi>possibility of ever being diseased more;</hi> here
is a cure wrought, not only <hi>of infirmity,</hi> but of <hi>death:</hi> for the
Saints conquer death by suffering it; Yea a cure, not <hi>of death</hi>
only, but of <hi>mortality,</hi> of any liableness to death, so as it can
never touch them more; Yea further, not only of <hi>bodily diseases,</hi>
but of <hi>Spiritual</hi> too, far worse, and more grievous than all bodily
diseases whatsoever; a cure of blindness of mind, deadness, and
hardness of heart, of all indispositions towards God, his ways,
and presence, towards the most spiritual duties, and the best,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56414:9"/>
and most excellent of our enjoyments. The <hi>body of Sin,</hi> and the
<hi>mortal body</hi> are both put off together. The imprisoned soul is
set free, and enters upon a state of everlasting liberty; is <hi>releast</hi>
from the <hi>bands of death,</hi> of whatsoever kind, and in the highest,
fullest sense, shall <hi>reign</hi> in life, <hi>thorough Jesus Christ.</hi> What is
the decease of a Saint, but a translation out of a valley of death,
a <hi>Golgotha,</hi> a place of Skulls, a region where death reigns, into
the region of perfect and everlasting life? It is not to be called
death <hi>simply or absolutely,</hi> but with diminution; 'tis death only
<hi>in a certain respect,</hi> when in <hi>an higher, and much more considerable res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,</hi>
When in <hi>an higher, and much more considerable respect,</hi>
it is a <hi>birth</hi> rather; <hi>a dying out of one world,</hi> and <hi>a being born</hi>
at the same time, into another, a much more lightsome, a purer,
and more glorious world. The soul is cured in a moment, of
whatsoever was grievous or afflicting to it, and the body put
into a certain way of cure, of being made from an earthly, mean,
mortal thing, heavenly, spiritual, incorruptible, and immortal;
from a <hi>vile,</hi> a <hi>glorious body, like Christs</hi> own, and by <hi>that power,
by which he can subdue all things to himself,</hi> Phil. 3. 21.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>And now for Use.</head>
               <p>I. Learn, <hi>That there is no inconsistency in the case, that the same
person should be at once the subject of long continued bodily affliction,
and of divine compassion.</hi> These are reconcilable things, sickly
languishings, under which one may be <hi>ready to fail,</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions
that fail not.</hi> This is a <hi>common Theme;</hi> but the <hi>due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration</hi>
of it is <hi>too little common.</hi> Let it now be considered with
impartial equity, and with deep seriousness. Do you think the
all-comprehending mind of the Son of God now first began to
pity this daughter of <hi>Abraham?</hi> While he was not yet ascended,
this attribution is given him; Otherwise, no doubt, than as a
false complement; <hi>Lord thou knowest all things</hi>—Since his
ascension, we are assured he hath <hi>a feeling of our infirmities,</hi> so as
to be <hi>toucht</hi> with them, a continuing sympathy, remembring
the inconveniences of that state he had past thorough (as she
once, <hi>non ignara mali</hi> &amp;c.) and is always ready, therefore, to do
the part of a faithful and merciful high Priest. <hi>Before his descent,</hi>
we must, with equal reason, suppose him to have an <hi>entire prospect</hi>
of the sad case of wretched mortals, in this miserable world of
ours. What else <hi>made him descend?</hi> And after that he was descended,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56414:10"/>
this mark could not but lye still before the eye of his divine mind,
to which <hi>all his works were known from the beginning of the world.</hi>
Yet the cure is defer'd, the release is not given till the appointed
season. When it is the case of any of you to be afflicted with
long sickness, and to feel the tediousness of a lingering disease
(count upon it that it may be so, as 'tis like, it hath been with
divers of you;) Do not then permit the matter to the censure
of an incompetent, partial Judge. If you consult <hi>flesh and blood,</hi> if
<hi>sense</hi> be to pronounce in the case, and give judgment, how hard
will it be to perswade that you are not neglected in your languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
that your groans and faintings are unpity'd; tho' you are
so plainly told, that <hi>whom the Lord loves he chastens?</hi> Are you not
ready to say, how can this stand with being at the same time,
the object of divine pity? If he pity me, would he let me lye,
and languish thus, in so miserable a plight, day after day, and
year after year? Yes; these things very well agree, and I would
fain shortly evince to you that they do. Why!</p>
               <p>1. His Compassion may sufficiently be Evidenc'd in <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind,</hi> and by another sort of instances. Sure, it will speak
compassion, if he frequently visit his frail infirm creatures, and
<hi>by his visitation preserve their spirits,</hi> if he support them, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
them, this is grace. <hi>My grace shall be sufficient for thee,</hi> saith
he to the great Apostle, when he refused to release him from
that <hi>thorn in the flesh, that messenger of Satan that did buffet
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Besides, <hi>compassion may appear by this kind of dispensation it
self.</hi> It may not only carry that <hi>with it,</hi> but <hi>in it,</hi> which may shew
good will. If long continued affliction may be supposed to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from compassion,</hi> it doth much more <hi>consist with it.</hi> It may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from compassion, and bear the relation to it of an effect to
the cause. We find it expresly so said in Scripture; and who can
so truly speak Gods mind as himself? <hi>He afflicts in very faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
and, <hi>as many as the Lord loves, he chastens, and scourges every
son whom he receives, Prov.</hi> 3. 12. quoted, <hi>Heb. 12. 5, 6. Rev.</hi> 3.
Affliction must be the effect of his real, and most sincere good
will, and compassion, tho' of long continuance, if it be apt, and
intended to do you good, in higher, and in greater regards, than
those wherein you suffer; or if the good your affliction does you,
or is fitly design'd to do you be of a nobler, and more excellent
kind, than that whereof it deprives you, it must be understood, not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56414:10"/>
only to be consistent with kindness and good will, but to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
of it. For the same principle that intends the end, must also
intend the proper means that serve to effect it. Now the <hi>kind of
this good</hi> is thus to be estimated. You read <hi>Psal. 103. 5. As a father
pities his children, so the Lord pities them that fear him. As a father.</hi>
The relation he is in to them is that of a father to his children.
But we must understand, under what notion, he is so related, and
we are told, <hi>Heb. 12. 9, 10. Furthermore, we have had fathers of our
flesh, which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: Shall we not then
much rather be in subjection to the father of our spirits, and live? For
they, verily, for a few days, chastened us after their own pleasure; but he
for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.</hi> We have here
an account where the relation terminates, and see both <hi>the object</hi>
of his more special kindness and good will, which accompany the
relation, and <hi>the end</hi> of it. He is <hi>the father of their spirits;</hi> whence,
therefore, we may collect the <hi>object</hi> of that love which goes with
the relation must be <hi>their spirits</hi> also; the <hi>end</hi> of it is their <hi>spiritual
advantage; to make them partakers of his own holiness. His holiness!</hi>]
is a lofty word, and carries the matter high. Understanding it so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
(as we may be sure it was meant) it must signifie the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
which he hath <hi>himself</hi> imprest, and the impression whereof
is the lively resemblance and image of <hi>his own.</hi> And is not this
<hi>a good</hi> of a nobler, and more excellent <hi>kind,</hi> than we can lose by
a sickness? better than <hi>the case</hi> of this vile flesh, that was made
out of dust, and tends thither? The object is <hi>their spirits;</hi> for
there the kindness that belongs to the relation must termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
where the relation terminates. <hi>How much more shall we
not be subject to the father of our spirits, and live?</hi> The father of
our spirits is there contradistinguisht from the fathers of our
flesh. God is not the father of our flesh; but the father of
our spirits. He is the Creator of our flesh too; our flesh is
his <hi>creature,</hi> but not his <hi>off-spring.</hi> There must be a similitude,
and likeness of nature between a father and a child, which
there is not necessarily, between a <hi>maker,</hi> and the <hi>thing made.</hi>
In respect of our spiritual part, we are his off-spring, and he
is so a father to us; both, as the Souls of men in common
bear his <hi>natural Image;</hi> and, if they be regenerate, as they
bear his <hi>holy Image</hi> too. And the case may be so, that the
suffering of our flesh is necessary for the advantage of our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
Our flesh may suffer so, as that the spirit shall be the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56414:11"/>
better for it; and then pity it self, compassion it self must not
only <hi>permit,</hi> but <hi>cause</hi> and <hi>produce</hi> such a course of dispensation,
as whereby that end shall be attained, <hi>the making us partakers
of his himself;</hi> so the Apostle speaks of his own case; <hi>Though
our outward man perish, yet our inward man is renewed day by
day,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 15. <hi>Though our outward man perish.</hi> We are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd
about with Deaths that are continually beating down
the Walls of this outward man; they are beating upon it,
and are likely to infer it's perishing; and if it perish, let it
perish, I am not follicitous (<hi>q. d.</hi>) about that. If it must
come down; let it come down; in the midst of all these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
assaults, our <hi>inward man</hi> is renewed day by day, gathers
a fresh, and increasing strength, and vigour, whilst this <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man</hi> is tending to dissolution and dust. And several
ways such continued afflictions upon the outward man, may
make for the advantage of the inward man in the best
kind.</p>
               <p>1. As they withdraw, and take off the Mind and Heart
from this World; a debasing and defiling thing, and which
transforms the Soul that converses too much with it, into a
Dunghil, fills it with ill favour. But what doth all this
World signifie to a sickly pained Person?</p>
               <p>2. As it engages them to be much in Prayer. Nothing is
more sutable, than that an afflicted Life be a Life of much
Prayer. <hi>Is any man afflicted, let him pray,</hi> Jam. 5. 13. Much affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
hath a natural aptitude to incline men this way. <hi>In their
affliction, they with seek me early,</hi> Hos. 5. 15. It is dictate of nature,
even when Grace, as yet, hath no possession; but which,
through Gods blessing, may, by this means, help to introduce
it. For it urges the Soul Godward, who is the <hi>God of all
Grace;</hi> obliges it to converse with him, whereby somewhat
better may be gained than is sought: In their afflictions they
will be submissive and lye at my feet, saith God; they will
<hi>seek me early,</hi> from whom, otherwise, I should never hear, it
may be, all their Life long. Oh! that you would understand
the matter so, when God afflicts in such kinds, so as his hand
touches your very bone and flesh; this is the design of it, to
make you pray, to bring you upon your knees, to put you
into a supplicating posture, if he can, upon any terms, hear
from you, tho' you seek him but for bodily ease and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56414:11"/>
it may be a means of the greatest advantage to you, e're
God have done with you, when once he has brought you,
by this means to treat; when he has got you into a more
tractable disposition, there is hope in the case. If thus he
<hi>open your ear to Discipline, and be to you an interpreter, one of a
thousand, to shew you his Righteousness, he may seal instruction to
you, and save your Soul from going down to the Pit, having found
a ransom for you,</hi> Job 33. 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for those that have a real Interest in God, and Union
with Christ, that which occasions much Prayer, is likely to be
the means of much spiritual improvement, and advantage to
them.</p>
               <p>3. It puts several suitable Graces upon exercise, and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
exercised they grow. It tries their <hi>Faith,</hi> and improves
it. <hi>Faith</hi> is, in such a case as this, necessarily called forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
act, if there be the principle; and as it <hi>acts,</hi> it <hi>grows;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
more and more strong and lively. Their <hi>Patience</hi>
is exercised by it, and perfected; and that has a great influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon their universal perfection. <hi>Let patience have it's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
work, that you may be perfect,</hi> Jam. 1, 2, 3, 4. There will
be an universal languor (as if he should have said) upon your
Spirits, if you be impatient; if you cannot suffer (as patience
is an ability for suffering) if you can by no means endure,
without tempestuous agitations, or sullen despondencies of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
But if <hi>Patience have it's perfect Work,</hi> that will infer an
universal healthfulness, and good habit into your whole Soul.</p>
               <p>Their Love to God is, in such a case, eminently tried; and
improved, <hi>Blessed is the man that endures Temptation</hi> (tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
affliction is there meant, as above, <hi>vers. 2.) For when he
is tryed, he shall receive the Crown of Life, which the Lord hath
promised to them that love him,</hi> Jam. 1. 12. Which implies <hi>their
love</hi> to him is the great thing put upon trial, in that case.
And it is a great trial of Love to God; a very improvable
opportunity of discerning it's sincerity, when, upon a long affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
you can appeal to God, and say, <hi>Thou knowest I love thee;</hi>
tho' thou smite and kill, I will still love thee. No discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
motion, no repining thought shall ever be allowed a place
in my breast; there may be sighs, but no murmurings; groans,
but no tumults, nothing of displeasure against thy Holy Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56414:12"/>
4. It occasions such to live much upon the borders of Eternity.
Under affliction we <hi>look not to the things that are seen and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
but to the things that are unseen and Eternal,</hi> which make
us count our affliction, <hi>tho' long,</hi> but <hi>momentany,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17,
18, And those Souls will prosper, and flourish that have so
unspeakably more to do with the other World than with this.
'Tis in this way, that the afflictions of this present state <hi>do
work for us the far more exceeding, and eternal weight of Glory,</hi>
ver. 17. as they direct our eye forward, <hi>while we look,</hi> ver.
18. <hi>not to the things which are seen, which are but temporal;
but to the things, which are unseen, and eternal.</hi> Life and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
strength and vigour enter (<hi>q. d.</hi>) at our eye, which is
prompted by the horrour of frightful spectacles in this scene
of things, to look to another, where all things appear light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
pleasant, and glorious.</p>
               <p>There are other considerations, whereby you might argue
to your selves, not only the consistency, but the great suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of an afflicted state in this World, with Gods Favour,
Kindness, and Compassion towards you.</p>
               <p>As that <hi>when he is more highly provok'd,</hi> he <hi>threatens not to
afflict,</hi> as the heaviest of penalties. <hi>Why should they be smitten
any more?</hi> Isa. 1. 5. I will no more punish your Daughters, &amp;c.
<hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 14. Ephraim <hi>is joined to Idols, let him alone,</hi> ver. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That his Covenant obliges him to it,</hi> as to them, who are, on
stricter terms, in Covenant with him, <hi>Christs own seed</hi> being
signifi'd by <hi>Davids,</hi> as by <hi>David</hi> is manifestly <hi>Christ</hi> himself,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 89: Where you may see how, and after what tenour
his Covenant runs, <hi>ver.</hi> 30. 31, 32, 33, 34.</p>
               <p>According whereto he himself elsewhere acknowledges,
that <hi>in very faithfulness God had afflicted him,</hi> Psal. 119. 75.</p>
               <p>That, in experience, we are apt to grow remiss, secure
and negligent, when all things are externally well with us.
And let us but appeal to our selves, how much a wakeful
temper of Spirit, under affliction, is better than carelesness,
and vanity of Mind, accompany'd with fleshly ease and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>That we can our selves easily apprehend that it may, not
only consist with the tenderness of a Parent, to have the
wound of a Child search'd, tho' with much pain; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:56414:12"/>
That in heaven our judgment of things will be right and
incorrupt, where we shall apprehend no cause of complaint,
that, through many sicknesses, diseases, and death it self, our
way was made for us thither. And if that shall <hi>then</hi> be a
<hi>true judgment,</hi> the thing it self must be as true <hi>now.</hi> But these I
hastily hint, and pass to some further use.</p>
               <p>2. We may, next, collect, that since it is out of doubt,
the Devil may have <hi>some hand</hi> in our outward affliction, we are
concern'd to take so much the more care, that he may not
have <hi>his end</hi> upon us by it. An hand he may have, and
we cannot determine how far; but whether it be more or
less, great care we are concern'd to take how to frustrate
his design. He has the most mischievous ends that can be,
and designs worse things to us than the affliction, which is
the means, whatsoever that be. He would fain engage us
in a controversie with God; would have us contend with
him, murmur, fret, blaspheme and curse God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
send out our last, and dying breath. That was his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
upon <hi>Job.</hi> Let us labour to frustrate it, as he did. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Antients (<hi>Justin Martyr, Jerome, Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>)
speak much to this purpose, how great a design the
Devil drives in being the Author of sicknesses and diseases
to men, that he might make them apply themselves to him,
and divert from God, as that wicked Prince did, whom by
the Prophet we find so tharply reprov'd for it, as if there
were no God in <hi>Israel,</hi> that he went to the God of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rom</hi> (some
Daemon, or other as we have reason to think.)</p>
               <p>The last mentioned of those Authors speaks of it, as just mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Excommunication, when those that bear the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
shall in such cases, use means bearing no natural proportion
or accommodateness to the end, charms, spells, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for ease,
or cure of maladies; wherein no relief could reasonably be
expected, but from the Devils agency; who may be offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
enough, if, especially, he have first hurt, to heal
too, that by practising upon their bodies, he may entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
their souls; and (according to his wont of running coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to God, who wounds that he may the more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
heal and save) by a present temporary cure, wound mortally,
and finally destroy.</p>
               <p>He hath not left the world (no, not the Christian world)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56414:13"/>
quite ignorant of his methods in these kinds, of training
men, by gradual steps, into things, first, that seem inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and then into such familiarities (whether their <hi>real
distress,</hi> or their <hi>curiosity,</hi> were the first handle he took hold of
them by, or the Engine by which he drew them) till, at
length, it comes to express covenanting. If the matter
come not so far, 'tis rare to come off from the least tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings
without a scratch. <hi>He that is born of God keeps himself,
that the evil one may not touch him,</hi> I John 5. 18. as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he designs to touch mortally, and if he touch, to kill.
If it proceed so far, as a solemn league, how tragical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
doth story abound with! That of <hi>Count Matiscon</hi>
(pluckt away by the Devil from among divers persons of
quality, whom he was entertaining, and at noon-day, whirl'd
in the air three times about the City, in open view of the
people, to whom he in vain cried for help) reported by
some Historians; and that of an infamous <hi>Magician of Saltz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
and divers others, are instances both very extraordinary,
and very monitory.</p>
               <p>But as to a future ruine, which he finally aims to involve
men in, with himself, he hath not faster hold of any, than
those that have learnt to ridicule every thing of this kind,
and who have put so much <hi>Sadducism</hi> into their Creed (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of so many negatives, or things they believe not,
that they scarce leave enough positive to admit that name)
as to think <hi>there is no such creature:</hi> perhaps as being consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
there can be no worse than themselves. But how near is he
to them that think him out of the Universe!</p>
               <p>3. Since it is possible the Devil may bind even those <hi>that
belong to God,</hi> with some kind of bodily affliction or other; it
is the more to be apprehended, how much worse bonds
they are, in which he binds those <hi>that do not belong to him.</hi>
Oh! that you would be serious here! How many such sad
cases are there, amongst even them, as may be feared, that
are called Christians, concerning which it may be said, here
is a soul that Satan hath bound, not <hi>eighteen,</hi> but, it may be,
thirty, forty, fifty years! Oh! when shall this soul be releast,
that Satan hath so long bound!</p>
               <p>4. As from the Devils malice to the bodies of men we
may collect his greater malice to their Souls; So we may
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56414:13"/>
judg proportionably of Christs compassions; that as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
him to give them all sutable relief in their bodily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
as far as can consist with those measures, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
wisdom hath pitcht upon, for the government of this
present world, and as shall fall in with the design of his
office of a Redeemer and Saviour to us; So they much more
incline him to relieve embondag'd souls; for <hi>this</hi> doth most
directly fall in with his design, and is the proper business of
his office; the other may be only collateral to it, and, as
it were to be done <hi>on the by.</hi> He came not into this world
to procure, that men might not be sick, or pained; or be
presently restored to health and ease. But he came and died,
that souls might live; to procure for them pardon, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
with God, all needful assisting influences of grace,
and eternal life. Of these therefore they may be most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
if they duly apply themselves. And some encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to expect so much they may draw even from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
This infirm woman, in order to bodily cure, <hi>did
apply her self to him.</hi> She came after him, as others did,
<hi>for this purpose;</hi> and did, in a sort, put herself in the way
of his healing influence. Now if any of you find your souls
are yet held by the Devil in worse bonds, apply your selves
to the merciful compassionate Jesus, there is hope in the
case. Oh! will you not say so much to him for a soul in
bondage? Lord loose this poor soul of mine, that Satan hath
bound for so many sad years. Do but labour to know you
are bound, to feel your bonds. Whatsoever there is of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
sin in you, it is a bond, by which the Devil holds
your souls. <hi>The wicked are held in the cords of their own ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi>
Prov. 5. 22. And sins are said to be the works of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
from which it is the design of the Redeemer to loose
us. <hi>The Son of God was for this purpose manifested that he might
destroy</hi> (we read,) it is, <hi>that he might dissolve the works of
the Devil.</hi> q. d. that he might release, and unbind souls,
that the Devil as yet holds in fast bonds. And you may
find you are so bound, when upon self-reflexion you take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
you are ordinarily restrained from what you should do,
against the light, and conviction of your own minds and
judgments; <hi>i. e.</hi> you find, if you reflect, a conviction hath tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
place in your consciences, you ought to love God; but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56414:14"/>
there is with you no such motion of soul, no inclination towards him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
you ought, in a stated course to pray, and pour out your soul
to him; but you are bound, you cannot offer at it; you have
no liberty for it; your terrene inclination, or love to vanity
plucks you back; you ought to <hi>walk in the ways of God,</hi> but
you are fetterred, you cannot move a foot; you ought to <hi>do
the works of God,</hi> but you are manacled, you cannot <hi>stir and an hand.</hi>
Are you so bound, and will you not know it? What! never feel
your bonds? When once they are felt, you will soon begin to
cry, and supplicate. And if once you shall be brought seriously,
and incessantly to supplicate, it may be hop't the release will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.
Was our Lord so compassionate towards infirm bodies, in
the days of his flesh in this world; and do we think he, above, is
less compassionate to souls? Can it be thought heaven hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
him to your disadvantage? Is he less kind, benign, and
less apt to do good, now he is inthroned in glory?
Why should you not believe he will give release unto your
captiv'd embondaged souls, if you implore his help and mercy,
with seriousness, and insist upon it, and do not give him over.
Say to him, <hi>Jesus, thou Son of God have mercy on me;</hi> for do
you not know it is his office. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and opening of Prisons
to them that are bound.</hi> Isa. 61. 1. What! will you be bound
all your days, and never lift up a cry to the great Redeemer and
Saviour of Souls to give you release? How deservedly should these
bonds end with you in the chains, wherein the Devils themselves
shall for ever be bound with you?</p>
               <p>5. We may collect, there is an awful regard due to the
Sabbath-day. When our Lord justifies the cure now wrought
on their Sabbath, only on this account, that it was an act
of mercy towards a daughter of <hi>Abraham,</hi> by the exception
of <hi>such a case</hi> he strengthens the <hi>general rule,</hi> and intimates
so holy a day should not, upon light occasions, be otherwise
imploy'd, than for the proper end of it's appointment. Tho'
<hi>our day</hi> be not the <hi>same,</hi> the <hi>business</hi> of it, in great part, is;
by the <hi>reason</hi> given in the <hi>fourth Commandment,</hi> which being
plac't among the rest of those <hi>ten words,</hi> so many ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably
distinguisht from the other laws given the Jews,
and signifying that these were intended not to them alone,
but to mankind, and given upon a reason common to man;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56414:14"/>
the words also not necessarily signifying more, than there should
be <hi>a seventh day</hi> kept as sacred to God, reserving it to after-significations
of his pleasure to mark out, and signalize this
or that day, as he should see fit. And our Saviour having
told us expresly the <hi>Sabbath was made for man, (i. e.</hi> as men,
not for <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Jews</hi>) These considerations taken together,
with many more (not fit to be here mentioned) do challenge
a very great regard to the day, which we have cause to think it
is the will of God we should keep <hi>as our Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. That there is somewhat of priviledge due by gracious
vouchsafement and grant to the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
seed, <hi>i. e. to speak by Analogy,</hi> to the children of <hi>covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Parents. Abraham</hi> is considerable here, as being <hi>under that
notion,</hi> a <hi>father;</hi> whosoever of you therefore are the children of
such, as <hi>were of the faith of Abraham;</hi> and you are now come
to that adult state, wherein you are capable of transacting with
God for your selves, and wherein the <hi>transitus</hi> is made from
minority to maturity; if now you own the God of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
if you will now say, My fathers God shall be my God;
<hi>he keeps mercy for thousands of them that love him, and keep his
commandments. i. e.</hi> if there were a thousand generations of such
(generations being spoken of so immediately before, <hi>viz. that
he would visit iniquity upon them that hate him, to the third, and
fourth generation; but shew mercy to them that love him, and keep
his commandments, unto a thousand generations, i. e. to never so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>)
If you will not when now grown up disavow your fathers
God; if you will avow and own him, and devote your selves
to him, he will be your God, as well as theirs. Here is now
the priviledge due to <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, or to the children of
covenanted parents. God has an early preventive interest in
them, upon which they may lay their claim to him, as their
God, if they will but now give up themselves to him, and
stand to his covenant. But if you will not do so, but slight,
and reject the God of your Fathers, then your <hi>birth priviledge</hi>
can signifie nothing to you; then, <hi>think not to say with your
selves, We have Abraham to our father,</hi> in that <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>Matthews</hi>
Gospel; for God will never want children; <hi>he is able of stones
to raise up children to Abraham, q. d.</hi> rather stones than you.
And then indeed, upon a true account, <hi>Abraham</hi> is none of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56414:15"/>
your father; as our Lord Jesus tells the <hi>Jews,</hi> If you were
<hi>Abrahams</hi> children, you would do the works of <hi>Abraham.</hi> You
do so and so, <hi>thus did not Abraham.</hi> Joh. 8. 39, 40. Pray
consider what <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and how he lived on earth, like an
inhabitant of heaven, as an heir of the heavenly Country, his
business was to <hi>seek the better country, that is, the heavenly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God was not ashamed to be called his God,</hi> as in that <hi>11th.</hi>
to the <hi>Heb. 16. ver.</hi> But if you will go from day to day
grovelling in the dust of the earth, <hi>this did not Abraham.</hi> If
you will spend your lives in the pursuit of vanity and trifles,
<hi>this did not Abraham.</hi> There is a great priviledge belonging
by Gospel grant unto the children of covenanted parents, if
they do not forfeit it, by neglecting, and practically disavowing
their fathers God.</p>
               <p>7. But I further infer hence, that since this compassion has
a <hi>real,</hi> tho' not a <hi>principal</hi> hand in the release that is given to
them that belong to God, in whatsoever way they are releast,
from all their infirmities, and ails, and afflictions in this world;
It very much becomes, and much concerns all the children of
<hi>Abraham</hi> patiently to wait for it, in Gods own way. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,
I say, in Gods own way wait for it: The children of
<hi>Abraham</hi> shall be loosen'd sooner or later, and in one way or
other, tho very long, tho so many years bound by such and
such afflicting distempers.</p>
               <p>You have a great instance of this kind in that daughter of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> whom God hath called away from us. In all that
long exercise, the main thing she was ever wont to insist
upon, was that in all this affliction, she might gain patience
submission, and instruction. And in her later time, when she
drew nearer to eternity, was more in view of it, <hi>that</hi> was the
great subject wherewith she entertained her self, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
much with somewhat more lately written upon that
subject, as by <hi>Mr. Shower</hi> (now known to most of you) and
by another Author: And her last entertainment, as I have
been told, (as to helps from creatures in any such kind) was
the repetition of what some of you have heard <hi>concerning the
Emmanuel,</hi> wherewith she formerly pleased her self, as being,
'tis likely much habituated in the temper of her spirit <hi>to the
thoughts of him,</hi> that having, by agreement with her pious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56414:15"/>
been their <hi>Motto</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The posie on their wedding ring.</note>, at their first coming
together, <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God with us.</p>
               <p>8. I shall only add one instruction more, to shut up all;
that since our Lord Jesus hath such an agency, and even with
compassion in the release of those, that do belong to him,
from their afflicting infirmities, we should all of us labour,
with a due and right frame, and disposition of spirit to behold
any such releasment. It is a great matter to be able to behold
instances of that kind, with a right frame of mind, and spirit.
If one be released by recovery, into ease, health, and strength
in this world, 'tis easily and readily made matter of joy. Is
one recovered out of a long and languishing sickness, friends
and relations behold it with great complacency and gladness
of heart. But if a Godly friend be relea'd by dying, truly
we can hardly make our selves believe, that this is a release
or so valuable a release; so much are we under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sense, so little doth that faith signifie with us, or do
it's part, that is <hi>the substance of what we hope for, and the
evidence of what we see not.</hi> No! This is to go with us for
no release. We look only upon the sensible, <hi>i. e.</hi> upon the
gloomy part of such a dispensation, when such a one is gone,
releast, set at liberty, (as a bird out of the cage, or the snare)
We can hardly tell how to consider it as a release. We will
not be induc'd to apprehend it so. There are no dispositions
no deportments commonly that suit such an apprehension.
And Oh! how unbecoming and incongruous a thing, when
Christ is, in that way, about releasing such a one, to have
an holy soul just upon the confines of a glorious blessed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
compassed about with sighs, sobs, tears, and lamenations.
How great an incongruity! I have many times thought with
my self, the love and kindness of friends and relations is very
pleasant in life, but grievous at death. It is indeed <hi>in some
respects,</hi> a very desirable thing, (if God shall vouchsafe it,)
to die with ones friends about one. It may be one may need
some little bodily relief, in those last hours; besides that,
<hi>some proper thoughts</hi> may be suggested by them, to mingle
with ones own. And, if God afford the use of reason, and
speech, and the supply of his own spirit, one may possibly, in
this last juncture, be a means of some good to them. One
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56414:16"/>
may possibly say that, that may abide with them, and be of
future advantage to them. But, <hi>in other respects,</hi> if the related
friendly by-standers cannot duly temper themselves; if they are
apter to <hi>receive</hi> or <hi>do</hi> more hurt, than good; if Christians do
not labour to shew a truly Christian spirit, in such a case,
their presence has very little eligible in it. And, indeed, the
deportment even of those that profess Christianity, about their
deceasing godly friends, is such, for the most part, as if the
foundations of all Religion were shaken with them, and as if
they had a design to shake them too, if possible, in such with
whom they are now to part; as if it were to be called in
question, whether what God hath said concerning another
world, and the blessed state of the innumerable and holy as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
above be true or no, or were not doubted to be false
and a solemn fiction, invented to delude mortals here on
earth.</p>
               <p>It is little considered how opposite such a temper of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as commonly appears in us, is to the very design of all
Christianity. For doth not the whole of Christianity termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
upon Eternity, and upon another State, and World?
Now do but consider the inconsistencies that are to be found
in this case, between the carriage, and temper of many that
profess Christianity and their very profession it self. They
acknowledge, they own, that the design of Christ's appearing
here in this World, and of his dying upon the Cross, was to
<hi>bring us to God;</hi> to <hi>bring the many Sons to Glory.</hi> They grant
that this is not to be done all at once, not all in a day;
but it is to be done by degrees. Here he takes up one, and
there another; leaving others still to transmit Religion, and
continue it on to the end of time. So far they agree, with
our common Lord; and seem to approve the divine deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
in all these steps of his procedure. But yet for
all this, if they might have their own will, Christ should
not have one to ascend to him, of those, for whom he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and himself ascended, to open Heaven for them, and to
prepare a place for their reception, as their forerunner,
there. I say not one to ascend after him! For they take
up with a general approving of this design of his. Very
well! say they, it is fitly ordered, his method is wise, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56414:16"/>
just, and kind, and let him take them that belong to him,
when he thinks fit; only let him excuse my Family; let
him take whom he will, only let him touch no Relation
of mine, not my Husband, Wife, Child, Brother, Sister, take
whom he will, but let all mine alone. I agree to all he
shall do well enough, only let him allow me my exception.
But if every one be of this temper and resolution, for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and theirs, according to this tendency, and course of
things, he shall have none at all to ascend; none <hi>to bring
with him,</hi> when he returns. <hi>Those that are dead in Jesus, he
is to bring with him.</hi> No, he should be solitary, and unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for all them. They, and all their Relations would
be immortal upon Earth. How ill doth this agree, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
with the Christian Scheme and model of things?</p>
               <p>But you will say, what! would I perswade you to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
and not to love, and care for your Relatives, or
be unwilling to part with them. No. All that I perswade
to is that there be a mixture in your temper; and such a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as that the prevailing <hi>ingredient</hi> therein, may agree with
the stronger and weightier <hi>reason.</hi> 'Tis not that I would
have love extinguisht among Relatives; but I would have it
moderated and subdued, to that degree, as to admit of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
governed by Superiour, Greater, and Nobler Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Do you think Christ did expect or design, that his
Disciples should not love him. And yet he tells them, <hi>If
you loved me, you would rejoice that I say, I
go to my Father.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 14. 28.</note> And who in all this
World could ever have such a loss, as they
of him, dwelling in flesh among them? Yet, says he, if you
loved me, you would rejoice, that I say, I go to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And when the Apostle, visibly tending towards death, by
the prediction given concerning him, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 13. said to the
Disciples round about him, <hi>What mean you to weep, and to
break my Heart? I am ready, not only to be bound, but to die
for the Name of Jesus.</hi> If there had not been a faulty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
in the affection they exprest, certainly he would not
have rebuk'd it. He would not have blam'd what he
thought not blame-worthy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:56414:17"/>
In short, It were desirable (if God see good) to die
amidst the pleasant Friends and Relatives, who were not
ill-pleased that we lived; that living, and dying breath
might mingle, and ascend together in Prayers, and Praises
to the blessed Lord of Heaven and Earth, the God of our
Lives. If then, we could part with consent, a rational, and
a joyful consent.</p>
               <p>Otherwise, To die with Ceremony! To die amongst the
fashionable bemoanings, and lamentations, as if we despair'd
of futurity! One would say (with humble submission to
the divine pleasure) Lord! Let me rather die alone! in
perfect solitude! in some unfrequented Wood, or on the
top of some far remote Mountain! where none might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
the solemn transactions, between thy glorious blessed
self, and my joyfully departing, self-resigning Soul!</p>
               <p>But in all this, we must refer our selves to Gods Holy
Pleasure, who will dispose of us, living, and dying, in the
best, the wisest, and the kindest way.</p>
