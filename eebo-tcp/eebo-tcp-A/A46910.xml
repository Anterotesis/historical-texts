            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Reaſon fell into ſo deſperate a controverſie, that I could in no wiſe judge, but that my vexed ſoule was intirely given up to the furies to bee tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. The cauſe of this my Buſirian calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty iſſued from that monſtrous Paſiphae, my Miſtris, who deſerved rather the juſt appellation of a cruell Syren, then ſerene female, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a Cockatrice, then a kind lover; and to call her embraces, mercifull piety, is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate unto her the killing qualities of the attractive Magnes, or rather that inſatiable appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of Sylla, who chiefly luſteth after an avariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous receiving, not leſſe ruinous, then perpetuall; and indeede I cannot compare her greedy deſire more fitly to any thing, then <hi>materia prima,</hi> which gapeth after the deſtruction of an abſent forme, to deface that, which now perfects and adornes her deformity; for ſhee making me the <hi>cadaver</hi> of her love to feede her helluous gorge, never ceaſed to crave, untill ſhe had induced this new forme of poverty, which I am now actuated with; nor had I as yet emerged my low-ſunck ſenſes out of the impriſoning dungeon of love, had my gold and treaſure continued But in fine, as I may ſay, in the bottome of my ſtore, when parſimony comes too late, my hands were not ſo yellow in the palmes, nor could my pockets afford a gingling chearefulneſſe; the clouds of perfumes, I uſed to walke in, were diſperſed, the Cuchinell, Arabian tinctures, ſericall vermines endeavours, Hydaſpian floods, and Orientall luſters were faded, dead, dryed up, and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracked, and I deſolate in the wilderneſſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſdaine;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95030:6"/>
and now at leſt veſted in the ſheepes ruggedneſſe, determined rather to bee a martyr (as indeede I both was, and ſtill remaine) then a confeſſor: for finding my ſelfe culpable of nothing but poverty, and moſt aſſured my poverty was ſo low and deſperate, and my fortune ſo disjoynted, that it was an impoſſible apprehenſion to conceive any amendment, I knew it was frivolous to confeſſe, becauſe I was uncapable of abſolution: Nay, finding my ſelfe in ſuch a deſperation of redreſſe, the vehemence of my diſtracted cogitations diſpoſſeſſed mee of my ſenſes, compelling them to the ſilent yoake of ſleepe. But yet kind Morpheus was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne, that hee charmed not my phanſie to the ſubmiſſion of that ſlothfull dulneſſe, but gave it free liberty to act its dumbe tragecome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>Thus was the ſentinell of my pentarchical ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers permitted to reſt; and thoſe other interiour demeſticks, whoſe tyred ſpirits had not ſufference to march on in nocturnall obſcurity, cloſed up their incorporeall eyes, with a ſoft whiſper to the pavilion of their ſilence: when the dreaming ſenſe (that workes up mountaines of admiration, which prove but mole-hills in the morning) ambled about, like Will-with-the wiſpe, dauncing rounde layes through the Morphean meadowes, and in ſhort ſpace entred the Iſle of Cyprus, and (phanſie being my guide) I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſeemed to be at the great Court of Love, where I found a by-pathed gate, which led me into Loves pleaſant garden; better and more

For it is the ganderwiſe traine of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus his ſcholers, who take me to be the potent peere, and open-handed God, that gives eaſe to all paſsions, that ſavour of the fury of an amorous deſire, darting golden ſhafts which unite ſoules in heavenly harmony, never to feele miſery after this ſtroke, when really there is no ſuch thing within the whole latitude of my power.</p>
            <p>For I muſt ingenuouſly confeſſe, that there is no true love, no true union, no true delight, but proceedes from the ſupreme divinity, the pure and immateriall eſſence of the omnipotent King, and ſole ruler of all celeſtiall and terreſtiall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: it is the love which hee powers downe upon us, that ſupernaturall bounty, which by how much the more it is fought for, ſo much the more is the increaſe of it; for it is a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative delight, whoſe chiefe propriety is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to ſtreame into the hearts and ſoules of all that are capeable thereof: This love is free, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, profuſe, truely generous, and without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation; ſwifter then thought, vaſter then the

concave of this univerſe, which is but a narrow ſtage, if divine love ſhould act upon it: And therefore, if ſimplicians conceit they ſhall finde this profundity in my ebnes, they deceive their expectation, and will in the end lament the ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lownes of their ſequeſtred intelligence. Friend, you conceive Intereſt to be liberality, and take poverty by the hand, if you goe to meete me in a generous weede: for when you receive a kiſſe by my direction, it may chance to make you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe a twelve moneths penance, or, as it hath now, groane under a ſeven yeares ſervitude: I have knowne a ſmile fetch off all the fleſh of a mans back, and the giving of a handkerchiefe coſt more then it would hold, had it beene filled with diamonds, to requite the kindneſſe; becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is given by mee or mine, but it hath a hooke in the end, that brings backe a double In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>If therefore you will rightly know my name, I am the god of Intereſt, begot of Laſcivious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, Bayliefe to Dis, and Pander to the world. And becauſe you are in the court of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus, and peradventure may not ſo ſuddainely conſent to this, which I have affirmed in my ſhort narration, I will favour you ſo much, as to ſhew you my Vniverſity, or ſchooles of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, which (thanks be to fooles) is the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, moſt ample, and moſt famous Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie in the world, where the women proceede graduates, and the men degradates, and all under my moderation, wearing the ſignet of this facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as regiſtred here form their matriculation,

            <p>No ſooner had I conceived theſe words, but the effect that the Remora cauſes to a ſhippe, the very ſame theſe cautions words wrought in my demurring limbes, where I ſtood as if I had beene thunder-ſtrucke, or confined by the power of a ſpel to a foot-broad peece of ground: for conſidering the poore condition of my ayery purſe (ayery I may call it, becauſe there was not one peny in it to expulſe that element) I had no motion left in mee to performe the obligation, which my curioſity exacted by entring therein; ſince I was not more free from any thing, then how to free my ſelfe from this imminent voyage: untill at length my Patron raiſed up my ſpirits, and animated my cowardize; ſaying.</p>

            <p>Cupid turning himſelfe towards mee, ſaid; now friend you are in Loves Vniverſity, where you ſhall preſently ſee women of ſeverall ages, witts, and beauties, who teach their maſculine diſciples the <hi>liberall arts,</hi> ſo that thoſe, who are moſt prompt in this faculty of liberality, with moſt celeritie proceede graduates.

            </p>
            <p>Advert therefore that the firſt is <hi>caſus dandi,</hi> and the next <hi>caſus gignendi</hi>; becauſe the Dative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets the Genitive; and when the Dative is no caſe: that is, not of force, for that the penurious caitive, or ruffinous ſwaggerer hath ſworne and drunke himſelfe not onely out of cloathes, but alſo out of money, then the Genitive is likewiſe no caſe. The Nomnative ſometimes we name, &amp; no more: the Accuſative is not knowne amongſt us, becauſe all muſt be ſo free, that none can bee accuſed of negligence to reward their deareſt. My minions have a rule for the Vocative caſe,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95030:15"/>
which only ſtrike and is termed at their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers eares, which is; <hi>Qui non eſt Dativus quando Vocatiuus clamitat, non eſt ſodalis Amoris.</hi> Yet marke the private rule of the females. When the Vocative endeth in us, the Dative endeth in as. The Ablative is the womans caſe onely, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they take all, nay they not onely take, but they take away all that is given, never regarding any recompenſe, but onely the common, which is thankes, I am your ſervant, and ſo: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we conſtitute the Dative and the Ablative to be correlatives.</p>
            <p>We likewiſe hold the opinion of the Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telians and true Thomiſtes, that <hi>Relatio fundatur in quantitate,</hi> this <hi>quantitas</hi> we ſay is <hi>Dativus</hi>; and therefore this is our Logicall diſcourſe, <hi>Sublato fundamento relationis tollitur ipſa relatio: ſed Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tivus eſt fundamentum Ablativi; ergo ſublato da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivo aufertur etiam &amp; Ablativus:</hi> and what we ſay of the Dative in reſpect of the Ablative, the ſame we likewiſe ſay in liew of the Genitive, <hi>quia non admittimus caſum Gignendi, ſi non adfuerit caſus Dandi.</hi> Neither be miſtake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for it is not <hi>caſus dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di in praeſens</hi> only, but <hi>caſus dandi ſecundum prius, vel antecedentèr.</hi> But let us omitte this anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince this is not the Claſſe which exacteth either this forme or doctrine. Wee have and ſet downe here as prime and chiefe one Subſtantive, one Adjective, one Pronoune, and one Verbe; for example theſe which follow with their beſt reliſhing compounds: <hi>Pecunia tota mea eſt.</hi> Our genders properly are but two: the Maſculine, which we call <hi>genus portans,</hi> and the Feminine,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95030:15"/>
which is <hi>genus recipiens.</hi> To the Female of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine gender belong all ſorts of metall, which are of value and eſtimation; likewiſe al ſtones be of the feminine gender, even thoſe that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to men, are attributed to the female kinde and therefore, we ſay in our Grammer rule: <hi>Propria quae maribus, foemineo generi tribuuntur.</hi> The new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gender is accounted an Eunuch amongſt us, &amp; therfore all newters, as <hi>ſtannum, aes, cuprum, plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum,</hi> and ſuch like rebellious metalls we burne for heretickes, and the ſame torture is inflicted upon the Neuter gender, becauſe he that enters our claſſe under this gender, is neither active in the Maſculine, nor paſſive in the Feminine gender, but all Eunuch, all neuter, neuter.

            <p>Numbers wee admit of, but yet hee that will winne his Miſtris ſooneſt, muſt complement in the plurall, for the ſingular is but a ſlender num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, &amp; therfore not able to ſatisfie her more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious appetite; ſo that thoſe that will be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the beſt proficients, muſt be perfect practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners

            <p>In the tract of this diſcourſe wee had ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the claſſe, and preparing to paſſe to the next, I deſire <hi>Cupid</hi> to benefit mee with the relation of the reſt contained in this ſchoole: It is needleſſe ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> for there is like difference betwixt ours &amp; thoſe which are taught in other ſchooles: only that wee reject ſome few rudiments, and tranſpoſe in a ſeverall order; as for example: of our undeclined parts of ſpeech the Prepoſition is firſt, and the next is the Coniunction; the reaſon hereof is this: we ayme at Intereſt, therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the men attaine to their wiſh, they muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or give ſomething, and then no doubt but they ſhall have a conjunction copulative at their demand.</p>
            <p>Of all the prepoſitions we except onely <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus</hi> and <hi>Contra</hi>; conjunctions <hi>Adverſatives,</hi> and <hi>Diminatives</hi> we hold to be meere obſoletes; and conſtitute <hi>Reddatives</hi> cheifly to be followed and practized.</p>
            <p>My Females admit not of an Interjection, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they have their hands filled with gold, which cauſeth them to exerciſe their ſpleene with <hi>ha, ha, he,</hi> and then perhaps they draw the curtaine of ſilence.</p>
            <p>Foure ſorts of Adverbes are thoſe which are of moſt eſtimation with us, two for the men and two for the women: the mens are Quantity and Number, which they preſent unto the Wiſhing and Chooſing women.

For as ſoone as they have paſſed their conjunction copulatives, then they take the degree of Licentiates, becauſe they have licence granted to practiſe any ſience art, or activitie, that their capacitie can climbe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to gaine the indulgencie of their liberall curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans: yet ever premiſed, that they have a vehement reſpect to their chiefe goale, which is intereſt.</p>

O friend, ſaid hee, the very time of their waiting is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95030:18"/>
their profeſſion and profeſſing of chaſtity; for their intention is not to commit an errour on their virginity, but an abſolute dominion over their owne poſſeſſion and cuſtodie, the totall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance their ſervants can or have attained unto; ſo to ſend him or them to their ſhorne compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in daw faire to eate a woodcock pie, where their grace before meate is; <hi>Maſcula nomina in as dicuntur multa virorum.</hi> For after they are thus cheated of their ſubſtance, they ſcarce can ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine (ſuch is their deſperation) from diſſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their hoſpitall-faſhioned carcaſſe of life, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing themſelves to ſorrow and lamentations unmercifull huggs; and after they have breakfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of this diſh of ſimplicity, they ſay this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meate grace following: <hi>Rarior eſt hilarus, vox eſt hilaris bene nota.</hi> For hilarity belongeth not to them, but to thoſe that fare well, which are the Females; which cauſeth them to ſay that <hi>Hilaris</hi> is not in uſe.</p>
            <p>But let us proceede, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> to the Syntaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſchoole, and as we walke I will rehearſe and explaine ſome rules which belong to our verball method. This is the order of the firſt rule, which the women begin thus: <hi>As in praeſenti</hi>; the men anſwering, <hi>perfectum format in have I.</hi> Which <hi>Cupid</hi> interpreted thus. The woman ſaies to her Idolator, that hee is an aſſe in the preſent tenſe; and when her loving ſimplician hath waſted all his ſtore, and findeth himſelfe neglected, he ſighes and ſaies, have I found out your deceit? I never yet learned to ſay no, I am now <hi>an as.</hi> Now I alſo finde the connective ſenſe of that exception,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95030:18"/>
               <hi>Do das rité dedi, ſto ſtas formare ſteti, vult.</hi> For <hi>dedi</hi> and <hi>ſteti</hi> are relatives, becauſe as long as I gave I ſtood, but now I can give no more, I fall from all familiaritie, and muſt now beginne the mournefull verſe, <hi>Dot fleo fles &amp;c. indeque natum deleo delevi</hi>; for to ſpeake truly, I have blotted my ſelf out of the regiſter of graduates, &amp; meerely by nothing but my too much precipitant prodigality; and therefore muſt entreate my teares to obtaine pardon for my vanity which hath pulled poverty upon me.</p>
            <p>When I heard <hi>Cupid</hi> act this part, I was ſtruck with a vehement incitement to inject a ſtop in his way, that I might have proceeded in the ſame theme, becauſe I apprehended it to bee a wrong unto me, that had ſo largely taſted the bitterneſſe of this experience: notwithſtanding I gave a great groane and ſaid, O <hi>Cupid,</hi> I am a reall ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in this campe, for I have turned the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ô, to be no Interjection, but a verbe, I have changed woing into owing, and woe in ô, and now I decline nothing but ô, ô, ô, <hi>per omnes modos et tempora.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Repentance, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> is nothing but ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when it comes too late; cheere up and bee merry, you will live the longer time; you have great reaſon to be glad if you conſidered all; for you muſt know, therefore you were ſtung with my waſpiſh dart, becauſe you were rich, and if you will bee rich againe, you ſhall be as ill tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented as ever you were; therefore rejoyce that you beeing poore, are uncapeable of this vexing torment.</p>

            <p>Now of all rules in Syntax this is the chiefe, to wit: <hi>Verba dandi ſunt praecipua in ſchola Amandi.</hi> And <hi>Verba promittendi ſunt optima juncta verbis ſolvendi:</hi> otherwiſe they are as bad as Imperſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls: But <hi>est pro habeo</hi> is a ſtrange rule; and <hi>Nomen praemii</hi> is of great eſteeme, and never is at reſt, till it reſt in <hi>Ablativa:</hi> This ſhee caſe is that which bagges up all this ſchoole; for my fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male traine no ſooner ſee one loaded with golden pockets, but they immediately ſalute him with an eaſement, ſaying, <hi>Ego hoc te faſce levabo</hi>; it is reaſon you ſhould doe ſo, anſwereth the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocke againe; becauſe <hi>Adjectivo et verba abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dandi, implendi &amp; onerandi Ablativo gaudent</hi>: and thus hee yeelds up the ſoules of his pockets for hopes of a ſmile, an embrace, or a kiſſe.</p>

as chiefe gods of this Claſſe: the one is <hi>Marcus Tullius Cicero</hi>; the other is <hi>Demuſthenes: Demoſthenes,</hi> you would ſay, anſwered I; No friend, it is <hi>Demuſthenes,</hi> the which you may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand if you but ponder the word, and reflect upon our inſtitution: wherefore I intending my eyes more earneſtly upon the object, found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> this motto: <hi>A nomine &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gento diſces</hi>: and under the other I read this: <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midium nominis non indiget Rhetoricâ.</hi>

ſubjects, as then his, and now hers, when I ſay ſuch a feaſt unites her will to his, then they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw and rhetorize in <hi>Similitèr cadens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee uſe no Metaphors, but all in private a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the women, for feare the men ſhould learne them; for ſeeing ſuch like tropes are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated from their Virgin ſenſe, and wreſted to ſound one thing in words, and another in deedes, they muſt bee ſhut up from the knowledge of ſo much cunning; and therefore wee ſatisfie them with a certaine number of figures, as <hi>figurae per additionem,</hi> which are the true touch-ſtone of a generous mind; likewiſe wee inuſe them with thoſe <hi>per ſimilitudinem,</hi> to pricke them on with the conceit of dignity, if they imitate thoſe that are moſt liberall, ſetting it downe for a principle, that he cannot be a good and exquiſite Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, that maketh not an oſtentation of his <hi>larga manus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the women are expert both in tropes and figures; tropes to delude their adorers, who ſuppoſe their reall words to bee full or reall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when as they onely commit a few comple<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments more to enflame their ſimplitians heartes, and to feed their owne toyiſh fancy, then any reality; for they abhorre it worſe then the poxe.</p>
            <p>All figures which come <hi>per detractionem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the women, as <hi>Diſſolutio, Refractio,</hi> and many more <hi>ejuſdem farinae,</hi> all takers and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their ſervants ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>We practice alſo in Topickes, and firſt we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne with <hi>Notatio, ſive Etymologia,</hi> which is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95030:24"/>
both according to us and <hi>Cicero,</hi> defined, <hi>Inda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio originis</hi>: and by this we ſearch out the true primitive of our courtiers, and provide his place correſpondently. I doe not meane, that wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt and dignifie him according to his parentage, but his patrimony: for if he bee of a great eſtate, he is preſently annexed to the topick <hi>à Cauſis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilioribus</hi>; becauſe the cauſe of greateſt prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here, is that which proceedeth out of the nobility of riches; and thus we draw him on with the plauſible appearance and evident probability, that he ſhal practice the topick <hi>à conjugatis,</hi> when wee but onely delude him with a Rhetoricall ſlight, extracting in the interim the very marrow of his purpoſe, &amp; ſo leave him in the perceivance of that <hi>à Contrariis</hi>: ſo that he poring upon that <hi>ab effectibus,</hi> findes himſelfe ſo ignorant and uncap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of the ſweet topick <hi>de adjunctis,</hi> that he falles into the woefull knowledge of <hi>Repugnantia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The cheife argumentation wee uſe in this our Rhetoricall claſſe, is either framed by a <hi>Sorites,</hi> or <hi>Dilemma.</hi> By <hi>Sorites,</hi> to make the pretendents ſtrive in generoſitie, we protract our diſcourſe in this wiſe. Hee that giveth moſt, findes moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructers, (or deſtructers) he that finds moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructers profiteth moſt, he that profiteth moſt, taketh moſt degrees; therfore, <hi>à primo ad ultimum,</hi> he that giveth moſt, taketh moſt degrees: but yet after this induction or graduall deceite we argue ſecretly <hi>per violationem,</hi> and beginne our orative compoſition, of which we have two kindes, to wit, <hi>Oratio demonſtrativa,</hi> by which the ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited wretch explicates &amp; demonſtrates at large
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95030:24"/>
the perfections of his beſt wiſhed objects, and the men are obliged to ſay nothing more, then what they can make manifeſt by proofe, yet they are tyed to inſiſt upon the prayſe of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, and if they betwixt ignorance and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, chance to ſinne againſt truth (as oft they doe) through the furious apprehenſion of their unlawfull Hyperbolies, and are confuted of it, then wee make their purſes fetch off the fine, which their eagerneſſe led them into: for ſuch kinde of Oratours are forced to ſatisfie the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with giftes for the wrong they have done in belying her beautie, modeſty, diſcretion, or the like.</p>
            <p>The women, when they have received preſents either from the obliged or voluntieres, they Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torize <hi>in oratione deliberativa,</hi> deliberating whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their ſervants deſerved for this, or no; and in this kind of diſcourſe they are ſo witty, beeing ſtill ayded with dilemmicall arguments, that they catch and let looſe againe as often as they pleaſe, and in ſo dubious a manner, that their ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Auditors become no leſſe ready to preſent againe, then drowned in confuſion which way to interpret the reality of their Miſtreſſes ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Some times my females aſcend the Pulpit provided with <hi>oratio funebris,</hi> but this only when a rich Devotiſt ſudainely departs this life, and leaves his Miſtris heire of all; then ſhee laments his death in words filling the ayre with lacryma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſyllables, although her heart leapeth for joy and alacrity, that he is gone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:95030:25"/>The women alſo extend their voyces in <hi>genere orationis demonſtrativo,</hi> but moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when their impoveriſhed ſervants faile to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their amorous ſuites, they uſe the oration in <hi>vituperium,</hi> which they freely beſtow upon thoſe vagabondes that have ſo long beene ſlaves to their wills and their owne misfortunes.</p>

            <p>But, ſaid I, why did not the Matron beginne with <hi>Vniverſale in communi</hi>; becauſe, anſwered <hi>Cupid,</hi> it is and muſt be a ſtranger to all men that frequent my Vniverſity; for you know <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale in commuini ex ſe non deſcendit ad particularia,</hi> which amongſt us is more abhorred then any thing elſe; as for example, hee that is Vniverſall in all kind of wealth, and deſcends not to preſent this ſome of money, that jewell, or ſo, ſuch a man is termed <hi>Vniverſale in communi,</hi> whom we intreate to favour us with his abſence, becauſe his preſence is <hi>cane pejus &amp; angue:</hi> notwithſtanding the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males are acquainted with this <hi>Vniverſale,</hi> in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we inſtruct them in private conference: and the reaſon why they are more familiar with it, then the men, is, becauſe they muſt yeeld as little as poſſible may be to their courteous requeſts, and

            <p>Next to this follovves the laſt antepredica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall lecture, vvhich vve terme <hi>praedicatio</hi>; and this is tvvofold; vvhich is <hi>concretum</hi> &amp; <hi>abſtractu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Firſt therefore know, that we are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the opinion of <hi>Ariſtole,</hi> and therefore wee teach not ſo many predicaments as he doth: but yet <hi>praedicamentum ſubſtantiae,</hi> as it is the prime with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſo is it with us, and ſo neceſſary, that what pretendent ſoever is not furniſhed with <hi>ſubſtantia,</hi> is excluded totally out of the predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Love.</p>
            <p>The predicament of quantitie is in exceeding eſtimation amongſt us, and he is only judged ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, proper, and compleate in all parts, that is furniſhed with the greateſt quantity of gold or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther treaſure, and without this he is more defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med then Cerberus, the contemptibleſt picture
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95030:28"/>
they can fixe their eyes upon, whom wee terme <hi>minimum naturale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Praedicamentum qualitatis</hi> is of no more rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning here, then a penny leſſe purſe; for wee never enquire of the quality of the man, but the quantity he brings with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Relatio</hi> is very famous in our ſchoole, and it is defined (according to the ancient and full expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Philoſophers opinion) <hi>Relatio dicitur il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lud, quod id quod eſt, aliarum eſſe dicitur</hi>: by this definition it moſt manifeſtly appeareth, that all the men have belongeth properly to the women: peruſe it ſeriouſly and you will eaſily conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame: <hi>Relatio dicitur iluld,</hi> Relation is that thing, to wit that ſubſtance, which, what or how great ſoever it be, it is to bee appropriated to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to the women, which is evident by the word <hi>aliarum</hi>; &amp; not to be delivered back againe, becauſe wee admit not of any relation, but that which is <hi>non mutua</hi>; and although all bee in one ſchoole, yet all have not the ſame ſtep of dignitie: but hee is in the firſt and moſt eminent place, <hi>qui in pretioſiori quantitate fundat relationem ſuam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now if I ſhall name that predicament, which maketh all the reſt nameleſſe, let me ſay no more but <hi>Habere</hi>: for this is it to which all other are reduced, they all ſleepe in this haven; if you will know more then ever <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did, you neede no more then the predicament <hi>habere: habere</hi> mollifies the hardeſt rocke, the flinty heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes fluid if but touched with the diamond <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere; habere</hi> is ſufficient to conquer impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:

            <p>And although wee could reduce not onely all the predic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

and impatient of the expectation.</p>
            <p>But yet we admit of one Verbe, which is <hi>est,</hi> becauſe it is a verbe ſubſtantive, or a ſubſtantiall Verbe; but this Verbe <hi>eſt,</hi> is never in its prime, untill it be ſet for <hi>habeo.</hi> Wee uſe <hi>verbum</hi> oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, but not as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth, for a verbe, but for a word, as a conjunction, becauſe <hi>Verbum à verbero derivationem accipit,</hi> and the beſt ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding word to the Petitioner is the free mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllable Yes, which cauſeth the malevolent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, No, to be excommunicated out of Loves limits; becauſe we teach no contradictions, nor contraries, but terme the denyall of a Petition, to be degenerous and want of true education: for ſuppoſe a woman ſhould crave of her Curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan this or that ring, jewell, or the like, what an abſurd ſound would the baſe and harſh ſound of No, or I will not, make? nay, although hee ſhould put it off with an Excuſe mee, yet would it be taken for ſo heinous a crime, that his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris vvould ever after excuſe her ſelfe from his preſence.</p>
            <p>But now to ſpeake ſomething of the Tract <hi>De arte inveniendi medii,</hi> which wee othervviſe call <hi>Pons aſinorum,</hi> this is all framed of pretious ſtones, vvhoſe cement is gold and ſilver; the Aſſe that is able to build this Bridge, <hi>invenit me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> he finde out the middle, which he ſo long ſolicited and ſought for: but the other crew of weaker ſillies beſtovv all their labour and coſt in vaine, becauſe they ſhall never attaine to the depth of that <hi>punctum reflectionis.</hi>

            <p>The peruſall of this tetraſtick ſtruck mee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into a difficulty, whereupon I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned my ſelfe to ſtay the God, and asked him, why and how Gold could be called the matter in this Tract, ſince that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the firſt Booke of Phyſicks, ſaith, that matter or <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria prima eſt chaos, caeca farrago,</hi> or <hi>rudis indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt aque moles:</hi> So is Gold, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> it is a Chaos, becauſe you ſee it confounds all men; it is <hi>caecum, quiareddit omnes caecos propter ejus amorem</hi>: it is alſo rude, becauſe it makes moſt that poſſeſſe it rude and vitious.</p>
            <p>It is very certaine, ſaid I, but <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> treates here <hi>de primis principiis; de illis, ſcilicet, quae primo conſtituunt compoſitum naturale.</hi> It is very
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95030:31"/>
true, anſwered <hi>Cupid,</hi> and for that cauſe I have often ſaid, that we exempt our ſelves from being ſtrict <hi>Ariſtotelians</hi>: For you muſt know, that we are already actuated or formed according to Natures compoſition; and therefore, as I even now ſaid, this Schoole is not properly called <hi>De phyſico auditu,</hi> but <hi>De Cupidine auditu</hi>: and therefore, ſince nature hath made us perfect in the firſt mixtion, wee account it frivolous, to ſearch or repeat that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out for us, that is, by what meanes it came to paſſe, what concurrence was uſed, and the like: but now wee ſearch that which is moſt ſemblant and agreeable to our condition, I meane our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: and becauſe Gold and other treaſure are ſubſtances and naturall mixtures, as theſe my females and maſculine flock be, ſpeaking of that which belongeth to naturall compoſition, and abſtracting from the formall perfection of this or that, onely inſiſting on thoſe ingredients which are matter and forme, deriving their generating cauſe from one and the ſame body as an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall cauſe, which is <hi>calor ſolis,</hi> I find no difference, but a great ſimilitude: and therefore wee ſet downe Gold and ſuch like eſtimable ſubſtances to be the matter of this our Phyſicall ſtudy, and oblation to be the forme, without which our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is to no purpoſe, nor the compoſition which we ſweat for is no compoſition, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oblation there is no union, no complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive actuality, which wee call <hi>Completio amoroſa</hi>: theſe therefore, as I have ſaid, <hi>ſunt principia per ſe noſtra phyſicae, &amp; totius philoſophiae</hi>; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imports
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95030:31"/>
as much as I had ſaid of our naturall appetite, becauſe <hi>Cupid</hi> or <hi>Cupido</hi> is the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive guide herein.</p>
            <p>With this anſwer, although it was not <hi>ab eſſentia rei petita,</hi> but a meere diverſion, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be overtedious to the God of Love, I reſted as if I had beene fully ſatisfied; upon the pauſe whereof wee entred the Claſſe. I could diſcover few or none here, that were not in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and paſſion; the Courtiers giving, and the Courtiereſſes receiving. In the midſt of this Hall lay many heaps of Gold, Silver, Diamonds, and other ſorts of treaſure, at the reſplendant glory whereof I was almoſt diſtracted: at which <hi>Cupid</hi> (perceiving my amazement) asked mee what I thought of this ſo beauteous a Treaſure-houſe.</p>
            <p>To whom I ſaid, this is the practicall part of yon Logick Claſſe: Why ſo? ſaid <hi>Cupid:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, anſwered I, my fancie apprehends all theſe laborious aſſes to be buſied in the ſtudy <hi>De in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventione medii</hi>; and theſe heapes of Gold and pretious ſtones I take to be the materials with which they intend to build their <hi>pons aſinorum</hi>: No, no, anſwered <hi>Cupid,</hi> this <hi>aggregatum per accidens</hi> is our Philoſophers ſtone, and thoſe that concurre not to the augmenting and raiſing up of theſe beauteous Banckes, theſe Phebean hillocks, theſe Love-ſtarres, which the World termes Earths Planets, for the uncertaine Manſion they have to dwell with this or that amorous Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan, thoſe, I ſay, that adde not to theſe Idols, are not taken to be Lapidary men, but a certaine
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95030:32"/>
kinde of <hi>jumenta,</hi> or rather <hi>bomenta,</hi> which are commonly called Eunuches, becauſe they ſhall never make uſe of their intayle, for that they adde not the previall diſpoſition which makes the formall connection: for indeed my females ſay, that ſuch kinde of Pedlers ſhall not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Shop, unleſſe they had ready money, becauſe they never uſe to truſt any man in that kinde.</p>
            <p>Then I intreated <hi>Cupid</hi> to better my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding with ſome inſtructions of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that was obſerved in this Schoole, who freely began in this manner. <hi>Phyſica</hi> is as much as to ſay <hi>natura</hi>: and therefore this Schoole and ſtudy is of naturall things; neither is there any one that truly endeavoureth in this Science, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee loveth it; for this is the generating of wiſdome, by reaſon of which he is called a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher; and for no other cauſe, then that he is a lover of wiſdome. This ſuppoſed, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that all here muſt of neceſſity be Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers (as for naturalliſts or Phyſitians, it is moſt evident by the Tract, that they be the ſame) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not onely lovers, but alſo lovers of wiſdome. I was not able to containe my ſelfe within the limits of ſilence, but I injected obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the difficulty which met my attention, as I gazed upon <hi>Cupids</hi> preamble, ſaying: It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares unto me (pardon my bold attempt, O di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Cupid</hi>) that you give theſe your Diſciples a falſe appellation, in calling them Philoſophers; and my judgement rather names them Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chryſers, becauſe their ſtudy is onely of Gold

and treaſure, as the portall ſcript manifeſteth, and not of wiſedome.</p>
            <p>You ſay well in giving them this Character; but yet you are extremely deceived, anſwered <hi>Cupid,</hi> if you rob them of the name of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; for in this Claſſe the men ſtudy and contemplate of the beauty of their Goddeſſes, and the women of the beauty of their riches; this beauty (for ſure there is beauty in both) is a celeſtiall gift flowing from the will of the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wiſdome, and in this reſpect I ſee no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent reaſon can debar them from being truly ſtiled reall Philoſophers; nay more, there is not one gemme, a piece of gold or ſilver, or any eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing elſe that my Damſels ſtretch their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to compaſſe, but they deſcant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the beauty, valuation, and perfections thereof, extolling gold above ſilver, and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds above gold, not onely for that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſtitution of men hath given this an aſcent in value above that, but alſo for the poynant ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, qualities, and ſuperiour qualities contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in one, more then in the other: can you then impugne me with a negation, that theſe are not true Philoſophers, and this true Philoſophy? and therefore to wipe away clearly the blot in your clouded apprehenſion, and reſtore you to your intellectuall ſight; you muſt know, that our gallants admiring the beauteous blaze of their Miſtreſſes &amp;c. they ſtudy how to gratifie ſo much worthineſſe with condigne <hi>praemiums,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finde it neceſſary to dive into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Philoſophy to arrive at the true
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95030:33"/>
Science of all perfections contained in theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ornaments, theſe pretious metals, and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an luſtres; and having obtained the verity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they make the moſt worthy to become pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents or ſpeakers to interpret their Maſters wills; and this is the end of their Philoſophy, to offer homage in theſe to their moſt amiable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>And the beauteous Minions likewiſe gratifie their ſervants with vertuous ſmiles, modeſt looks, affable ſpeeches, celeſtiall glances, curteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and ſiſter-like embraces, which could not be performed but by wiſdomes permiſſion, which they likewiſe underſtand and perfectly know: neither is our Philoſophicall Science haled by ſo forraine a reduction, but affirmative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is a true limbe of Philoſophy, ſuch as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke is; for it really includeth wiſdome, and therefore is ſufficient to ſtile our proficients <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phi,</hi> and <hi>ſophae,</hi> who being alſo Lovers, why ſhould wee doubt to call them <hi>Philoſophi</hi> and <hi>Philoſophae,</hi> or lovers of wiſdome.</p>
            <p>But, ſaid I, you involve me in another cloud, becauſe you ſeeme to contradict your former diſcourſe, where you ſay the women practice vertue, modeſty, and ſuch good attributes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your females now licentiates, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not bound to obſerve theſe rules. It is true, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> but yet you finde not that they are prohibited to uſe the ſame: Moreover, if you reflect your eye upon the antecedent Claſſe, you ſhall finde, that the women are Sophiſters or Fallatians, who with their artificiall veiles ſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95030:33"/>
blinde the eyes of their Enamoriſts, that they take this coyned ſhew of vertue to be reall, when it is onely apparent and not durable, a meere fiction, and nothing but ſuperficiall: for who will ſeeme more modeſt and vertuous, then ſhee that intends to deceive, and under this pretence the deceit paſſeth more eaſily, becauſe it is not ſuſpected at all.</p>
            <p>But I pray you let us proceed, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> for we have many Schooles to viſite, and times Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot wheeles away with great ſpeed. Content, quoth I, for I am ſory I detained you ſo long from your deſire. Then, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> you know our Schooles are the Schooles of Intereſt, where the women aime at treaſure, the men at beauty, and both at pleaſure: the men aime at the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of beauty and pleaſure without reſpect of gold, or any riches hee can attaine unto, which makes ſo many of them to ſing the ſecond part of their life in a new and lamentable tune, to wit, for Gods ſake cloath my nakedneſſe, for Chriſt his ſake relieve my hungry and thirſty ſoule. The women aime at riches and pleaſure, without regard of beauty; for let him be a Moore or Gypſie that courts them, if hee bring the golden key, hee unlockes their modeſties Cloſet doore, and enters as freely, as a knowne Puritane into his owne Congregation: Nay, I dare be bold to avouch, that if ſuch a pretendent had a bottle noſe as big as a bunch of Grapes of ten pounds, a ruby chin, a ſtrawberry paire of cheeks, a vermil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian fore-head, a breath more odious then his Miſtreſſes cloſe ſtooles lining, and a head as bare
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95030:34"/>
as a Cabbage, let him be ſet forth with all theſe deformities, and have but a golden hand, he ſhall be admitted and have free entrance into her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate preſence, and act what part he deſires, that hath beene found in the comedies of pleaſure: But the truly handſome, compleat, and merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that cannot ſhew the face of a <hi>Jacobus,</hi> ſhall live a-loofe from <hi>gratia dei,</hi> the grace of our good liking; hee ſhall paſſe by for <hi>vas vacuum,</hi> and be embarked in the Ship of ſcorne, to bee conducted to the Haven of heavineſſe, and thruſt upon the ſhore of, Never returne againe. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at this diabolicall inſtitution, ſaid to <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,</hi> no doubt but I am perpetually engaged to your Deities bounty, becauſe I perceive you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by this diſcourſe to deterre me from ever erring in the way of loving, or engaging my ſelfe to any Harpy in the world.</p>
            <p>Be not too audaciouſly confident, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> preſume not any thing of my mercy; for by this I teach thee to defie all females, and pricke thee on to lay hold of a thriving courſe, that when thou art growne ſubſtantiall and ſtrong in purſe, I may boult thee into my family once more, to conſume thy ſelfe, as thou haſt already done. When thou haſt effected what induſtrious labor may ſweepe up for thee, then let the ſecond effect be a true teſtimony of my power; for the poore ſtate of my preſent fortune is not capable of my Dart. But to returne to our purpoſe, liſten, and I will declare the Lawes of this Schoole.</p>
            <p>This Phyſicall appropriation, which we here ſimilize under the ſhapes of Peripateticks, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95030:34"/>
to ſhew, in diſciphering the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our Doctrine and the Ariſtotelians, and in what points wee accord: They hold, that there are foure cauſes, <hi>materialis, formalis, efficiens, &amp; finalis,</hi> and ſo doe we: with us the materiall and formall are chiefe, with them the efficient and finall.</p>
            <p>The materiall cauſe with us (as I have ſaid) is treaſure, which facilitates the intent of the amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous pretendent: it cauſeth affection to waite upon its glory; it proſtrates the Virgin, and therefore compells the inſatiable ſtrumpet to fly into the golden embraces of her ſervants will: and if this yellow footed youngſter treads but upon the toe of a wife, he makes her to forget her nuptiall duty, being ſo unreſiſtably inveagled with the luſtre of this Intereſt: this makes the Raven white, and curtaines up day in a thorall rug before the Sunne hath run halfe his diurnall courſe. Even <hi>Plato,</hi> and hee that lookes thorow as many Dogges faces, as <hi>Cerberus,</hi> ſeeme more lovely then <hi>Adonis,</hi> or <hi>Hylas, Alcides</hi> boy, if he be but attired with this bracelet of plenty: Why then ſhould not this our materiall cauſe be chief, and moſt excelling, ſince it beares moſt ſway and efficacity: but yet it is not compleat without oblation, which is the formall cauſe, which is that comfortable preſentment, that unites the ſoule of the receiver to the thing received, and in that conſiſteth the formality of our Schooles of Intereſt: as for the efficient cauſe, it is the ſame with the formall, becauſe the formall effects, whether it be <hi>efficiens principalis,</hi> or the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95030:35"/>
alarmes ſo full of ſweetneſſe and delight, <hi>cauſa inſtrumentalis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for <hi>cauſa finalis</hi> the women have none, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no end of their deſire, that appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive quality called <hi>auri ſacra fames</hi>: neither is there any finall cauſe for the men, untill their ſubſtance is conſumed, and nothing left to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to obtaine correſpondence with their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, for they hold this adage: <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit; ergo ubi non eſt aliquid dari, non opus eſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione finali.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>De continuo continuè agimus,</hi> and hee that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in giving, is ſupreme in this Claſſe; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any ceſſation to be admitted of, for he that will continue his correſpondence, muſt continue alſo his liberall practice. The <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuum</hi> which we treat of, is not that which <hi>Zeno,</hi> the Pythagorians, and many modernes now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes define, but that of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who ſayes, that <hi>Continuum componitur ex partibus, non ex in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſibilibus,</hi> as they ſaid; for theſe <hi>indiviſibilia non faciunt quantum; ergo nec indiviſibilia apud nos facere poſſunt acervum, ergo rejicienda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I deſired <hi>Cupid</hi> to tell me what he meant by his <hi>indiviſibilia</hi>; theſe are, ſaid he, thoſe poore diminutives, which others call pence; for wee are of opinion, that pence are ſo ſmall a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that he who beginneth and continueth in giving pence, ſhall be ſo long before he make a ſumme worthy to be received, that hee ſhall tire his Miſtreſſe ſo extreamely with long expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſhee leaves him, giving him a generall acquittance for ever entring the Schooles of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95030:35"/>
to pay any ſuch dribling debts hereafter; for our <hi>continuum</hi> is compoſed of parts, which the groſſer they be the better they compoſe; theſe parts are five pounds, ten pounds, twenty, and ſo, when they have mounted to an hundred pounds, or the worth thereof, then we ſay they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in <hi>continuo</hi>; and if he deſire it, he paſſeth to the proofe <hi>quomodo dua corpora poſſunt eſſe in uno loco</hi>; and at the end of this followes <hi>vacuum,</hi> which is proved <hi>ex parte viri,</hi> he having emptied his purſe, which drawes into the conſequent tract, which is <hi>infinitum multitudinis ex parte mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieris</hi>; for the evacuation of his bagges is the increaſe of her heape, <hi>quod nos vocamus infinitum ſyncategorematicum, quoniam per additionem fit, cujus non eſt terminus finalis, licet principium habu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit:</hi> And when this ſilly is ſhrived of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, my females make his Mittimus, and ſend him to the Jayle called <hi>Terminus minimus quod non:</hi> that is, hee ſhall be the leaſt termer with us, <hi>quòd non habet unde dare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſaid, <hi>Cupid</hi> drew a curtaine, which diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a leſſer Schoole, wherein I eſpied upon an Ebony Pulpit theſe words inſcribed:

            </p>
            <p>This is a pedagogicall Schoole, or a ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of <hi>Phyſica,</hi> where the true and moſt cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall concluſion is, <hi>Generatio unius eſt corruptio

            </p>
            <p>But yet you muſt know, that this Treatiſe of ours is not that which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> explicates, <hi>De generatione viventium,</hi> but <hi>De generatione mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum,</hi> that is, <hi>gazarum &amp; nummulorum:</hi> and if at any time this vitall generation ſucceedes, it is termed in our Schoole, <hi>Per accidens, &amp; non ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum intentum primarium &amp; principale doctrinae noſtrae:</hi> And in caſe my unexperienced Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels ſhould give occaſion, or yeeld to their amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous embracers motions, and ſo ſlippe into this doctrine, then incontinently they are ſent to the Claſſe <hi>de medicina,</hi> as having a neceſſited co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence with that practice; for <hi>Vbi deſinit Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicus, incipit medicus:</hi> but if they are not in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of protuberation, they aſcend to the Schoole where wee teach and treate of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors.</p>
            <p>Wee paſſe over many queſtions which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> and other Philoſophers have dilated: and one of the chiefe that the men are doctrinated in, is <hi>de actione &amp; reactione,</hi> that action produceth beſt liking, that is diamondall, or all Diamond, the next is the golden action, which the more often it is reacted, the more it pleaſeth: and without this kindneſſe of reaction we ſhould not hold condenſation of our treaſure heapes, and rarifaction of our Courtiers coyne; were it not for reaction, there would be no mixtion; for

                  <l>To contemplate the wonders of the skye:</l>
                  <l>We bring them down to earth from that high pearch,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I followed <hi>Cupid</hi> into this ſpatious roome, where I beheld not ſo few as a thouſand Mines, at the mouthes of which men aſcended and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, as if they had beene Bees: This, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> is the Schoole of Meteors; where wee chiefly intend not <hi>de illis, quae in ſublimi gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur, ſed potius de ſubterraneis; de foſsilibus nimirum, &amp; metallorum liquabilium extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I obſerved an infinite multitude with Comets in their hands, expecting to receive the 2ſweet that dropped from their enamoriſts ſweat, who ſtill came loaded with gold and ſilver over, marching towards their Miſtreſſes with every one a Torch of <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> in their hands: ſome came and went accompanied with their <hi>caprae ſaltantes,</hi> others with <hi>draco volans,</hi> and many with <hi>ignis lambens,</hi> and to ſpeake all, it was a true <hi>ignis lambens</hi> in the womens hands, for that it licked away all the fruits of their poore endeavours, labour and toile.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:95030:37"/>This great and mighty Vault was ſo furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the terrifying wonders, which uſe to appeare in the skies, that I ſeemed ſomething ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous to proceed; and in fine, <hi>Cupid</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my cautious ſteppes to loſe their accuſtomed diſtance, ſaid to me, be not amazed man, for theſe Luminaries can no wayes prejudice an old Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; therefore walke with me, and I will declare the meaning of them.</p>
            <p>And pointing at one of the women that held in her hand <hi>Flamma,</hi> or <hi>Fax</hi>; that, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> is an inflammation which endureth but a ſhort time, and for that cauſe ſhee holdeth it in her hand, as you ſee, to notifie that her Lovers Mine is almoſt at an end: beyond them are <hi>Caprae ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes,</hi> which ſignifies the mirth and joy which the newly honoured Girles take, for that their ſervants have newly found out a Golden Mine: thoſe that you ſee of your left hand with <hi>Stellae cadentes,</hi> are the ſignification of thoſe that have fallen into poverty and purſe-lameneſſe, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing too farre for their Miſtreſſes ſakes: Some men carry <hi>Lanceae,</hi> to ſignifie their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in behalfe of their deareſt; others negotiate with <hi>ſidera diſcurrentia,</hi> to ſhew their diligence to procure their faireſt her deſire: Many more wee have, as <hi>Caſtor,</hi> and <hi>Pollux, ignis perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris, trabs, Helena, columnae pyramidales,</hi> and ſuch like, which are very uſefull for the unbowelling of the earths fertile wombe, to diſcover the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and beſt pleaſing mettles.</p>
            <p>Then he brought me to a ſea, as I imagined, for although it was not Ocean-like, yet it was
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95030:37"/>
ſalt, and therefore I ſuppoſed it to be an arme of the Sea: Here, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> we treat not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly of the nature of the Sea, its ebbing and flowing, ſaltneſſe, and ſuch like qualities and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, as wee doe concerning the ſeverall ſorts of jewels herein, and the vertue contained in them: It was a wonderfull ſight to behold loves Mer-maids as they ſate by the ſhore ſide, and the dexterity of their ſervants that dived into the bottome to ſearch for pearle, Rubie, Saphir, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amond, and ſuch like eſtimative Gemmes; and if perchance one of the miſtaken divers ſhould unwarily preſent unto his expecting Miſtreſſe a ſtone of little or no value, ſhee preſently would caſt ſuch a cloud over her cleareneſſe, made all grim and horrid with frownes, that the affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted puffin immediately pulled the water over his head, to vaile himſelfe in that coole Element from the heat of her diſdaine.</p>
            <p>And at this <hi>Cupid</hi> ſaid, let us now paſſe to the Schoole <hi>De medicina,</hi> at which I asked him, if there were nothing in theſe his Philoſophicall Schooles <hi>De coelo &amp; mundo.</hi> Yes, anſwered <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,</hi> wee have much <hi>De mundo,</hi> and of this wee treat in every Claſſe, becauſe it is the prime and chiefe intent of our whole Vniverſity; for this <hi>De mundo</hi> is not onely <hi>conditio, ſine qua non,</hi> but <hi>ex eſſentia noſtrae philoſophiae:</hi> for if it were not for the treaſure of this inferiour world, our Schooles of Intereſt would be but dumbe caves, fitter for lamenters then lovers.

            <p>The intelligence of this Letter had no ſooner appeared in my apprehenſion, but I entred the place of Medicinall practice, where I beheld a thouſand beauties, whoſe profeſſion I could eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine to be <hi>De medicina,</hi> or <hi>Cupids</hi> Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliſts although I had not beene informed of the ſame by the Portall ſcripture, for that they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to kill with the <hi>Recipe</hi> of their eyes, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Phyſitians with their druggiſh receipts: and I dare affirme that the effectuall execution of thoſe bits of paper in which they write their poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous receipts, bereave more of vitality, then warres, famine, and the Gallowes.</p>
            <p>This ſpacious Hall had ſcarce received mee, when the Batcheloniſts, Licentiates and Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toreſſes flocked about mee, ſuppoſing the God had brought me in to be cured of a love ſick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and ſurrounding me in a ring, deſired to feele my pulſe, to whom I bowing in a curteous and thankfull manner, ſtretched forth my arme, at which they all burſt ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

by the pulſe of the purſe, they can eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver whether the infirmity be remediable, or in probabilities to be cured.</p>

            <p>Although I heard the terrifying noyſe of this their mortall ſentence, yet was I not aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed at all, partly becauſe I knew my infirmity was a conſumption, and partly becauſe the longs of my eſtate were quite ſpent, and laſt of all becauſe I was over-growne with the Leproſie of deſpaire, that I ſhould never ſee my owne happy proſperity in this world, and therefore deſired, and wiſhed for my better fortune in the next.</p>

This Gallery was compleatly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95030:39"/>
furniſhed with great ſtore of beds, and every bed had on it a ſick perſon, who after a ſmall time of repoſe ſtill aroſe walking male diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and as they men walked, they repeated continually theſe words, <hi>Terminus ambulationis eſt cauſa ſanitatis</hi>; the ſence whereof I preſently underſtood; for the terme of their walke was a viſitation beſtowed upon their ſeated atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, ever preſenting ſome thing of worth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, at the receiving of which the Doctor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes told them, that they were better then before, and preſcribed unto them a walke in Loves Garden; wherby I could not compare theſe Love-ſicke wretches to any but priſoners, for before they ſallied forth into the ſerene and wholſome ayre, they were continually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in new charges, neither could they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this freedome, untill they had payed not onely the ſumme they are damnified in, but alſo fees to the Gardner.</p>
            <p>I obſerved that when theſe infirme perſons came to the Doctoreſſes for remedy, being deſperately ſicke, they tooke them by the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or purſes, by which they judged the diſeaſe, and if they gave ſpeedy pulſation, the Doctor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſes aſſured them of life and cure, but if their pulſes went uncertaine and intercadentally, they turned away, ſhooke their head, and ſaid, there is no hopes of recovery, your malady is greater then my charity, unleſſe you get a good ſtrong pulſe, we cannot cure you.</p>
            <p>I asked <hi>Cupid</hi> the cauſe that ſo many men were ſicke, and no women: yes, anſwered he,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95030:39"/>
wee have many women ſicke, although not ſuch a number as there be men; the reaſon is, the men are ſicke, becauſe they give not, and ſince there is an infinite number of men that refuſe to give, and not the tyth of women that deſiſt to aske, (for the want of asking is the womens diſeaſe) therefore wee have fewer women ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, then men: the men there are ſicke becauſe they either know not how to give, or elſe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to give after they participate of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge how, which is a more dangerous diſeaſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd of more difficulty to be cured: the women fall into ſickneſſe, becauſe they neglect to aske, but yet they recover at the next asking; although the men give five times, before they recover their perfect health, for as long as they give ſparingly, their recovery is prorogued; and hee that holds faſt his purſe, as if he were benummed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The reaſon of this is ſemblanced from that which <hi>Galen</hi> affirmeth in his Booke <hi>De partibus, &amp;c.</hi> that a knotted veine or ſinew hindereth microcoſmall operation; ſo that we, taking the purſe to be the ſubſtance and the ſtrings to be the veines or ſinewes thereof, judge a knotted paire of Purſe-ſtrings to hinder the operation of a Lovers health or happy embraces. Whilſt thus he diſcourſed, there preſented to our view two perſons, the one a man, the other a woman, and both very pale and weake, yet perceiving <hi>Cupid</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:95030:40"/>

            <p>Then curiouſly peruſing the proceedings of theſe miſerable captives; I eſpied one very meager, and almoſt as like a Ghoſt as my ſelfe, who was almoſt ſpent with an extreame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the purſe, whoſe heart-ſtrings were ſo fretted with the greedy vulture that preyed upon his coyne, that hee fainted at every turne; hee ſhewed the Doctoreſſes his water, which one of them tooke in her hand ſhaking it, the reſt looking on, imagining it to have beene <hi>aurum potabile,</hi> or <hi>argentum vivum,</hi> and when ſhee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that it was neither yellow, like gold, nor white, like ſilver, but meere ruddy or melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly muddy urine, ſhe threw it away, and ſaid, unleſſe you depart from hence preſently, and change the ayre, you are a dead man; for I finde you in ſuch a deſperate and dangerous ſtate, that I cannot endure to looke upon your miſery; and thus ſhe ſent him crawling away to recover his loſſes in a bottomleſſe ocean, fruſtrate of his intention.</p>
            <p>Another I obſerved that was very coſtive in the way of liberality, to whom a vizarded witch gave a gliſter, that made him ſo gild her hands, not with that kind of gold which comes forth of

There was another that had no ſtomacke (I meane to part with any thing) the ſame woman gave him but halfe a do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I entreated <hi>Cupid</hi> to tell me, which of all theſe ſicke perſone, that he now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Then we directed our ſteps into another Hall, at each end whereof was a ſhop, the one of them
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95030:41"/>
an Apothecary, the other of a Barber: the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary had in ſtore ſuppoſitories, injections, and many more ſuch like facilitations, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the hide-bound Caitives to a looſeneſſe, and ſupple freeneſſe: there were alſo divers ſorts of plaſters, which <hi>Cupid</hi> recounted to me, as <hi>Dia palma,</hi> and <hi>emplaſtrum divinum</hi> to make them as generous as the Gods themſelves: unguents in abundance, as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum baſilicon</hi> for the men, and <hi>Vnguentum album, &amp; unguentum aureum,</hi> to be given to the women: there were alſo ſirrups and conſerves, to be adminiſtred to thoſe that were become laxative; alſo Gargariſmes, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries, Preparatives, Antidotes, and all ſorts of purgations, and drugges neceſſary or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to expulſe and drive away the tedious and detaining humours of ſuch as were through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall or diſdaine become participants of Loves infirmary.</p>
            <p>In the other ſhop the Barbereſſes were very buſie in bloudding, cupping, leeching, ſcarifying, ſnipping, and cutting, whereby I perceived, that their condition was an extracting quality, ſtill to take away what they never intended to reſtore. I obſerved alſo, that theſe barbarous Barbareſſes never opened any veine, but the bloud flowed ſtill from <hi>Vena de arca:</hi> thoſe that were deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately handled with Feavors, as being cauſed from the inflammation of their Miſtreſſes beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, breeding a violent and inſupportable paſſion in the amorous ſpectator, were ſhaved in the crownes, blooded, clipped, and ſtripped even to the ſhirt, for feare they ſhould melt with ardor of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95030:41"/>
their owne heate, and in-bred fire, and thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed they were conducted to the coole bathes of repentance.</p>
            <p>This obſerved and ſeene, <hi>Cupid</hi> directed his courſe forth from theſe Leeches, and I ſteered after him without being ſhaved, for I had not one crowne, neither was I blooded, becauſe they could not finde the veine of my Arke; nor yet was I purged, for that all the humour of my coyne was conſumed; neither was I cured, but rather in more deſperate danger then heretofore, for that the tiſſicke of my ſhort-ſtring'd purſe had ſtopped my pores, that opened the way to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe and freedome. With this cogitation I arrived at an open paire of large gates, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting up my head, beheld this verſe taken out of the ſixth Booke of the Prophet <hi>Maro,</hi> the hundred twenty and ſeventh verſe:
<q>Noctes atque dies patet atri janui Ditis.<note place="margin">Loves Law Schoole.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And under the ſame was engraven this tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticon:
<q>
                  <l>The golden oyle makes glib the muteſt tongue,</l>
                  <l>If this appeare, no ſentence can doe wrong:</l>
                  <l>Shew not the weighty cauſe, but weighty coyne,</l>
                  <l>By this we judge the cauſe and ſuite is thine.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> the grand hall of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, where men are clyents, and women Lawyers, for whatſover the men put in, the womens Law ſtands: the clyents here, for the moſt part, are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95030:42"/>
rivalls, or ſuch as are accuſed of negligence in the caſe of giving; and hee that will caſt his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, muſt begin with a bribe, which wee call a gratuity or ingreſſe to the proceſſe of the ſuite: and if the <hi>Iſepriſe</hi> or <hi>niſi prius</hi> be preferred into the Court, before the party accuſed appeares, he is condemned in coſts, and immediately the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer is obliged to morgage his purſe untill hee obtaine a <hi>ſignificavi,</hi> and if the peccant delay to appeare, or at leaſt to put in his lawfull excuſe, then the pleader inſtructs the Judge ſo ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly againſt the ſame party, that the matter proceedes to a declaration, which is ever groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the <hi>a fide data,</hi> or <hi>Afidavi,</hi> and ſo the cauſe comes to an execution, and without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murring is brought to an attachement, which being ſerved by the accuſer, the peccant party is brought in, condemned of double coſts, and fined to pay unto his neglected Miſtreſſe a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred crownes ſterling, for the diſcurteſie he had done her; or elſe to be caſt into Loves dungeon, which is a place of obſcurity, whoſe walls are all painted and portratur'd with the viſage of diſdaine, his dyet being nothing but coy looke, contempt, reproach, and ſarcaſmall flou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Yet you muſt underſtand, that although the party that is caſt, is damnified, as I have related, yet the accuſer doth not eſcape free, for looke what the peccants charges ſurmount to, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95030:42"/>
is conſtrained to pay halfe ſo much to the Lawyers Box for the trouble and diſturbance in the Court: For as in other Common-wealths, he that conceales the crime of another man, is puniſhed by the Law, as being an ill member of the publike ſtate, ſo if we, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> diſcover a Lover that keepes ſecret the faults of another, he is puniſhed in purſe; and if hee accuſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent as ſoone as he perceiveth his malice, yet he eſcapeth not ſcot-free, becauſe he is bound to maintain the right and legality of our inſtitution; ſo that he that ſpeeds beſt, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth off with loſſe; for our Maxime is, <hi>Diſcordia minuit ſubſtantiam:</hi> and we hold another point, which is moſt rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly obſerved, that is, <hi>Qui damnum alterius quaerit, ipſe ſibi damnum parit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I noting in the middle of this Hall a paire of ſcales, asked <hi>Cupid</hi> the uſe of them, who anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by theſe wee give judgement, not that they ſignifie levell juſtice; but according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our legall rights: for in one ſcale wee lay the bribe or gratuitie, and in the other the adverſe cauſe, which if it be not accoſted with a greater ſumme then the gratuity of the other is, the cauſe flyes up, were it never ſo ponderous; for my profeſſors ſay, that a penurious cauſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver findes either good cloſe or clauſe; for if his caſe be not well fraught with ſubſtance, and cleare ſhining like the Diamond, wee judge it ſo airy and light, that none of my Counſellors will give directions in it, neither any Barreſter take it into the uttering mouth of his conſideration; for all done here is God-a-mercy penny, for hee that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95030:43"/>
is guarded with the greateſt Troope of Angels, is certainely proclaimed victor. But now, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> let us proceed, and becauſe time will not licenſe us to viſit my whole Univerſity, as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, for that the night is almoſt ſpent, you may obſerve the inſtitution of the reſt of my ſchooles, as we walke, and I will likewiſe give you ſome briefe notice of the ſame as wee paſſe: and now wee came to a port, which was thus portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <note place="margin">Loves Schoole of Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</note>If that to Mathematicks you will climbe,</l>
                  <l>You must aſcend up by the golden line;</l>
                  <l>Our perfect circles are thoſe ſolid things,</l>
                  <l>Poſy'd with <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> about the rings.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the grand entrance to the Schooles of Mathematicks, which hath many ports, for that it hath many ſeverall arts contained within the latitude of its infiniteneſſe: and this firſt is that which treateth of the elements Mathematicall, not much different from thoſe, which Euclide hath recommended to poſterity. We begin with <hi>linea recta,</hi> which is made of gold or ſilver wyer, which is never perfectly <hi>recta,</hi> untill it is in the poſſeſſion of the Mathematician Ladies: It is impoſſible for any ſtudent to prove <hi>dari triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum aequilaterum,</hi> unleſſe every angle be equally tipped with pure ductible gold, becauſe there is no true demonſtration where gold appeares not, neither can our young Gallants make good this principle, to wit, <hi>Omnis triangulus habet tres an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulos aequales duolus rectis,</hi> unleſſe the baſis bee of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95030:43"/>
gold, and the whole triangle be pointed with Diamonds; for by the baſis we are certified of the longitude of the reſt of the lines, and by the Diamonds we collect firſt the equality or diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pancie of the angles, which joyned together make juſt two ſtraight angles, which poſition rectifies the uncertaine lover ſo, that hee and his Miſtreſſe agree in one and the ſame opinion of infallibility, both becauſe ſhee enjoyeth the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure and all it containes, and hee the Science or experience of the ſame; but yet of all triangles, that which pleaſeth the women beſt is the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterall; the <hi>Iſoſchele</hi> is alſo in much requeſt, becauſe it hath one angle equall to one, and only one different; but the <hi>Scalenall</hi> triangle is of leaſt eſteeme, becauſe it conſiſteth both of three unequall lines, and as many angles, and therefore requireth moſt time and trouble in the verifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame; yet none of them all are refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe they are all beautified with a diamon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall luſtre.</p>
            <p>Of all angles, the acute angle is moſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and therefore he that preſents his offerings acutely and quicke, is accounted the beſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician; for the obtuſe angle, it is the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of a dull and ſlow Mathematitian; and for this reaſon we never prove any thing by the externe angles, which in triangles are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obtuſe, but onely what is contained within the figure evident to be ſeene.</p>
            <p>But yet you muſt know, that we treat not of lines indiviſible as <hi>Euclide</hi> doth, but <hi>De lineis ſubſtantialibus, quae quanto groſsiores, tanto ſunt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95030:44"/>
meliores, beatioreſque illi, qui eaſdem adferunt</hi>; for this reaſon we treat not of <hi>ſuperficies, ut ſuperficies eſt propriè,</hi> but of <hi>ſuperficies ſolidata,</hi> becauſe wee allow of nothing but what is ſolid, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>trinam habet dimenſionem</hi>: Now to come to a quadrate, which is thus defined, <hi>Quadratum eſt figura quadrifariàm anguloſa, cujus anguli ſunt aequales, &amp; recti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is never practiſed, but when foure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents or ſtudious amoriſts ſollicite the ſame female in an equality of engagement; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we terme them a quadrat, becauſe their libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gifts are ſtill preſented, as I may ſay, <hi>in aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librio,</hi> not one exceeding his corrivall; but when one out-ſtrips the reſt in generoſity, wee conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute this quaterniall crew to be a quadrangle, and no longer a quadrat, ever preferring him that is moſt bountifull and quick in freeneſſe of hand and heart before the reſt, and becauſe hee exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the quadrilaterall company, and draweth them on to imitate his actions, wee ſtile him the acute angle.</p>
            <p>But now to ſpeake of a difficult in Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, let us ſpeake of a circle, which being defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Omnium figurarum capaciſsimam eſſe,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt chargeable to be filled, but the moſt coſt is required, when you will attempt to finde out the center; for this being the chiefe ſecret in all this Claſſe, and onely in the womens pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to teach and inſtruct, and againe ſince it cannot be found out, but by the <hi>ſemidiameter,</hi> which is very apt to erre, unleſſe your Miſtris hold your compaſſe and rule, and guide your pen, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95030:44"/>
it is impoſſible to draw a ſtraight line from the circumference to the center which you deſire, becauſe the place, where you draw, is in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all agitation; and therefore to effect this, it is neceſſary you ſee her exceedingly, otherwiſe you ſhall not obtaine her favour or your owne freedome; nay, when by her direction, you have found out the center, yet when you experience againe, you muſt either bring your reward, or elſe you labour in vain to find out the ſame point. At the end of this diſcourſe wee came to the next Port, which was thus ſuperſcribed:
<q>
                  <l>If you in Fencing practice doe take guſt,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> our Fencing Schoole, whoſe wards, thruſts, back-blowes, venies, wipes, touches, croſſe-cudgelling, and under-pointed agility depend all of Mathematicall angles, ſuch as wee have above-mentioned; very eager and boiſterous are this active traine, but yet there is no danger of homicide: the order is, that men ſhall fence againſt women, who although they chance to make a thruſt againſt theſe weaker veſſels, and pierce them at leaſt two handfull deepe, yet the wound is not mortall, becauſe the men have provided a plaiſter of yellow ſalve, and a pretty quantity of <hi>unguentum argenteum,</hi> the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of which not onely eaſeth her of the wound ſhe felt, but ſo reſtores her, that ſhee is

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95030:47"/>
for all my haſte I glanced my eyes upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, where I remember it began:
<q>

            </p>
            <p>But what enſued, I never became capable to forget. Here appeared a great tumult, which was, as I apprehended, cauſed by a company of thread-bare ſharkes, that had Harpes, Viols, Lutes, Citernes, Cornets, and many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, by which I judged them Muſitians, and wondring at the novelty, I deſired <hi>Cupid</hi> to declare the reaſon why theſe men were debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of entrance into the Hall of Loves Muſick; hee reſolved my doubt, ſaying, although theſe appeare Muſitians, yet they appertaine not to the Quire of Loves Muſitians, but to that of <hi>Bacchus</hi>; for ſince the object of Muſicke <hi>Non conſtat ſolùm ex numeris, quos arithmetica docet, ſed ex numeris ſonoris</hi>; and theſe Bagge-pipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheek'd warriers, theſe fidling ſottiſh trencher-ſcrapers, whoſe object is not the perfection of this Science, but a deſire to gain a trifle to make themſelves drunke, wee exclude them out of our Traine, as fit retainers to the Phalernian God.</p>
            <p>For it is daily ſeene, that if they rub a crowne or ſo out of the guts of their baſe and trouble, or blow a beggery echo into the eares of their auditors, which ends with a what will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow; if they receive their expectation, it onely ſerves to conduct them through the next Taverne; for a Taverne as it is their mint
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95030:47"/>
houſe, where their mony is coyned, ſo is it their furnace to melt it over againe and againe, even untill halfe a crowne comes to a halfe penny; they will ſhoot a chain'd bullet, called a paire of groats, at the French But, and will hit the white ſo oft untill they cannot hit their way home: Sacke is their choiſe Nectar, and they love it better than their owne ſoules; they will never leave Sacke, untill they have ſackt out all their ſilver, nay nor then neither, for they will pawne their crowds for more Sacke: Claret is a noble Wine, for that it is of the ſame complexion that Noblemens coats be of, and therefore to furniſh their noſes with a hud of this tincture they ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letfie that promontory, to ſignifie they are ſuch or ſuch Noblemens Muſitians: the noyſe of glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is a ſweet harmony, which they delight much in; and when <hi>Bacchus</hi> is pleaſed to ſee ſport, then they begin to play the Taylors, cutting and ſlaſhing one anothers faces in the neweſt faſhion, and theſe are ſuch, whom you ſee, and whom the Statute confirmes to be vagabundall Rogues. Yet I doe not condemne all for theſe Bacchana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians ſakes; becauſe there are many that dedicate the intereſt of their inſtruments to my imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, making their way thorow my Mother <hi>Venus</hi> her Court, and all ſuch Devotiſts we enliſt in the Hall of Muſicke: for you muſt conſider, that our Lawes conſtitute peace and quiet repoſe; why ſhould we then expoſe our ſelves to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous fury of ebriety? you know many Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards had rather part from their bodies blood, then their purſe; why ſhould we therefore deſire
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95030:48"/>
ſuch company, if wee onely deſire the blood of the purſe, which they onely deſire to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the blood of the grape? The greateſt enemy we have is the Vſurer, and the next is this ſort of hide bound Lovers, who are a petty kind of uſurers, they make uſe of their gaines to make themſelves frantick; and therefore inſtead of teaching them our <hi>ut, re, mi,</hi> wee ſay, out reeling minſtrels; who retire in this diſtemper to the Man in the Moone, and from thence to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, where they leave their ſhirts in pawne to play the purſe-bearer in behalfe of the reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>And in ſpeaking this I perceived the poore ſhrugging pedicularians gang away like ſo many gagling wild Geeſe; at whoſe departure a ſweet warbling Girle ſtanding in a Balcone, tuned her Lute, and ſung this Ode:

            <p>This pleaſant Damſell had no ſooner ended her melody, but the knot of roguery was quite vaniſhed, and I began to aske of <hi>Cupid,</hi> what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod they obſerved, to which he anſwered in this manner:</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95030:49"/>
and better liked, then a briefe, which my females delight in for the quick ſignification the word imports, although the note amongſt other Muſitians is extended to a whole time; a ſemi-briefe is better allowed of for that which belongs to time, although of leſſe eſteeme for the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball ſignification; a crotchet is good, if it make up the time with crownes inſtead of notes: qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and ſemiquavers, and ſuch like are to bee admitted with much caution, by reaſon of the trembling condition which is ordinarily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the airy practice thereof; Minums are as much as <hi>mine</hi> or <hi>munera</hi>; and therefore the women doe not ſay <hi>minum,</hi> but <hi>mine, hum:</hi> our ſongs are all plaine, and tangible. Many ſorts of Inſtruments we uſe; the women play upon the Ho-boy, when they ſee their Gallants well furniſhed with gold, which they uſe for a call: Corrivals play upon the Cornet, which is a manifeſt ſigne their Miſtreſſe hath cornuted them: and when they have conſumed their ſtore, they are forced to play a mournfull Ditty upon the Band-whore; the Virgin-all is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument which my Damſels can ſcarce play of, becauſe their ſtrings are ſo apt to breake; wee have very few men, but they are experienced in the Vi-hole, and when they have almoſt ſpent their ſubſtance, then they begin to practiſe the Baſe: the men practice much of the Virgin-holes, which yeelds ſweet Harmony if the wyer be of gold, and the keyes of Diamond, and with this they adjoyne the Bag-pipe, becauſe it is a

his fortune the next New Moone, becauſe then ſhe preſents him with a paire of hornes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conjunctions</hi> creſcent and diminiſhing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that many gallant Dames ſhall increaſe in riches, and their adorers decreaſe in the purſe.</p>
            <p>The ſilver, golden, and gemmiſh Starres, are preſagers of proſperity; and for this reaſon the poore Lover is called diſaſtrous, becauſe his penury cannot reach to the knowledge or poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them.</p>
            <p>You Labourers, or Husbandmen in love, have a care that you manure your ground with good fatning, plow without bawkes, and ſowe thicke, if you deſire to reape any fruit by your endeavors, for hee that manures ſeldome, tilleth gowtily and ſowes the thin and light graine of promiſes or frivolous words, ſhall gather nothing but the unprofitable weedes of denyals.</p>
            <p>If Loves Husbandmen be married; they muſt obſerve ſtrictly the tillage and ſemination of that piece of Land that lyes next to their houſes; otherwiſe their Wives will teach them how to ride <hi>Taurus,</hi> and hold by his head inſtead of a bridle.</p>
            <p>Cloſe by the Signe <hi>Virgo</hi> ſtands <hi>Libra,</hi> to ſignifie, that <hi>Virgo</hi> hath ſomething to ſell, but if you intend to buy of the beſt, bring with you your <hi>libra argenti,</hi> and then you ſhall not neede to dodge, but clap up your bargaine with onely ſaying, Here is your price.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Sol</hi> in <hi>Aquario</hi> is a ſwimmer, and foretells that he may adventure to ſwim in the Ocean of Loves embraces, who can make an Hydaſpian River towards his <hi>Venus. Quid non mortalia pectorae co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git auri ſacra fames?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Sol</hi> in <hi>Cancro</hi> ſeldome promiſeth benevolence, but of the womens part clowdy and obſcure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, for our Aſtronomers prognoſticate ill omen to all thoſe that enter whilſt this aſpect is in power, becauſe it is the Solſtice of liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty amongſt the men. Shut the Univerſities doores.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sextile</hi> aſpect is very acceptable to the female kinde, becauſe its Character, as you ſee, *, points like a bountifull Starre round about, and gives to all; which affirmes, that all thoſe that woe with this aſpect, ſhall arrive at the creek of their owne deſire and content.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:95030:52"/>The <hi>Oppoſition</hi> is malevolent both to poore and rich; to rich, becauſe they oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the generous and laudable quality of giving; to the poore, becauſe they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to give.</p>
            <p>If the Gallant ſollicit for a conjunction, when <hi>Cancer</hi> raignes, he hardly obtaines his wiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Crab continually is accompanied with vinegar ſauce, eſpecially if the female be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily pleaſed, who cauſeth a Pagient of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> to ſignifie that ſuch a lubber-fiſted Gallant is held a Monſter in <hi>Cupids</hi> Doctrine: But if the Gallant pretend a conjunction when the Rammes golden Fleece and the yellow Lion preſent their aſpects, then the female dignifies the Rammiſh Gallant with the mild union of the ly-on.</p>
            <p>He that touches the <hi>Dragons tayle</hi> is in danger to be ſtung; therefore to avoid this killing kinde of malice, it is neceſſary that hee hang his purſe about this Dragons necke, and whilſt ſhe playes with it, he may play with her tayle. <hi>Cupid</hi> would not permit me to paſſe on, but cut off the eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my deſire, ſaying, day now approaches, &amp; therefore wee muſt depart, onely I will ſhew you my Library, and there we will end. But as wee went, I deſired <hi>Cupid</hi> to relate ſomething more concerning the fixed ſtars, who began thus; The conſtellations or figured congregations of fixed ſtarres according to other Aſtrologers are forty and eight, but in Schoole the number is much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviated; we divide them into five for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as aggreeable to ther diſpoſition, and other

five appropriated to the mens function; thoſe which belong to the women are <hi>urſa major,</hi> which ſignifies the graver ſort of my Matrones; the next is <hi>urſa minor,</hi> which are the younger; the third is <hi>lupus,</hi> a true type of their avaritious ſtomacke; the fourth <hi>draco,</hi> that with her breath poyſons all; the fifth is <hi>argus,</hi> whoſe multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of eyes darts invincible allurements at all that come within her view, and alſo ſets vigilant eyes on all, that none ſhall eſcape her.</p>
            <p>The maſculine are <hi>auriga,</hi> or as wee terme it, <hi>auri-gaza,</hi> that drives <hi>Bootes</hi> to be unloaded at <hi>Dracos</hi> cloſet doore; the ſecond is <hi>cygnus,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting thoſe that are ſerious ſollicitors for the fulfilling of their <hi>argus</hi> deſire, who, at every departure from their faire ones, ſing forth the death of their purſe, which nimble-ey'd <hi>Argus</hi> ſhewes a Mercurian ſlight; the third is <hi>crater,</hi> a ſtanding diſh of gold, alwayes fit for <hi>lupus</hi> ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, the fourth is <hi>corona auſtralis,</hi> repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the noble-minded ſuiter, who would make <hi>urſa major</hi> a Queene, if his power were correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent to his will; the laſt is <hi>corona borealis,</hi> given freely to <hi>urſa minor,</hi> to appeaſe her choler or coldneſſe, and to make her eight bright eyes benevolent to the meſſenger.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Loves Library.</note>In ſpeaking of this we entred Loves Library, which was very ſpacious, and compleatly filled with great variety of Bookes of all faculties, and in all kindes of Volumes.</p>
            <p>Theſe, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> are not called Bookes, but Tomes, or Sections, for that our courtly Dames ſtudy onely to exect or cut off their thread-bare
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95030:53"/>
curteſans, and induce freſh and new furniſhed ones: And viewing theſe Tomes, ſaw chained up in golden linkes two Spaniſh Poets, <hi>Dante</hi> and <hi>Coſt,</hi> and an Engliſh one called <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> which <hi>Meſſenger</hi> they entertaine, hoping ſtill to ſee the good and gratefull newes of a well-filled purſe, but if it prove contrary to their expectati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, they command ſhaving <hi>Shirly</hi> to make him acquainted with Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> and ſo they flirt him into <hi>Arcadia</hi> to ſing a lamentation for his loſt Miſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>There was alſo <hi>Shakeſpeere,</hi> who (as <hi>Cupid</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me) creepes into the womens cloſets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout bed time, and if it were not for ſome of the old out-of-date Grandames (who are ſet over the reſt as their tutoreſſes) the young ſparkiſh Girles would read in <hi>Shakeſpeere</hi> day and night, ſo that they would open the Booke or Tome, and the men with a Feſcue in their hands ſhould point to the Verſe.</p>
            <p>I proceeded to another ranke of Philoſophers, and there was <hi>Philoſophia de Pla,</hi> whom they read as a nominall, for the vicinity that <hi>Pla</hi> hath to Plate; and after this was their Divine, <hi>Plato,</hi> a nominall that inſtructed the ſame Doctrine: there were <hi>Rubeus</hi> and <hi>Aureolus,</hi> thoſe golden nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls; alſo <hi>More</hi> and <hi>Durandus,</hi> to ſignifie, that thoſe which read <hi>More,</hi> muſt give more, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the extenuation of the gifts, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were aſſured of their durance, and this was the reaſon that <hi>More</hi> and <hi>Durandus</hi> were ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee that reades <hi>More,</hi> gives more, and he that gives more, is a Durand or of durance, but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95030:54"/>
he that gives not, ſhall not be endured in <hi>Cupids</hi> Schooles. Infinite was the number of Tomes, which I will omit for brevities ſake, only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring a few to give the Reader notice, that as they began ſo they ended, intending ſtill upon covetouſneſſe. There was <hi>Tollet, à tollendo,</hi> the womens Author; <hi>Aſinus aureus,</hi> a preſent for the women, which is interpreted to be a rich ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitian, more full of gold then wit; <hi>Catena au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> full of bracelets and ſuch like riches proper to the womens poſſeſſion; and <hi>Bartholomeus Anglicus de lapidibus precioſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and many other Tomes were imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſeverall places; thoſe which were Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors for the women, were all imprinted in <hi>Capua, à capiendo</hi>; and thoſe which belonged to the men, and treated of Jewels and ſuch like, were imprinted in the City of <hi>Valencia</hi>; the other, that treated of gold and ſilver, had their impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Ile of Waight.</p>
            <p>Now, ſaid <hi>Cupid,</hi> you have ſeene, what this ſhort time could benefit you with, and all that I can doe, is to reconduct you to the place where I firſt found you: Thus wee returned, <hi>Cupid</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying me untill I came to Loves Garden gate; and in this paſſage ſpace I made uſe of the remnant of time which was remaining in asking what vacations they obſerved: to which hee anſwered, O what a pitifull Univerſity ſhould I have, if I permitted Vacations! we diſagree in this point from other Vniverſities, for that wee have no Vacations, for the great hurt they cauſe both to male and female, which would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95030:54"/>
in idleneſſe and fruitleſſe actions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the tenure of our inſtitution; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what wee begin, we proſecute, and allow of no ceſſation.</p>
            <p>But that our Tomes may alwayes be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I have ordained many houres of recreation, and as many ſorts of paſtime: As to play at ball, the men providing ſuch balls as that which was caſt amongſt the Goddeſſes in <hi>Ida's</hi> Valley; and the cuſtome is, that men poſt and throw, and the women keepe and catch; for the women catch excellent well, but throw as bad; and the men throw, well and catch very ill. They play much at Nine-holes, but the men bowle continually; and when they enter, they forfeit a certaine ſum of money, it being the generall rule with us, that no man can enter without loſſe. Here alſo is Artilery, and the women are the Butts, but the moſt expert Archer is hee that ſhootes with gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-headed Arrowes, who hits the marke every ſhoot. We uſe Dice, and ſometimes Tables, and if the men adventure againſt the women at Tik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tak, they are certaine to loſe all they play for, and if the men loſe all, then the women deſire them to play at Paſſage amongſt themſelves. Noddy and Catch-foole are their chiefe Games at Cards. Shoovell-boord is alſo in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and very acceptable to the Women, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their lap is the Box, and all is theirs that falls therein.</p>
            <p>Whilſt my fancy gave audience to the God thus diſcourſing, and as I imagined tracing on towards the place of our parting, a boy with a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95030:55"/>
Towell and a Baſon of water opened my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber doore, and avvaked me out of this Dreame, vvhen he ſaid it vvas ſeven of the clock, at vvhich I aroſe, and veſted, I turned downe the pillow where I found a branch of Laurell under my head, which one had laid there, who as ſoone as the party had given me my mornings ſalutation, deſired me to declare my dreame, if perchance I had any that night: I deſired her to excuſe mee for the preſent, and within few dayes I vvould accompliſh her deſire, becauſe my dreame vvas true; and immediately incloſing my ſelfe in my Cloſet, I began this relation vvhich you have heard concerning Loves Schooles, from vvhence proceedeth the baſe and covetous deſire of Intereſt.</p>
