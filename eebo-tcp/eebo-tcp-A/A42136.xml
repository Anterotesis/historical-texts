         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and that I have been here ſince <hi>December</hi>; And I mentioned unto you the moſt inhumane cruelty and bloody practices that the Rebels have inflicted upon the poor Proteſtants here; how they have dealt with our Miniſters, worſe than the Turkes doe by their Mutes and Eunuchs; how barbarouſly they have dealt with Ladies and modeſt Gentlewomen, as others of that ſex; how many children they have burnt, taken by the heels and daſht out their braines: And of that Diabolicall and unchriſtian-like practice, when they have by menacing perſwaſions prevailed upon the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſome Proteſtants, to goe to their Maſſe and partake of their Sacrament, and then cauſe that they be hanged with ſcoffings, that they are fitted and prepa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I did alſo let you know the preſent diſtreſſe that wee then were in, and yet are, here within this City of <hi>London-Derry</hi>; You ſhall underſtand that within theſe wals are above foure thouſand perſons, which never heretofore endured ſuch miſery and hardneſſe; ſweet diſpoſitioned vertuous Ladies, and Gentlewomen of ſingular quality, many of them ready to famiſh, ſome without cloaths, all without money, and what is neceſſary for their ſuſtenance, but that wee ſhare in common upon hopes of reliefe from <hi>England,</hi> if wee bee not wholly forſaken (as the Rebels ſay we are.) This is a very ſtrong City, and may hold out for our

               <!-- PDF PAGE 12 -->
ſafety and the good of all this Kingdome, if it be ſpeedily ſupplied as is neceſſary, with victuals, men, Armes and Ammunition; without which we have no hopes to ſubſiſt, but muſt bee made a prey to the mercileſſe Rebels. O, that <hi>England</hi> would lay it to heart and conſider our diſtreſſe! although we are a particular, yet very conſiderable, as well for the generall good as for the preſervation of us miſerable abjects; (if not objects of pitty:) we had not been expoſed to this miſery, had not that divelliſh invention defeated the City of <hi>London</hi> from their juſt poſſeſſions, or ſurely wee had ere this beene comforted in ſome meaſure: O, as I ſaid formerly, wee are wholly deſerted and left, as a people not worthy the mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and in truth if it hold thus for a while longer, you may be aſſured of our utter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for the Rebels have vowed, and by their meſſages threatned, that unleſſe wee render unto them, they will not ſpare either man, woman or childe: and truly for us to accept their conditions is as dangerous; for they hold no faith with any. They ſhew themſelves of an infinite number upon a hill over againſt the Ferry, and have poſſeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of all the boats from a place called <hi>Ballakel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> to <hi>Strabam,</hi> burnt the town of <hi>Strabam,</hi> where they deſtroyed many in the fire, and took from us there one great piece of Ordnance; and they have another, which they got further in the Countrey,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64076:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 13 -->
with which and their force they may beat downe all the houſes in this towne; for wee have in ſtrength of men and armes to oppoſe them now, but foure pieces of Ordnance great and ſmall; this Towne doth need at leaſt twenty pieces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and a thouſand men. Good Coſen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime our diſtreſſes farre and neere. Wee have ſent to <hi>Dublin</hi> twice, and no remedy, but our laſt meſſengers returne with this; that our former are gone for <hi>England,</hi> but what they doe there, God knoweth; we can heare of no comfort or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe from thence. <hi>O-Neale, Mac-Guyrr, Mac-Gennes,</hi> and <hi>O-Gallows</hi> are joyned in one body of at leaſt a thouſand men, to aſſaile us: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught</hi> hath advanced above ſo many more to their aſſiſtance: we expect them every day to aſſault us, and wee are in admiration that they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and no way as yet aſſault us, although very neere unto us. I did formerly write of the great loſſe at <hi>Garvagley,</hi> above two hundred of our men were ſtaine, in which Maſter <hi>Rayley</hi> and Maſter <hi>Canning</hi> were loſt: great men are in this Rebellion; the Iriſh, make new Lawes and Statutes amongſt themſelves, and yet they ſay they are true and loyall Subjects: they plough and ſeeme to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and ſecure amongſt themſelves, and vow never to ſuffer the Engliſh againe amongſt them. In this little City are many Families, ſome famiſhed, others grievouſly pined and annoyed; ſo that as I

believe the Rebels policy is, that without blowes the place muſt bee forſaken although the people bee expoſed to death or more barbarous cruelty. Are we not of <hi>England</hi> very fleſh and very bone, and ſhall we thus ſuffer for want of help! We hear that that Arch-Rebell <hi>Mac-Maghon</hi> is taken, and <hi>O-Relly</hi> hanged at <hi>Dublin</hi>: But all <hi>Lemſter</hi> is ſo ſtrong of Rebels, that <hi>Dublin, Droghedaugh</hi> and <hi>Youghall</hi> is in aparent danger: All <hi>Vlſter</hi> is loſt, excepting <hi>London-Derry, Colraine</hi> and <hi>Carric-Fergus.</hi> I ſhall not bee more tedious at this preſent, pray for us all, amongſt which you cannot forget</p>
