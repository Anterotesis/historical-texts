            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THere is it seems a <hi>Train</hi> in <hi>Controversies,</hi> as well as in <hi>Thoughts;</hi> one thing still giving a start to another; <hi>Conferences</hi> produce <hi>Letters; Letters, Books;</hi> and one <hi>Discourse</hi> gives <hi>Occasion</hi> for another. For this follows the former as a necessary <hi>Pursuit</hi> of the same Argument against <hi>Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I. S.</hi> in his last <hi>Letter,</hi> had vouched the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> proceeding upon <hi>Tradition,</hi> and he instanced in three Points, <hi>Transubstantiation, Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Third Letter p. 64.</note> 
               <hi>Confession</hi> and <hi>Extreme Unction.</hi> The Examination of this I thought fit to reserve for a <hi>Discourse</hi> by it self; wherein, instead of confining my Self to those three Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, I intend to go through the most material Points there established, and to prove from the most Authentick Testimonies, that there was no <hi>true Catholick Tradition</hi> for any of them. And if I can make good what I have undertaken, I shall make the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> it <hi>Self</hi> the great Instance against the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a new Undertaking; which the impetuousness of our Adversaries setting up <hi>Tradition</hi> for the Ground of their Faith, hath brought me to. But besides the shewing that really they have not <hi>Tradition</hi> on their side; I have endeavoured to trace the several steps and to set down the <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Occasions</hi> of Introducing those Points which
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:95209:3"/>
have caused that unhappy breach in the Christian world, whose sad effects we daily see and lament, But have little hopes to see remied, till these new Points be discarded and Scripture interpreted by truely <hi>Catholick Tradition,</hi> be made the Standard of Christian Communion.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend, that all these Points came in at one Time or in the same Manner; for some Errours and Corruptions came in far more early; some had the favour of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in a higher degree; some were more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received in the Practice of the Church in later times, than others; and some were merely <hi>School Points</hi> before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> but as far as the <hi>Thomists</hi> and <hi>Scotists</hi> could be made to agree there against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, these passed for <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> For, this was one of the great Arts of that <hi>Council</hi> to draw up their <hi>Decrees</hi> in such Terms, as should leave Room enough for Eternal Wranglings among themselves, provided they agreed in doing the business effectually against the <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> as they are pleased to call them. I therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to urge these as <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which have been freely debated among themselves since the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> without any Censure. We have enough in the plain <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> of that <hi>Council,</hi> without medling with any <hi>School-Points.</hi> And so I cannot be charged with <hi>Misrepresenting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Debate of late hath been about the <hi>true Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Points</hi> there defined; and for my part, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to yield to any just and reasonable Methods of giving the <hi>true sense</hi> of them. And such I conceive these to be,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> Where the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> makes use of Words in a <hi>strict</hi> and <hi>limited Sense,</hi> there it is unreasonable to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them in a <hi>large</hi> and <hi>improper Sense.</hi> As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>Sess. 6.</hi> c. <hi>26.</hi> It decrees that Justified Persons
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:95209:3"/>
do <hi>verè promerere;</hi> truely merit Eternal Life; and <hi>Can. 32.</hi> there is an <hi>Anathema</hi> against him who denies <hi>true Merit in the good Works of justified Persons, both as to Increase of Grace and Eternal Life.</hi> There is no one conversant in Ancient Writers, but knows that there was a large and improper Sense of the Word <hi>Merit;</hi> but how is it impossible to apply that Sense, where such Care is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that it may be understood in a strict and limited Sense? If the Council had left the Word in its General Sense, there might have been Reason to have given the fairest Interpretation to it; but when it is certainly known, that there had been a difference of Opinions in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> about <hi>true and proper Merit,</hi> and that which was not (however it were called,) and the <hi>Council</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares for the former, no man of understanding can believe that onely the <hi>improper Sense</hi> was meant by it. As in the Point of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> when the <hi>Council</hi> declares that the words of Christ, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> are <hi>truely and properly</hi> to be understood; Would it not be thought strange for any one to say, that the <hi>Council</hi> notwithstanding might mean that Christ's Words may be figuratively understood? And we must take the <hi>true notion</hi> of Merit not from any large expressions of the Ancients, but from the Conditions of <hi>true and proper Merit</hi> among themselves. But of this at large afterwards. So as to the Notion of <hi>Sacraments;</hi> every one knows how largely that Word was taken in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writers; but it would be absurd to understand the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> in that Sense, when <hi>Sess. 6. Can. 1. De Sacramentis,</hi> it denounces an <hi>Anathema</hi> not merely against him <hi>that denies seven Sacraments;</hi> but against him <hi>that doth not hold every one of them to be truely and properly a Sacrament.</hi> And in the <hi>Creed</hi> of <hi>Pius IV.</hi> one Article is, that there are <hi>seven true and proper Sacraments</hi> How vain a thing then were it for any
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:95209:4"/>
to Expound the <hi>Sacraments</hi> in a large and improper Sense?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> Where the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> hath not declared it self, but it is fully done in the <hi>Catechism</hi> made by its Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, we ought to look on that, as the <hi>true Sense</hi> of the <hi>Council.</hi> As in the Case of the <hi>Sacraments;</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> never declares what it means by <hi>true and proper Sacraments;</hi> but the <hi>Catechism</hi> makes large and full a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for this Defect. For after it hath mention'd the <note place="margin">Catechism Rom. Part 2.</note> use of the Word in Profane and Sacred Writers, it sets down the Sense of it according to their Divines for <hi>a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible sign which conveys the Grace which it signifies.</hi> And after a large Explication of the Nature of Signs, it gives this Description of a true and proper Sacrament, <hi>that it is a sensible thing, which by Divine Institution not only hath the force of signifying but of causing Grace.</hi> And to shew the Authority of this <hi>Catechism</hi> for explicating the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> we need only to look into <hi>Sess. 24. c. 7. de Reform. where it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the People be instructed in the Sacraments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="v" facs="tcp:95209:4"/>
carefully review'd by <hi>Cardinal Sirlet, Borromeo,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and hath since been universally received in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church;</hi> so that we can have no more Authentick <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> than what is contained in that <hi>Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>III.</hi> Where the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> declares a thing in general to be <hi>lawfull</hi> and <hi>due,</hi> but doth not express the <hi>manner</hi> of it, that is to be understood from the generally receiv'd and allowed Practices at that time. For, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the <hi>Council</hi> must be charged with great unfaithfulness in not setting down and correcting publick and notorious Abuses, when it mention'd the things themselves and some Abuses about them. As in the <hi>25th Session,</hi> concerning <hi>Purgatory, Invocation of Saints, Worship of Images</hi> and <hi>Relicks,</hi> it goes no farther than <hi>that the sound Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine be taught, that Saints are to be Invocated, Images and Relicks to be Worship'd;</hi> but never defines what <hi>that sound Doctrine</hi> is, what <hi>bounds</hi> are to be set in the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Saints, Images</hi> and <hi>Relicks,</hi> which it is unlawfull to exceed. So that in this Case, we have no other way to judge of the Meaning of the Council, but by comparing the <hi>Publick and Allow'd Practices</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> with the General <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Council.</hi> And we have this farther Reason for it, that we are told by the latest Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors of it, that the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>speculative Points,</hi> is to be taken from <hi>Publick Practices.</hi> For, thus one of them expresses himself, <hi>Moreover, even her Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative</hi>

               <hi>IV.</hi> Where the Decrees of the Council, are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently clear, there we must take in the <hi>Canons</hi> to make the <hi>Sense</hi> more plain. This <hi>Rule</hi> I take from the <hi>Council</hi> it self, which in the <hi>6th Session,</hi> just before the <hi>Canons</hi> saith, <hi>that those are added, that all may know not only what they are to hold and follow, but what they are to shun and avoid.</hi> As in the famous Instance of <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation;</hi> suppose, that the Words of the <hi>Decree</hi> do not determine expresly the <hi>Modus;</hi> yet it is impossible for any one to doubt of it who looks into the <hi>Canon,</hi> which denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces an <hi>Anathema</hi> against him, not only that <hi>denies Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> but that <hi>asserts the substance of Bread and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Sess. 13. Can. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Wine to remain after Consecration.</hi> Therefore he that asserts <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> according to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> must hold it in such a <hi>manner,</hi> as thereby to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>that the Substance of Bread and Wine doth not remain.</hi> Otherwise he is under an <hi>Anathema</hi> by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press <hi>Canon</hi> of the Council.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is so far from being a <hi>fatal Oversight,</hi> (as a late Author expresses it,) <hi>to say that the Council of Trent hath determin'd the Modus of the Real Presence,</hi> that no man who is not resolved <hi>to oversee it</hi> can be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opinion. And herein the <hi>Divines</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do agree with us, <hi>viz.</hi> that the particular <hi>Modus</hi> is not only determin'd by the <hi>Council,</hi> but that it is a <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> to all Persons of the Communion of that Church. As not only appears from the <hi>2d Canon,</hi> but from the very <hi>Decree</hi> it self, <hi>Sess. 13. ch. 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The holy Synod declares, that by Consecration of the Bread and Wine, there is a Conversion of the whole Substance of the Bread into the Substance of the Body of Christ, and of the whole Substance of the Wine into the Substance of his Blood, which Conversion is fitly</hi>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:95209:5"/>
               <hi>and properly by the holy Catholick Church called Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation.</hi> In which Words the <hi>Council</hi> doth plainly express the <hi>Modus</hi> of the <hi>Real Presence</hi> to be, not by a Presence of <hi>Christ's Body</hi> together with the <hi>Substance of the Bread,</hi> as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> held, but by a <hi>Conversion of the whole Substance of the Bread into the Substance of the Body,</hi> &amp;c. And since there were different <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of understanding this <hi>Real Presence,</hi> if the <hi>Council</hi> did not Espouse one so, as to reject the other as <hi>Heretical;</hi> then it is impossible to make the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrine to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be <hi>Heretical,</hi> i. e, unless the <hi>Council</hi> did deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the <hi>Modus</hi> of the <hi>Real Presence.</hi> For, if it did not, then notwithstanding the <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> Persons are at liberty to believe either <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> or <hi>Consubstantiation,</hi> which I think no <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> will allow.</p>
            <p>But. it is said, that the meaning of the <hi>Decree</hi> is, <hi>that the Real Presence is not to be understood after a Natural, but a Sacramental Manner;</hi> But doth it not plainly tell us, how that <hi>Sacramental Manner</hi> is to be understood, <hi>viz. by a Conversion of the whole Substance of the Bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole Substance of the Body,</hi> &amp;c. And if other ways be possible, and all others be rejected, then this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Modus</hi> must be determin'd.</p>
            <p>I grant, that the <hi>Council</hi> doth not say, <hi>there is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation of the Elements;</hi> and I know no Necessity of using that Term, for that which is supposed to be turned into another thing cannot properly be said to be <hi>Annihilated</hi> (which is the reducing it to nothing) but the <hi>Council</hi> doth assert <hi>a Total Conversion of one Substance into another,</hi> and where that is, that <hi>Substance</hi> must wholly cease to be what it was; and so, there can be no Substance of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments remaining after Consecration. For, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, <hi>Quod convertitur in aliquid factâ Conversione</hi>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:95209:6"/>
               <hi>non manet.</hi> If then the <hi>Substance</hi> of the Elements doth <note place="margin">3 Q. 75. A. 2.</note> not remain after Consecration, by virtue of this <hi>total Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,</hi> then the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> by its <hi>Decree</hi> hath plainly determin'd the <hi>Modus</hi> of the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> so as to exclude any such <hi>Manner,</hi> as doth suppose, the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> to remain, whether it be by <hi>Impanation</hi> or <hi>Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi> or any other way.</p>
            <p>What <hi>if</hi> Rupertus <hi>thought the Bread might become the Real Body of Christ by an Union of the Word to it?</hi> All that can be infer'd is, that the <hi>Modus</hi> was not then so determin'd, as to oblige all Persons to hold it. But what is this to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent?</hi> Can any one hold the <hi>Substance</hi> to remain, and not to remain at the same time? For, he that holds with <hi>Rupertus</hi> must allow the Substance to remain; he that believes a total Conversion must deny it. And he that can believe both these at once, may believe what he pleases.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Council only declares the Sacramental Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to be after an ineffable manner.</hi> I say, it deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it to be by <hi>a total Conversion of one Substance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another;</hi> which may well be said to be <hi>ineffable,</hi> since what cannot be understood can never be expressed.</p>
            <p>Our Dispute is not about the use of the Word, <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi> for I think it proper enough to express the Sense of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent;</hi> but as the Word <hi>Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial</hi> did exclude all other <hi>Modes</hi> how Christ might be <hi>the Son of God,</hi> and determin'd the Faith of the Church to that <hi>Manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> so doth the Sense of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as determin'd by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> limit the <hi>Manner</hi> of the <hi>Real Presence,</hi> to such a <hi>Conversion</hi> of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of the Elements into the <hi>Substance of Christ's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood,</hi> as doth imply no Substance to remain after Consecration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:95209:6"/>
It is to no purpose to tell us, <hi>the Council uses only the Word Species and not Accidents;</hi> for whatever they are called, the <hi>Council</hi> denounces its <hi>Anathema</hi> against those <hi>who hold the Substance to remain after Consecration; and denies the Total Conversion of the Substance of the Bread and Wine into the Substance of the Body and Bloud of Christ.</hi> If the <hi>Substance</hi> be not there, the <hi>Modus</hi> is to purpose determin'd. And whatever remains, call it what you will, it is not the <hi>Substance;</hi> and that is sufficient to shew, that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> hath clearly determin'd the <hi>Modus</hi> of the <hi>Real Presence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>V.</hi> We must distinguish the <hi>School Points</hi> left undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> from those which are made <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> We never pretend, that it left no <hi>School-Disputes</hi> about the Points there determin'd; but we say it went too far in making some <hi>School-Points</hi> to be Points of Faith, when it had been more for the Peace of Christendom to have left them to the <hi>Schools</hi> still. Thus in the Point of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> the elder <hi>School-men</hi> tell us, there were different Ways of explaining the <hi>Real Presence;</hi> And that those, which supposed the substance to remain, <hi>were more agreeable to Reason and Scripture than the other;</hi> and some were of Opinion, <hi>that the</hi> Modus <hi>was no matter of Faith then.</hi> But after the Point of the <hi>Real Presence</hi> came to be warmly contested in the time of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> it rose by degrees higher and higher, till at last the particular <hi>Modus</hi> came to be determin'd with an <hi>Anathema</hi> by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Berengarius,</hi> A. D. <hi>1059.</hi> was forced to Recant by <hi>Nicolaus 2d,</hi> with the Assistance of <hi>113.</hi> Bishops; no more was required of him, <hi>than to hold that the Bread and Wine after Consecration; are not only the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the true Body and Bloud of Christ, and that</hi>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:95209:7"/>
               <hi>it is sensibly handled and broke by the Priests hands, and eaten by the Communicants.</hi> Here is no denying the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> to remain; and <hi>Joh. Parisiensis</hi> observes, that the words cannot be defended but by an <hi>Assumption</hi> of the Bread; for, saith he, <hi>If the Body of Christ be truely and sensibly handled and eaten, this cannot be understood of Christ's Glorious Body in Heaven, but it must be of the Bread really made the Body of Christ after Consecration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sense which the <hi>Canonists</hi> put upon the Words of this <hi>Recantation</hi> is absurd, <hi>viz. that they are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the Species;</hi> For <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Opinion related to the <hi>Substance of Christ's Body</hi> which he denied to be in the Sacrament. And what would it have signified for him to have said <hi>that Christ was sensibly broken and eaten under the Species of Bread and Wine?</hi> i. e. that his Body was not sensibly broken and eaten but the <hi>Species</hi> were. It had signified something, if he had said, <hi>there was no Substance of Bread and Wine left but only the Species.</hi> But all the design of this Recantation was to make him assert the <hi>Sacrament to be made the true and real Body of Christ</hi> in as strong a manner, as the Pope and his Brethren could think of. And although the <hi>Canonists</hi> think, <hi>if strictly</hi> taken, <hi>it implies greater He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie than that of Berengarius;</hi> yet by their favour, this Form was only thought fit to be put into the <hi>Canon-Law,</hi> as the Standard of the Faith of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> then; and the following <hi>Abjuration</hi> of <hi>Berengarius</hi> was only kept in the <hi>Register</hi> of <hi>Gregory the seventh's Epistles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For about twenty years after by Order of <hi>Gregory VII. Berengarius</hi> was brought to another <hi>Abjuration,</hi> but by no means <hi>after the same Form with the former.</hi> For by this he was required to declare, <hi>that the Bread and Wine are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially Converted into the true and proper Flesh and</hi>
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:95209:7"/>
               <hi>Bloud of Christ, and after Censecration are the true Body of Christ born of the Virgin and Sacrificed upon the Cross, and that sits at the right hand of the Father; and the true Bloud of Christ which was shed out of his Side, not only as a Sacramental Sign, but in propriety of Nature and Reality of Substance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was indeed <hi>a pretty bold Assertion of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Presence.</hi> And so much the bolder, if the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary</hi> on S. <hi>Matthew</hi> be <hi>Hildebrand's.</hi> For there he saith, <hi>the manner of the Conversion is uncertain.</hi> But as far as I can judge, by <hi>Substantial Conversion</hi> he did not then mean, as the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> doth, <hi>a total Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of one substance into another, so as that nothing of the former Substance remains;</hi> but <hi>that there was a Change by Consecration not by making the Body of Christ of the Substance of the Bread, but by its passing into that Body of Christ which was born of the Virgin.</hi> For, upon comparing the two Forms, there we shall find lies the main difference. Pope <hi>Nicolaus</hi> went no farther than to <hi>the true Body of Christ;</hi> which it might be as well by <hi>Assumption,</hi> as <hi>Conversion; Gregory VII.</hi> went farther and thought it necessary to add that the Change was into the <hi>Substance of that Body which was born of the Virgin,</hi> &amp;c. And so this second Form excludes a true Body merely by <hi>Assumption,</hi> and asserts the Change to be into the <hi>Substance of Christ's Body in Heaven;</hi> but it doth not determine, that nothing of the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Elements</hi> doth remain. For when he puts <hi>that kind of Substantial Conversion which leaves nothing but the Accidents, and the Body of Christ to be under them, which belonged to the Substance of the Elements;</hi> he declares <hi>this matter to be uncertain.</hi> Which shews, that however a <hi>Change</hi> was owned into the <hi>Substance</hi> of <hi>Christ's Body,</hi> yet such a <hi>total Conversion,</hi> as is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:95209:8"/>
by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> was not then made an Article of Faith.</p>
            <p>But from this supposition made by <hi>Hildebrand</hi> it appears, that the Dectrine of <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Accidents</hi> was then well known; and therefore the introducing <hi>Aristotle's Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy</hi> from the <hi>Arabians</hi> afterwards could make no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in this Matter. For the words of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> are as plain as to the difference of <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> as of any of the <hi>School-men;</hi> and that the <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents</hi> of the Bread and Wine might be separated from the Substance of them; but this was not then made a Matter of Faith; as it was afterwards.</p>
            <p>But the case was remarkably alter'd, after the <hi>Lateran Council</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> III. For <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> being admitted there among the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> and so entred in the <hi>Canon-Law</hi> in the very beginning of the <hi>Decretals;</hi> this did not merely become a <hi>School-Term,</hi> but by the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors</hi> of that time, it was accounted <hi>Heresie</hi> to deny it. It may be sufficiently proved by the <hi>School-men</hi> and <hi>Canonists,</hi> that a difference of <hi>Opinions,</hi> as to the <hi>Modus</hi> did still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, (but that belongs to a more proper place) and <hi>Joh. Parisiensis</hi> declares <hi>(p. 103) that the Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in his Opinion did not make Transubstantiation a Point of Faith; or at least that Substance was not to be taken for the Matter, but the Suppositum;</hi> but the <hi>Inquisitors</hi> went more briskly to work and made it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>

            </p>
            <p>Of this, we have full Evidence in the <hi>Register</hi> of <hi>Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (which is <hi>no Invisible Manuscript.)</hi> For there we read <hi>f. 25.</hi> that he called a select <hi>Convecation</hi> of <hi>Bishops, Divines</hi> and <hi>Canonists, May 17.</hi> A.

               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:95209:8"/>
               <hi>determination of the Church.</hi> Among the first, these two are set down in the first Place,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. That the material Substance of the Bread and Wine doth remain in the Sacrament of the Altar after Consecration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. That the Accidents do not remain without their Subject in that Sacrament after Consecration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> sent forth his Mandate to all his <hi>Suffragans</hi> not only to prohibit the preaching of that Doctrine, but to inquire after those who did it. And June <hi>12. Robert Rygge Chancellour</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Brightwall</hi> appeared before him and were examined upon these Propositions; which they declared to be <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical:</hi> who thereupon required the Publication of them as such in the <hi>University;</hi> and the proceeding against those who were suspected to favour them.</p>
            <p>The Ground the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> went upon, was, <hi>that these had been already condemned by the Church,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ex abundanti, they declared them to be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;</hi> as appears by the <hi>Monition</hi> given to <hi>Robert Rygge</hi> himself as too much suspected to favour the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Doctrine; as well as <hi>Nicholas Hereford, Philip Reppyndon</hi> D. D. and <hi>John Ashton</hi> B. D.</p>
            <p>Against these the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> proceeded as <hi>Inquisitor Haereticae Pravitatis per totam suam Provinciam,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Record;</hi> who appearing desired a Copy of the several <hi>Propositions,</hi> and then they were required to give in their judgment upon them. <hi>Ashton</hi> refused, but the other promised, which they performed soon after; and to these two Propositions, their Answers were,</p>
            <p>To the first <hi>that as far as it was contrary to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal,</hi> Firmiter Credimus, <hi>it was Heresie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the second <hi>that as far as it was contrary to the Decretal,</hi> Cum Marthoe, <hi>it was Heresie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:95209:9"/>
These Answers were judged <hi>insufficient,</hi> because they did not declare what that <hi>Sense</hi> was And the <hi>Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> put this Question to them, <hi>whether the same Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical material Bread which before Consecration was set upon the Altar, did remain in its proper Substance and Nature after Consecration,</hi> but they would give no other Answer at that time. But afterwards <hi>Reppyndon</hi> abjured, and was made <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence it appears, that it was then thought that the <hi>Modus</hi> was so far determin'd by the <hi>Lateran Council,</hi> that the <hi>contrary Doctrine was</hi> declared not merely <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous in Faith,</hi> but <hi>Heretical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first <hi>Convocation</hi> held by <hi>Th. Arundel Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> A. D. <hi>1396,</hi> A Complaint was <note place="margin">Regist. f. 47.</note> brought, that several <hi>Divines</hi> and others of the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> held some <hi>heretical</hi> and <hi>erroneous</hi> opinions; the first whereof was,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Substance of Bread doth remain after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecration; and doth not cease to be Bread;</hi> which is there affirmed <hi>to be Heresie, speaking of material Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second, <hi>that the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>in the</hi> Can. Ego <hi>Berengarius, had determined that the Sacrament of the Eucharist is naturally true Bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very hard to say, how this came to be then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Heretical Doctrine, when no less a man than <hi>Durandus</hi> in the same Age affirms, <hi>that the Canonists grant that the Opinion of the ceasing of the Substance was grounded on the</hi> Can. <hi>Firmiter Credimus,</hi> i. e. on the <hi>Lateran Council; but that of the remaining of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance on that,</hi> Ego, <hi>Berengarius.</hi> But however it passed for <hi>Heretical,</hi> or at least very <hi>Erroneous</hi> Doctrine here; but the main <hi>Heresie</hi> was to hold, <hi>that the Substance remained.</hi>

For <hi>A. D. 1400.</hi> (as appears by the <hi>Register</hi> p. <hi>2.</hi> f. <hi>179.) William Sawtre</hi> alias <hi>Chatris</hi> a Parochial Priest in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> was summoned before the same <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> upon an Information of <hi>Heresie;</hi> and one of the main Articles against him was that he held <hi>the Substance of the Bread to remain in the Sacrament of the Altar after Consecration; and that it doth not cease to be Bread. Sawtre</hi> answered, that he believed, <hi>that after Consecration the Bread did remain with the Body of Christ; but it doth not cease to be simply Bread, but it remains holy and true the Bread of Life and Body of Christ.</hi> The <hi>Arch Bishop</hi> examined him chiefly upon this Article; and because he did not answer home to the point, he was condemned for a <hi>Heretick,</hi> and was the first who was burned for <hi>Heresie</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> And yet his Answer was, <hi>that he could not understand the matter;</hi> then the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> asked him, <hi>if he would stand to the Churches Determination;</hi> he said, <hi>he would so far as it was not contrary to the Will of God.</hi> Upon which he was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an <hi>Heretick</hi> and delivered over to the Secular Power.</p>
            <p>In the same Convocation <hi>John Purvey</hi> made an <hi>Abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Heresie,</hi> and the first he renounced was <hi>that after Consecration in the Sacrament of the Altar, there neither is, nor can be an Accident without a Subject, and that the same Substance and Nature of Bread remained which was before.</hi>

D. <hi>1407.</hi> (which is not in the <hi>Register</hi> being defective, but the account is preserved from his own Copy) The <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>that the Church had now determined, that there abideth no Substance of Bread after Consecration in the Sacrament of the Altar. And that if he believed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he did not believe as the Church believed. Thorp</hi>
               <pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:95209:10"/>
quoted S. <hi>Augustin</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius</hi> to prove <hi>that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance remained; and the very Mass on Christmas Day.</hi> The <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> still pressed him with <hi>the Churches De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. Thorp</hi> said <hi>this was a School-nicety whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accidents could be without a Subject;</hi> no, said the <hi>Arch-Bishop, it is the Faith of the Church I go upon. Thorp</hi> replyed, <hi>it was not so for a thousand years after Christ.</hi>

            <p>In the Examination of the <hi>Lord Cobham</hi> A. D. <hi>1412.</hi> by the same <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> we find that he owned <hi>the Real</hi>

               <hi>Presence of Christ's Body</hi> as firmly as his Accusers; but he was condemned for <hi>Heresie, Because he held the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Bread to remain.</hi> For the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this to be the Sense of the <hi>Church; that after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, remaineth no material Bread or Wine which were before, they being turned into Christ's very Body and Bloud.</hi> The Original words of the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> as they are in the <hi>Register,</hi> are these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The faith and the determination of holy Church touching the blestfull Sacrament of the auter is this, that after the Sacramental Words ben said by a Prest in his Masse, the material bred that was before is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Christ's veray body. And the material Wyn that was before is turned into Christ veray blode, and so there leweth in the auter, no material brede ne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Wyn the wich wer ther byfore the saying of the Sacramental words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Bishops</hi> afterwards stood up and said; <hi>It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest Heresie to say that it is Bread after the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Words be spoken; because it was against the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of holy Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to make all sure, not many years after, <hi>May</hi> 4th. A. D. <hi>1415.</hi> the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> Session <hi>8.</hi> declared the two <hi>Propositions</hi> before mentioned to be <hi>heretical;</hi>
               <pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:95209:10"/>
viz. <hi>to hold that the Substance doth remain after Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and that the Accidents do not remain without a Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let any impartial Reader now judge, whether it be any <hi>fatal Oversight</hi> to assert, <hi>that the Modus of the Real Presence was determin'd by the Council of Trent,</hi> when there were so many leading Determinations to it, which were generally owned and received in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> But there were other <hi>Disputes</hi> remaining in the <hi>Schools</hi> relating to this <hi>Matter;</hi> which we do not pretend were ever determin'd by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi> As,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>(1.)</hi> Whether the Words of <hi>Consecration</hi> are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in a <hi>Speculative</hi> or <hi>Practical Sense?</hi> For, the <hi>Scotists</hi> say, in the former Sense, they do by no means prove Transubstantiation; since it may be truly said <hi>This is my Body,</hi> though the Substance of Bread do remain; and that they are to be understood in <hi>a Practical Sense,</hi> i. e. for converting the Bread into the Body, is not to be deduced <hi>ex vi verborum,</hi> from the mere force of the Words, but from the Sense of the Church which hath so understood them. Which in plain terms is to say, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved from <hi>Scripture,</hi> but from the Sense of the Church; and so <hi>Scotus</hi> doth acknowledge, but then he adds, <hi>that we are to judge this to be the Sense of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because the Church hath declared it. Which he doth not think was done before the Council of</hi> Lateran. So that, this Council must be believed to have had as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible a Spirit in giving this Sense of <hi>Scripture</hi> as there was in the writing of it; since it is not drawn from the Words, but added to them. On the other side, the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists</hi> insist on the force of the Words themselves; for, if, say they, from the Words be infer'd that there is a Real Presence of the Substance of Christ's Body, then it follows
<pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:95209:11"/>
thence, that there is no Substance of the Bread remaining; for a Substance cannot be where it was not before, but it must either change its place, or another must be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; as Fire in a House must either be brought thither, or some other thing must be turned into Fire; but, say they, the Body of Christ cannot be brought from Heaven thither, for then it must leave the place it had there; and must pass through all the Bodies between; and it is impossible for the same Body to be Locally present in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places; and therefore the Body of Christ cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be really and substantially present, but by the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Substance of the Bread into it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>(2.)</hi> In what <hi>Manner</hi> the <hi>Body of Christ</hi> is made to be present in the Sacrament? The <hi>Scotists</hi> say, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceive it otherwise than by bringing it from the place where it already is; the <hi>Thomists</hi> say that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, since that Body must be divided from it self by so many other Bodies interposing. The former is said to be an <hi>adductive</hi> Conversion, the latter a <hi>productive;</hi> but then here lies another difficulty, how there can be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive Conversion of a thing already in being. But my business is not to give an account of these <hi>School-Disputes;</hi> but to shew how different they were from the point of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fubslantiation;</hi> and that both these disputing Parties did agree that the <hi>Modus</hi> of the <hi>Real Presence</hi> was defined to be <hi>by changing the Substance of the Elements into the Body and Blood of Christ;</hi> but they still warmly disputed about the <hi>Modus</hi> of that <hi>Modus;</hi> viz. how a Body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in being could be present in so many places without leaving that Place where it was already. And no Man who hath ever look'd into these <hi>School Disputes</hi> can ever ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they disputed about the Truth of the Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> but only about the <hi>manner</hi> of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:95209:11"/>
it. Wherein they do effectually overthrow each others Notions without being able to establish their own; as the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Cologn</hi> truly observed of their Debates about this matter in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>VI.</hi> Where the Sense of Words hath been changed by the introducing new Doctrine, there the words ought to be understood according to the Doctrine at that time received. Of this we have two remarkable Instances in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first is about <hi>Indulgences,</hi> which that <hi>Council</hi> in its last <hi>Session</hi> never went about to define; but made use of the old Word, and so declares both Scripture and Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the use of them. But there had been a mighty change in the Doctrine about them, since the Word was used in the Christian Church. No doubt there was a Power in the Church to relax <hi>Canonical Penances</hi> in extraordinary Cases; but what could that signifie when the <hi>Canonical Discipline</hi> was laid aside, and a new Method of dealing with Penitents was taken up, and another Trade driven with Respect to <hi>Purgatory Pains?</hi> For here was a new thing carried on under an old Name. And that hath been the great Artifice of the Roman Church; where it hath evidently gone off from the <hi>old Doctrines,</hi> yet to retain the <hi>old Names,</hi> that the unwary might still think, the things were the same, because the Names were. As in the present Case, we deny not the use of <hi>Indulgences</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Church;</hi> as the Word was used for <hi>Relaxations</hi> of the <hi>Canonical Discipline;</hi> but we utterly deny it as to the <hi>Pains</hi> of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> And that this was the Sense then receiv'd in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> appears from the Papal Constitutions of <hi>Bon face</hi> the <hi>8th, Clemens</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>10th.</hi> But of these more hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xx" facs="tcp:95209:12"/>
The other Instance is in the Word <hi>Species</hi> used by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent, Sess. 13. Can. 2.</hi> where <hi>an Anathema is denounced against him that denies the Conversion of the whole Substance of the Elements into the Body and Blood of Christ, the Species of Bread and Wine only remaining.</hi> Now a Controversie hath been started in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> what is to be understood by <hi>Species,</hi> whether <hi>real Accidents</hi> or only <hi>Appearances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> who have had a Tast of the New Philosophy, reject any <hi>real Accidents,</hi> and yet declare <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to be a matter of Faith, and go about to explain the Notion of it in another manner. Among these one <hi>Emanuel Maignan,</hi> a Professor of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maignan</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophia Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ra. <hi>Part 2. Append. 5.</hi>
               </note> at <hi>Tholouse,</hi> hath at large undertaken this matter. The Method he takes is this.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>(1.)</hi> He grants, that nothing remains of the Bread af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Consecration, but that whereby it was an Object of Sense; because that which is really the Being of one thing cannot be the Being of another. And he confesses that the <hi>Modus</hi> as to the <hi>not being</hi> of the <hi>Substance</hi> after Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, is determin'd by the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>(2.)</hi> He asserts, that real Accidents, supposing them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from the Substance, are not that whereby the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are made the Objects of Sense; because they do not make the Conjunction between the Object and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>(3.)</hi> Since he denies, that Accidents have any real Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing distinct from the Substance they are in, he grants, that it is as much a matter of Faith, that there are no real Accidents after Consecration, as that there is no real Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and he brings the Authorities of the Councils of <hi>Lateran, Florence</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> to prove it.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:95209:12"/>
               <hi>(4.)</hi> As the Substance did by Divine Concourse so Act upon the Senses before, as to make it be an Object of Sense; so after Consecration, God by his immediate Act makes the same <hi>Appearances,</hi> although the Substance be gone. And this, he saith, is the effect of this Miraculous Conversion, which is concealed from our Senses, by God's immediate cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the very same Appearances, which came before from the Substance. Which Appearances, he saith, are the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> mention'd by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent;</hi> and other elder Councils and Fathers.</p>
            <p>Against this new <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> a famous <hi>Jesuit, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus Raynaudus,</hi> opposed himself with great vehemency; and urged these Arguments against it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>(1.)</hi> That it overthrows the very Nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leaving no external visible sign; but a perpetual il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion of the Senses, in such a manner, that the Error of one cannot be corrected by another.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>(2.)</hi> That it overthrows the Design of the Sacrament, which is to be true and proper Food. <hi>My Flesh is meat indeed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>John 6.</hi> Which, he saith, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the Sacrament, as well as of the Body of Christ, and therefore cannot agree with an imaginary appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>(3.)</hi> It is not consistent with the <hi>Accidents</hi> which befall the Sacramental <hi>Species,</hi> as <hi>to be trod under foot, to be cast into indecent places, to be devoured by Brutes, to be Putrified,</hi> &amp;c. If the Body of Christ withdraws, there must be something beyond mere <hi>Appearances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>(4.)</hi> He makes this Doctrine to be <hi>Heretical,</hi> because the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> condemned it as an <hi>Heretical Proposition,</hi> to affirm, <hi>that in the Eucharist Accidents do not remain without their Subject;</hi> and because the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> uses the Word <hi>Species</hi> in the Sense
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:95209:13"/>
then generally received, and so it signified the same with <hi>Accidents.</hi> Which, saith he, farther appears, because the <hi>Council</hi> speaks of the <hi>Species remaining;</hi> but if there be no real Accidents, the Species doth not remain in the Object; but a new Appearance is produced. And it seems most reasonable to interpret the Language of the Council according to the general Sense wherein the Words were understood at that time.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>VII.</hi> What things were disputed and opposed by some in the <hi>Council,</hi> without being censured for it, although they were afterwards decreed by a <hi>Major Party,</hi> yet cannot be said to have been there received by a <hi>Catholick Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Because <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> which have been univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally received in the <hi>Church,</hi> can never be supposed to be contested in a <hi>Council</hi> without <hi>Censure;</hi> but if it appears that there were Heats and warm Debates among the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the <hi>Council</hi> it self, and both think they speak the Sense of the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> then we must either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that there was then no known <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> about those matters, or that the Divines of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> assembled in <hi>Council</hi> did not understand what it was. And what happens to be decreed by a <hi>Majority,</hi> can never be concluded from thence to have been the <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> before, because there was a different Sense of others concerning it. And since in a division, a single Person may make a <hi>Majority,</hi> it will be very hard to believe, that he carries <hi>Infallibility</hi> and <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> along with him.</p>
            <p>But I think it Reasonable in the enquiry after <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tradition</hi> to take notice of the different Opinions in the <hi>Council;</hi> and among the <hi>School-men</hi> before it; and not only to observe, what was the Sense of the <hi>Roman</hi>
               <pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:95209:13"/>
               <hi>Church,</hi> but of the <hi>Eastern Churches</hi> too; and where the matter requires it, to go through the several <hi>Ages</hi> of the Church up to the <hi>Apostolical Times;</hi> that I may ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually prove, that in the main Points in Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, which are established by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> there cannot be produced any <hi>Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apostolical Tradition</hi> for them.</p>

            <head>THE Council of Trent EXAMINED AND DISPROVED, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere are Two things designed by me in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To shew that there is no such thing as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Tradition for the main Points in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie between us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they are determined by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To give an Account by what Steps and Degrees, and on what Occasion those Doctrines and Practices came into the Church.</p>
            <p>But before I come to particulars, I shall lay down some reasonable <hi>Postulata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That a <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> must be universally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among the sound Members of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the force of Tradition lies in the Certainty of Conveyance of Matters of Faith from the Apostolical Times. For no New Doctrines being pretended to, there
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95209:17"/>
can be no Matter of Faith in any Age of the Church, but what was so in the precedent and so up to the Apostles times.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it is impossible to suppose the Divines of the Catholick Church to be ignorant, what was in their own time received for <hi>Catholick Tradition.</hi> For, if it be so hard for others to mistake it, it will be much more so for those whose business is to enquire into, and to deliver Matters of Faith.</p>
            <p>These things premised, I now enter upon the Points themselves; and I begin with,</p>
            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>I. Traditions being a Rule of Faith equal with Scriptures.</head>
               <p>This is declared by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as the Groundwork of their Proceedings.</p>
               <p>The words are Sess. 4. <hi>That the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil receives Traditions both as to Faith</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Necnon Traditiones ipsas tum ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and manners, either delivered by Christ himself with his own mouth, or dictated by the Holy Ghost, and preserved in the Catholick Church by a continual Succession with equal Piety of Affection and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as the Proofs of holy Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where the Council first supposes <hi>there are such Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from Christ and the Holy Ghost distinct from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which relate to Faith;</hi> and then it declares <hi>equal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and Veneration due to them.</hi> No one questions but the Word of Christ and Dictates of the Holy Ghost deserve equal Respect, howsoever conveyed to us; But the Point is, whether there was a <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> before this time
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95209:17"/>
for an unwritten Word, as a Foundation of Faith, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the written Word.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is therefore impertinent here to talk of a <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before the written Word;</hi> for our Debate is concerning both being joined together to make a perfect Rule of Faith: and yet this is one of the common Pleas on behalf of Tradition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is likewise impertinent to talk of that Tradition whereby we do receive the written Word. For the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil first supposes the written Word to be received and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced as the Word of God, before it mentions the unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word; and therefore, it cannot be understood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Tradition whereby we receive the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And the Council affirms, <hi>That the Truth of the Gospel is contained partly in Books that are written, and partly in unwritten Traditions.</hi> By the Truth of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel they cannot mean the Scriptures being the Word of God, but that the word was contained partly in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and partly in Tradition; and it is therefore imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to urge the Tradition for Scripture to prove Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be part of the Rule of Faith, as it is here owned by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Council doth not here speak of a Traditionary sense of Scripture, but of a distinct Rule of Faith from the Scripture. For of that it speaks afterwards in the Decree about the use of the Scripture; where it saith, <hi>no man ought to interpret Scripture against the Sense of the Church to whom it belongs to judge of the true Sense and Meaning of Scripture, nor against the unanimous Consent of the Fathers.</hi> Whereby it is evident, the Council is not to be understood of any Consequences drawn out of Scripture concerning things not expresly contained in it; but it clearly means an unwritten Word distinct from the written, and not contained in it, which, together with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95209:18"/>
that, makes up a Complete Rule of Faith. This being the true sense of the Council, I now shew that there was no <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>Which I shall prove by these steps:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. From the Proceedings of the Council it self.</item>
                  <item>2. From the Testimony of the Divines of that Church before the Council for several Centuries.</item>
                  <item>3. From the Canon Law received and allowed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. From the ancient Offices used in that Church.</item>
                  <item>5. From the Testimony of the Fathers.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. From the Proceedings of the Council about this matter.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Postulata</hi> it appears, that the <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> is such as must be known by the sound members of the Church, and especially of the Divines in it. But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the most allowed Histories of that Council, this Rule of Faith was not so received there. For Cardinal <hi>Pallavicini</hi> tells us that it was warmly debated and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vassed even by the Bishops themselves. The Bishop of <hi>Fano (Bertanus)</hi> urged against it, <hi>that God had not given</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hist. Concil.</hi> Trident. l. 6. c. 14. <hi>n.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>equal firmness to Tradition as he had done to Scripture, since several Traditions had failed.</hi> But the Bishop of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonto (Mussus)</hi> opposed him and said, <hi>Though all Truths were not to be equally regarded, yet every word of God ought, and Traditions as well as Scripture were the word of God, and the first Principles of Faith; and the greater part of the Council followed him.</hi> It seems then there was a division in the Council about it; but how could that be if there were a Catholick Tradition about this Rule of Faith? Could the Bishops of the Catholick Church, when assembled in Council to determine Matters of Faith,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95209:18"/>
be no better agreed about the Rule of Faith; and yet must we believe there was at that time a known Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tradition about it, and that it was impossible they should err about such a Tradition? Nay farther, the same Authour tells us, that although this Bishop had gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the greatest part of the Council to him, yet his own heart misgave him, and in the next Congregation him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self proposed, that instead of <hi>equal</hi> it might be put a <hi>like Veneration;</hi> and yet we must believe there was a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tradition for an Equal Veneration to Scripture and Tradition. <hi>But the Bishop of</hi> Chioza, (Naclantus) he saith, <hi>inveighed more bitterly against this Equality,</hi> and in the face of the Council <hi>charged the Doctrine with Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>N.</hi> 4.</note> and he would not allow any Divine Inspiration to Tradition, but that they were to be considered onely as Laws of the Church. It's true, he saith he professed to consent to the Decree afterwards, but withall he tells us, that he was brought under the Inquisition not long after, upon suspicion of Heresie; which shews they were not well satisfied with his submission. We are extremely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to Cardinal <hi>Pallavicini</hi> for his Information in these matters, which are past over too jejunely by <hi>F. Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I proceed to the Testimony of the Divines of the Roman Church before the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by some of them, that when the Fathers appealed to the Tradition of the Church in any controverted Point of Faith, they made their Appeal to those who wrote be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Controversie was started; as <hi>S. Augustin</hi> did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Pelagians, &amp;c.</hi> This is a reasonable Method <note place="margin">Aug. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> Julian.</note> of proceeding, in case Tradition be a Rule of Faith: and therefore must be so even in this point, whether Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be such a Rule or not. For the Divines who wrote before could not be ignorant of the Rule of Faith they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among themselves.</p>

                  <hi>Gabriel Biel</hi> lived in the latter end of the 15th Century, and he affirms, <hi>that the Scripture alone teaches all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi>

                  <hi>Will of God is to be understood by the Scriptures, and by them alone we know the whole Will of God.</hi> If the whole Will of God were to be known by the Scripture, how could part of it be preserved in an unwritten Tradition? And if this were then part of the Rule of Faith, how could such a Man, who was Professour of Divinity at <hi>Tubing</hi> be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it? I know he saith he took the main of his Book from the Lectures of <hi>Eggelingus,</hi> in the Cathedral Church at <hi>Mentz;</hi> but this adds greater strength to the Argument, since it appears hereby that this Doctrine was not confined to the Schools, but openly delivered in one of the most famous Churches of <hi>Germany.</hi>

For if Mens Salvation be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently provided for, by the Written Rule; and the Divine Revelation, be in Order to mens Salvation, what need any other Revelation to the Church, besides what is Written?</p>
               <p>He asserts farther, <hi>that nothing is</hi> de fide, <hi>but what God</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>hath revealed to the Prophets and Apostles, or is deduced from thence.</hi> This he brings to prove <hi>that whatsoever was received as a matter of Faith in the Church, which is not found in Scripture must have come from an Apostolical Tradition.</hi> But if it be <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> according to his own Concession it must be written; and if it be not, how comes it to be received as a matter of Faith? unless it be first proved, that it is necessary to Salvation to receive an unwritten Rule of Faith, as well as a written? For, either it must be necessary on its own Account, and then he saith it must be written; and if not, then it can be no otherwise necessary than because it is to be believed on the Account of a Rule, which makes it necessary. And consequently that Rule must be first proved to be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Article of Faith: Which <hi>Bellarmin</hi> hath no where done; but onely sets down Rules about knowing true Apostolical Traditions from others in matters of Faith, wherein he wisely supposes that which he was to prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95209:20"/>
And the true Occasion of setting up this new Rule of Faith is intimated by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himself in his first Rule of judging true Apostolical Traditions. Which is, <hi>when the Church believes any thing as a Doctrine of Faith which is not in Scripture,</hi> then saith he, <hi>we must judge it to be an Apostolical Tradition.</hi> Why so? <hi>Otherwise the Church must have erred in taking that for a matter of Faith which was not.</hi> And this is the great <hi>Secret</hi> about this <hi>New Rule of Faith;</hi> they saw plainly several things were imposed on the Faith of Christians, which could not be proved from <hi>Scripture;</hi> and they must not yield they had once mistaken, and therefore this New, Additional Less certain Rule for <hi>unnecessary Points</hi> must be advanced, although they wanted <hi>Tradition</hi> among themselves to prove <hi>Tradition a Rule of Faith,</hi> which I shall now farther make appear from their own <hi>School Divines</hi> before the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are to observe among them what those are which they strictly call <hi>Theological Truths,</hi> and by them we shall judge, what they made <hi>the Rule of Faith.</hi> For, they do not make a bare <hi>Revelation</hi> to any Person a sufficient Ground for Faith; but they say <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>And here I shall pass over all those Testimonies of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which speak either of <hi>Tradition</hi> before the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> or to those who did not receive it, or of the <hi>Tradition</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> it self, or of some <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as wholly impertinent.

               </p>
               <p>I begin with <hi>Vincentius Lerinensis,</hi> who by some is thought so great a Favourer of Tradition; but he saith not a word of it as a Rule of Faith distinct from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <note place="margin">

                  </note> for he asserts the <hi>Canon of Scripture to be sufficient of it self for all things.</hi> How can that be, if Tradition be a Rule of Faith distinct from it? He makes indeed Catholick Tradition the best Interpreter of Scripture;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95209:27"/>
and we have no reason to decline it in the Points in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute between us, if <hi>Vincentius</hi> his Rules be follow'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If Antiquity, Universality and Consent be joyned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If the difference be observed between old Errours and new ones. For,</hi> saith he, <hi>when they had length of</hi>

                  <hi>time, Truth is more easily concealed, by those who are concerned to suppress it. And in those Cases we have no other way to deal with them, but by Scripture and ancient Councils.</hi> And this is the Rule we profess to hold to.</p>
               <p>But to suppose any one part of the Church to assume to it self the Title of Catholick, and then to determine what is to be held for Catholick Tradition by all Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Catholick Church, is a thing in it self unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and leaves that part under an impossibility of being reclaimed. For in case the Corrupt Part be judge, we may be sure no Corruptions will be ever owned. <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> grants that <hi>Arianism</hi> had once extremely the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage <note place="margin">c. 6.</note> in Point of Universality, and had many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of its side; if now the prevailing Party be to judge of <hi>Catholick Tradition,</hi> and all are bound to submit to its Decrees without farther Examination, as the Authour of <hi>the Guide in Controversies</hi> saith upon these Rules of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Church-Guides p.</hi> 201.</note> 
                  <hi>Vincentius;</hi> then I say all men were then bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themselves <hi>Arians.</hi> For if <hi>the Guides of the present Church are to be trusted and relied upon for the Doctrine of the Apostolical Church downwards;</hi> how was it possible for any Members of the Church then to oppose <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,</hi> and to reform the Church after its prevalency? To say <hi>it was condemned by a former Council,</hi> doth by no means clear the difficulty; For <hi>the present Guides must be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 199.</note> 
                  <hi>trusted,</hi> whether they were rightly condemned or not; and nothing can be more certain, than that they would be sure to condemn those who condemned them. But
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95209:27"/>
                  <hi>Vincentius</hi> saith, <hi>Every true Lover of Christ preferred the ancient Faith before the novel betraying of it;</hi> but then he must chuse this ancient Faith against the judgment of the present Guides of the Church. And therefore that, according to <hi>Vincentius,</hi> can be no Infallible Rule of Faith.</p>
               <p>But <hi>whether the present Universality dissents from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, whose Judgment should be sooner taken than its own?</hi> saith the same Authour, This had been an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Argument in the mouth of <hi>Ursacius</hi> or <hi>Valens</hi> at the Council of <hi>Ariminum;</hi> and I do not see what Answer the Guide in Controversies could have made. <hi>But both are Parties, and is not the Councils Judgment to be taken rather than a few Opposers?</hi> So that, for all that I can find by these Principles, <hi>Arianism</hi> having the greater number, had hard luck not to be established as the Catholick Faith. But if in that case, particular Persons were to judge between the New and the Old Faith, then the same Reason will still hold, unless the Guides of the Church have obtained a new Patent of Infallibility since that time.</p>
               <p>The great Question among us, is, Where the true an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Faith is; and how we may come to find it out? We are willing to follow the ancient Rules in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Scripture is allowed to be an Infallible Rule on all hands; and I am proving that Tradition was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the ancient Church as distinct from it. But the present Question is, how far Tradition is to be allowed in giving the Sense of Scripture between us. <hi>Vincentius</hi> saith, <hi>we ought to follow it when there is Antiquity, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versality and Consent:</hi> This we are willing to be tryed by. But here comes another Question, Who is to be Judge of these? <hi>The present Guides of the Catholick Church?</hi> To what purpose then are all those Rules? Will they condemn
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95209:28"/>
themselves? Or, as the <hi>Guide</hi> admirably saith, <hi>If the present Universality be its own Judge, when can we think</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 199.</note> 
                  <hi>it will witness its departure from the true Faith?</hi> And if it will not, what a Case is the Church in, under such a pretended <hi>Universality?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The utmost use I can suppose then, <hi>Vincentius</hi> his Rules can be of to us now, is in that Case which he puts when Corruptions and Errours have had time to take root and fasten themselves; and that is, <hi>By an Appeal to Scripture and Ancient Councils.</hi> But because of the charge of Innovation upon us, we are content to be tried by his second Rule. <hi>By the Consent of the Fathers of greatest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, who are agreed on all hands to have lived and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Communion of the Catholick Church: and what they delivered freely, constantly and unanimously, let that be taken for the undoubted and certain Rule in judging be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us.</hi> But <hi>if the present Guides must come in to be Judges here again,</hi> then all our labour is lost, and <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his Rules signifie just nothing,</p>

And if we take away all unwritten Customs, we shall doe wrong to the Gospel, and leave a bare name to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Preaching. And from thence he insists on some Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary Rites, as the Sign of the Cross, Praying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the East, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His business is to shew that to the greater solemnity of Christian Worship several Customs were observed in the Church, which are not to be found in Scripture. And if other ancient Customs were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved which are not commanded in Scripture, he sees no Reason that they should find such fault with this. And <note place="margin">
                     <hi>c.</hi> 29.</note> this is the whole force of S. <hi>Basil</hi>'s Reasoning, which can never be stretched to the setting up Tradition as a Rule of Faith distinct from Scripture.</p>
               <p>Having thus shewed that there was no Catholick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for this New Rule of Faith, I am now to give an Account how it came into the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:95209:29"/>
The first Step that was made towards it, was by the second Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> For, although the Emperour in the Synodical Epistle proposed to them the true ancient Mehod of judging in Councils, <hi>By the Books of Scripture placed on a Throne in the middle of the Council;</hi> yet they found, they could by no means doe their business that Way, and therefore as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> observes, they set up <hi>Tradition</hi> in the 6th and 7th Sessions, and pronounced Anathema's against those who rejected unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But although there were then almost as little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for Tradition as Scripture in the matter of Images; yet there having been a practice among them, to set up <note place="margin">Richer. <hi>Hist. Conc. General. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>n.</hi> 13.</note> and to worship Images, (which <hi>Richerius</hi> thinks came first into the Church from the Reverence shewed to the Emperours Statues) they thought this the securest way to advance that, which they could never defend by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>But this prevailed very little in the Western Church, as is well known by the rejection of that Synod; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> joined with them, and produced a wretched Tradition about <hi>Sylvester</hi> and <hi>Constantine</hi> to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie their Proceedings; as appears by the Acts of that Council. And from the time that Images were received at <hi>Rome,</hi> the force of Tradition was magnified; and by degrees it came to be made use of to justifie other Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, for which they had nothing else to plead.</p>
               <p>Hitherto Tradition was made use of for matters of Practice, and the Scripture was generally received as the Rule of Faith; but some of the Schoolmen found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to defend some Doctrines held in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by mere Scripture, and therefore they were forced to call in the Help of Tradition. The most remarkable of these was <hi>Scotus,</hi> who although in his Prologue he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95209:29"/>
as is said already, <hi>that the Scripture did sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contain all things necessary to salvation;</hi> yet when he came to particular Points, he found Scripture alone would never doe their business. And especially as to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church, about which he saw the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> then held many things which could never be <note place="margin">Scot. <hi>in l. 1. Sent. Dist.</hi> 11.</note> proved from thence. And this was the true occasion of Traditions being taken in for a partial Rule.</p>
               <p>For after the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> had declared several things to be of Faith, which were in no former Creeds, as <hi>Scotus</hi> confesses, and they were bound to defend them as Points of Faith, the Men of Wit and Subtilty, such as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>l. 4. Dist.</hi> 11. <hi>n.</hi> 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Scotus</hi> was, were very hard put to it, to find out ways to prove those to have been old Points of Faith, which they knew to be very new. Then they betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to two things, which would serve for a colour to blind the common People; and those were,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it was true, these things were not in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but <hi>Christ said to his Disciples, I have many things to say unto you,</hi> &amp;c. and among those many things they were to believe these new Doctrines to be some.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When this would not serve, then they told them, though these Doctrines were not explicitly in Scripture, yet they were implicitly there; and the Church had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to fetch them out of those dark places, and to set them in a better light. And thus <hi>Scotus</hi> helped himself out in that dark Point of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> First he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts <note place="margin">
                     <hi>n.</hi> 13.</note> to make it out by Tradition, but finding that would not doe the business effectually, he runs to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, especially in the business of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and <hi>we are to suppose,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the Church doth expound the Scripture with the same Spirit which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited them.</hi> This was a brave <hi>Supposition</hi> indeed, but he offers no proof of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95209:30"/>
If we allow <hi>Scotus</hi> to have been the Introducer of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> as to some Points of Faith, yet I have made it appear, that his Doctrine was not received in the Schools. But after the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> had declared several Propositions to be <hi>Heretical,</hi> which could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Scripture, there was found a Necessity of holding, that there were <hi>Catholick Truths</hi> not contained in Scripture. The first Proposition there condemned was, <hi>That the Substance of Bread and Wine remain in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Altar:</hi> the second, <hi>That the Accidents do not remain without their Subject:</hi> Now how could such as these be condemned by Scripture? But although one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some were said to be <hi>Heretical,</hi> yet all were said to be <hi>against Catholick Truth.</hi> But where is this <hi>Catholick Truth</hi> to be found? Cardinal <hi>Cusanus</hi> thought of a <hi>current sense of Scripture, according</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>to the Churches Occasions;</hi> so that though the Churches Practice should be directly contrary, yet the Scripture was to be understood as the Church practised. This was a very plain and effectual way, if it had not been too gross; and therefore it was thought much better by Cardinal <hi>Turrecremata,</hi> to found Catholick Verities on <hi>unwritten Tradition,</hi> as well as on Scripture.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Leo</hi> X. in his famous Bull against <hi>Luther, Exurge Domine,</hi> made a farther step; for 22 Proposition condemned therein, is <hi>That it is certain that it is not in the power of the Church or Pope to appoint new Articles of Faith.</hi> It seems then the Pope or Church have a Power to constitute new Articles of Faith; and then neither Scripture nor Tradition can be the certain Rule of Faith, but the Present Church or Pope.</p>
               <p>This had put an end to the business, if it would have taken; but the World being wiser, and the Errours and

                  </gap> Scripture, Tradition was pitched upon as a secure Way; and accordingly several attempts were made towards the setting of it up, by some Provincial Councils before that of <hi>Trent.</hi> So in the Council of <hi>Sens,</hi> 1527. Can. 53. It is declared to be a pernicious Errour to receive nothing but what is deduced from Scripture, because Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered many things to his Apostles which were never written. But not one thing is alledged as a matter of Faith so conveyed; but onely some Rites about Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Prayer; and yet he is declared a Heretick as well as Schismatick, who rejects them. Indeed <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Creed</hi> is mentioned, but not as to the Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, but as to the <hi>Authours</hi> of it. But what is there in all this that makes a man guilty of Heresie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jod. Clicthoveus,</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Paris,</hi> the next Year wrote an Explication and Defence of this Council, but he mistakes the Point; for he runs upon it as if it were, <hi>whether all things to be believed and observed in the Church, were to be expresly set down in Scripture?</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a just consequence out of it is sufficient. And the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test strength of what he saith to the purpose, is, <hi>that the other Opinion was condemned in the Council of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>And from no better a Tradition than this did the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> declare <hi>the unwritten Word to be a Rule of Faith equal with the Scriptures.</hi>

               <head>II. <hi>About the Canon of Scripture, defined by the Council of</hi> Trent.</head>
               <p>This is declared by the Council of <hi>Trent, Sess.</hi> 4. and therein the Books of <hi>Tobias, Judith, Wisedom of</hi> Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>Ecclesiasticus, Maccabees</hi> and <hi>Baruch</hi> are received for <hi>Canonical, with the twenty two Books</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and an <hi>Anathema</hi> is denounced against those who do not. And presently it adds, <hi>that hereby the World might see what Authorities the Council proceeded on for con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rming matters of Faith as well as reforming manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to shew that there was no <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> for the ground of this <hi>Decree,</hi> we are to observe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That these <hi>Canonical Books</hi> are not so called in a large sense for such as have been used or read in the <hi>Church;</hi> but in the strict sense for such as are a good <hi>Foundation</hi> to build matters of Faith upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That these Books were not so received by all even in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi> For what is received by virtue of a <hi>Catholick Tradition,</hi> must be universally received by the Members of it. But that so it was not appears by the account given by both the Historians. <hi>F. Paul</hi> saith, <hi>that in the Congregation there were two different Opinions</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hist. of the Council of</hi> Tr. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 154.</note> 
                  <hi>of those who were for a particular Catalogue; one was to distinguish the Books into three parts, the other to make all the Books of equal authority; and that this latter was carried by the greater number.</hi> Now if this were a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Tradition,</hi> how was it possible for the Fathers of the Council to divide about it? And Cardinal <hi>Pallavicini</hi> himself saith, <hi>that</hi> Bertanus <hi>and</hi> Seripandus <hi>propounded the putting the Books into several Classes,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>p.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>some to be read for Piety, and others to confirm Doctrines of Faith;</hi> and <hi>that Cardinal</hi> Seripando <hi>wrote a most lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:95209:34"/>
                  <hi>Book to that purpose.</hi> What! against a <hi>Catholick Tradition?</hi> It seems, he was far from believing it to be so. And he confesses, <hi>that when they came to the Anathema, the Legats and twenty Fathers were for it;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 8.</note> Madrucci <hi>and fourteen were against it, because some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks were of another opinion.</hi> Then certainly, they knew no <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>Among these Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> is mention'd, <hi>who was,</hi> saith <hi>Pallavicini, severely rebuked for it by</hi> Melchior Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus; but what is that to the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church? <hi>Canus</hi> doth indeed appeal to the Council of <hi>Carthage, Innocentius</hi> I. and the Council of <hi>Florence;</hi> but this doth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Can. Loc. Theol. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> not make up a <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> against <hi>Cajetan;</hi> who declares that he follows S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who cast those Books <note place="margin">Cajet. <hi>in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. fine.</hi>
                  </note> out of the <hi>Canon</hi> with Respect to Faith. And he answers the Arguments brought on the other side, by this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, that they are <hi>Canonical for Edification, but not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>for Faith.</hi> If therefore <hi>Canus</hi> would have confuted <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan</hi> he ought to have proved that they were owned for <hi>Canonical</hi> in the latter Sense. <hi>Cajetan</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Clemens</hi> VII. before the Historical Books, owns the great Obligation of the Church to S. <hi>Jerom</hi> for distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing <hi>Canonical and Apocryphal Books;</hi> and saith, <hi>that he hath freed it from the Reproach of the Jews, who said the Christians made Canonical Books of the Old Testament which they knew nothing of.</hi> And this was an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of great consequence; but <hi>Canus</hi> takes no notice of it, and it fully answers his Objection, <hi>that men could not know what Books were truly Canonical,</hi> viz. such as were of <hi>divine inspiration, and so received by the Jews. Catharinus</hi> saith, in Answer to <hi>Cajetan, that the Jews</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Annot. in</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jet. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 37.</note> 
                  <hi>had one Canon, and the Church another.</hi> But how comes the Canon to be received as of <hi>divine Inspiration</hi> which was not so received among the Jews? This were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95209:35"/>
all into the Churches <hi>Inspiration</hi> and not into <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmin</hi> grants, <hi>that the Church can by no means make</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Verb. Dei, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>a Book Canonical which is not so, but onely declare what is Canonical, and that, not at pleasure; but from ancient Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies, from similitude of style with Books uncontrovert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the general Sense and Taste of Christian People.</hi> Now the Case here relates to Books not first written to Christians, but among the <hi>Jews,</hi> from whom we receive <hi>the Oracles of God committed to them.</hi> And if the <hi>Jews</hi> never believed these Books to contain <hi>the Oracles of God</hi> in them, how can the Christian Church embrace them for such, unless it assumes a Power to make, and not merely to declare Canonical Books? For he grants we have no Testimony of the <hi>Jews</hi> for them.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Catharinus</hi> himself cannot deny <hi>that S.</hi> Jerom <hi>saith, that although the Church reads those Books, yet it doth not receive them for Canonical Scriptures.</hi> And he makes a pitisull Answer to it. For he confesses, <hi>that the Church taken for the Body of the Faithfull did not receive them; but as taken for the Governours it did.</hi> But others grant that they did receive them no more than the People; and as to the other, the cause of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <note place="margin">Jul. Ruger. <hi>de libris Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicis, p.</hi> 80.</note> is plainly given us. And in truth he resolves all at last into the opinion of the Popes <hi>Innocentius, Gelasius</hi> and <hi>Eugenius</hi> 4. But we are obliged to him for letting us know the Secret of so much zeal for these <hi>Apocryphal Books,</hi> viz. <hi>that they are of great force against the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, for Purgatory is no where so expresly mention'd as in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 41.</note> 
                  <hi>the Maccabees.</hi> If it had not been for this, S. <hi>Jerom</hi> and <hi>Cajetan</hi> might have escaped Censure, and the <hi>Jewish Canon</hi> had been sufficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:95209:35"/>
But to shew, that there hath been no <hi>Catholick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> about the <hi>Tridentine Canon,</hi> I shall prove these two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there hath been a <hi>constant Tradition against it</hi> in the <hi>Eastern Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That there never was a <hi>constant Tradition</hi> for it in the <hi>Western Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That there hath been a <hi>constant Tradition against it in the Eastern Church,</hi> which received the <hi>Jewish Canon,</hi> without the Books declared <hi>Canonical</hi> by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi> We have very early Evidence of this in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of <hi>Melito,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sardis,</hi> who lived not long after the middle of the 2d.

               </p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95209:36"/>
between this <hi>Tradition</hi> and that of the <hi>Eastern Church,</hi> and therefore there could be no possible Reason for the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to make a Decree for this <hi>Tradition,</hi> and to <hi>anathematize</hi> all who did not submit to it. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This <hi>Tradition</hi> was not <hi>universally</hi> received at that time. <hi>Innocentius</hi> his Epistle is supposed to be written <hi>A. D.</hi> 405. Was the Western Church agreed before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about this matter? This Epistle was written to <hi>Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perius,</hi> a Gallican Bishop, (to whom St. <hi>Jerom</hi> dedicated his Commentaries on <hi>Zechariah,)</hi> but now it unluckily falls out, that the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Gallican Church</hi> was contrary to this; as appears by <hi>S. Hilary,</hi> (who could <note place="margin">Hilar. <hi>Prolog. in</hi> Psalm.</note> not be ignorant of it, being a famous Bishop of that Church) and he tells us, <hi>there were but</hi> 22 <hi>Canonical Books of the Old Testament.</hi> I confess he saith, <hi>some were for adding</hi> Tobit <hi>and</hi> Judith, but it is very observable that he saith, <hi>that the other Account is most agreeable to ancient Tradition,</hi> which is a mighty Argument against <hi>Innocentius,</hi> who brings no Tradition to justifie his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. When St. <hi>Augustin</hi> produced a Place out of the <note place="margin">

of Tradition to be found? If <hi>Innocent</hi> were in the right, S. <hi>Jerom</hi> was foully mistaken, and in plain terms belied the Church. But how is this consistent with the <hi>Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of St. <hi>Jerom?</hi> Or with common discretion if the Church did receive those Books for Canonical? For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one could have disproved him. And it required no great Judgment or deep Learning to know what Books were received, and what not. If S. <hi>Jerom</hi> were so mistaken (which it is very hard to believe) how came <hi>Ruffinus</hi> not to observe his errours and opposition to the Church? Nay, how came <hi>Ruffinus</hi> himself to fall into the very same prodigious mistake? For he not onely rejects the controverted Books out of the <hi>Canon,</hi> but saith, <hi>he follow'd the ancient Tradition therein.</hi> What <note place="margin">Ruffin. <hi>in Symbol. pag.</hi> 188, 189.</note> account can be given of this matter? If <hi>Innocent</hi>'s Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were right, these men were under a gross Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and yet they were learned and knowing Persons, and more than ordinarily conversant in the <hi>Doctrines and Traditions</hi> of the Church.</p>

               <p>These I think are sufficient to shew there was no <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Tradition</hi> for the Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> about the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I now proceed to shew on what pretences and colours it came in, and by what degrees and steps it advanced.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first step was, the Esteem which some of the Fathers expressed of these Books in quoting of passages out of them. We do not deny that the Fathers did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cite them: even those who expresly rejected them from being <hi>Canonical,</hi> and not as ordinary Books, but as such as were usefull to the Church, wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wise Sayings and good Actions are recorded. But the many Quotations the Fathers do make out of them is the onely plausible pretence which those of the Church
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95209:38"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> have to defend the putting them into the Canon, as appears by <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and others. The Book of <hi>Tobit,</hi> they tell us, is mentioned by S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> St. <hi>Basil,</hi> and St. <hi>Augustin.</hi> Of <hi>Judith</hi> by St. <hi>Jerom</hi> who mentions <hi>a Tradition that it was allowed in the Council of</hi> Nice; but certainly S. <hi>Jerom</hi> never believed it, when he declares it to be <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> and not sufficient to prove any matter of Faith. The Book of <hi>Wisedom</hi> by S. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> S. <hi>Cyril</hi> and S. <hi>Augustin. Ecclesiasticus</hi> by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian, Epiphanius,</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> and S. <hi>Augustin.</hi> The <hi>Machabees</hi> by <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus, Origen, Eusebius,</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin.</hi> But all these Testimonies onely prove that they thought something in those Books worth alledging, but not that they judged the Books themselves <hi>Canonical.</hi> And better Arguments from their Citations might be brought for the Books of the <hi>Sibylls</hi> than for any of these. We are not then to judge of their Opinion of <hi>Canonical Books</hi> by bare Citations, but by their declared Judgments about them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next step was, when they came to be read in Churches; but about this there was no certain Rule. For the Councils of <hi>Laodicea</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> differed chiefly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Point. The former decreed, <hi>That none but Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Scripture should be read under the Name of Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;</hi> and sets down the names of the <hi>Canonical Books then to be read,</hi> (and so leaves out the <hi>Apocalypse.)</hi> The latter <hi>from their being read, inferr'd their being Canonical;</hi> for it agrees with the other, <hi>that none but Canonical should be read,</hi> and because these were read, it reckons them up with the <hi>Canonical Books;</hi> for so the Canon concludes, <hi>We have received from our Fathers that these Books are to be read in Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:95209:39"/>
But the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> was not peremptory in this matter; but desired <hi>it might be referred to</hi> Boniface <hi>and other Bishops beyond the Seas:</hi> Which shews that here was no Decree absolutely made, nor any <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Tradition;</hi> for then to what purpose should they send to other Churches to advise about it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. When they came to be distinguished from <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Writings.</hi> Whence those who do not consider the Reason of it, conclude them to have been <hi>Canonical.</hi> But sometimes <hi>Apocryphal</hi> signified such Books as were not in <hi>the Canon of Faith,</hi> as in the Authours before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; sometimes such Books which <hi>were not allowed to be used among Christians.</hi> This distinction we have in <hi>Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus,</hi> who saith there are three sorts of Books; <hi>Canonical,</hi> as <hi>the</hi> 22 <hi>of the Old Testament; Ecclesiastical,</hi> of which sort he reckons <hi>Wisedom, Ecclesiasticus, Tobit, Judith</hi> and <hi>Machabees,</hi> and these he saith <hi>were permitted to be read in Churches,</hi> but no Argument could be brought out of them for matter of Faith, <hi>Apocryphal</hi> are such <hi>which by no means were permitted to be read.</hi> And thus <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> his words may well be understood: For he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with saying, <hi>that other Writings were not onely to be rejected, but to be condemned.</hi> And so his meaning is to distinguish them from such <hi>counterfeit Divine Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> as were then abroad. For these were not to be wholly rejected, and in that large sense he admits them into the <hi>Canon,</hi> taking <hi>Ecclesiastical Writings</hi> which were read in Churches into that number. And in this sense S. <hi>Augustin</hi> used the Word <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> when the Book of <hi>Enoch</hi> is so called by him, and such other <hi>counterfeit Writings</hi> under the Names of the <hi>Prophets and Apostles;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> but elsewhere he distinguishes between the <hi>Canonical Books of</hi> Salomon, <hi>and those which bear his Name;</hi> which he saith <hi>the more learned know not to be his, but the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:95209:39"/>
                  <hi>Church had of old owned their Authority.</hi> But in the case of the Book of <hi>Enoch,</hi> he appeals to the <hi>Canon,</hi> which <hi>was kept in the Jewish Temple;</hi> and so falls in with S. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom;</hi> and he confesses it is hard to justifie the Authority of those which are not in the <hi>Hebrew Canon.</hi> Of the <hi>Machabees</hi> he saith, <hi>It is distinguished from the Writings</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Aug. <hi>de Civ. Dei, l.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 36.</note> 
                  <hi>called Canonical; but it is received by the Church as such.</hi> What! to confirm matters of Faith? No. But <hi>for the glorious sufferings therein recorded;</hi> and elsewhere he saith, <note place="margin">C. Gaudent. <hi>c.</hi> 29.</note> 
                  <hi>it is usefull, if it be soberly read.</hi> S. <hi>Augustin</hi> knew very well that all Books were not received alike; and that many were received in some parts of the Western Church from the old Translation out of the <hi>LXX,</hi> which were not received in the <hi>Eastern;</hi> and therefore in his Books of <hi>Christian Doctrine</hi> he gives Rules in judging of <hi>Canonical</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Doctr. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Books;</hi> to follow <hi>the Authority of the greatest Number of Catholick Churches, especially the Apostolical; and that those which were received by all, should be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those which were onely received by some.</hi> But he very well knew, that the Hebrew Canon was universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and that the controverted Books were not; and therefore, according to his Rule, these could never be of Equal Authority with the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When the Roman Church declared that it received the controverted Books into the <hi>Canon.</hi> This is said to have been done by <hi>Gelasius,</hi> with his <hi>Synod of LXX Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> (and yet it is hard to understand how <hi>Gregory</hi> so soon after should contradict it.) The Title of it in the old MS. produced by <hi>Chiffletius,</hi> and by him attributed to <hi>Hormisdas,</hi> is, <hi>The Order of the Old Testament which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Not. in</hi> Vigil. Taps. <hi>p.</hi> 150.</note> 
                  <hi>the holy Catholick Roman Church receives and honours is this.</hi> But whether by <hi>Gelasius,</hi> or <hi>Hormisdas,</hi> I cannot understand, why such a Decree as this should not be put into the old <hi>Roman Code</hi> of <hi>Canons,</hi> if it had been then
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95209:40"/>
made. That there was such a one appears by the Copies of it in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> mentioned by the <hi>Roman</hi> Correctors of <hi>Gratian,</hi> and by mention of it by the Canon <hi>Si Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum, Dist.</hi> 19. and <hi>De Libellis, Dist.</hi> 20. and by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we understand what Canons of Councils and Decrees of Popes are in it, among whom are both <hi>Gelasius</hi> and <hi>Hormisdas.</hi> This they agree to be the same with that published by <hi>Wendelstin</hi> at <hi>Mentz,</hi> 1525. The Epistle of <hi>Innocentius</hi> to <hi>Exuperius</hi> with the <hi>Canon</hi> is there publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; but not the other; and so is the Canon of the Council of <hi>Carthage;</hi> but that of <hi>Laodicea</hi> is cut off; and so they are in that published by <hi>Dionysius Exiguus</hi> and <hi>Quesnell, (Justellus</hi> his ancient Copy was imperfect there,) but both these Canons being in the <hi>Roman Code,</hi> are an Argument to me, that the controverted Books were received by the <hi>Roman Church</hi> at that time; but in such a manner, that S. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Prologues still stood in the <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Latin Bible,</hi> with the Commentaries of <hi>Lyra,</hi> and Additions of <hi>Burgensis,</hi> which were stiff for the <hi>Hebrew Canon;</hi> and S. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Authority prevailed more than the Pope's, as appears fully by what hath been already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To advance the Authority of these Books one step higher, <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV. declared them to be <hi>Part of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> in the Instruction given to the <hi>Armenians.</hi> Which the Roman Writers pretend to have been done in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Florence:</hi> But <hi>Naclantus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chioza,</hi> in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as <hi>Pallavicini</hi> saith, <hi>denied that any</hi>

                  <hi>such Decree was made by the Council of</hi> Florence; <hi>because the last Session of it ended</hi> 1439. <hi>and that Decree was signed</hi> Feb. 4. 1441. To this the Legat replied, <hi>that this was a mistake occasioned by</hi> Abraham Cretensis, <hi>who published the Latin version of it, onely till the Greeks departure; but the Council continued three years longer, as appeared by</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:95209:40"/>
                  <hi>the Extracts of</hi> Augustinus Patricius, since published in the Tomes of the Councils. But he never mentions the <hi>Canon of Scripture;</hi> however, because <hi>Cervinus</hi> affirms that he saw the Original signed by the Pope and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, we have no reason to dispute it. But then it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears how very little it signified, when <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Florence</hi> opposed it, and Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> slighted it, and all who embraced the Council of <hi>Basil</hi> looked on <hi>Eugenius</hi> his Decree as void; and after all, that very Decree onely joins the <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Books</hi> in the <hi>same Canon,</hi> as the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> had done; but it was reserved as the peculiar Honour of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> to declare <hi>that Matters of Faith might be proved out of them, as well as out of any Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Scriptures.</hi>

of the Council as far as I can judge.

I shall add but one thing more to this purpose, which is taken from the want of Antiquity in the <hi>Arabick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;</hi> which is confessed by the learned Criticks on all sides. And even this tends to prove my design. For when the <hi>Saracen</hi> Empire prevailed, the People grew more acquainted with the <hi>Arabick</hi> than with the ancient <hi>Syriack</hi> or <hi>Coptick;</hi> and therefore the Scripture was then translated into <hi>Arabick;</hi> (as <hi>Vasaeus</hi> saith it was done in <hi>Spain</hi> after the Moors came thither by a Bishop of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil)</hi> and this was the true reason why the <hi>Arabick Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> have no greater Antiquity.

                  <hi>that the Arabick is become the most Vulgar Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in the Eastern Parts.</hi> And because it was so in <hi>Syria</hi> as well as <hi>Egypt,</hi> therefore there are different <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick Versions;</hi> the one called <hi>Codex Antiochenus,</hi> and the other <hi>Alexandrinus.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And now I proceed to give an Account of the <hi>Methods</hi> and <hi>Steps by which</hi> this Decree came to its ripeness.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first <hi>Step</hi> was the <hi>Declension</hi> and <hi>Corruption</hi> of the <hi>Latin Tongue</hi> in the <hi>Western Church.</hi> It is observed by <hi>Polybius, that from the time of the first League between</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Polyb. <hi>l.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>the Romans and Carthaginians, the Latin Tongue was so much changed even in</hi> Rome <hi>it self that very few could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Words of it.</hi> And <hi>Festus</hi> in <hi>Latine loqui</hi> saith, <hi>that the Language was so alter'd, that scarce any part of it remained entire. Scaliger</hi> thinks <hi>these words were added to</hi> Festus <hi>by</hi> Paulus Diaconus; which seems much more probable, since he lived in the time of <hi>Charlemagn.</hi> At which time we may easily suppose the <hi>Latin Tongue</hi> to have been very much corrupted by the Writers, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95209:45"/>
not so easie to be understood any where by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People in sudden Discourse, as it had been before. Which appears evident by the <hi>Latin Sermons</hi> made to the People in the several Provinces in the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> as in <hi>Africa</hi> by S. <hi>Augustin</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius;</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Petrus Chrysologus, Laurentius Novariensis, Gaudentius Brixiensis, Ennodius Ticinensis:</hi> In <hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Isidore, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dephonsus</hi> and others: In <hi>Gaul</hi> by <hi>Caesarius, Eucherius, Eligius,</hi> and several others, whose Latin Sermons to the People are still extant. In the Council of <hi>Tours,</hi> in the <note place="margin">

For the <hi>Franks</hi> then either retained the <hi>Original German,</hi> or used the <hi>Rustick Roman;</hi> but this latter so much prevailed over the other, that in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Oaths between <hi>Lewis</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> upon parting the Dominions of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> set down in <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thardus,</hi>

                  <hi>the Princes and Great Men retained the German, but the generality then spake the Rustick Roman;</hi> as appears by the Oath of the People; which begins thus.</p>

By which we may see what a mixture of <hi>Latin</hi> there was in the <hi>vulgar Language</hi> then used by the <hi>Franks,</hi> and how easie it was for the People then to understand the <hi>publick Offices</hi> being constant; but the <hi>Sermons</hi> not being so, there was greater necessity to turn them into that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptor <hi>Rustick Roman,</hi> which was thoroughly understood by them. In <hi>Spain</hi> the <hi>Latin</hi> was less corrupted before the <hi>Gothick</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> or <hi>Moorish</hi> Words were taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. <hi>Lucius Mariness</hi> saith, <hi>that had it not been for</hi>

                  <hi>the mixture of those words, the Spaniards had spoken as good Latin as the Romans did in the time of</hi> Tully: and he saith, <hi>that to his time he had seen Epistles written in Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, wherein all the Nouns and Verbs were good Latin.</hi> In <hi>Italy</hi> the Affinity of the vulgar prevailing Language and the <hi>Latin</hi> continued so great, that the difference seemed for some hundred years, no more than of the learned and common <hi>Greek,</hi> or of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scotch;</hi> and so no necessity was then apprehended of Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the correct Tongue into a corrupt Dialect of it.</p>
               <p>But where there was a plain difference of Language there was some care even then taken, that the People might understand what they heard, as appears by these things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Alcuinus</hi> gives an Account why one day was called <hi>Sabbatum in</hi> 12 <hi>Lectionibus,</hi> when there were but <hi>six Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>

               <p>The Council of <hi>Trent Sess.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 16. declares, <hi>That the Good Works of justified Persons do truly deserve Eternal Life;</hi> and <hi>Can.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Council</hi> hath not thought fit to declare what it means by <hi>truly meriting;</hi> but certainly it must be opposed to an improper kind of Meriting, and what that is we must learn from the <hi>Divines</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Some say, That some of the Fathers speak of an <hi>improper</hi> kind of Merit, which is no more than the due Means for the attaining of Happiness as the End. So <hi>Vega</hi> confesses they often use the word <hi>Merit,</hi> where <note place="margin">Vega <hi>de Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stif. l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> there is no Reason for <hi>Merit,</hi> either by way of <hi>Congruity</hi> or <hi>Condignity.</hi> Therefore, where there is true Merit there must be a proper Reason for it. And the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> being designed to condemn some prevailing Opinions at that time, among those they called <hi>Hereticks,</hi> this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion of <hi>true Merit</hi> must be levelled against some Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of theirs; but they held <hi>Good Works</hi> to be <hi>necessary</hi> as <hi>Means</hi> to an end, and therefore this could not be the meaning of the Council.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suarez</hi> saith, <hi>the words of the Council ought to be speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>

2. Others say, that a <hi>meer Congruity</hi> arising from the Promise and Favour of God in rewarding the acts of his Grace in justified Persons cannot be the <hi>proper Merit</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Council. And that for these Reasons.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Because <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Promise</hi> doth not give any <hi>Intrinsick value</hi> to the Nature of the Act; no more than his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning doth increase the Nature of Guilt. If the King of <hi>Persia</hi> had promised a Province to him that gave him a draught of Water, the Act it self had been no more <hi>meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious;</hi> but it only shewed the Munificence of the Prince; no more do God's Promises of Eternal Life add any merit to the Acts of Grace, but onely set forth the Infinite Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Promiser.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the Conference at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> (the year this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree passed) by the Emperour's Order the Protestant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did yield, <hi>that by virtue of God</hi>'s <hi>Promise the Reward of Eternal Life was due to justified Persons; as a Father</hi>

                  <hi>promising a great Reward to his Son for his pains in study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, makes it become due to him, although there be no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between them.

                  <hi>it cannot in Justice be due to it; and consequently if God gives it, he must do it freely.

                  <hi>depends on divine Acceptation in order to a Reward; and if it did depend on the intrinsick worth of the Acts, God could not in justice deny the Reward; which is false; and therefore it wholly depends on the good will and favour of God.</hi>

But how then do they hold the Doctrine and Tradition of <hi>true Merit? He holds that good Works are properly and truly good.</hi> So do we, and yet deny <hi>Merit.</hi> But he grants, <hi>that he denies that they bear any proportion to Eternal Life,</hi> and therefore they cannot be <hi>truly merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> of it. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himself asserts <hi>that without the divine Promise good Works have a proportion to Eternal Life,</hi> and this he saw was necessary to defend the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> but then he adds, <hi>that there is no obligation on God's part to reward in such a manner without a Promise.</hi> Now here are two hard Points, 1. To make it appear that there is such a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriousness in good Works <hi>without a Divine Promise.</hi> 2. That if there were so, there is <hi>no Obligation on God</hi> to reward such Acts in point of <hi>Justice.</hi> The former is so much harder to do from what he had proved before, <hi>c.</hi> 14. Viz. <hi>that they are not meritorious without a Promise;</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:95209:53"/>
and here he proves <hi>that they have no proportion to the Reward, from Scripture, Fathers and Reason; because there is no Obligation on God to do it, either from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative or distributive justice; and because we are God's Servants.</hi> These are good Arguments against himself for how can such Acts then become <hi>meritorious</hi> without a Promise? If there be no proportion or <hi>equality</hi> on Man's part, no Justice on God's part to reward, how can they possibly be <hi>meritorious?</hi> But this is too deep for me to comprehend. My business is <hi>Tradition,</hi> and I have evidently proved that there was no <hi>Tradition</hi> even in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for the <hi>true Merit</hi> defined by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi> It were easie to carry this point higher, by she wing that the <hi>Fathers</hi> knew nothing of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but that hath been done by many already, and it is needless in so plain a case.</p>

               <p>This Doctrine had some followers in the Schools, but not many in comparison of those who opposed it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what is said already.</p>

But here lies the main difficulty, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath altered both <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of this Sacrament from the primitive Institution; and yet it dares not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow the Ordinations made without them, as is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the Case of the <hi>Greek Church;</hi> and therefore they have been forced to allow this latitude as to the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of this Sacrament; although such an allowance doth really overthrow its being a true and proper <hi>Sacrament</hi> on their own grounds.</p>

                  <p>There are two things necessary to the <hi>Matter</hi> of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it be an <hi>External and sensible Sign;</hi> which S. <hi>Augustin</hi> calls an <hi>Element</hi> in that known Expression, <hi>Accedat verbum ad Elementum, &amp; fit Sacramentum;</hi> which <note place="margin">Aug. <hi>in</hi> Joh. <hi>Tr.</hi> 80.</note>

How then can <hi>Contrition</hi> make up any part of the <hi>Matter</hi> of a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> when it is not <hi>external?</hi> How can <hi>Confession,</hi> when it is no <hi>visible sign,</hi> nor any <hi>permanent</hi> thing as an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> must be? how can <hi>satisfaction</hi> be any part of the Sacrament, which may be done when the <hi>Effect</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is over in <hi>Absolution?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There must be a <hi>Resemblance</hi> between the <hi>Sign</hi> and the <hi>Thing signified.</hi> Which St. <hi>Augustin</hi> is so peremptory in, <hi>that he denies there can be any Sacrament where there</hi>

And the Power of the Keys,</hi> he saith, <hi>is like the Priests Judgment about Leprosie in the Levitical Law, God healed the Person, and the Priest declared him healed. Or as our Saviour first raised</hi> Lazarus, <hi>then gave him to his Disciples to be loosed. He is loosed before God, but not in the face of the Church but by the Priests Judgment.

                  <p>This Doctrin of <hi>Peter Lombard's</hi> is none of those <hi>in quibus Magister nontenetur;</hi> for we see he had followers of great Name, almost to the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> But it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95209:64"/>
happened, that both <hi>Th. Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> agreed in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing this Doctrin; and the <hi>Franciscans</hi> and <hi>Dominicans</hi> bearing greatest sway in the Debates of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> what they agreed in, passed for <hi>Catholick Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And <hi>Vasquez</hi> is in the right when he saith, <hi>this</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Vasquez <hi>in</hi> 3. <hi>Q.</hi> 84. <hi>A.</hi> 3. <hi>dub.</hi> 2. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Doctrin was condemned by the Council of</hi> Trent; and so was <hi>Scotus,</hi> when he said, <hi>that it did derogate from the Sacrament of Penance;</hi> for in truth it makes it but a <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Sacrament,</hi> since it hath no Power of conferring Grace; which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> makes necessary to a <hi>true and proper Sacrament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The main Point in this Debate is, whether <hi>true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition</hi> be required to <hi>Absolution</hi> or not? Which <hi>Scotus</hi> saw well enough and argues accordingly. For none of them deny, that where there is true Contrition, there is immediately an <hi>Absolution</hi> before God; and if this be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired before the <hi>Priests Absolution,</hi> he can have no more to do, but to pronounce or declare him absolved. But if something less than <hi>Contrition</hi> do qualifie a Man for <hi>Absolution,</hi> and by that Grace be conveyed, then the Power of Absolution hath a great and real Effect; for it puts a Man into a <hi>State of Grace</hi> which he had not been in without it. And from hence came the Opinion, that <hi>Attrition</hi> with <hi>Absolution</hi> was sufficient; and they do not understand the Council of <hi>Trent's</hi> Doctrin of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> of <hi>Penance,</hi> who deny it, as will appear to any one that reads the 4th Chapter of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> and compares it with the 7, and 8 Canons about <hi>Sacraments in general.</hi> It is true that Contrition is there said to have the first place in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Penitent; but observe what follows: <hi>True Contrition reconciles a Man to God, before he receives this Sacrament.</hi> What hath the Priest then to do, but to declare him reconciled? <hi>But it saith not without the desire of it.</hi> Suppose not, yet
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95209:64"/>
the thing is done upon the desire, &amp; therefore the Priests Power can be no more than declarative. And that such a Desire is so necessary as without Contrition avails not, is more than the Council hath proved, and it is bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supposed, to maintain the Necessity of going to the Priest for <hi>Absolution;</hi> and so it will be no more than a Precept of the <hi>Church,</hi> and not a condition of Remission in the Sacrament of <hi>Penance.</hi> But afterwards, it declares <hi>that imperfect Contrition or Attrition doth dispose a Man for the Grace of God in this Sacrament;</hi> and by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Canons, <hi>the Sacraments do confer Grace where Men are disposed.</hi> So that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> did rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the force of the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Absolution,</hi> which it gave to the <hi>Priest</hi> in the Sacrament of <hi>Penance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what <hi>Catholick Tradition</hi> could there be for the Doctrin of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> in thismatter, when <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi>

Lombard, Alex. Alens.</hi> and <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture;</hi> and saith, <hi>that Opinion is probable, because the Priests Power of binding and loosing is equal; and as they cannot bind where God doth not, for they cannot retain the sins of a true Penitent; so neither can they loose where God doth not, i. e.</hi> where there is not <hi>true Contrition.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saith <hi>others held the contrary Opinion, and had probability on their side too, therefore he would determine nothing.</hi> Notwithstanding this, in a few years after, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> finds no difficulty, no Probability in the other Opinion; but determines as boldly, as if there had been an <hi>Universal Tradition</hi> their way; whereas the contrary cannot be denied by any that are conversant in the Doctrin of their <hi>Schools.</hi> But it was the mighty Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> to make the Doctrins of

                     <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> when they agreed, to be <hi>Articles of Faith;</hi> and to denounce <hi>Anathema's</hi> against Opposers, although they reached to some of the greatest Divines of their own Church, within <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s compass of 500 <hi>Years.</hi>

                  <p>We cannot pass over so great a Man as <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who wrote on that place of St. <hi>James,</hi> not long before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and a good while after the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> which relies on this place for this <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Unction.</hi> But <hi>Cajetan</hi> saith, <hi>it doth not relate to it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the immediate effect is the cure of the Party in Saint</hi> James; <hi>but in this Sacrament the direct and proper effect is Remission of Sins.</hi> All that <hi>Catharinus</hi> hath to say <note place="margin">Cath. <hi>

                  <p>The <hi>School Divines,</hi> from <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received this for a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> but the <hi>Canonists</hi> denied it, as appears by the <hi>Gloss</hi> on <hi>c.

before. For, I suppose matter of <hi>Heresie</hi> must reach to the <hi>Canonists,</hi> as well as the <hi>Divines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the plainest determination of this matter will be by the ancient <hi>Offices</hi> of the Church; for if they respected <hi>bodily Cures</hi> in the first place, then it is owned there could be no <hi>Tradition</hi> for any <hi>Sacrament</hi> in this <hi>Unction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ancient <hi>Ordo Romanus</hi> it is called <hi>Benedictio Olei ad omnem Languorem quocunque tempore.</hi> I desire to know whether the <hi>Oil</hi> so consecrated be chiefly designed for the <hi>Body</hi> or the <hi>Soul.</hi> And in the <hi>Office</hi> it self, this place of St. <hi>James</hi> is mentioned: And then follows, <hi>Te Domine peritissimum Medicum imploramus, ut virtutis tuae Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinam in hoc Oleum propitius infundas.</hi> And a little after; <hi>Prosit Pater Misericordiarum, febribus &amp; dysenteria la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borantibus, prosit paralyticis, caecis &amp; claudis simulque vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atitiis,</hi> with abundance more; which manifestly shews that this consecrated <hi>Oil</hi> was intended primarily for the <hi>cure of Diseases.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Ambrosian Form,</hi> the Prayer is, <hi>Infunde sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationem tuam huic Oleo, ut ab his quae unxerit membra, fugatis insidiis adversariae potestatis, susceptione praesentis Olei, Sancti Spiritus Gratia salutaris debilitatem expellat &amp; plenam conferat sospitatem,</hi> Where the effect relates to the soundness of the Members anointed, and not to the Sins committed by them.</p>

                  <p>But <hi>Durandus</hi> urges one thing more, which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> takes no notice of, viz. <hi>that this Opinion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists was very well known at that time, and was never condemned as contrary to any determination of the Church.</hi> Now, if there had been any constant <hi>Tradition</hi> even of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> against it, it is impossible these <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> should have avoided Censure; their Opinion being so much taken notice of by the Schoolmen afterwards. <hi>Jacobus Almain</hi> saith, <hi>it was a Controversie between the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists</hi>

                  <p>But before I come to that, it is fit to take notice of what <hi>Bellarmin</hi> lays great weight upon, both as to the Number of the Sacraments in general, and this in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; <note place="margin">Bell. <hi>de Sacr. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 25.</note> which is, <hi>the consent of both the</hi> Greek <hi>and</hi> Latin <hi>Church for at least</hi> 500 <hi>Years.</hi> But I have shewed there <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>To this I Answer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>The Sense of other Eastern Churches about the Seven Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>But to shew how late this Tradition of Seven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments came into the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> and how far it is from being an <hi>Universal Tradition,</hi> I shall now make it appear that this Number of Sacraments was never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the other Christian Churches, although some of them were originally descended from the Ancient <hi>Greek Church.</hi>

                  <p>But this <hi>genus est Sacramenti</hi> signifies very little to those who know how largely the Word <hi>Sacrament</hi> was used in elder times, from <hi>Iertullian</hi> downwards.

It appears from hence, that there was then a Custome among some in regard to S. <hi>James</hi> his Words, if Persons were sick, to take some of the <hi>Chrism</hi> to anoint them, and to pray over them in hopes of their Recovery; but this was no <hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>dying Persons,</hi> as it is now in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <p>If it had been then so esteemed, S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> (or who-ever was the Author of the Book of <hi>Sacraments)</hi> would not have omitted it, and the other supernumeraries, when he purposely treats of <hi>Sacraments;</hi> the same holds as to S. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> And it is a poor evasion to say, <hi>that they spake only to Catechumens;</hi> for they were to be instructed in the Means and Instruments of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they make all <hi>Sacraments</hi> to be.</p>

               <p>The Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> under <hi>Innocent</hi> III.

                  <note place="margin">Lom. <hi>sent. l.</hi> 4. <hi>dist.</hi> 17.</note> and for what reason? <hi>because the Doctors of the Church seemed to deliver not only divers but contrary things, i. e.</hi> they had no certain and constant <hi>Tradition</hi> about them. And when he comes to the point of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to God only,</hi> he quotes for it, besides <hi>Scripture,</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and S. <hi>Chrysostem,</hi> and <hi>Prosper,</hi> and against it S. <hi>Augustine</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> and concludes himself for the latter; but saith not a word more to shew that the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Tradition</hi> of the Church had been for this opinion.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Hieron. <hi>in</hi> Matth. <hi>c.</hi> 16.</note> who saith, that <hi>Men are apt to assume too much to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under pretence of this Power of the Keys, whereas God regards not the Sentence of the Priests but the Life of the Penitents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Natalis Alexander</hi> thinks <hi>there is no binding Power with respect to Baptism;</hi> Was there not as to <hi>Simon Magus?</hi> And as long as every year the Church judged of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency</hi> of Persons for it? When Christ spake these words the Church was wholly to be formed, and it was a great Power lodged with the <hi>Apostles</hi> and their <hi>Successors</hi> to admit into the Church, or to exclude from it, not as private Persons, but by Authority from Christ himself. <hi>But then this Power is vain and idle in a constituted Church.</hi> By no means; they have still a <hi>Power</hi> of casting out and taking in again; and of imposing such Acts on Offenders, as may give satisfaction to the Church, whose
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95209:81"/>
Honour suffers, and whose Discipline is broken. But the question is, Whether by Christ's appointment under the Gospel no known mortal sin can be pardon'd to <hi>baptized Persons</hi> without <hi>Confession</hi> of it to a Priest? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these words of our Saviour do imply it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scotus</hi> is by no means satisfied with mens Reasoning out of this place, <hi>that because Christ hath given such a Power,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Scot. <hi>in l.</hi> 4. <hi>Dist.</hi> 17. <hi>q. unica.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>therefore it is mens duty to confess their sins;</hi> For, saith he, <hi>this only implies the usefulness and efficacy of this Power if it be made use of;</hi> as in <hi>Confirmation, none think themselves damned if they do not use it though it be very useful;</hi> and therefore he goes another way to work, <hi>viz. by joyning this precept and that of loving God and our selves together with it.</hi> But how doth this prove that a man ought to take this particular way? Truly, <hi>Scotus</hi> here shews his Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ilty. <hi>Suppose there be another way that is harder, and this be found more easie, he thinks a man is bound to take the shortest and easiest way,</hi> viz. <hi>by Confession and Absolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for all this his heart did misgive him, and he could not but see, that this proved nothing, unless this way of <hi>Confession</hi> were first proved to be a secure way. And therefore he puts the Case, <hi>that if it be not proved by these Words, it may be by</hi> S. James, <hi>Confess your faults one to ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

No,</hi> saith he, <hi>this will not do;</hi> for which he gives this Reason, <hi>that it holds no more for confession to a Priest than to any other;</hi> therefore, after all, he is willing to resolve it into some <hi>unwritten Tradition,</hi> since there was no convincing evidence for it either in this or any other place of <hi>Scripture.</hi> Which shew'd they ran to Tradition, when they had nothing else to say.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Reason</hi> of them was different. For, as <hi>Rigal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>

                  </note> observes, <hi>the penitential Rigour was taken up after great Numbers were admitted into the Church;</hi> and a great dishonour was brought upon Christianity by the looseness or inconstancy of those who professed it. There were such in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time in the Churches of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and elsewhere; but although he gives Rules about such, yet he mentions no other than <hi>avoiding</hi> or <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the guilty Persons,</hi> and upon due Sorrow and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance receiving them in again; but he imposes no necessity of <hi>Publick</hi> or <hi>Private Confession</hi> in order to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;</hi> much less of every kind of mortal sin, though it be but the breach of the tenth Commandment, as the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> doth; yet this had been necessary in case he had thought, as that declares, <hi>that God will not forgive upon other terms.</hi> And so much the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Evangelists</hi> had said nothing of it; and now Churches began to fill, it was absolutely necessary for him to have declared it, if it were a necessary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pardon for sins after Baptism. But although the <hi>Apostles</hi> had given no Rules about it, yet the <hi>Christian Churches</hi> suffering so extremely by the Reproaches cast upon them, they resolved, as far as it was possible, to take care to prevent any <hi>scandalous Offences</hi> among them. To this end, the actions of all Persons who professed themselves Christians were narrowly watched; and their faults, especially such as were <hi>scandalous,</hi> complained of; and then if they confessed them, or they were convicted of them, a severe and rigorous Discipline was to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone by them before they were restored to Communion;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95209:83"/>
that their Enemies might see how far the Christians were from incouraging such <hi>enormities</hi> as they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of. They were charged with <hi>Thyestean Suppers</hi> and <hi>promiscuous mixtures;</hi> whereas, any Persons among them who were guilty of <hi>Homicide</hi> or <hi>Adultery</hi> were dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their society, and for a great while not admitted upon any terms; and afterwards, upon very rigorous and severe terms. And besides these, to preserve the purity of their Religion in times of Persecution, they allowed no <hi>Compliance</hi> with the <hi>Gentile Idolatry;</hi> and any tendency to this, was looked upon as a degree of Apostasie, and censured accordingly. And about these three sorts of sins the severity of the Primitive Discipline was chiefly exercised; which shews, that it proceeded upon quite different grounds from those of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> about <hi>Auricular Confession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>method</hi> of <hi>proceeding</hi> was very different; for here was no <hi>toties quoties</hi> allow'd; that men may sin, and confess, and be absolved; and then sin the same sin again, and confess again, and receive Absolution in the same manner. The <hi>Primitive Church</hi> knew nothing of this way of dealing with Sinners upon <hi>Confession.</hi> If they were admitted <hi>once</hi> to it that was all.

How then can they pretend any <hi>similitude</hi> between their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> and the ancient <hi>Exomologesis?</hi> Besides, none ever received <hi>Absolution</hi> from the ancient Church till full <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> performed.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95209:84"/>
have complained of this, as a great abuse; yet they have been sharply answer'd, <hi>that it is to call in question the Conduct of the Church for five hundred years; and they may as well question many other things, which depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Authority of the Present Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Obligation</hi> to Confession is very different from what it was in the ancient <hi>Exomologesis.</hi> Now by the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> a person looks on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as bound in Conscience to confess <hi>every Mortal sin;</hi> but in the <hi>Ancient Church</hi> none can imagine that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were bound to undergo the <hi>Exomologesis</hi> for every mortal sin, there being no <hi>Penitential Canons</hi> which did ever require it; but they had respect to some particular sins, and the <hi>Penance</hi> was proportion'd to them.</p>
               <p>We ought to take notice of two things with respect to the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> which will shew the different notion it had of these things from what is now current in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That it did not exclude those from all hopes of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> whom it excluded from <hi>Penance;</hi> as may be seen in the <hi>Illiberitan Council,</hi> where many are wholly shut out from the <hi>Church,</hi> whom we cannot think they <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:95209:84"/>
2. That the <hi>Penitential Canons</hi> never extended in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> to all those sins which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> now accounts <hi>Mortal,</hi> and therefore necessary to be confessed. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> saith expresly, they must confess <hi>omnia &amp; singula peccata mortalia—etiam occulta—</hi>and an <hi>Anathema</hi> is denounced against him <note place="margin">
                     <hi>De Poenit. can.</hi> 7.</note> that denies it to be necessary to Remission of them. Now if we consider their notion of <hi>mortal sins,</hi> we shall easily discern the vast difference between the Obligation to Confession by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and by the old <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Canons.</hi> For <hi>mortal</hi> sins are not only all Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Acts committed against the known Laws of God, but against the Laws of the Church; and even ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial sins may become mortal by the Disposition of the Person, and by other circumstances, which the Casuists set down at large; now the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly oblige men, not only to relate the Acts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but <hi>all Circumstances which change the kind of Sin.</hi> And this is a racking the Consciences of Men far beyond whatever we find in the old <hi>Penitential Canons;</hi> for, <hi>Petavius</hi> confesses <hi>that many sins now accounted mortal,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Petav. <hi>not. ad</hi> Epiph. <hi>p.</hi> 238.</note> 
                  <hi>had no Penance appointed for them by the old Canons;</hi> and therefore I need not take any pains to prove it: If any one hath a mind to be satisfied, he may see it in <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nyssen's Canonical Epistle,</hi> where he owns that seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of those sins, for which the <hi>Scripture</hi> excludes from <note place="margin">Greg.

               </p>
               <p>The most plausible place in Antiquity brought for all <hi>mortal sin,</hi> is that of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> where he saith, <hi>that some</hi>

                  <hi>to actual sin.</hi> It is true, that he doth speak of some such; but was it for <hi>sins</hi> of <hi>thought</hi> against the <hi>tenth Command?</hi> No; but it is very plain, that he speaks of that sin which was thought to imply a renouncing Christianity, and S <hi>Cyprian</hi> elsewhere calls <hi>summum delictum,</hi> and <hi>the Sin ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> had much ado to perswade those who were actually guilty to submit to due Penance for it; but they obtained <hi>Tickets</hi> from the <hi>Confessors,</hi> and were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to communion without undergoing the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church, the consequence whereof would be, that the Discipline would be lost, and the Church over-run with Apostates; this makes S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> plead hard against such practices, and among other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he uses this of the great tenderness of some, who because they had entertained such thoughts of doing as others did, for their own safety, they offered to unbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their Consciences before them, and desired remedy for small Wounds; how much more ought they to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess their faults whose wounds are greater? This is the whole force of his reasoning; where the Thought and Act relate to the same sin; and that said to be no less than <hi>denying Christ, and sinning against the Holy Ghost.</hi> But there is no parity in the case of other sins; which even S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls <hi>minora delicta,</hi> being against men <note place="margin">Cypr. <hi>Ep.</hi> 12.</note> immediately; and there is no intimation in him that ever the thoughts of those sins were discovered, or that Persons were under any obligation by the Rules of the Church to do it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Private Offenders</hi> were sometimes advised in those first Ages for the ease of their <hi>Consciences</hi> to make <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:95209:85"/>
of their sins; of which we see an instance as to the Practice in one Case in S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time. And <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> compares such Persons who avoid it, to those who have such secret Ulcers that they chuse <hi>rather to perish than to discover them.</hi> Now in Cases of this nature he advises to <hi>Confession and publick penitential Acts,</hi> that so they may in the Judgment of the Church have the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Wounds of their Consciences healed. And this is that which <hi>Origen</hi> doth advise to in such Cases, <hi>to seek out a wise spiritual Physician, and to make known his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Orig. <hi>in</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. <hi>Hom.</hi> 2. <hi>in</hi> Psal. 37. <hi>Hom.</hi> 2. <hi>in</hi> Luc. <hi>Hom.</hi> 17.</note> 
                  <hi>distemper to him, and to follow his advice and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as to the Method of Cure.</hi> Now this we never oppose; but the only Question is, whether it be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for all Persons, and for every Mortal Sin, to make <hi>Confession</hi> of it to the <hi>Priest,</hi> that it may be forgiven; and <hi>Origen</hi> never once supposes this; for he mentions several other ways for the <hi>Remission of Sins</hi> after <hi>Baptism,</hi> by <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> by <hi>Alms,</hi> by <hi>forgiving and converting others,</hi> by <hi>great Love to God,</hi> and in the last place he brings in this <hi>of a Laborious Penance and Confession.</hi> Either the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ways are sufficient without this, or not; if they are, then this is not necessary to the Remission of all mortal Sins; if not, to what purpose doth he mention so many ways, when this one is sufficient without them and all those are insufficient without this? For <hi>Boileau</hi> confesses, <hi>that no mortal sins according to them can be remitted,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hist. Confess. Auric. c.</hi> 5. <hi>n.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>where there is not at least the desire of this.</hi> But <hi>Origen</hi> shews the different ways of obtaining Remission, or else he doth not answer the difficulty; which was <hi>that the Jews had several sorts of Sacrifices for the Expiation of Sins, to which we have none answerable under the Gospel, Yes,</hi> saith <hi>Origen, Baptism answers to one sort, Martyrdom to another, Alms to a third,</hi> &amp;c. and last of all, <hi>Penance</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:95209:86"/>
                  <hi>to the Offering baked in the Frying Pan.</hi> From whence it is plain, that he looked on this as one particular way proper to some Cases, and not as a general Method for the Remission of all mortal Sins. But he urges <hi>that</hi> Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen <hi>quctes Scripture for the Confession of Sins, as necessary,</hi> Hom. 2. <hi>in</hi> Psal. 37. But what <hi>Scripture?</hi> Even the Words of the <hi>Psalmist, I will confess my Iniquity.</hi> And was <hi>Confession</hi> to a Priest necessary under the Law? How then can those words prove it necessary under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel? Although therefore <hi>Origen</hi> might think it very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient in some cases for <hi>Penitents</hi> to unload their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by Confession to a <hi>Spiritual Physician,</hi> yet we find no proof of any necessity of it, as to all mortal Sins. It is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that publick Faults, either confessed or proved, had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Penance</hi> appointed for them by the <hi>Penitential Canons;</hi> but <hi>Boileau,</hi> after <hi>Arnauld,</hi> pleads, <hi>that even secret Sins being mortal, were not thought remissible by the Keys of the Church, without publick Penance.</hi> But this can never be proved to have been the Doctrine of the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> and it is unreasonable to suppose; for then, all Persons must have undergone publick Penance who had any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin, and it must have been frequently born by the same Persons, both which are inconsistent with the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Discipline.</hi> But they saw there was no other way to maintain the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>Confession,</hi> but by this. For they could find none but <hi>publick Penance,</hi> and that by the <hi>Penitential Canons</hi> was prescribed only for some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular scandalous Sins; and therefore they fansied, that Persons who committed other faults, were bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess them privately, and to undergo publick Penance for them. I do not deny, but some <hi>great Penitents,</hi> for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Faults, would of their own accord submit to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Discipline; but this was a voluntary Act in them,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95209:86"/>
that by this means they might assure themselves the More of the sincerity of their own Repentance; and it being looked on as an Act of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Piety,</hi> it made it go down the better with <hi>Voluntary Penitents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For the sake of such <hi>Voluntary Penitents</hi> in great Churches, whose Cases required <hi>particular and private Examination and Direction,</hi> there was a <hi>Penitentiary</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, whose <hi>Office</hi> it was to receive their <hi>Confessions,</hi> and to direct and order the Method of their <hi>Penance.</hi> Of this we have a famous Instance in the Church of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> in the time of <hi>Nectarius,</hi> about which so much pains hath been taken for different purposes. That which seems most probable to me, is, that the <hi>Penitentiary</hi> was appointed to examine and judge of such <hi>Penitential Causes</hi> which were brought before him, (not being notorious,) and to give sentence according to the Canons; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>Voluntary Confessions</hi> of Persons, whose Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were oppressed with the Guilt of Secret Sins; and to those he was to appoint <hi>Penance</hi> without revealing their Faults. Where the Facts were <hi>notorious</hi> and <hi>scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous,</hi> I suppose the ancient <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> (part whereof is to be seen in the <hi>Canonical Epistles)</hi> to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pandect. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. Vol.</hi> 2.</note> have still continued at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as well as in other Churches. But there were many private miscarriages, wherein great Prudence and Judgment was required, both to determine the <hi>Penance,</hi> and to manage it so, that it did not break out into an open Scandal. And for Cases of this Nature the <hi>Penitentiary</hi> was appointed; to whom all Persons might resort in private cases, and open their Consciences to him, and take his Directions how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their <hi>Penitential Acts.</hi> So it was with that Person of Quality at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who gave occasion to the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95209:87"/>
abolishing the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Penitentiary,</hi> both there, and in all the <hi>Eastern Churches.</hi> She first went to the <hi>Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary,</hi> as a <hi>voluntary Penitent,</hi> and confessed her Faults to him, and took his directions; and while she was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming her Penance in the Church, the Fact was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with the Deacon, which she afterwards confessed to the <hi>Penitentiary.</hi> Who being enraged at the Deacon, in probability through his desire to have him punished, the Fact came to be discovered, and the People to be highly offended: And it is not reasonable to suppose that the <hi>Penitentiary</hi> put her upon a <hi>publick Confession</hi> of her secret fault; but that it came out by his means; and therefore <hi>Nectarius</hi> thought fit no longer to put such a Trust into any Man's hand, which through his discovery might redound to the Dishonour of the Church, as that did.</p>
               <p>What the effect was of abolishing this Office, is the great Question, whether the taking away <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Confession.</hi> If the Historians may be believed, it was the <hi>Necessity of making any Confession at all in secret;</hi> for the Right of receiving such Confessions, was devolved upon the <hi>Penitentiary;</hi> therefore when his Office was put down, where the Case was not notorious, every one <hi>must be left to his own Conscience;</hi> and that both <hi>Socrates</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  </note> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> affirm was the consequence of it. If only <hi>publick Confession</hi> was taken away, as some imagine, a <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Confession</hi> was still continued, how was it possible for the <hi>Historians</hi> to mistake the matter so grosly, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that the consequence of it? For, <hi>is every Man left to his own Conscience,</hi> where he is bound to go to <hi>Confession</hi> before he partakes of the <hi>Eucharist?</hi> And why should publick <hi>Penance</hi> be taken away on this occasion, where there seems to have been none; for that Person under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95209:87"/>
to <hi>publick Penance</hi> upon her former <hi>Confession,</hi> for then her <hi>Penance</hi> would not have been <hi>done in the Church,</hi> but out of it, among the <hi>Penitents.</hi> But as the former was voluntary, so was the latter too; for here was no Accuser but her self; and for what Reason should publick and solemn Penance for notorious Cri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Therefore I think it most probable, that the case of <hi>notorious and scandalous Offenders</hi> stood as it did, and so continued in <hi>S.

And so this Act of <hi>Nectarius</hi> in taking away the <hi>Penitentiary's</hi> Office, and the <hi>Approbation</hi> of it by other Churches following the Example, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proves, that they did not look on <hi>Confession</hi> of <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

As the <hi>publick Discipline</hi> declined, Persons were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to make <hi>private Confession</hi> of their sins; if they could not be brought to <hi>publick Penance.</hi> Thence in the <hi>Greek Church</hi> came the <hi>Penitentials</hi> of <hi>Johannes Jejuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> (who first took upon himself the Title of <hi>Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Patriarch</hi> in the time of <hi>Mauritius</hi> to the great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Bishops of <hi>Rome)</hi> and of some others after him.</p>

                  <hi>Greek Church</hi> about this matter; he thinks it began with the business of the <hi>Penitentiary,</hi> but after the publick Discipline was disused, instead of that, he saith, <hi>came up a secret Confession and Penance;</hi> which was left to the <note place="margin">

So that we have a plain Confession from him, that there is no Rule in the <hi>Greek Church</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this <hi>secret Confession</hi> of Sins in order to the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95209:91"/>
of them. But it is observable concerning the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Greeks,</hi> that if Persons do make <hi>Confession</hi> among them, they think themselves obliged to keep to the old <hi>Penitential Canons,</hi> and blame <hi>Joh. Jejunator</hi> for rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from them; for <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Thessalonica</hi> saith, <hi>they had them from the Fathers, and the Fathers by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion down from the Apostles.</hi> But although they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mistaken, yet they shew how different their <hi>Tradition</hi> is from that of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which thinks it self under no such obligation, but allows <hi>Absolution</hi> to be granted upon <hi>Confession,</hi> and a right of Communion without <hi>Penance</hi> performed, for which there is no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, as to any <hi>ancient Tradition</hi> either of the <hi>Eastern</hi> or <hi>Western Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Western Church</hi> we find the <hi>publick Discipline</hi> fallen to decay in the beginning of the <hi>ninth Age,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Great summoning <hi>several Councils</hi> for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting things into as good an Order as they would then bear. In the second <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Cavaillon, A. D.</hi> 813. we find a Complaint, <hi>Can.</hi> 25. <hi>that the old Canonical Penance was generally disused; and neither the ancient Order of Excommunicating or Absolving was observed.</hi> Which is a plain and ingenuous acknowledgment that they had gone off from the <hi>ancient Tradition</hi> of the Church; and therefore they pray the Emperor's Assistance, <hi>that the publick Discipline might be restored for publick Offenders, and the ancient Canons be brought into use again.</hi> From whence it follows, that at that time <hi>notorious Offenders</hi> escaped with <hi>private Confession</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;</hi> and even that was done by halves, <hi>can.</hi> 32. and some thought it not necessary to do it at all, <hi>can.</hi> 33.

And the most it saith before, is, <hi>that Confession to a Priest is useful in the Church;</hi> which is not the the thing disputed by us, but the Necessity of it; and his Critical Observations of <hi>Utrumque</hi> signifie just nothing, unless he had proved that the Council had before said that both were necessary, which it doth not.

                  <hi>of the Sufficiency of Confession to God alone did continue in the Church to the time of the Council of</hi> Lateran, <hi>and that it gave Occasion to the Canon, which enforced the Necessity of Confession to a Priest;</hi> but he adds, <hi>that learned and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men may have false Opinions before the Judgment of the Church.</hi> So that at last we find <hi>Universal Tradition</hi> is given up, and the Necessity of <hi>Auricular Confession</hi> is resolved into the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Churches Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, or rather, the <hi>Pope's Declaration</hi> of it, either with or without the Consent of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council. But he saith, <hi>The Fathers did not speak so exactly of the Trinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Council of</hi> Nice; <hi>nor the Greek Fathers of Grace and Predestination before S.</hi> Augustin. If this be true, it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to prove either of those great Points merely by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95209:92"/>
for those Fathers either delivered the sense of the Church, or they did not; if they delivered the sense of the Church, then either the sense of the Church was doubtful, or they did not understand it; if the sense of the Church were doubtful, then it is plain those Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines could not be proved by Tradition; if the sense of the Church were not doubtful, but the Fathers did not understand it, then how is it possible that the <hi>Churches Tradition</hi> should be an <hi>Infallible Guide,</hi> when even the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Church were mistaken about it? But I have sufficiently proved, that not only before, but even after the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> there was no <hi>Universal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for the Necessity of Auricular Confession.</hi>

            <head>AN APPENDIX, <hi>In Answer to some late Passages of</hi> J. W. <hi>of the</hi> Society of Jesus, <hi>concerning the</hi> Prohibition <hi>of</hi> Scripture in Vulgar Languages <hi>by the Council of</hi> Trent.</head>
            <p>SInce the Publication of the foregoing Book, I have met with a Reflexion upon it made by <hi>J. W.</hi> in the Preface to a <hi>Treatise</hi> lately <hi>Reprinted</hi> by him. Wherein, <hi>he observes that a great part of the Objections made against them are either grounded on mistakes, or touch points of Discipline not of Faith, which alone they are bound to defend.</hi> This last Clause I could not but wonder at, since the new Title of his Book is, <hi>A Defence of the Doctrine and Holy Rites of the Roman Catholick Church,</hi> &amp;c. Why should <hi>I W.</hi> take such needless pains to <hi>defend the Rites of the Church,</hi> if they are bound to defend nothing but Points of Faith? I had thought the Honour and Authority of the Church had been concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in its Commands and Prohibitions, as well as in its
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:95209:94"/>
Definitions and Decrees. And although it be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that the Church is Infallible in Matters of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; yet it is a strong Prejudice against any pretence to Infallibility in a Church, if it be found to err notoriously in any thing of general Concernment to the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how comes my late Book to be made an Example? <hi>As for instance,</hi> (saith he) <hi>I find in a Book newly Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, with this Title,</hi> The Council of Trent Examin'd and Disprov'd by Catholick Tradition, <hi>that for</hi> 15 <hi>Pages together Dr.</hi> St. <hi>labours to prove that there is no Catholick Tradition against Translating Scripture into Vulgar Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> Whereas I expresly say, that the <hi>Prohibition</hi> of reading the Scripture so translated without a particular License, was that which I undertook to shew could not be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by any Catholick Tradition; And that there was a General Consent of the Catholick Church, not merely for the Translations of Scripture into Vulgar Languages, but for the free use of them by the People. Which I made out by these Particulars,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That where-ever the Christian Religion prevailed, the Scripture was Translated into the Vulgar Language for the Peoples benefit. Which I proved from the Ancient <hi>Italick</hi> Versions before St. <hi>Jerom's</hi> time, the <hi>Gothick, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian, Armenian, Syriack, Coptick</hi> and <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; without the least prohibition of the Common use of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That where a Language grew into Disuse among the People there the Scripture was Translated into the Tongue which was better understood. And for this I instanced in the <hi>Arabick Versions</hi> after the prevalency
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95209:94"/>
of the <hi>Saracens</hi> in the Eastern and Southern Parts, and after the <hi>Moors</hi> coming into <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That even after the Primitive Times, Christian Princes and Bishops did take Care that the People should read the Scriptures in their own Language. For Princes, I instanced in <hi>Ludovicus Pius</hi> and <hi>Alfred;</hi> for Bishops, in <hi>Waldo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Fressing, Methodius</hi> and <hi>Cyrill,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Pope himself in the 9th Century did approve of it; and for a Reason common to all times and Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>All People and Languages were to praise God, and that God himself had so commanded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. That <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. was the first Person who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the use of Scripture and Divine Offices in the Vulgar Tongue, and was not ashamed to own that the Church saw cause to alter several things from what they were in the Primitive Church.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That upon the setting up the Inquisition by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> III. this Prohibition took place in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Places.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That some noted Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have highly commended it; and said that the taking of it away would be pernicious and destructive to Faith and Devotion.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That the Prohibition in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is built on the Authority of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Index</hi> to be made, in which the fourth Rule for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids all Persons the use of the Scripture in the Vulgar
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95209:95"/>
Tongue without a particular License, and whosoever presumes to doe it is to be denied Absolution.</p>
            <p n="9">9. From hence it follows, that the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> is evidently disproved, as to <hi>Catholick Tradition,</hi> for any Foundation of such a <hi>Prohibition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what now saith <hi>J. W.</hi> against all this? <hi>He would gladly know against whom I dispute.</hi> Against <hi>J. S.</hi> and all such who would make the World believe the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> did proceed upon <hi>Catholick Tradition.</hi> To prove I am mistaken, he tells me <hi>in his 6th Chap. I may find an Account of several new Translations of Scripture into Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tongues, made by Catholicks and approved in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church.</hi> Then he mentions <hi>an English Translation made by the</hi> Rhemish <hi>and</hi> Doway <hi>Colleges; and in French by the Doctours of</hi> Lovain; <hi>and some others.</hi> What now follows from hence? Is it any <hi>Mistake</hi> in me to say, There was such a Prohibition of Reading the Scripture in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and inforced by the Rule made by Appointment of the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> This had been indeed to the purpose if it could have been proved. I do not deny, that there have been such <hi>Translations</hi> made, where it was found impossible to hinder all <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;</hi> and the use of them have been connived at or allow'd to some particular persons, whom they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise secure of. But such Translations are like the <hi>Galenists</hi> allowing some <hi>Chymical Medicines</hi> to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients; they declare against their use as dangerous; but if the Patient will have them, then pray take them of my Apothecary, who is a very honest man and prepares mischievous Medicines better than another. This is just the Case of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to <hi>Translations</hi> of <hi>Scripture;</hi> If we ask their Opinion in general, whether
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95209:95"/>
Translations be allowable or not, their Answer hath been formerly very free and open, by no means; for they are very dangerous and mischievous things. And here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those I have already mentioned, I could produce many more to the same purpose. But alas! these men lived before the Age of <hi>Mis-representing</hi> and <hi>Expounding.</hi> Now all is <hi>Mistake</hi> on our side, and <hi>Infallibility</hi> on theirs. We cannot for our hearts understand their Doctrines or Practices aright, although we take never so much pains and care to doe it. One would think by the present way of dealing with us, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were like <hi>the New Name on the White Stone, which no man knows</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 17.</note> 
               <hi>but he that hath it;</hi> and so it were impossible for any else to understand it, but such as are in it. I thought my self pretty secure from <hi>Mistaking,</hi> when I pitched on the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> for my <hi>Guide.</hi> But it seems, I am <hi>mistaken</hi> here too: How so? Did not the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> appoint the Congregation of the <hi>Index</hi> at first, <hi>Sess.</hi> 18? Did it not own that the Matters of it were prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its Dissolution? And if there were a <hi>Prohibition</hi> of the free use of the Scripture in Vulgar Languages by the Rules of the <hi>Index,</hi> is not the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> justly chargeable with that <hi>Prohibition?</hi> Especially when the Title in the <hi>Roman</hi> Edition is <hi>Regulae Indicis Sacrosanctoe Synodi Tridentinoe jussu editoe.</hi>

            <p>The same <hi>Ledesma</hi> goes farther, and vouches the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in this matter, from the Decree <hi>Sess.</hi> 23. c. 8. where it forbids all the Parts of the <hi>Mass</hi> to be in the Vulgar Tongue. Which could not be reasonable, if the Scripture were allowed to be translated. <hi>Alphonsus à Castro,</hi> thinks the case so alike, <hi>that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition</hi>

them to be made by the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> And the same Pope is so far from renewing <hi>the Power of granting Licenses to read the Scripture in the vulgar Languages,</hi> that he declares against them. For by the <hi>4th</hi> Rule of the <hi>Index, the Ordinary and Inquisitor by the Advice of the Parish Priest or Consessor might permit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to read the Bible in the vulgar Language, so the Translation were made by Catholick Authours;</hi> and it was apprehended by some, that the new Printing the <hi>Rule</hi> might be giving new Authority to Bishops and Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors to grant Licenses, therefore the Pope declares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it; and saith it <hi>was contrary to the Command and use of the Roman Church and Inquisition, which ought to be inviolably observed.</hi> In pursuance of this we find in the <hi>Roman Index</hi> of <hi>prohibited Books,</hi> these words, <hi>Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia vulgari quocunque idiomate conscripta;</hi> i. e. <hi>All Bibles in vulgar Languages are prohibited.</hi> Therefore I cannot understand how the giving License to Persons since the <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>Clemens</hi> VIII. is consistent with the Duty which Persons of that Communion owe to the <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>the Roman See,</hi> unless they can produce a <hi>Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Clemens</hi> VIII. and some latter Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>fourth Rule</hi> which take away the force of his. But instead of that, <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. who published the <hi>Index</hi> again, after <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. owns that the first <hi>Index</hi> was made by Authority of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Qui sacrosanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti Concilii Tridentini auctoritate prodierat.</note> and it is observable that in his Bull <hi>A. D.</hi> 1664. he not onely prefixes the <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Index,</hi> but the <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Instruction</hi> of <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. and confirms all by his Apostolical authority; and injoyns the punctual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Orders contained therein inviolably; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same pains which were expressed in the Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> IV. Therefore as far as I can understand, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95209:97"/>
of granting Licenses to reade the Translations of the Bible is taken away as far as the Pope's authority can doe it.</p>
            <p>To what purpose then are we told of some <hi>modern Translations,</hi> as long as the use of them is forbidden by the Pope's Authority? And no Ordinaries can have Authority to grant Licenses against the Popes solemn Declaration to the contrary; nor can any of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with good Conscience make use of them.</p>
            <p>But I am told <hi>there are Translations approved in the Roman Church.</hi> By whom have they been approved? By the Pope, or the <hi>Congregation</hi> of the <hi>Index?</hi> I do not sind any such Approbation given to any of them. But on the contrary even in <hi>France,</hi> such <hi>Translations</hi> have been vehemently opposed by the Bishops and Divines there, as being repugnant to the Sense of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church. And this is apparent by a Book publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by Order of the <hi>Gallican Clergy, A. D.</hi> 1661. Where-in it is said <hi>that it was the common and unanimous Sense and Practice of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox</hi> 
               <note place="margin">E quibus pateat fuisse semper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munem &amp; unanimem Orthodoxorum omnium sensum ac usum; divinos Libros ac Officia Ecclesiastica, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naculo Idiomate neutiquam redden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di; utpote Christianae Reipubl. dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosum, ac rudibus &amp; imperit is scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dali occasionem praebens.

               <hi>Persons, that neither the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures nor divine Offices ought to be put into Vulgar Languages, it being injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Christian Church, and giving Occasion of Offence to the weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned.</hi> How then can we imagine that such <hi>Translations</hi> should not onely be allowed but <hi>approved</hi> among them?</p>
            <p>And besides the entire Treatises there collected against them, of <hi>Card. Hosius, Lizetius, Spiritus Roterus, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desma, &amp;c.</hi> and the Fragments and Testimonies of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others; we have a particular account of the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> as to this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:95209:97"/>
In the <hi>Censure</hi> of <hi>Erasmus, Dec.</hi> 17. 1527. the <hi>Sorbon</hi> declared <hi>Vulgar Translations of Scripture to be dangerous and pernicious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The like Declaration had been made before <hi>A. D.</hi> 1525. <hi>and that all Translations of the Bible, or of the Parts thereof ought rather to be suppressed than tolerated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. D.</hi> 1607. The Faculty again declared, <hi>that it did not approve any Translations of Scripture into the Vulgar Language.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>J. W.</hi> instances p. 26. <hi>in some Translations that have been approved;</hi> as <hi>a French Translation by the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of Lovain.</hi> But in the <hi>French Collection</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, I find, <hi>that</hi> A. D. 1620. Dec. 1. <hi>a debate arose in the Faculty at</hi> Lovain <hi>about it; and the Faculty decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it by no means approved of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another is of <hi>Rene Benoit;</hi> which was so far from being <hi>approved,</hi> that it was first condemned by the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and then sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to be condemned by the Pope; which was effectually done; and <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> XIII. directed his Bull to the Faculty of Divinity in <hi>Paris, Nov.</hi> 3. <hi>A. D.</hi> 1575. <note place="margin">Biblia supradicta omnine prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus, &amp; ab Ecclesia Catholicae sub Anathemate rejicimus.</note> wherein he doth expresly <hi>forbid this Translation, and reject it with an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet this very <hi>Translation</hi> of <hi>Rene Benoit</hi> is one of those made by <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>approved in the Roman Church;</hi> which <hi>J. W.</hi> refers me to. One of us two must needs be under a great Mistake, but to whom it belongs I leave the Reader to determin.</p>
            <p>The sense of the <hi>Gallican Clergy</hi> in this matter doth fully appear by the Representation which they sent to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> VII. about the <hi>Translation</hi> of the <hi>Missal</hi> into <hi>French.</hi> Which was done by <hi>Voisin</hi> a <hi>Doctour</hi> of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:95209:98"/>
and was published at <hi>Paris</hi> by the Permission of <hi>Cardinal de Retz</hi> Archbishop there, and had the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of some Doctours of the <hi>Sorbon.</hi> The rest of the Bishops and Clergy highly resented this matter, and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled together to consult about it, <hi>Nov.</hi> 29. 1660. where they proposed two things to be considered. 1. The matter of Right, whether such a Translation were to be permitted or not. 2. The matter of Fact, whether this were a good Translation or not. The debate was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed to <hi>Dec.</hi> 3. and from thence to the 7th on which they came to a Resolution to suppress it. And a Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Letter was sent to all the Bishops to forbid the use of it under pain of Excommunication; and the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to interpose his Authority in it. <hi>Dec.</hi> 9. they agreed to send an account of the whole matter to the Pope in the name of the <hi>Gallican Clergy;</hi> wherein they declare their great dislike of it, <hi>as contrary to the Custom of the Church, and as pernicious to the Souls</hi>

               <hi>of Men.</hi> And in the Body of it, they say <hi>that they look on the Translations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into vulgar Languages as the great occasion of the Northern Heresies; and quote</hi> Vincentius Lerinensis, <hi>saying that the Scripture is the Book of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</hi> And after add, <hi>that they bad sent to the Pope their Condemnation of all Translations of Scripture and Divine Offices into the Vulgar Languages.</hi> This was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the <hi>General Assembly</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> Jan. 7. 1661.</p>
            <p>The Pope sent a <hi>Brief</hi> in Answer, which was received <hi>Feb.</hi> 25. wherein he very Tragically complains <hi>that some Sons of Perdition in</hi> France <hi>had to the ruine of Souls, and in Contempt of the Churches Laws and Practice, arrived to that degree of madness as to translate the Roman Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:95209:98"/>
               <hi>into French.</hi> And he charges the doing of it not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>Novelty,</hi> but <hi>Disobedience, Sedition, Schism,</hi> &amp;c. and declares <hi>that he abhorred and detested it; and for ever damned, reprobated and forbad it, under pain of Excommunication; and requires all Persons to deliver up their Books to the several Ordinaries that they might be burnt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I now desire <hi>J. W.</hi> to inform me whether we are bound to believe that in <hi>France Translations of Scripture into the vulgar Language are allowed and approved?</hi> I am really so unwilling to <hi>mistake,</hi> that I take the best care I can to be rightly informed. I have no design ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deceive others, or to be deceived my self; and therefore have not trusted to second-hand Evidence; but searched and considered the Authours themselves, whose Testimonies I rely upon. I am certain I have fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no wilfull mistake, but have truly and impartially stated things according to the clearest Evidence I could find; and therefore I think it some what hard to be told, <hi>that our Objections are grounded on Mistakes,</hi> and especially as to this matter <hi>about the Prohibition of reading Scripture in the Vulgar Language;</hi> for I hope I have made it appear not onely that there is such a <hi>Prohibition</hi> but that it is founded on the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if it be so, then it serves my main design, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove that it went off from <hi>Catholick Tradition,</hi> for if there were so many Translations of old without the least prohibition, and there be since the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> so severe a one, backed with the Pope's Authority, here must be a very great change in <hi>Tradition.</hi> For that is accounted <hi>pernicious and mischievous to the Souls of men,</hi> which before was accounted usefull and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to them. If the Physicians in one Age should
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95209:99"/>
condemn the common Reading of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Gale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> as destructive to the Health of mens bodies, which those of former Ages extremely commended, would not any one say, there was a great Change in the Opinions of Physicians, and that they did by no means hold to the Judgment of those before them? If the common Lawyers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hould now say <hi>Littleton's Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures</hi> is a Book very unfit to be read by young Lawyers, that it fills their heads with seditious and dangerous Principles, and therefore ought to be taken out of their hands; would not any one say, here is a wonderfull Change, for no such thing was ever apprehended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but the Book was thought very usefull and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to instruct Students in some fundamental Points of the Law?</p>
            <p>When <hi>Manna was rained from Heaven in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness for</hi> 40. <hi>years,</hi> and for 30. of them every man gathered his own share and proportion, and ate of it as he saw cause; would it not have been thought a strange alteration among them, if after 30. years a sett of Physicians should have risen up and told the People <q> it was true, <hi>Manna was Angels food,</hi> but if they had not great care in the taking it, and used it promiscuously, it would turn them to <hi>Devils;</hi> or at least it would fill them with such distempers, as they would never be able to reach to <hi>Canaan?</hi>
               </q> This might be pretended to be great Care and Tenderness of them, in these <hi>new Physicians;</hi> but on the other side, they would tell them, <q>they had done very well with their eating Manna for 30. years together; and there had been no such distempers among them, but such as humane nature is always subject to; that such an alteration might be of worse Consequence than their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95209:99"/>
common use of Manna; for so it was at first appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and so it had continued, and they could not tell but their new Physicians might be worse to them than their old distempers; and they could never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that could be so hurtfull which God himself had appointed for their food.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The former Discourse makes the Application need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</p>
            <p>But after all, it is said: <hi>This is but a point of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and not of Faith; and in such the Church may change her Measures.</hi> To that I answer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is more than a point of Discipline, for it is changing the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> with respect to the People. While the Scriptures were in the hands of the People, they resolved their Faith into the <hi>Word of God,</hi> as it was delivered to them and understood by them. But when that is taken out of their hands and they are bid to Trust to the <hi>Churches Testimony</hi> for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith; they have a different Resolution of their Faith and a different Ground and Reason of believing. For they cannot ground their Faith upon a written Rule who are uncapable of understanding it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is no matter of Discipline to overthrow the design of publishing the Scripture for the universal Benefit of the Church of God. And this the <hi>Janse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> have well proved in Defence of their Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the New Testament against the Prohibitions of it. <q>For, say they, the Prohibition of reading the Scripture under pain of Excommunication, is it self <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dialogue</hi> 1. p. 26. 29.</note> contrary to the Gospel and ought not to be obey'd. For Bread and nourishment is not more necessary
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95209:100"/>
to preserve the Life of the Body, than the Word of God is to uphold the Life of the Soul. That for men to speak of so much danger in reading the Scripture is to reflect very dishonourably on the Providence and Groodness of God; for it was by means of Trans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ations in Vulgar Languages that God's Word came to be kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to the World, and the Gospel was at first published in those Tongues, which were most generally understood. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those do manifestly oppose the design and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Providence for advancing the Gospel, who decry Translations of Scripture, as pernicious to the Souls of Men. And farther, that such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, <note place="margin">p. 63.</note> is a Contempt of our Lord Jesus Christ and a design to suppress the Gospel; and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the Will and Command of God; A Contempt of the Scripture, which was intended to be understood by all, A Contempt both of Councils and Fathers, which looked on the Scripture as the best Judge of Controversies, and who advised all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to a continual reading of the Word of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If after all this, the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> could so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously err not onely against <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> but <hi>Tradition</hi> too in such a Matter of Concernment to the Souls of Men, as this is, it will be hardly possible to persuade Men, it could not as well err in any Point of Faith. And it renders the whole proceeding suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to particular Points, when the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> is so industriously kept out of the hands of the People. For those who follow their Instructions, are never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to produce their Credentials.</p>
            <p>As to what <hi>J. W.</hi> saith in his Book concerning <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi>

that I have Reason to expect a Reply to what I had there said in my own Vindication, before I can think it fit to trouble the World with needless Repetitions. And it were hard for me to be put to Answer again to the same things, when a Person will not take the pains to see whether he were not Answer'd already.</p>
