         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS to what you ask, concerning Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>'s
<hi>Modest Examination of the</hi> Oxford
<hi>Decree</hi> (as he calls it:) I have seen it; and find
He is very Angry, and under great Mistakes.</p>
            <p>He is set forth in the Frontispice, with
his Titles at large, <hi>WILLIAM SHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOCK,
D. D. Dean of St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s, Master of
the Temple, and Chaplain in Ordinary to His
Majesty:</hi> And thinks much, that what he
says (though without naming him) should be
Censured, <hi>considering his Profession, Character,
and Station in the Church,</hi> p. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41203:3"/>
The Title he gives it, (and at which he
quarels) <hi>Decretum Oxoniense,</hi> or the <hi>Oxford
Decree,</hi> is (for ought I know) a Title of his
own. Sure, 'tis none of theirs who made it:
who are therefore therein not concerned,
whether it be, or be not, <hi>Decretum Oxoniense.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was he Named in it; but onely a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
censured, which was Preached at <hi>Oxford</hi>
by another Person. If Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> be of the
same mind with that other Person; that is
not our fault.</p>
            <p>'Twas <hi>Printed</hi> (he says) <hi>in Latin in these
words,</hi> &amp;c. True; but not with that spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
For instance, <hi>Prefectorum</hi> was not
printed (once and again) with a single <hi>e,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>Praefectorum</hi> with an <hi>ae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it was hoped, so great a <hi>Critick</hi> as he
would be thought (pag. 5.) might have been
able to spell true, when he had a printed
Copy before him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He then fansies (or would be thought to
think) that some</hi> Malicious Animadverter
(<hi>p.</hi> 1. 5.) had Translated this Latin into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
for the Benefit and Edification of his Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Readers.</p>
            <p>But that is one of his great Mistakes.
'Twas printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> both in <hi>Latin</hi> and
<hi>English,</hi> the same Day; and by the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41203:3"/>
(and 'tis believ'd, Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> knows
it was;) And the <hi>English</hi> (as there printed) is
as much an Original as the <hi>Latin;</hi> (how it is
Re-printed at <hi>London,</hi> I know not.)</p>
            <p>And, I doubt, the Animadverter (if he had
done it) would rather have said, It was for the
<hi>Benefit and Edification of Dr.</hi> Sherlock, <hi>for
fear he should not have understood Latin.</hi> For
it is at this rate, they use to talk to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>If the Hawkers at <hi>London,</hi> have caused it
to be <hi>Re-printed,</hi> with a new <hi>Title,</hi> and <hi>Notes</hi>
upon it, (to make it fell the better,) and put it
into the <hi>Weekly Advertisements,</hi> for that
purpose; who can help it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the</hi> Critick <hi>finds fault with the</hi> Latin,
<hi>as</hi> transgressing the plain Rules of Grammar,
in using Eorum fidei &amp; curae commissis,
<hi>for</hi> suae.</p>
            <p>Of that, let the Criticks judge. If com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to <hi>their</hi> care, had been meant of <hi>them
Iointly,</hi> I think the word <hi>suae</hi> might have
been used; but when to be understood of <hi>them
Respectively,</hi> I think <hi>eorum</hi> doth better.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suae curae commissi,</hi> is, in plain English, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their own care:</hi> But it is here to
be understood, of the care of <hi>others;</hi> and,
who those others were, <hi>eorum</hi> was to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41203:4"/>
And I would fain know, by what <hi>plain
Rule of Dr.</hi> Sherlock<hi>'s Grammar</hi> (if he have a
<hi>Grammar) Eorum</hi> may not be so used.</p>
            <p>But I would not advise Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
too much at Criticism. I doubt his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
doth not lie that way. In what cases we
<hi>must</hi> use <hi>suae,</hi> and in what <hi>eorum,</hi> and in
what we <hi>may</hi> indifferently use <hi>either;</hi> better
Criticks, than Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> and I, will not
take upon them to determine.</p>
            <p>The pretended <hi>false English</hi> in that <hi>Remark</hi>
(whose ever it be) <hi>It may be Noted, that the
Propositions above-mentioned are Dr.</hi> Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock<hi>'s
in his Discourse of the Trinity; and the
Defender's of it</hi> (of that Discourse;) <hi>and wrote
against by the Animadverter;</hi> I am yet to seek.
I think it is true <hi>English.</hi> When Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>
tells us, where the bad <hi>English</hi> lies, let the
Noter Answer it. The Vice-Chancellor and
Heads of Houses are not therein concerned.
Mean while, I think his two Criticisms, to
be two Mistakes.</p>
            <p>He tells us, <hi>The Decree of the</hi> Oxford <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
is indeed</hi> Decretum Oxoniense, <hi>or a
Decree of the University of</hi> Oxford, (Be it so;)
but, not that of <hi>the Heads of Colleges and
Halls.</hi> Very true; Nor do they say it is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41203:4"/>
But, if that would do him a Kindness, a
Vote of Convocation might have been had
as easily. For, as I do not hear, that any one
dissented, in the Meeting of Heads; so I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there would have been as few in Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
if it had been proposed there.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps would rather have had it
passed, not there only, but <hi>in Convocation
also;</hi> but, if so, it was to pass there first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it came to Convocation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he says, p. 6. The</hi> Statutes refer such
Censures, not to the Meeting of Heads, <hi>but to</hi>
the Vice-Chancellor, and six Heads, Doctors of
Divinity, and to one or both of the Professors
of Divinity.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Heads</hi> in this last Clause, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
of his Mistakes. For it is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site,
that <hi>the six Doctors of Divinity</hi> should
all be <hi>Heads of Houses;</hi> the Vice-Chancellor
may as well advise with other Doctors.</p>
            <p>But be it so; there were at least <hi>six Heads
of Houses, Doctors of Divinity, and one or both
of the two Professors of Divinity.</hi> But is it
there said, He may not advise with <hi>more</hi> than
<hi>six?</hi> If instead of calling <hi>six</hi> Heads, he call
them All, is there any hurt in this? Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when they are all Unanimous?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:41203:5"/>
But, he says, <hi>p.</hi> 3. they were not all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
(Very good! Before we had too many,
now we have too few.) But all were warned;
and if some chanced to be out of Town, it
is but what would have been in a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some of the Wisest Heads</hi> (he says) <hi>were
Absent, and some present Dissented.</hi> That
some were absent, is very like: But, that any
present did Dissent, I have not heard; or,
that any then absent did dislike the Sentence
when they heard it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, if the Meeting of</hi> the Heads of Houses
be so Venerable an Authority; he will <hi>(he
says)</hi> undertake, any day in the Year, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a Meeting of twice as many, as Wise and
Learned Men, to censure their Decree. <hi>(Very</hi>
modestly <hi>spoken!) No doubt but he and his
are</hi> Wise and Learned Men; <hi>at least, he
thinks so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what are those <hi>Wise and Learned Men</hi>
to do? <hi>To censure their Decree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very good! Perhaps they would (some of
them, not many,) advise to put <hi>suae</hi> instead of
<hi>eorum.</hi> But would those <hi>Wise and Learned
Men</hi> say (as he doth) <hi>That the three Persons
in the Trinity, are three distinct Infinite Minds
and Spirits, and three Individual Substances?</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41203:5"/>
I doubt, he would not find it so easy (<hi>every
day in the Year</hi>) to procure a Meeting of
<hi>Twice so many Wise and Learned Men,</hi> to say
<hi>This.</hi> I do not find, that his New Doctrine
doth make so many Proselites.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But,</hi> supposing their Authority, <hi>he asks,</hi>
How far their Authority extends?</p>
            <p>I say, if it extend so far as to censure our
own Members; 'tis enough for our turn at
present. Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> if he please, may keep
out of their reach.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the words of the Statute be large e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>And this referred (with Dr.</hi> Sherlock<hi>'s good
leave</hi>) Vice-Cancellarii judicio, assidentibus ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si

            <p>But, because Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> (tho' he pretend

know our Statutes;</hi> I shall admit this excuse
of <hi>Ignorance</hi> for his <hi>Mistakes;</hi> Provided, he
will forbear <hi>thus to talk of he knows not what.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, as to what the Vice-Chancellor is
thus to censure; it may be presum'd, that
he (with the Advice afore-said) is (in some
measure) to make some Judgement of it, in
order to such Censure.</p>
            <p>How far (out of the present case) they may
<hi>declare and decree Heresy,</hi> I shall not take
upon me to determine.</p>
            <p>A Judge, in his Ordinary Proceedings, tho'
I think he is not to declare <hi>New Treasons</hi>
(besides those enumerated in the <hi>Statute of
Treasons;</hi>) yet, when a Case is to be tried
before him, I suppose, he may declare, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he think the fact in question, to be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41203:6"/>
               <hi>Treason within that Statute.</hi> But, of this, let
those judge, whose business it is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Law.</p>
            <p>I confess also, that I do not take <hi>our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi>
to be the <hi>Law of the Land,</hi> (for the
whole Nation;) But they be <hi>our Rule</hi> (by
which we are to proceed as to our own Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:)
Ratified to us by the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> under his Archiepiscopal Seal;
and by the King's Majesty, under the great
Seal of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Statute of <hi>1. Eliz.</hi> is, I suppose, to be
understood of such <hi>Legal Conviction</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive
Sentence</hi> (in order to Burning) as upon
which (as the Law then stood) the Writ <hi>De
Haeretico comburendo,</hi> was of course to issue.
Which is not the present Case.</p>
            <p>That the Paper of Complaint was signed
<hi>but by Two;</hi> I believe is true. But <hi>One</hi> had
been enough. And the Vice-Chancellor was
satisfied, there needed no more. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did forbid the gathering of more Hands:
Because he meant to proceed Calmly, not Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuously.
(And, in so doing, I think he did
wisely.) And it had been dispatched sooner;
but that the Business of Entertaining the
KING, did retard it till that Solemnity was
over.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41203:7"/>
But a main business of these Angry Papers,
is, a Quarel between Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> and, his
<hi>Malicious Animadverter,</hi> Dr. <hi>South.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Vice-Chancellor and Heads of Houses
had said nothing of Dr. <hi>Sherlock;</hi> But had
onely censured an offensive Sermon, which
they could not approve of; but might be
supposed to do, if (when Preached to their
Faces) they shewed no dislike of it. But Dr.
<hi>Sherlock</hi> (whose Doctrine was the same) brings
himself into the Quarel by a side-wind.</p>
            <p>He first supposeth, That the Complaint was
commenced by Dr. <hi>South.</hi> Which is a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take;
for the Sermon was complain'd of, the
same day it was Preached, or that following,
before Dr. <hi>South</hi> knew any thing of it; being
at that time far enough from <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, That the Person who Preached it,
was never <hi>summoned</hi> or questioned for it, or
<hi>his Name mentioned at the Meeting.</hi> Which
is another mistake; for, upon the first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
the person was summoned, and did
appear, and did give his Answer in writing,
with his <hi>Name</hi> subscribed; owned the words;
and said, what he had to say, in excuse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
and this his Answer was communicated
to the Heads of Houses.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:41203:7"/>
Next, That their Censure was in <hi>Latin</hi>
only; whereas it was Originally in <hi>English</hi>
also.</p>
            <p>Then, That it was <hi>Translated</hi> by his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
Animadverter:</hi> when as there was no
such matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> He <hi>caused it to be</hi> Re-printed <hi>at</hi>
London; <hi>That, there,</hi> He <hi>gave it a</hi> notable Title;
<hi>That</hi> He <hi>made the</hi> notable Remarks <hi>in the Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script;
That,</hi> when He had Railed himself out
of Breath, he called for a <hi>Decretum Oxoniense</hi>
to help him; which was the wisest thing he
could do. <hi>That</hi> Dr. <hi>South</hi> sollicited the Cause
with such Zeal and Importunity, as could not
be resisted; <hi>That</hi> He triumphs in it; <hi>That</hi>
He Published it in one of the weekly Prints;
<hi>and much more to the same purpose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if you ask, How he knows all this?
His proof is, <hi>It may be supposed,</hi> or <hi>It is
easy to guess,</hi> p. 5.</p>
            <p>Now, much of this we know to be false.
And if we should add, <hi>It may be supposed,</hi>
that the rest is so too; would not this be as
good a Proof?</p>
            <p>Or, if it should be said, That Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>
being Baffled by Dr. <hi>South,</hi> and having <hi>Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
to no purpose, got a Young man to Preach
his Doctrine in the face of the University,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41203:8"/>
               <hi>(which happened, for his purpose, as if it had
been contrived;)</hi> that in case, as was hoped,
the University had taken it patiently; he
might have <hi>gloried,</hi> That the University of
<hi>Oxford</hi> found no fault with his Doctrine.
Which might <hi>furnish him with new Topicks
of Railing and Triumphing:</hi> Would not, <hi>It
may be supposed,</hi> do as well here? Only we
cannot say, <hi>It happened Luckily for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;</hi>
but rather <hi>Unluckily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But be this as it will: Let the Two Doctors
agree that Point amongst themselves; or
let the <hi>Animadverter</hi> and the <hi>Defender</hi> fight
it out. The <hi>Decree</hi> (as he calls it) names nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but only Censures a third Person.</p>
            <p>That this Person <hi>was not summoned,</hi> is not
true. Summoned he was; and had given in
his Answer, in Writing, under his hand; and
upon that Answer the Vice-Chancellor and
Heads of Houses did proceed. They did Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Doctrine; and forbid the Preaching
it; by him or any other.</p>
            <p>Why they were so kind as to proceed no
farther against him; many reasons may be
alleged. He had (while the business was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending)
quitted the University, and was gone;
And, 'twas hoped (being a Young man) he
would be more wary; and avoid the like, for
the future.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41203:8"/>
And if Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> would, in time, have
done the like, I think he had done better:
and I believe the best of his Friends think so
too. When he had let fall some unwary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
and not justifiable; he might have
retracted them, with as little discredit as he
has done some other. And <hi>it would be the
Wisest thing he could do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What are <hi>the thousand Iacobite Stories</hi> he
talks of (p. 1.) I know not: Whether now
he <hi>be</hi> or <hi>be not</hi> a Jacobite; Whether he <hi>have</hi>
or <hi>have not</hi> been; or, Whether <hi>sometime he
have and sometime have not;</hi> is nothing to
this purpose?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If he will still insist upon it, that</hi> If a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be a Mind, a Spirit, a Substance; then
three Persons must be Three distinct Minds,
Spirits, and Substances, <hi>p.</hi> 18. (as distinct as
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> though not separate, <hi>p. 20.)
he knows it will not be allow'd him: Because</hi>
Mind, Spirit, Substance, <hi>are (in their proper
signification)</hi> Absolute; <hi>but</hi> Person <hi>(in its
proper signification) is a</hi> Relative Term.</p>
            <p>If Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> were Dean of <hi>Paul</hi> s, Dean
of <hi>Windsor,</hi> and Dean of <hi>Westminster;</hi> should
we thence argue, That, since a <hi>Dean</hi> is a <hi>Man,</hi>
an <hi>Animal,</hi> a <hi>Substance;</hi> therefore, because
of <hi>three Distinct, Substantial Deaneries,</hi> they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41203:9"/>
be (or he is) <hi>three distinct Men, three distinct
Animals, and three distinct Substances?</hi> I
think not. Because <hi>Man, Animal, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
are terms <hi>Absolute,</hi> but <hi>Dean</hi> is <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
And the same <hi>Absolute Being,</hi> may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
(without being multiplied) many <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Predicates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should rather say, that Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>
would (in such case) sustain <hi>three Persons,</hi>
without being <hi>three Men, three Animals,</hi>
or <hi>three Substances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet this is not <hi>Sabellianism;</hi> For, though
<hi>Dean of Paul</hi>'s, be a <hi>Relative Name;</hi> yet it is
not merely an <hi>Empty Name;</hi> but doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
a <hi>Substantial Dignity,</hi> as the <hi>Ground</hi> of
that <hi>Relation;</hi> and a <hi>Substantial Man</hi> as the
<hi>Subject</hi> of That, as well as of his Other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
            <p>And this hath been told him so often, that
we cannot think the Dean so Dull, as not to
Apprehend the Distinction; but so wilful, as
that he scorns to own it: But would still
have us think, that <hi>Mind, Spirit, Person,</hi>
are terms Equivalent; (and therefore jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
them together as such;) which will not
be admitted.</p>
            <p>Or, if they be equivalent; why cannot he
content himself with (what is generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41203:9"/>
               <hi>three Persons,</hi> but must impose upon
us his New Terms of Three Distinct <hi>Minds,</hi>
Three Distinct <hi>Spirits,</hi> and Three Distinct
<hi>Substances?</hi> But Scorn and Flouncing will
not carry it off.</p>
            <p>The Consequence will hold more strongly,
thus, If an <hi>Infinite Eternal Mind or Spirit</hi>
be <hi>God;</hi> Then <hi>Three Distinct</hi> Infinite Eternal
Minds or Spirits, are <hi>Three Gods.</hi> (For, here,
the Terms are all <hi>Absolute,</hi> not <hi>Relative.</hi>)
And if to maintain <hi>(obstinately)</hi> That there
be <hi>Three Gods;</hi> (that is, <hi>Three Eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Minds or Spirits;</hi>) be not <hi>Heresy,</hi>
What is?</p>
            <p>It seems to me, but a New Trick, to play
the Game into the <hi>Socinian</hi>'s hand; By grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them (their darling Notion) that To
affirm, <hi>the Father, Son, and Holy-Ghost,</hi> to be
<hi>Three Persons</hi> of which <hi>each is God;</hi> is the
same as to affirm that they are <hi>Three Gods.</hi>
Which we must not allow.</p>
            <p>If St. <hi>Hilary</hi> have sometime called them
<hi>tres substantias;</hi> he may know, that <hi>substantia</hi>
was at that time an ambiguous term, and
taken sometimes as the <hi>Latin</hi> word for <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis,</hi>
and sometimes for <hi>Ousia.</hi> For which
reason the <hi>Latines</hi> were, for some time, shy
of admitting the term <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> least it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41203:10"/>
should be thought to imply the same with
<hi>Substantia,</hi> in the same sense with <hi>Ousia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he might have understood from his
own Citation, <hi>p.</hi> 38. that, by <hi>Substance,</hi> is
there meant <hi>Subsistence. Tres Substantias esse
dixerunt; Subsistentium Personas, per Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantias,
edocentes.</hi> That is, (by his own
Translation) <hi>They said there were three Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
meaning thereby, three Subsisting
Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when as now (for some Ages) it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
(for prevention of Ambiguity) in the
one sense, to say <hi>Substance,</hi> and in the other
<hi>Subsistence;</hi> it is not now the same to call
them <hi>three substances</hi> (in contradistinction to
three <hi>subsistences</hi>) as then it was, while the
word was used Ambiguously in both senses.</p>
            <p>This, I suppose, may satisfy you, (so far
as concerns the Vice-Chancellor and Heads
of Houses;) if it will not satisfy Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi>
let Him and the Animadverter dispute
it out.</p>
