            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <opener>My Lord,</opener>
                  <p>IF I should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to enumerate the many favours and advantages I have had
<pb facs="tcp:51860:3"/>
by my very long acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with your Lordship, I should enter upon an Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that might prove as tedious, as the Collecting of the Materials for this poor Monument, which I have erected, and do dedicate to the Memory of your belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Friend Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>: But though I will not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do that; yet I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member with pleasure, and remonstrate with gratitude, that your Lordship made me known to him, Mr. <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:3"/>
men, whose Merits ought never to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                  <p>My Friendship with the first was begun almost Forty years past, when I was as far from a thought, as a desire to out-live him; and farther from an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to write his life: But the wise Disposer of all mens lives and actions hath prolong'd the first, and now permitted the last; which is here dedicated to your Lordship (and as it ought to be) with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:4"/>
and a desire that it may remain as a publick Testimony of my Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>I Dare neither think, nor assure the Reader, that I have committed no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes in this Relation of the Life of Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>; but am sure, there is none that are either wilful, or very material. I confess, it was worthy the imployment of some person of more Learning and greater A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities than I can pretend to; and I have not a little wondred
<pb facs="tcp:51860:5"/>
that none have yet been so grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him and Posterity, as to undertake it. For it may be noted, That our Saviour hath had such care, that for <hi>Mary Magdalens</hi> kindness to him, her Name should never be forgotten: And doubtless, Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s meek and innocent Life, his great and useful Learning, might therefore challenge the like indeavours to preserve his Memory: And 'tis to me a wonder, that it has been already fifteen years neglected. But, in saying this, my meaning is not to upbraid others (I am far from that) but excuse my self, or beg pardon for daring to attempt it.
<pb facs="tcp:51860:5"/>
This being premis'd, I desire to tell the Reader, that in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation I have been so bold, as to paraphrase and say what I think he (whom I had the happiness to know well) would have said upon the same occasions; and, if I have err'd in this kind, and cannot now beg pardon of him that lov'd me; yet I do of my Reader, from whom I desire the same favour.</p>
                  <p>And, though my Age might have procur'd me a Writ of Ease, and that secur'd me from all further trouble in this kind; yet I met with such perswasions to begin, and so many willing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers since, and from them
<pb facs="tcp:51860:6"/>
and others, such helps and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to proceed, that when I found my self faint, and weary of the burthen with which I had loaden my self, and ready to lay it down; yet time and new strength hath at last brought it to be what it now is, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Reader, and with it this desire; That he will take notice, that Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> did in his Will or last Sickness adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, that after his death nothing of his might be printed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>that might be said to be his, which indeed was not</hi>; and also for that <hi>he might have chang'd his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion since be first writ it.</hi> And though these Reasons ought to
<pb facs="tcp:51860:6"/>
be regarded, yet regarded so, as he resolves in that Case of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science concerning <hi>rash Vows,</hi> that there may appear very good second Reasons, why we may forbear to perform them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for his said Reasons, they ought to be read as we do <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criphal Scripture</hi>; to explain, but not oblige us to so firm a belief of what is here presented as his.</p>
                  <p>And I have this to say more, That as in my Queries for wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s Life, I met with these little Tracts annex'd; so in my former Queries for my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to write the Life of <hi>venerable</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> I met with a Sermon, which I also believe was
<pb facs="tcp:51860:7"/>
really his, and here presented as his to the Reader. It is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd (and I have met with reason to believe it) that there be some Artists, that do certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know an <hi>Original</hi> Picture from a <hi>Copy</hi>; and in what Age of the World, and by whom drawn: And if so, then I hope it may be as safely affirmed, that what is here presented for theirs, is so like their temper of mind, their other writings, the times when, and the occasions upon which they were writ, that all Readers may safely conclude, they could be writ by none but <hi>venerable</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and the <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Dr. <hi>Sanderson.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:7"/>And lastly, I am now glad that have collected these Memoirs, which lay scatter'd, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted them into a narrower compass; and, if I have by the pleasant toyl of doing so, either pleas'd or profited any man, I have attain'd what I design'd when I first undertook it: But I seriously wish, both for the Readers, and Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s sake, that Posterity had known his great Learning and Vertue by a better Pen; by such a Pen, as could have made his Life as immortal as his Learning and Merits ought to be.</p>

                  <head>THE LIFE OF Dr. <hi>Robert Sanderson,</hi> LATE Lord Bishop of <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>DOctor <hi>Robert Sanderson,</hi> the late learned Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> whose Life I intend to write with all truth
<pb facs="tcp:51860:9"/>
and equal plainness, was born the nineteenth day of <hi>September,</hi> in the year of our Redemption 1587. The place of his birth was <hi>Rotheram</hi> in the County of <hi>York</hi>; a Town of good note, and the more for that <hi>Thomas Rotheram,</hi> sometime <hi>Archbishop</hi> of that Sea was born in it; a man, whose great wisdom, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and sanctity of life, have made it the more memorable; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it ought also to be, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the birth place of our <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Sanderson.</hi> And the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will be of my belief, if this humble Relation of his Life can hold any proportion with his great Piety, his useful Learning,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:9"/>
and his many other extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry endowments.</p>
                  <p>He was the second and young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Son of <hi>Robert Sanderson</hi> of <hi>Gilthwait-hall</hi> in the said Parish and County, <abbr>Esq</abbr> by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> one of the Daughters of <hi>Richard Carr</hi> of <hi>Buterthwate-hall,</hi> in the Parish of <hi>Ecclesfield</hi> in the said County of <hi>York,</hi> Gentleman.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Robert Sanderson</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was descended from a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, ancient, and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Family of his own Name: for the search of which truth, I refer my Reader, that inclines to it, to Dr. <hi>Thoriton</hi>'s <hi>History of the Antiquities of Nottinghamshire,</hi> and other Records; not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:51860:10"/>
it necessary here to ingage him into a search for bare Titles, which are noted to have in them nothing of reality: For Titles not acquir'd, but deriv'd only, do but shew us who of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors have, and how they have atchiev'd that honour which their Descendants claim, and may not be worthy to enjoy. For if those Titles descend to persons that degenerate into Vice, and break off the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued line of Learning, or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or that Vertue that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd them, they destroy the very foundation upon which that Honour was built; and all the Rubbish of their Vices ought

to fall heavy on such dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Heads; ought to fall so heavy, as to degrade them of their Titles, and blast their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories with reproach and shame.</p>
                  <p>But our <hi>Robert Sanderson</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved worthy of his Name and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: Of which one testimony may be, That <hi>Gilbert,</hi> call'd the Great Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> thought him not unworthy to be joyn'd with him as a God-father to <hi>Gilbert Sheldon,</hi> the late Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; to whose Merits and Memory Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity (the Clergy especially) ought to pay a Reverence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:11"/>But I return to my intended Relation of <hi>Robert</hi> the Son, who began in his Youth to make the Laws of God, and Obedience to his Parents, the rules of his life; seeming even then to dedicate himself, and all his Studies, to Piety and Vertue.</p>
                  <p>And, as he was inclin'd to this by that native goodness, with which the wise Disposer of all hearts had endow'd his: So this calm, this quiet and happy temper of mind (his being mild, and averse to oppositions) made the whole course of his life easie and grateful both to himself and others: And this blessed temper, was maintain'd
<pb facs="tcp:51860:11"/>
and improv'd by his prudent Fathers good Example, and by frequent conversing with him; and scattering short Apothegms and little pleasant Stories, and making useful applications of them, his Son was in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy taught to abhor Vanity and Vice as Monsters, and to discern the loveliness of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Vertue; and by these means, and God's concurring Grace, his knowledge was so augmented, and his native good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness so confirm'd, that all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came so habitual, as 'twas not easie to determine whether Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Education were his Teachers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:12"/>And here let me tell the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That these early beginnings of Vertue were by God's <hi>assisting grace</hi> blest with what St. <hi>Paul</hi> seem'd to beg for his <hi>Philippians,</hi> namely,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6.</note> 
                     <hi>That he that had begun a good work in them, would finish it.</hi> And Almighty God did: For his whole life was so regular and innocent, that he might have said at his death (and with truth and comfort) what the same St. <hi>Paul</hi> said after to the same <hi>Philippians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.17.</note> when he advis'd them <hi>to walk as they had him for an Example.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this goodness, of which I have spoken, seem'd to increase as his years did; and with his
<pb facs="tcp:51860:12"/>
goodness his learning, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of which was laid in the Grammer School of <hi>Rotheram</hi> (that being one of those three that were founded and liberally endow'd by the said great and good Bishop of that Name.) And in this time of his being a Scholar there, he was observ'd to use an unwearied diligence to attain learning, and to have a seriousness beyond his age, and with it a more than common modesty; and to be of so calm and obliging a behaviour, that the Master and whole number of Scholars lov'd him, as one man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:13"/>And in this love and amity he continued at that School till about the thirteenth year of his age; at which time his Father design'd to improve his Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer learning, by removing him from <hi>Rotheram</hi> to one of the more noted Schools of <hi>Eaton</hi> or <hi>Westminster:</hi> and after a years stay there, then to remove him thence to <hi>Oxford.</hi> But, as he went with him, he call'd on an old Friend, a Minister of noted learning, and told him his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; and he, after many questions with his Son, receiv'd such Answers from him, that he assur'd his Father, his Son was so perfect a Grammarian, that
<pb facs="tcp:51860:13"/>
he had laid a good foundation to build any, or all the Arts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore advis'd him to shorten his journey, and leave him at <hi>Oxford.</hi> And his Father did so.</p>
                  <p>His father left him there to the sole care and manage of Dr. <hi>Kilbie,</hi> who was then Rector of <hi>Lincoln Colledge:</hi> And he, after some time and trial of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and learning, thought fit to enter him of that Colledge, and after to matriculate him in the University, which he did the first of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1603. but he was not chosen Fellow till the third of <hi>May</hi> 1606. at which time he had taken his Degree of Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
<pb facs="tcp:51860:14"/>
of Arts; at the taking of which Degree, his Tutor told the <hi>Rector,</hi> That his Pupil <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> had a metaphysical brain, and a matchless memory: and that he thought he had improv'd, or made the last so by an Art of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. And all the future im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of his life prov'd that his Tutor was not mistaken. I must here stop my Reader, and tell him, that this Dr. <hi>Kilbie</hi> was a man of so great learning and wisdom, and so excellent a Critick in the <hi>Hebrew Tongue,</hi> that he was made Professor of it in this University; and was also so perfect a Grecian, that he was by King <hi>Iames</hi> appointed to be
<pb facs="tcp:51860:14"/>
one of the Translators of the Bible: And that this Doctor and Mr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> had frequent Discourses, and lov'd as Father and Son. The Doctor was to ride a Journey into <hi>Darbyshire,</hi> and took Mr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> to bear him company: and they going together on a <hi>Sunday</hi> with the Doctor's Friend to that Parish Church where they then were, found the young Preacher to have no more discretion, than to waste a great part of the hour allotted for his Sermon in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions against the late Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of several words (not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting such a hearer as Dr. <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie</hi>) and shew'd three Reasons
<pb facs="tcp:51860:15"/>
why a particular word should have been otherwise translated. When Evening Prayer was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Preacher was invited to the Doctor's Friends house; where, after some other Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the Doctor told him, <hi>He might have preach'd more useful Doctrine, and not fill'd his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ears with needless Exceptions against the late Translation; and for that word, for which he offered to that poor Congregation three Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, why it ought to have been translated, as he said; he and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had considered all them, and found thirteen more considerable Reasons, why it was translated as now printed:</hi> and told him, <hi>If his
<pb facs="tcp:51860:15"/>
Friend,</hi> then attending him, <hi>should prove guilty of such indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he should forfeit his favour.</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> said, <hi>He hop'd he should not.</hi> And the Preacher was so ingenious as to say, <hi>He would not justifie himself.</hi> And so I return to <hi>Oxford.</hi> In the year 1608. (<hi>Iuly the</hi> 11<hi>th.</hi>) Mr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> was compleated Master of Arts. I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that for the attaining these Dignities, the time was shorter than was then, or is now required; but either his birth, or the well performance of some extraordinary exercise, or some other merit, made him so: and the Reader is requested to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb facs="tcp:51860:16"/>
that 'twas the last; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested to believe also, that, if I be mistaken in the time, the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Records have mis-inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me: But I hope they have not.</p>
                  <p>In that year of 1608. he was (<hi>November</hi> the 7<hi>th.</hi>) by his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge chosen Reader of Logick in the House, which he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so well, that he was chosen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the sixth of <hi>November,</hi> 1609. In the year 1613. he was chosen Sub-rector of the Colledge, and the like for the year 1614. and chose again to the same Dignity and Trust for the year 1616.</p>
                  <p>In all which time and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, his abilities and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
<pb facs="tcp:51860:16"/>
were such, as procur'd him both love and reverence from the whole Society; there being no exception against him for any faults, but a sorrow for the infirmities of his being too timorous and bashful; both which were, God knows, so connatural, as they never left him. And I know not whether his lovers ought to wish they had; for they prov'd so like the <hi>Radical moisture</hi> in man's body, that they preserv'd the life of Vertue in his Soul, which by God's assisting grace never left him, till this life put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Of which happy infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities (if they may be so
<pb facs="tcp:51860:17"/>
call'd) more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1614. he stood to be elected one of the Proctors for the University. And 'twas not to satisfie any ambition of his own, but to comply with the desire of the Rector and whole Society, of which he was a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; who had not had a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor chosen out of their Colledge for the space of sixty years (namely, not from the year 1554. unto his standing;) and they perswaded him, that if he would but stand for <hi>Proctor,</hi> his merits were so generally known, and he so well beloved, that 'twas but appearing, and he would infallibly carry it against any
<pb facs="tcp:51860:17"/>
Opposers; and told him, <hi>That he would by that means recover a right or reputation that was seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly dead to his Colledge.</hi> By these and other like perswasions he yielded up his own reason to theirs, and appear'd to stand for <hi>Proctor.</hi> But that Election was carried on by so sudden and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and by so powerful a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that he mist it. Which when he understood, he profest seriously to his Friends, <hi>That if he were troubled at the disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'twas for theirs, and not for his own sake: For he was far from any desire of such an Imployment, as must be managed with charge and trouble, and was too usually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
<pb facs="tcp:51860:18"/>
with hard censures, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, or both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the year following he was earnestly perswaded by Dr. <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie</hi> and others, to renew the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Lectures which he had read some years past in his Colledge: and that done, to methodize and print them, for the ease and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good of Posterity. But though he had an aversness to appear publickly in print; yet after many serious solicitations, and some second thoughts of his own, he laid aside his modesty, and promised he would; and he did so in that year of 1615. And the Book prov'd, as his Friends seem'd to prophecy,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:18"/>
that is, of great and general use, whether we respect the Art or the Author. For Logick may be said to be an <hi>Art of right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning</hi>: an Art that undeceives men who take falshood for truth; enables men to pass a true Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and detect those fallacies which in some mens Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings usurp the place of right reason. And how great a Master our Author was in this Art, will quickly appear from that clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of method, argument, and demonstration, which is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous in all his other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. He who had attained to so great a dexterity in the use of reason himself, was best quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb facs="tcp:51860:19"/>
to prescribe rules and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the instruction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And I am the more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of the excellency and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of this his first publick Undertaking, by hearing that most Tutors in both Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties teach Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick to their Pupils, as a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon which they are to build their future Studies in Philosophy. And for a further confirmation of my belief, the Reader may note, That since his Book of Logick was first print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there has not been less than ten thousand sold: And that 'tis like to continue both to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover truth, and to clear and
<pb facs="tcp:51860:19"/>
confirm the reason of the unborn World.</p>
                  <p>It will easily be believed that his former standing for a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors place, and being disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, must prove much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to a man of his great wisdom and modesty, and create in him an aversness to run a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hazard of his credit and content; and yet he was assured by Dr. <hi>Kilbie,</hi> and the Fellows of his own Colledge, and most of those that had oppos'd him in the former Election, that his Book of Logick had purchas'd for him such a belief of his Learning and Prudence, and his behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our at the former Election had
<pb facs="tcp:51860:20"/>
got for him so great and so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a love, that all his former Opposers repented what they had done; and therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to venture to stand a second time. And upon these and other like incouragements, he did again, but not without an inward unwillingness, yield up his own reason to theirs, and promis'd to stand. And he did so; and was the tenth of <hi>April,</hi> 1616. chosen Senior Proctor for the year following, Mr. <hi>Charles Crooke</hi> of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> being then chosen the Junior.</p>
                  <p>In this year of his being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor there happened many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable accidents; namely, Dr.
<pb facs="tcp:51860:20"/>
                     <hi>Robert Abbot,</hi> Master of <hi>Balial Colledge,</hi> and <hi>Regius</hi> Professor of Divinity (who being elected or consecrated Bishop of <hi>Sarum</hi> some months before) was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly conducted out of <hi>Oxford</hi> towards his Diocese, by the Heads of all Houses, and the chief of all the University. And Dr. <hi>Pridiaux</hi> succeeded him in the Professorship, in which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the year 1642. (being then elected Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi>) and then our now Proctor Mr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> succeeded him in the <hi>Regius</hi> Professorship.</p>
                  <p>And in this year Dr. <hi>Arthur Lake</hi> (then Warden of <hi>New Colledge</hi>) was advanced to the
<pb facs="tcp:51860:21"/>
Bishoprick of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi>: A man of whom I take my self bound in Justice to say, That he made the great trust committed to him, the chief care and whole business of his life. And one testimony of this truth may be, That he sate usually with his Chancellor in his Consistory, and at least advis'd, if not assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in most sentences for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of such Offenders as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Church Censures. And it may be noted, That after a Sentence for Penance was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, he did very warily or never allow of any <hi>Commutation</hi> for the Offence, but did usually see the Sentence for Penance
<pb facs="tcp:51860:21"/>
executed; and then as usually preach'd a Sermon of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Repentance, and so apply them to the Offenders, that then stood before him, as begot in them then a devout con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and at least resolutions to amend their lives; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done that, he would take them (though never so poor) to dinner with him, and use them friendly, and dismiss them with his blessing, and perswasions to a vertuous life, and beg them to believe him: And his Humility, and Charity, and other Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Excellencies were all like this. Of all which the Reader may inform himself in his Life, truly
<pb facs="tcp:51860:22"/>
writ and printed before his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
                  <p>And in this year also, the very prudent and very wise Lord <hi>Elsmere,</hi> who was so very long Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and then of <hi>Oxford,</hi> resigning up the last, the right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and as magnificent, <hi>William Herbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> was chose to succeed him.</p>
                  <p>And in this year our late King <hi>Charles</hi> the First (then Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>) came honourably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>Oxford</hi>; and having deliberately visited the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, the Schools, Colledges, and Libraries, He and his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants were entertained with
<pb facs="tcp:51860:22"/>
Ceremonies and Feasting sutable to their Dignity and Merirs.</p>
                  <p>And this year King <hi>Iames</hi> sent Letters to the University for the regulating their Studies; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the young Divines: Advising they should not rely on modern Sums and Systemes, but study the Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and the more Primitive Learning. And this advice was occasioned by the indiscreet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences made by very many Preachers out of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Doctrine concerning <hi>Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Vniversal Redemption, the Irresistibility of God's Grace,</hi> and of some other knotty Points depending upon these; Points
<pb facs="tcp:51860:23"/>
which many think were not, but by Interpreters forc'd to be Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s meaning; of the truth or falshood of which, I pretend not to have an ability to judge; my meaning in this Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to acquaint the Reader with the occasion of the King's Letter.</p>
                  <p>It may be observed, that the various accidents of this year did afford our Proctor large and laudable matter to relate and discourse upon: And, that though his Office seem'd, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Statute and Custome, to require him to do so at his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it; yet he chose rather to pass them over with some very
<pb facs="tcp:51860:23"/>
short Observations, and present the Governours, and his other Hearers, with rules to keep up Discipline and Order in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity; which at that time was either by defective Statutes, or want of the due execution of those that were good, grown to be extreamly irregular. And in this year also, the Magisterial part of the Proctor requir'd more diligence, and was more difficult to be managed than formerly, by reason of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of new Statutes, which begot much confusion; some of which Statutes were then, and others suddenly after, put into a useful execution. And though
<pb facs="tcp:51860:24"/>
these Statutes were not then made so perfectly useful, as they were design'd, till Archbishop <hi>Laud</hi>'s time (who assisted in the forming and promoting them;) yet our present Proctor made them as effectual as discretion and diligence could do: Of which one Example may seem worthy the noting; namely, That if in his Night-walk he met with irregular Scholars absent from their Colledges at Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity hours, or disordered by drink, or in scandalous compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he did not use his power of punishing to an extremity; but did usually take their names, and a promise to appear before
<pb facs="tcp:51860:24"/>
him unsent for next morning: And when they did, convinced them with such obligingness, and reason added to it, that they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him with such resolutions as the man after God's own heart was possess'd with, when he said,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.11</note> 
                     <hi>There is mercy with thee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou shalt be feared.</hi> And by this, and a like behaviour to all men, he was so happy as to lay down this dangerous imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as but very few, if any have done, even <hi>without an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After his Speech was ended, and he retir'd with a Friend into a convenient privacy; he look'd upon his Friend with a more
<pb facs="tcp:51860:25"/>
than common chearfulness, and spake to him to this purpose. I look back upon my late imployment with some content to my self, and a great thankfulness to Almighty God, that he hath made me of a temper not apt to provoke the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of mankind, but rather to pass by infirmities, if noted; and in this Imployment I have had (God knows) many occasions to do both. And when I consider how many of a contrary temper, are by sudden and small occasions transported and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by Anger to commit such Errors, as they in that passion could not foresee, and will in their more calm and deliberate thoughts upbraid, and require repentance: And Consider,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:25"/>
that though Repentance secures us from the punishment of any sin, yet how much more comfortable it is to be innocent, than need pardon: And consider, that Errors against men, though pardon'd both by God and them, do yet leave such anxious and upbraiding impressions in the memory, as abates of the Offender's content: When I consider all this, and that God hath of his goodness given me a temper that hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me from running into such enormities, I remember my temper with joy and thankfulness.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 1 30.</note> And though I cannot say with <hi>David</hi> (I wish I could) that therefore <hi>his praise shall always be in my mouth</hi>; yet I hope, that by his
<pb facs="tcp:51860:26"/>
grace, and that grace seconded by my endeavours, it shall never be blotted out of my memory; and I now beseech Almighty God that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may.</p>
                  <p>And here I must look back, and mention one passage more in his Proctorship, which is; That <hi>Gilbert Sheldon,</hi> the late Lord Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was this year sent to <hi>Trinity Colledge</hi> in that University; and not long after his entrance there, a Letter was sent after him from his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father (the Father of our Proctor) to let his Son know it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his God-son to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and to more than a common care of his behaviour;
<pb facs="tcp:51860:26"/>
which prov'd a pleasing injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to our Proctor, who was so gladly obedient to his Fathers desire, that he some few days after sent his Servitor to intreat Mr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> to his Chamber next morning. But it seems Mr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> having (like a young man as he was) run into some such irregularity as made him cautious he had transgress'd his Statutes, did therefore appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Proctor's invitation as an introduction to punishment; the fear of which made his Bed restless that night; but at their meeting the next morning, that fear vanished immediately by the Proctor's chearful countenance,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:27"/>
and the freedom of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Friends. And let me tell my Reader, that this first meeting prov'd the beginning of as spirituala friendship as human nature is capable of; of a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship free from all self ends: and it continued to be so, till death forc'd a separation of it on earth; but 'tis now reunited in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>And now, having given this account of his behaviour, and the considerable accidents in his Proctorship, I proceed to tell my Reader, that this busie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment being ended, he preach'd his Sermon for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Batchelor in Divinity, in
<pb facs="tcp:51860:27"/>
as eligant Latin, and as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the matter, as hath been preach'd in that University since that day. And having well perform'd his other Exercises for that degree, he took it the nine and twentieth of <hi>May</hi> following, having been ordain'd Deacon and Priest in the year 1611. by <hi>Iohn King,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> who had not long before been Dean of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> and then knew him so well, that he became his most affectionate Friend. And in this year, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then about the 29th. of his Age, he <hi>took</hi> from the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a Licence to preach.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:28"/>In the year 1618. he was by Sir <hi>Nicholas Sanderson,</hi> Lord Viscount <hi>Castleton,</hi> presented to the Rectory of <hi>Wibberton,</hi> not far from <hi>Boston,</hi> in the County of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> a Living of very good value; but it lay in so low and wet a part of that Countrey, as was inconsistent with his health. And health being (next to a good Conscience) the greatest of God's blessings in this life, and requiring therefore of every man a care and diligence to preserve it, he, apprehending a danger of losing it if he continued at <hi>Wib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berton</hi> a second Winter, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore resign it back into the hands of his worthy Kinsman and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
about one year after his donation of it to him.</p>
                  <p>And about this time of his resignation he was presented to the Rectory of <hi>Boothby Pannel</hi> in the same County of <hi>Lincoln</hi>; a Town which has been made fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and must continue to be famous, because <hi>Dr. Sanderson,</hi> the humble and learned <hi>Dr. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson,</hi> was more than 40 years Parson of <hi>Boothby Pannel,</hi> and from thence dated all, or most of his matchless Writings.</p>
                  <p>To this Living (which was of less value, but a purer Air than <hi>Wibberton)</hi> he was presented by <hi>Thomas Harrington</hi> of the same County and Parish, <abbr>Esq</abbr> who
<pb facs="tcp:51860:29"/>
was a Gentleman of a very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Family, and of great use and esteem in his Countrey du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his whole life. And in this <hi>Boothby Pannel</hi> the meek and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> and his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron liv'd with an endearing, mutual, and comfortable friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, till the death of the last put a period to it.</p>
                  <p>About the time that he was made Parson of <hi>Boothby Pannel,</hi> he resign'd his Fellowship of <hi>Lincoln Colledge</hi> unto the then Rector and Fellows: And his resignation is recorded in these words:
<q>Ego <hi>Robertus Sanderson</hi> per, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:29"/>I <hi>Robert Sanderson,</hi> Fellow of the Colledge of St. <hi>Maries</hi> and <hi>All-Saints,</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln Colledge,</hi> in the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> do freely and willingly resign into the hands of the Rector and fellows, all the Right and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that I have in the said Colledge, wishing to them and their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, all peace, and piety, and happiness, in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> 6. 1619</p>
                  <p>Robert Sanderson.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:30"/>And not long after this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, he was by the then Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> or the King, <hi>Sede vacante,</hi> made Prebend of the Collegiate Church of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> in that Diocese; and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after of <hi>Lincoln</hi> by the Bishop of that See.</p>
                  <p>And being now resolv'd to set down his rest in a quiet privacy at <hi>Boothby Pannel,</hi> and looking back with some sadness upon his removal from his general Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance left in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the peculiar pleasures of a Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity life; he could not but think the want of Society would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this of a Countrey Parson the more uncomfortable, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb facs="tcp:51860:30"/>
of that want of conversation; and therefore he did put on some saint purposes to marry. For he had considered, that though marriage be cumbred with more worldly care than a single life; yet a complying and prudent Wife changes those very cares into so mutual a content, as makes them become like the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.24.</note> which he would not have wanted, because <hi>they occasioned his rejoycing in them.</hi> And he having well considered this, and observ'd the secret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable joys that Children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in Parents, and the mutual pleasures and contented trouble of their daily care and constant
<pb facs="tcp:51860:31"/>
endeavours to bring up those little Images of themselves so, as to make them as happy as all those cares and endeavours can make them: He having consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all this, the hopes of such happiness turn'd his faint pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose into a positive resolution to marry. And he was so happy as to obtain <hi>Anne,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Henry Nelson</hi> Batchelor in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, then Rector of <hi>Haugham</hi> in the County of <hi>Lincoln</hi> (a man of noted worth and learning.) And the Giver of all good things was so good to him, as to give him such a Wife as was sutable to his own desires; a Wife, that made his life happy by being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb facs="tcp:51860:31"/>
content when he was chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; that divided her joys with him, and abated of his sorrow, by bearing a part of that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; a Wife, that demonstrated her affection by a chearful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all his desires, during the whole course of his life; and at his death too, for she out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd him.</p>
                  <p>And in this <hi>Boothby Pannel</hi> he either found or made his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioners peaceable, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with him in the decent and regular service of God. And thus his Parish, his Patron, and he liv'd together in a religious love, and a contented quietness. He not troubling their thoughts
<pb facs="tcp:51860:32"/>
by preaching high and useless notions, but such plain truths as were necessary to be known, believed, and practised, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their salvation. And their assent to what he taught was testified by such a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to his Doctrine, as decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they believ'd and lov'd him. For he would often say, <hi>That without the last, the most evident truths (heard as from an enemy, or an evil liver) either are not, or are at least the less effectual; and do usually rather harden, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the hearer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this excellent man did not think his duty discharged by only reading the Church
<pb facs="tcp:51860:32"/>
Prayers, Catechizing, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and administring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments seasonably; but thought (if the Law or the Canons may seem to injoyn no more, yet) that God would require more than the defective Laws of man's making, can or does injoyn; the performance of that inward Law, which Almighty God hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the Conscience of all good Christians, and inclines those whom he loves to perform. He considering this, did therefore become a law to himself, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing what his Conscience told him was his duty, in reconciling differences, and preventing Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, both in his Parish and in
<pb facs="tcp:51860:33"/>
the Neighbourhood. To which may be added his often visiting sick and disconsolate Families, perswading them to patience, and raising them from dejection and his advice and chearful dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and by adding his own Alms, if there were any so poor as to need it; considering how acceptable it is to Almighty God, when we do as we are advis'd by St. <hi>Paul, help to bear one anothers burthen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ga. 6.2.</note> either of <hi>sorrow</hi> or <hi>want:</hi> and what a comfort it will be, when the Searcher of all hearts shall call us to a strict account for that evil we have done, and the good we have omitted, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member we have comforted and
<pb facs="tcp:51860:33"/>
been helpful to a dejected or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed Family.</p>
                  <p>And that his practice was to do good, one Example may be, That he met with a poor dejected Neighbour that complain'd he had taken a Meadow, the Rent of which was <hi>9 l.</hi> a year; and when the Hay was made ready to be carried into his Barn, several days constant rain had so raised the water, that a sudden Flood carried all away, and his rich Landlord would bate him no rent; and that unless he had half abated, he and seven children were utterly undone. It may be noted, That in this Age there are a sort of people so unlike the God
<pb facs="tcp:51860:34"/>
of mercy, so void of the bowels of pity, that they love only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and children; love them so, as not to be concern'd, whether the rest of mankind waste their days in sorrow or shame; Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are curst with riches, and a mistake that nothing but riches can make them and theirs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. But 'twas not so with Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>; for he was concern'd, and spoke comfortably to the poor dejected man; bade him go home and pray, and not load himself with sorrow, for he would go to his Landlord next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and if his Landlord would not abate what he desired, he and a Friend would pay it for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:34"/>To the Landlord he went the next day; and in a conference, the Doctor presented to him the sad condition of his poor deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tenant; telling him how much God is pleas'd when men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate the poor: and told him, That though God loves Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, yet he loves Mercy so much better, that he is pleas'd when call'd <hi>the God of mercy.</hi> And told him, the riches he was possest of were given him by that <hi>God of mercy,</hi> who would not be pleas'd, if he that had so much given, yea, and forgiven him too, should prove like the rich Steward in the Gospel, <hi>that took his fellow servant by the throat to make him pay the
<pb facs="tcp:51860:35"/>
utmost farthing.</hi> This he told him. And told him, That the Law of this Nation (by which Law he claims his Rent) does not undertake to make men <hi>honest</hi> or <hi>merciful</hi>; but does what it can to restrain men from being <hi>dishonest</hi> or <hi>unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,</hi> and yet was defective in both: and that taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rent from his poor Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for what God suffered him not to enjoy, though the Law allowed him to do so, yet if he did so, he was too like that rich Steward which he had mentioned to him; and told him that riches so gotten, and added to his great
<pb facs="tcp:51860:35"/>
Estate, would, as <hi>Iob</hi> says, <hi>prove like gravel in his teeth,</hi> would in time so corrode his Conscience, or become so nauseous when he lay upon his Death-bed, that he would then labour to vomit it up, and not be able: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore advis'd him, being very rich, to make Friends of his <hi>unrighteous Mammon,</hi> before that evil day come upon him: But however, neither for his own sake, nor for God's sake, to take any Rent of his poor dejected sad Tenant, for that were to gain a temporal, and lose his eternal happiness. These and other such reasons, were urg'd with so grave and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate an earnestness, that the
<pb facs="tcp:51860:36"/>
Landlord forgave his Tenant the whole Rent.</p>
                  <p>The Reader will easily believe that Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> who was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so meek &amp; merciful, did sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and gladly carry this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable news to the dejected Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and will believe, that at the telling of it there was a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual rejoycing. 'Twas one of <hi>Iob</hi>'s boasts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iob</hi> 31.</note> 
                     <hi>That he had seen none perish for want of clothing: and that he had often made the heart of the widow to rejoyce.</hi> And doubtless Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> might have made the same religious boast of this, and very many like occasions. But since he did not, I rejoyce that I have this just occasion to
<pb facs="tcp:51860:36"/>
do it for him; and that I can tell the Reader, I might tire my self and him in telling how like the whole course of Dr. <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s life was to this which I have now related.</p>
                  <p>Thus he went on in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and quiet privacy, doing good daily both by word and by deed, as often as any occasion offer'd it self; yet not so obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but that his very great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, prudence, and piety were much noted and valued by the Bishop of his Diocese, and by most of the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of that Country. By the first of which he was often summon'd to preach many Visitation Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:37"/>
and by the latter at many Assizes. Which Sermons, though they were much esteemed by them that procur'd and were fit to judge them; yet they were the less valued, because he read them, which he was forc'd to do; for though he had an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary memory (even the Art of it) yet he had such an inmate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible fear and bashfulness, that his memory was wholly use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, as to the repetition of his Sermons as he had writ them, which gave occasion to say, when they were first printed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to censure (which was in the year 1632) That <hi>the best Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that were ever read, were never preach'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:37"/>In this contented obscurity he continued, till the learned and good Archbishop <hi>Laud,</hi> who knew him well in <hi>Oxford</hi> (for he was his contemporary there told the King ('twas the knowing and conscientious King <hi>Charles</hi> the I.) that there was one Mr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> an obscure Countrey Minister, that was of such sincerity, and so excellent in all Casuistical learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he desir'd his Majesty would make him his Chaplain. The King granted it most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, &amp; gave the Bishop charge to hasten it, for he long'd, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with a man that had dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his Studies to that useful part of learning. The Bishop for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
<pb facs="tcp:51860:38"/>
not the King's desire, and Mr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> was made his Chaplain in Ordinary in <hi>November</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 1631. And when they became known to each other, the King did put many Cases of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him, and receiv'd from him such deliberate, safe, and clear solutions, as gave him great content in conversing with him: so that at the end of his months attendance, the King told him, He should long for the next <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>; for he resolv'd to have a more inward acquaintance with him, when that month and he return'd. And when the month and he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, the good King was never absent from his Sermons, and
<pb facs="tcp:51860:38"/>
would usually say, I carry my ears to hear other Preachers, but I carry my conscience to hear Mr. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson,</hi> and to act accordingly. And this ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd from Posterity, That the King thought what he spake: For he took him to be his Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser in that quiet part of his life, and he prov'd to be his Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in those days of his affliction, when he apprehended himself to be in danger of Death or Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. Of which more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>In the first Parliament of this good King (which was 1625.) he was chosen to be a Clerk of the Convocation for the Diocese of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> which I here mention,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:39"/>
because about that time did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise many disputes about Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination, and the many Critical Points that depend upon, or are interwoven in it; occasioned, as was said, by a disquisition of new Principles of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s (though others say they were before his time.) But of these Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> then drew up for his own satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction such a Scheme (he call'd it <hi>Pax Ecclesia</hi>) as then gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and hath since given others such satisfaction, that it still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be of great estimation among the most learned. He was also chosen Clerk of all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations during that good Kings reign. Which I here tell my
<pb facs="tcp:51860:39"/>
Reader, because I shall hereafter have occasion to mention that Convocation in 1640. the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py long Parliament, and some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of the Predestination Points, as they have been since charitably handled betwixt him, the learned Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> the now reverend Dean of <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the year 1636. his Majesty then in his Progress took a fair occasion to visit <hi>Oxford,</hi> and to take an entertainment for two days for himself and honourable Attendants, which the Reader ought to believe was sutable to their dignities: But this is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, because at the King's
<pb facs="tcp:51860:40"/>
coming thither Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> did attend him, and was then (the 31 of <hi>August</hi>) created Doctor of Divinity; which honour had an addition to it, by having many of the Nobility of this Nation then made <hi>Doctors</hi> and <hi>Masters of Art with him:</hi> Some of whose names shall be recorded and live with his (and none shall out-live it.) First Dr. <hi>Curle</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wren,</hi> who were then Bishops of <hi>Winton</hi> and of <hi>Norwich</hi> (and had formerly taken their degrees in <hi>Cambridge</hi>) were with him created Doctors of Divinity in his University. So was <hi>Merick</hi> the Son of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Izaak Causabon</hi>; and Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> (who still lives) the then
<pb facs="tcp:51860:40"/>
                     <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lenox,</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> of <hi>Barkshire,</hi> and very many others of noble birth (too many to be named) were then created Masters of Arts.</p>
                  <p>Some years before the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py long Parliament, this Nation being then happy and in peace (though inwardly sick of being well) namely in the year 1639. a discontented party of the <hi>Scots</hi> Church were zealously restless for another Reformation of their Kirk Government; and to that end created a new Covenant, for the general taking of which they pretended to petition the King for his assent, and that he would injoyn the taking of it by all of
<pb facs="tcp:51860:41"/>
that Nation: but this Petition was not to be presenred to him by a Committee of eight or ten men of their Fraternity, but by so many thousands, and they so arm'd, as seem'd to force an assent to what they seem'd to request; so that though forbidden by the King, yet they entred <hi>England,</hi> and in their heat of Zeal took and plunder'd <hi>New-Castle,</hi> where the King was forc'd to meet them with an Army; but upon a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and some concessions, he sent them back (though not so rich as they intended, yet) for that time without blood-shed: But oh, this Peace and this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant were but the forerunners of
<pb facs="tcp:51860:41"/>
War and the many miseries that followed: For in the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing there were so many cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen into the long Parliament, that were of a conjunct Council with these very zealous, and as facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reformes, as begot such a confusion by the several desires and designs in many of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Parliament, and at last in the very common people of this Nation, that they were so lost by contrary designs, fears and confusions, as to believe the <hi>Scots</hi> and their Covenant would restore them to their former tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. And to that end the Presbyterian party of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did again, in the year 1643.
<pb facs="tcp:51860:42"/>
invite the Scotch Covenanters back into <hi>England:</hi> and hither they came marching with it glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously upon their Pikes, and in their Hats, with this Motto, <hi>For the Crown and Covenant of both Kingdoms.</hi> This I saw, and suffer'd by it. But when I look back upon the ruine of Families, the bloodshed, the decay of common honesty, and how the former piety and plain dealing of this now sinful Nation is turned into cruelty and cunning, I praise God that he prevented me from being of that party which help'd to bring in this Covenant, and those sad Confusions that have follow'd it, And I have been the
<pb facs="tcp:51860:42"/>
bolder to say this of my self, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in a sad discourse with Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> I heard him make the like grateful acknowledgement.</p>
                  <p>This digression is intended for the better information of the Reader in what will follow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Dr. <hi>Sanderson.</hi> And first, That the Covenanters of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their party in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made many Exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Common Prayer and Ceremonies of the Church, and seem'd restless for a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And though their desires seem'd not reasonable to the King and the learned Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> then Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; yet to quiet their Consciences, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb facs="tcp:51860:43"/>
future confusion, they did in the year 1641. desire Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> to call two more of the Convocation to advise with him, and that he would then draw up some such safe alterations as he thought fit in the Service Book, and abate some of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that were least material, for satisfying their consciences; and to this end they did meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther privately twice a week at the <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi>'s House (for the space of 3 months or more.) But not long after that time, when Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> had made the Reformation ready for a view, the Church and State were both fall'n into such a confusion, that
<pb facs="tcp:51860:43"/>
Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s Model for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation became then useless. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, his Reputation was such, that he was in the year 1642. propos'd by both Houses of Parliament to the King then in <hi>Oxford,</hi> to be one of their Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stees for the settling of Church affairs, and was allowed of by the King to be so; but that Treaty came to nothing.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1643. the 2 Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Parliament took upon them to make an Ordinance, and call an Assembly of Divines, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and settle some Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies (of which many were very unfit to judges:) in which Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> was also named;
<pb facs="tcp:51860:44"/>
but did not appear, I suppose for the same reason that many other worthy and learned men did forbear, the Summons wanting the King's Authority. And here I must look back and tell the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that in the year 1642. he was (<hi>Iuly</hi> 21.) named by a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Authority to a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imployment, which was to be <hi>Professor Regius of Divinity in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>; but though <hi>knowledge be said to puff up,</hi> yet his modesty and too mean an opinion of his great Abilities, and some other real or pretended reasons (exprest in his Speech, when he first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Chair, and since print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) kept him from entring into it till <hi>Octobor</hi> 1646.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:44"/>He did for about a years time continue to read his matchless Lectures, which were first <hi>de Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramento,</hi> a Point very difficult, and at that time very dangerous to be handled as it ought to be. But this learned man, as he was eminently furnished with Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to satisfie the consciences of men upon that important Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; so he wanted not courage to assert the true obligation of Oaths in a degenerate Age, when men had made perjury a main part of their Religion. How much the learned world stands obliged to him for these and his following Lectures <hi>de Conscientia,</hi> I shall not attempt to declare, as being very
<pb facs="tcp:51860:45"/>
sensible, that the best Pens must needs fall short in the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of them : So that I shall only add, That they continue to this day, and will do for ever, as a compleat standard for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the most material doubts in Casuistical Divinity. And therefore I proceed to tell the Reader, That about the time of his reading those Lectures (the King being then Prisoner in the <hi>Isle of Wight</hi>) the Parliament had sent the <hi>Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Oath,</hi> and I know not what more, to be taken by the <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Chair,</hi> and all Heads of Houses: and all other inferiour Scholars of what degree soever,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:45"/>
were <hi>all to take these Oaths</hi> by a six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed day, and those that did not, to abandon their Colledge and the University too, within 24 hours after the beating of a Drum; for if they remain'd longer, they were to be proceeded against as Spies.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Laud</hi> then Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and many others, had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly murthered by this wicked Parliament, but the King yet was not; and the University had yet some faint hopes that in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then in being, or pretended to be suddenly, there might be such an Agreement made between King and Parliament, that the dissenters in the University might
<pb facs="tcp:51860:46"/>
both preserve their Consciences and Subsistance which they then enjoyed by their Colledges.</p>
                  <p>And being possess'd of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken hope, That the Parliament were not yet grown so merciless as not to allow manifest reason for their not submitting to the enjoyn'd Oaths, the University appointed twenty Delegates to meet, consider, and draw up a <hi>Manifesto</hi> to the Parliament, why they could not take those Oaths but by violation of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences: And of these Delegates Dr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> (late Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> Dr. <hi>Morley</hi> (now Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Winchester)</hi> and that most
<pb facs="tcp:51860:46"/>
honest, and as judicious Civil Lawyer, Dr. <hi>Zouch,</hi> were a part, the rest I cannot now name; but the whole number of the Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates requested Dr. <hi>Zouch</hi> to draw up the Law part, and give it to Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> and he was requested to methodize and add what referr'd to reason and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and put it into form: He yielded to their desires, and did so. And then after they had been read in a full Convocation, and allow'd of, they were print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Latin,</hi> that the Parliaments proceedings and the Universities sufferings might he manifested to all Nations; and the Imposers of these Oaths might repent, or
<pb facs="tcp:51860:47"/>
answer them: But they were past the first; and for the latter, I might swear they neither can, nor ever will. And these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were also suddenly turn'd into English by <hi>Dr. Sanderson,</hi> that those of these three Kingdoms might the better judge of the Loyal Parties sufferings.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants (who were then grown to be the most powerful part of the Army) had taken the King from a close to a more large im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, and by their own pretences to <hi>liberty of Conscience,</hi> were obliged to allow somewhat of that to the King, who had in the year 1646. sent for <hi>Dr. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson
<pb facs="tcp:51860:47"/>
Dr. Hammond, Dr. Sheldon</hi> (the late Archbishop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>) and <hi>Dr. Morley</hi> (the now Bishop of <hi>Winchester)</hi> to attend him, in order to advise with them, how far he might with a good Conscience comply with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals of the Parliament for a Peace in Church and State; but these having been then denied him by the Presbyterian Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were now allow'd him by those in present power. And as those other Divines, so <hi>Dr. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson</hi> gave his attendance on his Majesty also in the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> preach'd there before him, and had in that attendance many, both publick and private Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
<pb facs="tcp:51860:48"/>
with him, to his Majesties great satisfaction. At which time he desir'd <hi>Dr. Sanderson,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Parliament had propos'd to him the abolishing of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Government in the Church, as inconsistent with Monarchy, that he would consider of it, and declare his judgment: He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to do so, and did it; but it might not be printed till our King's happy Restoration, and then it was. And at <hi>Dr. Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s taking his leave of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in this last attendance on him, the King requested him <hi>to betake himself to the writing Cases of Conscience for the good of Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> To which his answer was,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:48"/>
                     <hi>That he was now grown old, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to write Cases of Conscience.</hi> But the King was so bold with him, as to say, It was the simplest an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer be ever heard from Dr. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson;</hi> for no young man was fit to be a Judge, or write Cases of Conscience. And let me here take occasion to tell the Reader this truth, not commonly known, that in one of these Conferences this conscientious King told Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> or one of them that then waited with him, <hi>That the remembrance of two Erro<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> did much afflict him,</hi> which were, his assent to the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s death, and the abolishing Episcopacy in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and that if God ever
<pb facs="tcp:51860:49"/>
restored him to be in a peaceable possession of his Crown, he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate his Repentance by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Confession and a voluntary Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (<hi>I think barefoot</hi>) from the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> or <hi>Whitehall,</hi> to St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Church, and desire the people to intercede with God for his pardon. I am sure one of them told it me, lives still, and will witness it. And it ought to be observ'd, that Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures <hi>de Juramento</hi> were so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd and valu'd by the King, that in this time of his imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and solitude, he translated them into exact English, desiring Dr. <hi>Iuxson</hi> (then Bishop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>) <hi>Dr. Hammond,</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
<pb facs="tcp:51860:49"/>
Herbert</hi> (who then attended him) to compare them with the Original. The last still lives, and has declared it, with some other of that King's excellencies, in a Letter under his own hand, which was lately shew'd me by Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Dugdale,</hi> King at Arms. The Book was design'd to be put into the King's Library at St <hi>Iames</hi>'s, but I doubt not now to be found there. I thought the honour of the Author and the Translator to be both so much concern'd in this Relation, that it ought not to be conceal'd from the Reader, and 'tis therefore here inserted.</p>
                  <p>I now return to <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> in the Chair in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where they
<pb facs="tcp:51860:50"/>
that comply'd not in taking the <hi>Covenant, Negative Oath,</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Ordinance</hi> for Church Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Worship, were under a sad and daily apprehension of Expulsion; for the Visiters were daily expected, and both City and University full of Souldiers, and a party of Presbyterian Divines, that were as greedy and ready to possess, as the ignorant and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd Visiters were to eject the dissenters out of their Colledges and Livelyhoods: But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> did still continue to read his Lecture, and did to the very faces of those Presbyterian Divines and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, read with so much reason,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:50"/>
and with a calm fortitude make such applications, as if they were not, they ought to have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd, and beg'd pardon of God and him, and forborn to do what follow'd. But these thriving sinners were hardned; and as the Visiters expel'd the Orthodox, they, without scruple or shame, possest themselves of their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; so that with the rest, <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> was (in <hi>Iune</hi> 1648.) forc'd to pack up and be gone, and thank God he was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison'd, as <hi>Dr. Sheldon, Dr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and others then were.</p>
                  <p>I must now again look back to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and tell my Reader, that the year before this expulsion,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:51"/>
when the University had deny'd this Subscription, &amp; apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the danger of that Visitation which followed, they sent <hi>Dr. Morley,</hi> then Canon of <hi>Christ-Church</hi> (now Lord Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi>) and others, to petition the Parliament for recalling the Injunction, or a mitigation of it, or accept of their Reasons why they could not take the Oaths injoyn'd them; and the Petition was by Parliament referr'd to a Committee to hear and report the Reasons to the House, and a day set for hearing them. This done, <hi>Dr. Morley</hi> and the rest went to inform and fee Counsel, to plead their Cause on the day
<pb facs="tcp:51860:51"/>
appointed: but there had been so many committed for pleading, that none durst undertake it; for at this time the Priviledges of that Parliament were become a <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> as sacred and useful to them, as Traditions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were, or are now to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> their number must never be known, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not without danger to be meddled with. For which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>Dr. Morley</hi> was forc'd, for want of Counsel, to plead the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities Reasons for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with the Parliaments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions; and though this was done with great reason, and a boldness equal to the Justice of
<pb facs="tcp:51860:52"/>
his Cause; yet the effect of it was, but that he and the rest appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him were so fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as to return to <hi>Oxford</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commitment. This was some few days before the Visiters and more Soldiers were sent down to drive the Dissenters out of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity. And one that was at this time of <hi>Dr. Morley</hi>'s pleading a powerful man in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of that Committee, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving <hi>Dr. Morley</hi>'s behaviour and reason, and inquiring of him, and hearing a good report of his Morals, was therefore willing to afford him a peculiar favour; and that he might express it, sent for me that relate this Story, and
<pb facs="tcp:51860:52"/>
knew <hi>Dr. Morley</hi> well, and told me, He had such a love for Dr. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> that knowing he would not take the Oaths, and must therefore be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected his Colledge, and leave <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> he desired I would therefore write to him to ride out of <hi>Oxford</hi> when the Visiters came into it, and not return till they left it, and he should be sure then to return in safety; and that he should without taking any Oath or other molestation, enjoy his Canons place in his Colledge. I did receive this intended kindness with a sudden gladness, because I was sure the party had a power, and as sure he meant to perform it, and did therefore write the Doctor word; and his Answer
<pb facs="tcp:51860:53"/>
was, That I must not fail to return my Friend (who still lives) his humble and undissembled thanks, though he could not accept of his intended kindness; for when the Dean, Dr. <hi>Gardner,</hi> Dr. <hi>Paine,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> and all the rest of the Colledge, were turn'd out, except Dr. <hi>Wall,</hi> he should take it to be, if not a sin, yet a shame to be left behind with him only. Dr. <hi>Wall</hi> I knew, and will speak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of him, for he is <hi>dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be easily imagined, with what a joyful willingness these self-loving Reformers took pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of all vacant preferments, and with what reluctance others parted with their beloved Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb facs="tcp:51860:53"/>
and Subsistance: but their Consciences were dearer than their Subsistance, and out they went; the Reformers possessing them without shame or scruple, where I will leave these Scruple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, and make an account of the then present affairs of <hi>London,</hi> to be the next imployment of my Readers patience.</p>
                  <p>And in <hi>London</hi> all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Houses were turn'd to be Prisons, and they fill'd with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that would not take the Covenant, or forbear reading Common Prayer, or that were accus'd for some faults like these. For it may be noted, That about this time the Parliament set out
<pb facs="tcp:51860:54"/>
a Proclamation to incourage all Lay-men that had occasion to complain of their Ministers for being troublesome or scandalous, or that conformed not to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Parliament, to make their complaint to a Committee for that purpose; and the Minister, though 100 miles from <hi>London,</hi> should appear there and give sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, or be sequestred; (and you may be sure no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish could want a covetous, or malicious, or cross-grain'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainant:) by which means all Prisons in <hi>London,</hi> and in some other places, became the sad habitations of Conforming Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:54"/>And about this time the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> having been by an unknown Law condemned to die, and the execution suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for some days, many of the malicious Citizens fearing his pardon, shut up their Shops, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing not to open them till Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice was executed. This malice and madness is scarce credible, but I saw it.</p>
                  <p>The Bishops had been voted out of the House of Parliament, &amp; some upon that occasion sent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> which made many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters rejoyce, and believe Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> (who probably was a a good and well meaning man) to be inspir'd in this Comment on
<pb facs="tcp:51860:55"/>
the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> an Abridgment of which was now printed, and cal'd <hi>Mr.</hi> Brightman<hi>'s Revelation of the Revelation.</hi> And though he was grosly mistaken in other things, yet; because he had made the Churches of <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which had no Bishops, to be <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia</hi> in the <hi>Apocalyps, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel that God loved</hi>; and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Prelacy to be Antichrist, the evil Angel, which the House of Commons had now so spued up, as never to recover their dignity: Therefore did those Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters approve and applaud Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> for discovering and foretelling the Bishops downfall; so that they both rail'd
<pb facs="tcp:51860:55"/>
at them, and rejoyc'd to buy good pennyworths of their Land, which their Friends of the House of Commons, did afford them as a reward of their diligent assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to pull them down.</p>
                  <p>And the Bishops power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now vacated, the common people were made so happy, as every Parish might choose their own Minister, and tell him when he did, and when he did not preach true Doctrine: and by this and like means several Churches had several Teachers, that pray'd and preach'd for and against one another; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd their hearers to contend furiously for truths which they
<pb facs="tcp:51860:56"/>
understood not; some of which I shall mention in the discourse that follows.</p>
                  <p>I have heard of two men that in their discourse undertook to give a character of a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and one concluded he was a very honest man, <hi>for he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him</hi>; and the other that he was not, <hi>for he was not behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to him.</hi> And something like this was in the designs both of the Covenanters and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants (the last of which were now grown both as numerous and as powerful as the former:) for though they differed much in many Principles, and preach'd against each other, one making it
<pb facs="tcp:51860:56"/>
a sign of being in the state of grace, if we were but zealous for the Covenant: and the other, that we ought to buy and sell by a Measure, and to allow the same liberty of Conscience to others, which we by Scripture claim to our selves; and therefore not to force any to swear the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant contrary to their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and loose both their Livings and Liberties too. Though these differed thus in their conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet they both agreed in their practice to preach down <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> and get into the best se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred Livings; and whatever became of the true Owners, their Wives and Children, yet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb facs="tcp:51860:57"/>
in them without the least scruple of Conscience.</p>
                  <p>They also made other strange Observations of <hi>Election, Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Free-will,</hi> and the other Points dependent upon these; such as the wisest of the common people were not fit to judge of: I am sure I am not; though I must mention some of them hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storically in a more proper place, when I have brought my Reader with me to Dr. <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> at <hi>Boothby Pannel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the way thither I must tell him, That a very Covenanter and a Scot too, that came into <hi>England</hi> with this unhappy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, was got into a good se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred
<pb facs="tcp:51860:57"/>
Living by the help of a Presbyterian Parish, which had got the true Owner out. And this Scotch Presbyterian being well settled in this good Living, began to reform the Church-yard, by cutting down a large Ewe Tree, and some other Trees that were an ornament to the place, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often a shelter to the Parishi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners; who excepting against him for so doing, were answered, <hi>That the Trees were his, and 'twas lawful for every man to use his own as he, and not as they thought fit.</hi> I have hear'd (but do not affirm it) That no Action lies against him that is so wicked as to steal the winding sheet of a dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb facs="tcp:51860:58"/>
after 'tis buried; and have heard the reason to be, because none were supposed to be so void of humanity, and that such a Law would vilifie that Nation that would but suppose so vile a man to be born in it: nor would one suppose any man to do what this Covenanter did. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were any Law against, him I know not; but pity the Parish the less for turning out their legal Minister.</p>
                  <p>We have now overtaken Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> at <hi>Boothby</hi> Parish, where he hop'd to have enjoy'd himself, though in a poor, yet in a quiet and desir'd privacy; but it prov'd otherwise: For all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb facs="tcp:51860:58"/>
of the Nation were fill'd with Covenanters, Confusion, Comittee-men and Soldiers, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving each other to their several ends, of revenge, or power, or profit; and these Committee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Soldiers were most of them so possest with this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that they became like those that were infected with that dreadful Plague of <hi>Athens</hi>; the Plague of which Plague was, that they by it became maliciously restless to get into company, and to joy (so the Historian<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Theucidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi>
                     </note> saith) when they had infected others, even those of their most beloved or nearest Friends or Relations; and though there might be some
<pb facs="tcp:51860:59"/>
of these Covenanters that were beguil'd, and meant well; yet such were the generality of them, and temper of the times, that you may be sure Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> who though quiet and harmless, yet an eminent dissenter from them, could not live peaceably; nor did he: For the Soldiers would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and visibly disturb him in the Church when he read Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, pretending to advise him how God was to be serv'd most acceptably: which he not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, but continuing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve order and decent behaviour in reading the Church Service, they forc'd his Book from him, and tore it, expecting extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Prayers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:59"/>At this time he was advis'd by a Parliament man of power and note, that lov'd and valued him much, not to be strict in reading all the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> but make some little variation, especially if the Soldiers came to watch him; for then it might not be in the power of him and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Friends to secure him from taking the Covenant, or Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration: for which Reasons he did vary somewhat from the strict Rules of the Rubrick. I will set down the very words of Confession which he us'd, as I have it under his own hand; and tell the Reader that all his other variations were as little, &amp; much like to this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:60"/>His Confession.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>O Almighty God and merciful Father, we thy unworthy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants do with shame and sorrow confess, that we have all our life long gone astray out of thy ways like lost sheep; and that by following too much the vain devices and desires of our own hearts, we have grievously offended against thy holy Laws both in thought, word and deed; we have many times left undone those good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which we might and ought to have done; and we have many times done those evils, when we might have avoided them, which we ought not to have done. We confess, O Lord, that there is no health at all, nor help in any Creature to relieve us; but all
<pb facs="tcp:51860:60"/>
our hope is in thy mercy, whose ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice we have by our sins so far pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked: Have mercy therefore upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us miserable offenders: spare us good God, who confess our faults, that we perish not; but according to thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promises declared unto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in Christ Iesus our Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store us upon our true Repentance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy grace and favour. And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake, that we henceforth study to serve and please thee by leading a godly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and a sober life, to the glory of thy holy Name, and the eternal comfort of our own souls, through Iesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:61"/>In these disturbances of tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Service Book, a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour came on a Sunday, after the Evening Service was ended, to visit and condole with him for the affront offered by the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. To whom he spake with a composed patience, and said; <hi>God hath restored me to my desir'd privacy, with my wife and children, where I hop'd to have met with quietness, and it proves not so; but I will labour to be pleas'd, because God, on whom I depend, sees 'tis not fit for me to be quiet. I praise him, that he hath by his grace prevented me from making shipwrack of a good Conscience to maintain me in a place of great reputation and profit: and
<pb facs="tcp:51860:61"/>
though my condition be such, that I need the last; yet I submit, for God did not send me into this world to do my own, but suffer his will, and I will obey it.</hi> Thus by a sublime depending on his wise, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and pitiful Creator, he did chearfully submit to what God had appointed, justifying the truth of that Doctrine which he had preach'd.</p>
                  <p>About this time that excellent Book of the <hi>King's Meditations in his Solitude</hi> was printed, and made publick: and Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> was such a lover of the Author, and so desirous that the whole world should see the character of him in that Book, and something of
<pb facs="tcp:51860:62"/>
the cause for which they suffer'd, that he design'd to turn it into Latin: but when he had done half of it most excellently, his Friend Dr. <hi>Earle</hi> prevented him, by appearing to have done the whole very well before him.</p>
                  <p>About this time his dear and most intimate Friend, the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> came to enjoy a conversation and rest with him for some days, and did so. And having formerly perswaded him to trust his excellent memory, and not read, but try to speak a Sermon as he had writ it. Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> became so complyant as to promise he would. And to that end they two went early the
<pb facs="tcp:51860:62"/>
Sunday following to a Neighbour Minister, and requested to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change a Sermon; and they did so. And at Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Pulpit, he gave his Sermon (which was a very short one) into the hand of Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> intending to preach it as 'twas writ; but before he had preach'd a third part, Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> (looking on his Sermon as written) observed him to be out, and so lost as to the matter, that he also became afraid for him; for 'twas discernable to many of the plain Auditory: But when he had ended this short Sermon, as they two walk'd homeward, Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> said with much
<pb facs="tcp:51860:63"/>
earnestness, <hi>Good Doctor give me my Sermon, and know, that neither you, nor any man living shall ever perswade me to preach again without my Books.</hi> To which the reply was, <hi>Good Doctor be not angry; for if I ever perswade you to preach again without Book, I will give you leave to burn all those that I am Master of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Part of the occasion of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s visit was at this time, to discourse Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> about some Opinions, in which, if they did not then, they had doubtless differed formerly; 'twas about those knotty Points, which are by the Learned call'd the <hi>Quinquar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Controversie</hi>; of which I
<pb facs="tcp:51860:63"/>
shall proceed, not to give any Judgment (I pretend not to that) but some short Historical account which shall follow.</p>
                  <p>There had been, since the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Covenant was brought, and so generally taken in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a liberty given or taken by many Preachers (those of <hi>London</hi> especially) to preach and be too positive in the Points of <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Redemption, Predestination,</hi> and those other depending upon these. Some of which preach'd, <hi>That all men were, before they came into this world, so predestinated to salvation or damnation, that 'twas not in their power to sin so, as to lose the first, nor by their most diligent
<pb facs="tcp:51860:64"/>
endeavour to avoid the latter.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>That 'twas not so; because then God could not be said to grieve for the death of a sinner, when he himself had made him so by an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable decree, before he had so much as a being in this world</hi>; affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore, <hi>that man had some power left him to do the will of God, because he was advised to work out his salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi>; maintaining, <hi>that 'tis most certain, every man can do what he can to be saved</hi>; and that <hi>he that does what he can to be saved, shall never be damned:</hi> And yet many that affirmed this, would confess, <hi>That that grace, which is but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive offer, and left to us to receive
<pb facs="tcp:51860:64"/>
or refuse, is not that grace which shall bring men to heaven.</hi> Which truths, or untruths, or both, be they which they will, did upon these or the like occasions come to be searched into, and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly debated betwixt Dr. <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> (the now Reverend Dean of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi>) of which I shall proceed to give some account, but briefly.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1648. the 52 <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Ministers (then a Fraternity of <hi>Ston Colledge</hi> in that City) had in a printed Declaration aspers'd Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> most heinously, for that he had in his <hi>Practical Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism</hi> affirm'd, <hi>That our Saviour died for the sins of all mankind.</hi> To
<pb facs="tcp:51860:65"/>
jnstifie which truth, he presently makes a charitable Reply (as 'tis now printed in his Works.) After which there were many Letters past betwixt the said <hi>Dr. Hammond, Dr. Sanderson,</hi> and <hi>Dr. Pierce,</hi> concerning God's grace and decrees. <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> was with much unwillingness drawn into this Debate; for he declared it would prove uneasie to him, who in his judgment of God's decrees differ'd with <hi>Dr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> (whom he reverenced and loved dearly) and would not therefore ingage him into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, of which he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hope to see an end: but they did all enter into a charitable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition
<pb facs="tcp:51860:65"/>
of these said Points in several Letters, to the full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Learned; those betwixt <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> and <hi>Dr. Hammond</hi> being printed in his Works; and for what past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and the Learned <hi>Dr. Pierce,</hi> I refer my Reader to a Letter annext to the end of this Relation.</p>
                  <p>I think the Judgment of <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> was by these Debates altered from what it was at his entrance into them; for in the year 1632. when his excellent Sermons were first printed in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. the Reader may on the Margent find some accusation of <hi>Arminius</hi> for false Doctrine; and find, that
<pb facs="tcp:51860:66"/>
upon a review and reprinting those Sermons in folio in the year 1657. that accusation of <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> is omitted. And the change of his judgment seems more fully to appear in his said Letter to <hi>Dr. Pierce.</hi> And let me now tell the Reader, which may seem to be perplex'd with these several affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of God's decrees before mentioned, that <hi>Dr. Hammond,</hi> in a Postscript to the last Letter of <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi>'s, says, <hi>God can reconcile his own contradictions, and therefore advises all men, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle does, to study mortification, and be wise to sobriety.</hi> And let me add further, that if these 52 Ministers of <hi>Sion Colledge</hi> were the occasion
<pb facs="tcp:51860:66"/>
of the Debates in these Letters; they have, I think, been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of giving an end to the <hi>Quinquarticular Controversie,</hi> for none have since undertaken to say more; but seem to be so wise, as to be content to be ignorant of the rest, till they come to that place, where the secrets of all hearts shall be laid open. And let me here tell the Reader also, that if the rest of mankind would, as <hi>Dr. Sanderson,</hi> not conceal their alteration of Judgment, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it to the honour of God and themselves, then our Nation would become freer from perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious Disputes, and fuller of Recantations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:67"/>I cannot lead my Reader to <hi>Dr. Hammond</hi> and <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> where we left them at <hi>Boothby Pannel,</hi> till I have look'd back to the long Parliament, the Society of Covenanters in <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi> and those others scattered up and down in <hi>London,</hi> and given some account of their proceedings and usage of the late learned <hi>Dr. Laud,</hi> then Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And though I will forbear to mention the injustice of his death, and the barbarous usage of him, both then and before it; yet my desire is, that what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows may be noted, because it does now, or may hereafter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us, namely, That in his last
<pb facs="tcp:51860:67"/>
sad Sermon on the Scaffold at his death, he having freely pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his Enemies, and humbly begg'd of God to Pardon them, and besought those present to pardon and pray for him; yet he seem'd to accuse the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of the City, for suffering a sort of wretched people, that could not known why he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, to go visibly up and down to gather hands to a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>That the Parliament would hasten his Execution.</hi> And having declar'd how unjustly he thought himself to be condemned, and accus'd for endeavouring to bring in <hi>Popery</hi> (for that was one of the Accusations for which he
<pb facs="tcp:51860:68"/>
died) he declar'd with sadness, That the several Sects and Divisions then in <hi>England</hi> (which he had laboured to prevent) were like to bring the Pope a far greater harvest, than he could ever have expected without them. And said, <hi>these Sects and Divisions introduce prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness under the cloak of an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Religion</hi>; and <hi>that we have lost the substance of Religion by changing it into Opinion</hi>; and <hi>that by these means this Church, which all the Iesuits machinations could not ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, was fall'n into apparent danger by those which were his Accusers.</hi> To this purpose he spoke at his death: for this, &amp; more of which, the Reader may view his last sad
<pb facs="tcp:51860:68"/>
Sermon on the Scaffold. And 'tis here mentioned, because his dear Friend Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> seems to demonstrate the same in his two large and remarkable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces before his two Volumes of Sermons; and seems also with much sorrow to say the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in his last Will, made when he apprehended himself to be very near his death. And these Covenanters ought to take notice of it, and to remember, that by the late wicked War began by them, <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> was ejected out of the Professors Chair in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>; and that if he had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in it (for he lived 14 years after) both the Learned of this
<pb facs="tcp:51860:69"/>
and other Nations, had been made happy by many remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Cases of Conscience,</hi> so ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally stated, and so briefly, so clearly, and so convincingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, that Posterity might have joyed and boasted, that <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> was born in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the ease and benefit of all the Learned that shall be born after him: But this benefit is so like <hi>time past,</hi> that they are both irrecoverably lost.</p>
                  <p>I should now return to <hi>Booth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Pannel</hi> where we left Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> and <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> together, but neither can be found there. For the first was in his Journey to <hi>London,</hi> and the second seiz'd
<pb facs="tcp:51860:69"/>
upon the day after his Friends departure, and carried Prisoner to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> then a Garison of the Parliaments. For the pretended reason of which Commitment, I shall give this following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>There was one Mr. <hi>Clarke,</hi> the Minister of <hi>Alington,</hi> a Town not many miles from <hi>Boothby Pannel,</hi> who was an active man for the Parliament and Covenant; one that, when <hi>Belvoire Castle</hi> (then a Garison for the Parliament) was taken by a party of the King's Soldiers, was taken in it, &amp; made a Prisoner of War in <hi>Newark,</hi> then a Garison of the Kings; a man so active and useful for his
<pb facs="tcp:51860:70"/>
party, that they became so much concern'd for his inlargement, that the Committee of <hi>Lincoln</hi> sent a Troop of Horse to seize and bring <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> a Prisoner to that Garison; and they did so. And there he had the happiness to meet with many, that knew him so well as to treat him kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but told him, He must conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their Prisoner, till he should pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase his own inlargement by procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an Exchange for Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> then Prisoner in the King's Garison of <hi>Newark.</hi> There were many Reasons given by the Doctor of the Injustice of his Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Inequality of the Exchange, but all were unef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual:
<pb facs="tcp:51860:70"/>
For done it must be, or he continue a Prisoner. And in time done it was upon the following Conditions.</p>
                  <p>First, that Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> and Mr. <hi>Clarke</hi> being Exchanged, should live undisturb'd at their own Parishes; and of either were injur'd by the Soldiers of the contrary party, the other having notice of it, should procure him a Redress, by having satisfaction made for his loss, or for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther injury; or if not, he to be us'd in the same kind by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party. Nevertheless, <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> could neither live safe, nor quietly, being several times plundered, and once wounded in
<pb facs="tcp:51860:71"/>
three places; but he, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the remedy might turn to a more intolerable burthen by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience or complying, forbore both; and possess'd his Soul in a contented quietness, without the least repining. But though he could not enjoy the safety he expected by this Exchange, yet by his Providence that can bring good out of evil, it turn'd so much to his advantage, that whereas his Living had been sequestred from the year 1644. and continued to be so till this time of his Imprisonment, he, by the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>War</hi> in this Exchange for Mr. <hi>Clarke,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd his Sequestration to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:71"/>
and by that means injoy'd a poor but contented subsistence for himself, wife, and children, till the happy Restoration of our King and Church.</p>
                  <p>In this time of his poor, but contented privacy of life, his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suistical learning, peaceful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and sincerity, became so remarkable, that there were many that apply'd themselves to him for Resolution in Cases of Conscience; some known to him, many not; some requiring satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by Conference, others by Letters; so many, that his life became almost as restless as their minds; yet he denied no man: And if it be a truth which <hi>holy</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:72"/>
Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> says, <hi>That all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joys seem less, when compared with shewing mercy or doing kindnesses</hi>; then doubtless Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> might have boasted for relieving so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny restless and wounded Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; which, as <hi>Solomon</hi> says, <hi>are a burthen that none can bear,</hi> though their fortitude may su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain their other Infirmities: and if words cannot express the joy of a Conscience relieved from such restless Agonies; then <hi>Dr. Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> might rejoyce, that so many were by him so clearly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously satisfied; for he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied none, and would often praise God for that ability, and as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for the occasion, and that
<pb facs="tcp:51860:72"/>
God had inclin'd his heart to do it, to the meanest of any of those poor, but precious Souls, for which his Saviour vouchsafed to be crucified.</p>
                  <p>Some of those very many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that were resolved by Letters, have been preserv'd and printed for the benefit of Posterity; as namely,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Of the Sabbath.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Marrying with a Recusant.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>Of unlawful Love.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. <hi>Of a Military life.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>5. <hi>Of Scandal.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>6. <hi>Of a Bond taken in the King's Name.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>7. <hi>Of the Ingagement.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>8. <hi>Of a rash Vow.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:73"/>
But many more remain in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate hands, of which one is of <hi>Symony</hi>; and I wish the World might see it, that it might unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive some Patrons, who think they have discharg'd that great and dangerous trust, both to God and man, if they take no money for a Living, though it may be parted with for other ends less justifiable.</p>
                  <p>And in this time of his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the common people were amaz'd &amp; grown giddy by the many falshoods and misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of Truths frequently vented in Sermons; when they wrested the Scripture by chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging God to be of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:73"/>
and call'd upon him in their prayers to patronize their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; zealous Frenzies, in this time he did so compassionate the generality of this misled Nation, that though the times threatned danger, yet he then hazarded his safety by writing the large and bold Preface now extant before his last 20 Sermons (first printed in the year 1655.) In which there was such strength of reason, with so powerful and clear convincing applications made to the Non-conformists, as being read by one of those dissenting Brethren, who was possess'd with such a spirit of contradiction, as being neither able to defend his error, nor yield
<pb facs="tcp:51860:74"/>
to truth manifest (his Conscience having slept long and quietly in a good sequestred Living) was yet at the reading of it so awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, that after a conflict with the reason he had met, and the dammage he was to sustain if he consented to it (and being still unwilling to be so convinced, as to lose by being over-reason'd) he went in haste to the Bookseller of whom 'twas bought, threatned him, and told him in anger, <hi>he had sold a Book in which there was false Divinity; and that the Preface had upbraided the Parliament, and many godly Ministers of that party for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just dealing.</hi> To which his Reply was ('twas <hi>Tim. Garthwaite) That
<pb facs="tcp:51860:74"/>'twas not his Trade to judge of true or false Divinity, but to print and sell Books; and yet if he, or any friend of his would write an Answer to it, and own it by setting his Name to it, he would print the Answer, and promote the selling of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the time of his printing this excellent Preface, I met him accidentally in <hi>London</hi> in sad-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured clothes, and God knows, far from being costly: the place of our meeting was near to <hi>little Britain,</hi> where he had been to buy a Book, which he then had in his hand; we had no inclination to part presently; and therefore turn'd to stand in a corner under a Penthouse (for it began to rain)
<pb facs="tcp:51860:75"/>
and immediately the wind rose, and the rain increased so much, that both became so inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as to force us into a cleanly house, where we had <hi>Bread, Cheese, Ale,</hi> &amp; a <hi>Fire</hi> for our money. This rain and wind were so obliging to me, as to force our stay there for at least an hour, to my great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and advantage; for in that time he made to me many useful observations with much clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and conscientious freedom. I shall relate a part of them, in hope they may also turn to the advantage of my Reader. He seem'd to lament, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had taken upon them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish our Liturgy, to the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
<pb facs="tcp:51860:75"/>
of so many devout and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, and the disgrace of those many Martyrs, who had seal'd the truth and use of it with their blood: and that no Minister was now thought godly that did not decry it; and, at least, pretend to make better Prayers <hi>ex tempore:</hi> and that they, and only they that could do so, prayed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and were godly; though in their Sermons they disputed, and evidently contradicted each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their Prayers. And as he did dislike this, so he did most highly commend the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> of the Church, saying, The Collects were the most passionate, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and most elegant expressions
<pb facs="tcp:51860:76"/>
that any language ever afforded; and that there was in them such <hi>pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and that so interwoven with <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,</hi> that they taught us to know the power, the wisdom, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and mercy of God, and much of our duty both to him and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and that a Congregation beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hemselves reverently, &amp; putting up to God these joynt and known de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires for pardon of sins, and praises for mercies receiv'd, could not but be more pleasing to God, than those raw unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated expressions, to which many of the hearers could not say <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he then commended to me the frequent use of the <hi>Psalter</hi> or <hi>Psalms of David</hi>; speaking to this purpose, <hi>That they were the
<pb facs="tcp:51860:76"/>
Treasury of Christian Comfort, fitted for all persons and all necessities; able to raise the soul from dejection by the frequent mention of God's mercies to repentant sinners; to stir up holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; to increase joy; to moderate sorrow; to nourish hope, and teach us patience, by waiting God's leasure; to beget a trust in the mercy, power, &amp; providence of our Creator; &amp; to cause a resignation of our selves to his will; &amp; then (and not till then) to believe our selves happy.</hi> This he said the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Psalms</hi> taught us; and that by the frequent use of the last they would not only prove to be our souls comfort, but would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so habitual, as to transform them into the image of his soul
<pb facs="tcp:51860:77"/>
that composed them. After this manner he express'd himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Liturgy &amp; Psalms; &amp; seem'd to lament that this, which was the Devotion of the more Primitive times, should in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pulpits be turn'd into need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less debates about <hi>Free-will, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> of which, and many like Questions, we may be safely ignorant, because Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God intends not to lead us to Heaven by hard Questions, but by meekness and charity, and a frequent practice of Devotion.</p>
                  <p>And he seem'd to lament very much, that by the means of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and indiscreet preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the generality of the Nation
<pb facs="tcp:51860:77"/>
were possess'd with such danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mistakes, as to think, <hi>They might be religious first, and then just and merciful; that they might sell their Consciences, and yet have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left that was worth keeping; that they might be sure they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, though their lives were visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly scandalous; that to be cunning was to be wise; that to be rich was to be happy, though their wealth was got without justice or mercy; that to be busie in things they understood not, was no sin.</hi> These, and the like mistakes he lamented much, and besought God to remove them, and restore us to that humility, sincerity, and singleheartedness, with which this Nation was blest,

before the unhappy Covenant was brought into the Nation, and every man preach'd and pray'd what seem'd best in his own eyes. And he then said to me, That the way to restore this Nation to a more meek and Christian temper, was to have the Body of Divinity (or so much of it as was needful to be known) to be put into <hi>52 Homilies</hi> or <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> of such a length as not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a third or fourth part of an hours reading; and these needful Points to be made so clear and plain, that those of a mean capacity might know what was necessary to be believed, and what God requires to be done; and then some applications of trial and conviction: and these to be read
<pb facs="tcp:51860:78"/>
every <hi>Sunday</hi> of the year, as infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as the blood circulates the body; and then as certainly begun again, and continued the year following: and that this being done, it might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably abate the inordinate desire of knowing what we need not, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising what we know, and ought to do. This was the earnest desire of this prudent man. And, O that Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it! for then in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity it would have prov'd effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</p>
                  <p>At this happy time of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying his company and this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, he express'd a sorrow by saying to me, O that I had gone Chaplain to that excellently accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd
<pb facs="tcp:51860:79"/>
Gentleman, your Friend, Sir <hi>Henry Wootton</hi>! which was once intended, when he first went Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador to the State of <hi>Venice:</hi> for by that imployment I had been forc'd into a necessity of conversing, not with him only, but with several men of several Nations; and might thereby have kept my self from my unmanly bashfulness, which has prov'd very troublesome, and not less inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to me; and which I now fear is become so habitual as never to leave me: and by that means I might also have known, or at least have had the satisfaction of seeing one of the late miracles of general learning, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and modesty, Sir <hi>Henry Woottons</hi> dear Friend, <hi>Padre
<pb facs="tcp:51860:79"/>
Paulo,</hi> who, the Author of his life says, was <hi>born with a bashfulness as invincible, as I have found my own to be:</hi> A man whose fame must never die, till vertue and learning shall become so useless as not to be regarded.</p>
                  <p>This was a part of the benefit I then had by that hours conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation: and I gladly remember and mention it, as an Argument of my happiness, and his great humility and condescention. I had also a like advantage by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther happy conference with him, which I am desirous to impart in this place to the Reader. He la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented much, that in many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, where the maintenance was
<pb facs="tcp:51860:80"/>
not great, there was no Minister to officiate; and that many of the best sequestred Livings were possess'd with such rigid Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters as denied the Sacrament to their Parishioners, unless upon such conditions, and in such a manner as they could not take it. This he mentioned with much sorrow, saying, The blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did, by way of preparation for it, give occasion to all conscientious Receivers to examine the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their Vows, since they received their last seal for the pardon of their sins past; and to examine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>search their hearts, and make peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent reflexions on their failings; and that done, to bewail them, and then
<pb facs="tcp:51860:80"/>
make new vows or resolutions to obey all God's Commands, and beg his grace to perform them. And this done,the <hi>Sacrament</hi> repairs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays of grace, helps us to conquer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, gives us grace to beg God's grace, and then gives us what we beg; makes us still hunger and thirst after his righteousness, which we then receive, and being assisted with our endeavours, will still so dwell in us, as to become our satisfaction in this life, and our comfort on our last Sick-beds. The want of this blessed benefit he lamented much, and pitied their condition that desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but could not obtain it.</p>
                  <p>I hope I shall not disoblige my Reader, if I here inlarge into
<pb facs="tcp:51860:81"/>
a further Character of his person and temper. As first, That he was moderately tall; his behaviour had in it much of a plain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and very little (yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) of ceremony or court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; his looks and motion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested affability and mildness, and yet he had with these a calm, but so matchless a fortitude, as secur'd him from complying with any of those many Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment injunctions, that interfer'd with a doubtful conscience. His Learning was methodical and exact; his wisdome useful; his integrity visible; and his whole life so unspotted, that all ought to be preserved as Copies for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
<pb facs="tcp:51860:81"/>
to write after; the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy especially, who with impure hands ought not to offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to that God, whose pure eyes abhorr iniquity.</p>
                  <p>There was in his Sermons no improper Rhetorick, nor such perplex'd divisions, as may be said to be like too much light, that so dazles the eyes that the sight becomes less perfect: But there was therein no want of use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful matter, nor waste of words; and yet such clear distinctions as dispel'd all confus'd Notions, and made his hearers depart both wiser, and more confirm'd in vertuous resolutions.</p>
                  <p>His memory was so matchless
<pb facs="tcp:51860:82"/>
and firm, as 'twas only overcome by his bashfulness; for he alone, or to a friend, could repeat all the <hi>Odes of Horace,</hi> all <hi>Tully's Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and much of <hi>Iuvenal</hi> and <hi>Persius</hi> without Book; and would say, The repetition of one of the <hi>Odes</hi> of <hi>Horace</hi> to himself was to him such musick, as a Lesson on the <hi>Viol</hi> was to others, when they play'd it to themselves or friends. And though he was blest with a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Judgment than other men; yet he was so distrustful of it, that he did over-consider of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and would so delay and reconsider what to determine, that though none ever determin'd better, yet, when the Bell toll'd
<pb facs="tcp:51860:82"/>
for him to appear and read his Divinity Lectures in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and all the Scholars attended to hear him, he had not then, or not till then, resolv'd and writ what he meant to determine; so that that appear'd to be a truth, which his old dear Friend Dr. <hi>Sheldon</hi> would often say, namely, <hi>That his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was so much superiour to his phancy, that whatsoever this suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that dislik'd and controul'd; still considering and reconsidering, till his time was so wasted, that he was forc'd to write, not (probably) what was best, but what he thought last.</hi> And yet what he did then read, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to all hearers to be so useful, clear, and satisfactory, as
<pb facs="tcp:51860:83"/>
none ever determin'd with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er applause. These tiring and perplexing thoughts begot in him an aversness to enter into the toyl of considering and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining all Casuistical Points; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause during that time, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave rest to his body or mind. But though he would not be always loden with these knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Points and Distinctions; yet the study of old <hi>Records, Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi> and <hi>Heraldry,</hi> were a recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so pleasing, that he would say they gave rest to his mind. Of the last of which I have seen two remarkable Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes; and the Reader needs neither to doubt their truth or exactness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:83"/>And this humble man had so conquer'd all repining and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious thoughts, and with them all other unruly passions, that, if the accidents of the day prov'd to his danger or dammage, yet he both began and ended it with an even and undisturbed quietness: always praising God that he had not withdrawn food and raiment from him and his poor Family; nor suffered him to violate his Conscience for his safety, or to support himself or them in a more splendid or plentiful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and that he therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd with <hi>David, That his praise should be always in his mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have taken a content in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:51860:84"/>
my Reader this Character of his person, his temper, and some of the accidents of his life past; and more might be added of all: But I will with sorrow look forward to the sad days, in which so many good men suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, about the year 1658. at which time Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> was in a very low condition as to his Estate: And in that time Mr. <hi>Robert Boyle</hi> (a Gentleman of a very Noble Birth, and more eminent for his Liberality, Learning, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and of whom I would say much more, but that he still lives) having casually met with, and read his Lectures <hi>de Iuramento,</hi> to his great satisfaction, and being
<pb facs="tcp:51860:84"/>
informed of Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s great innocence and sincerity, and that he and his Family were brought into a low condition by his not complying with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments injunctions, sent him by his dear Friend Dr. <hi>Barlow</hi> (the now learned Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>) 50 <hi>l.</hi> and with it a request and promise: The request was, That he would review the Lectures <hi>de Conscientia,</hi> which he had read when he was Doctor of the Chair in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and print them for the good of Posterity; (and this Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> did in the year 1659.) And the Promise was, That he would pay him that, or a greater sum if desir'd, during his Life, to
<pb facs="tcp:51860:85"/>
inable him to pay an <hi>Amanuensis,</hi> to ease him from the trouble of writing what he should conceive or dictate. For the more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of which, I refer my Reader to a Letter writ by the said Dr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> which I have annexed to the end of this Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Towards the end of this year 1659. when the many mixt Sects, and their Creators and merciless Protectors, had led or driven each other into a Whirl-pool of Confusion: when amazement and fear had seiz'd them, and their accusing Consciences gave them an inward and fearful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that the God which
<pb facs="tcp:51860:85"/>
they had long serv'd, was now ready to pay them such wages as he does always reward <hi>Witches</hi> with for their obeying him: When these wretches were come to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see an end of their cruel reign, by our King's return; and such Sufferers as <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> (and with him many of the oppressed Clergy and others) could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see the cloud of their afflictions would be dispers'd by it: Then, in the beginning of the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the King was by God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to us, and we to our known Laws and Liberties; and a general joy and peace seem'd to breath through the 3 Nations. Then were the suffering Clergy
<pb facs="tcp:51860:86"/>
freed from their Sequestration, restor'd to their Revenues, and to a liberty to adore, praise, and pray to God in such order as their Consciences and Oaths had formerly obliged them. And the Reader will easily believe that <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> and his dejected Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily rejoyc'd to see this day, and be of this number.</p>
                  <p>It ought to be considered (which I have often heard or read) that in the Primitive times men of learning and vertue were usually sought for, and sollicited to accept of <hi>Episcopal Government,</hi> and often refus'd it. For they conscientiously considered, that the Office of a Bishop was made
<pb facs="tcp:51860:86"/>
up of labour and care: that they were trusted to be God's Almon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Churches Revenue, and double their care for the poor: to live strictly themselves, and use all diligence to see that their Familie, Officers, and Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy did so: and that the account of that Stewardship must at the last dreadful day be made to the Searcher of all hearts: and that in the primitive times they were therefore timorous to undertake it. It may not be said that <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> was accomplish'd with these, and all the other requisites requir'd in a Bishop, so as to be able to answer them exactly; but it may be affirm'd, as a good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:87"/>
that he had at the Age of 73 years (for he was so old at the King's return) fewer faults to be pardon'd by God or man, than are apparent in others in these days, in which (God knows) we fall so short of that visible sanctity and zeal to God's glory, which was apparent in the days of primitive Christianity. This is mentioned by way of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what I shall say more of <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi>; and namely, That at the King's return <hi>Dr. Sheldon,</hi> the late prudent Bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> (than whom none knew, valued, or lov'd <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> more or better) was by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty made a chief Trustee to
<pb facs="tcp:51860:87"/>
commend to him fit men to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the then vacant Bishopricks. And <hi>Dr. Sheldon</hi> knew none fitter than <hi>Dr. Sanderson,</hi> and therefore humbly desired the King that he would nominate him: and that done, he did as humbly desire <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> that he would for Gods and the Churches sake, take that charge and care upon him. <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> had, if not an unwillingness, certainly no forwardness to undertake it, and would often say, <hi>He had not led himself, but his Friend would now lead him into a temptation, which he had daily pray'd against; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought God, if he did undertake it, so to assist him with his grace, that
<pb facs="tcp:51860:88"/>
the example of his life, his cares and endeavours, might promote his glory, and help forward the salvation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I have mentioned as a happy preparation to his Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, and am next to tell that he was consecrated Bishop of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln</hi> at <hi>Westminster</hi> the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctober,</hi> 1660.</p>
                  <p>There was about this time a Christian care taken, that those whose Consciences were (as they said) tender, and could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Service and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church, might have satisfaction given by a friendly debate betwixt a select number of them, and some like
<pb facs="tcp:51860:88"/>
number of those that had been Sufferers for the <hi>Church Service</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and now restor'd to liberty; of which last some were then preferr'd to power and dignity in the Church. And of these Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi> was one, and then chose to be a Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in that debate: and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd his trust with much mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, patience, and reason, but all prov'd uneffectual: For there be some propositions like jealousies, which (though causless, yet) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be remov'd by reasons as apparent as demonstration can make any truth. The place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for this debate was the <hi>Savoy</hi> in the <hi>Strand</hi>: and the
<pb facs="tcp:51860:89"/>
Points debated were, I think, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; some affirmed to be truth and reason, some denied to be either; and these debates being then in words, proved to be so loose and perplex'd, as satisfied neither party. For sometime that which had been affirmed was immediately forgot or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, and so no satisfaction gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to either party. But that the debate might become more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it was therefore resolv'd that the day following the desires and reasons of the <hi>Non-conformists</hi> should be given in writing, and they in writing receive Answers from the conforming party. And though I neither now can, nor
<pb facs="tcp:51860:89"/>
need to mention all the Points debated, nor the names of the dissenting Brethren: yet I am sure Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was one, and am sure what shall now follow, was one of the Points debated.</p>
                  <p>Concerning a Command of lawful Superiours, what was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to its being a lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; this Proposition was brought by the confirming Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>That Command which commands an act in it self lawful, and no other act or circumstance unlawful, is not sinful.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denied it for two Reasons, which he gave in with his own hand in writing thus:
<pb facs="tcp:51860:90"/>
One was, Because that may be a sin <hi>per accidens,</hi> which is not so in it self, and may be unlawfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, though that accident be not in the command. Another was, <hi>That it may be commanded under an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just penalty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, this Proposition being brought by the Conformists, That Command which commandeth an act in it self lawful, and no other act whereby any unjust penalty is injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor any circumstance whence <hi>per accidens</hi> any sin is consequent which the Commander ought to provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, is not sinful.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denied it for this reason then given in with his own hand in writing, thus: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:51860:90"/>
the first act commanded may be <hi>per accidens</hi> unlawful, and be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by an unjust penalty, though no other act or circumstance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded be such.</p>
                  <p>Again, this Proposition being brought by the Conformists, That Command which commandeth an act in it self lawful, and no other Act whereby any unjust penalty is injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor any circumtance whence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or <hi>per accidens</hi> any sin is consequent, which the Commander ought to provide against, hath in it all things requisite to the lawfulness of a Command, and particularly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be guilty of commanding an act <hi>per accidens</hi> unlawful, nor of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding an act under an unjust pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:91"/>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denied it upon the same Reasons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter Gunning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn Pearson.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These were then two of the Disputants, still live, and will attest this; one being now Lord Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and the other of <hi>Chester.</hi> And the last of them told me very lately, that one of the Dissenters (which I could, but forbear to name) appear'd to <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> to be so bold, so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, and so illogical in the dispute, as forc'd <hi>patient Dr. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson</hi> (who was then Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and a Moderator with other Bishops) to say with an unusual earnestness, <hi>That he had
<pb facs="tcp:51860:91"/>
never met with a man of more perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious confidence, and less abilities in all his conversation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though this debate at the <hi>Savoy</hi> was ended without any great satisfaction to either party, yet both parties knew the desires, and understood the abilities of the other much better than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it: and the late distressed Clergy, that were now restor'd to their former rights and power, did at their next meeting in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation contrive to give the dissenting party satisfaction by alteration, explanation, and addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to some part both of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> and <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by adding some new necessary
<pb facs="tcp:51860:92"/>
Collects, and a particular Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Thanksgiving. How many of those new Collects were word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Dr. Sanderson,</hi> I cannot say; but am sure the whole Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion valued him so much, that he never undertook to speak to any Point in question, but he was heard with great willingness and attention; and when any Point in question was determin'd, the Convocation did usually desire him to word their intentions, and as usually approve &amp; thank him.</p>
                  <p>At this Convocation the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer</hi> was made more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, by adding 3 new necessary Offices; which were, A form of Humiliation for the murther of King
<pb facs="tcp:51860:92"/>
                     <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr; a Thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for the Restoration of his Son our King; and for the baptizing of persons of riper age. I cannot say <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi> did form or word them all, but doubtless more than any single man of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he did also, by desire of the Convocation, alter &amp; add to the forms of Prayers to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at Sea (now taken into the <hi>Service Book</hi>) And it may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That <hi>William,</hi> the now right Reverend Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was in these imployments dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently useful, especially in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rectifie the <hi>Kalendar</hi> and <hi>Rubrick.</hi> And lastly it may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That for the satisfying all the
<pb facs="tcp:51860:93"/>
dissenting Brethren and others, the Convocations Reasons for the alterations and additions to the Liturgy, were by them desir'd to be drawn up by <hi>Dr. Sanderson</hi>; which being done by him, and approv'd by them, was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be printed before the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, and may be known by this Title, —<hi>The Preface:</hi> and begins thus— <hi>It hath been the wisdom of the Church —.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I shall now follow him to his Bishoprick, and declare a part of his behaviour in that busie and weighty imployment. And first, That it was with such conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention and obligingness to the meanest of his Clergy, as to know
<pb facs="tcp:51860:93"/>
and be known to them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he practis'd the like to all men of what degree soever, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to his old Neighbours or Parishioners of <hi>Boothby Pannel</hi>; for there was all joy at his Table when they came to visit him: then they pray'd for him, and he for them with an unfeigned affection.</p>
                  <p>I think it will not be deny'd but that the care and toyl requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of a Bishop, may justly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the riches &amp; revenue with which their Predecessors had law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endow'd them; and yet he sought not that so much, as doing good both to the present Age and Posterity; and he made this appear by what follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:94"/>The Bishops chief House at <hi>Buckden,</hi> in the County of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi> the usual Residence of his Predecessors (for it stands about the midst of his Diocese) having been at his Consecration a great part of it demolish'd, and what was left standing under a visible decay, was by him undertaken to be erected and repair'd; and it was perform'd with great speed, care, and charge. And to this may be added, That the King having by an <hi>Injunction</hi> commended to the care of the Bishops, Deans, and Prebends of all Cathedral Churches, <hi>the repair of them, their Houses, and augmentation of small Vicarages</hi>; He, when he was repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:51860:94"/>
                     <hi>Bugden,</hi> did also augment the last, as fast as Fines were paid for renewing Leases: so fast, that a Friend taking notice of his bounty, was so bold as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise him to remember, <hi>he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his first fruits, and that he was old, and had a wife and children yet but meanly provided for, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if his dignity were considered.</hi> To whom he made a mild and thankful answer, saying, It would not become a Christian Bishop to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer those houses built by his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, to be ruin'd for want of repair; and less justifiable to suffer any of those that were call'd to so high a calling as <hi>to sacrifice at God's Altar,</hi> to eat the bread of sorrow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:95"/>
when he had a power by a small augmentation to turn it into the bread of chearfulness: and wish' d, that as this was, so it were also in his power to make all mankind happy, for he desired nothing more. And for his wife and children, he hop'd to leave them a competence; and in the hands of a God, that would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for all that kept innocence, and trusted his providence and protection, which he had always found enough to make and keep him happy.</p>
                  <p>There was in his Diocese a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of almost his Age, that had been of <hi>Lincoln Colledge</hi> when he left it, who visited him often, and always welcome, because he was a man of innocence and open-heartedness:
<pb facs="tcp:51860:95"/>
This Minister ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Bishop what Books he stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died most, when he laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his great and clear Learning? To which his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer was, That he declin'd read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many; but what he did read, were well chosen, and read so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that he became very familiar with them; and said they were chiefly three, <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Rhetorick, Aquinas</hi>'s <hi>Secunda Secundae,</hi> and <hi>Tully,</hi> but chiefly his <hi>Offices,</hi> which he had not read over less than 20 times, and could at this Age say without Book. And told him also, the learned Civilian Doctor <hi>Zouch</hi> (who died lately) had writ <hi>Elementa jurisprudentiae,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:51860:96"/>
was a Book that he could also say without Book; and that no wise man could read it too often, or love, or commend too much; and told him these had been his toyl: But for himself, he always had a natural love to <hi>Genealogies</hi> and <hi>Heraldry</hi>; and that when his thoughts were harassed with any perplext Studies, he left off, and turned to them as a recreation; and that his very recreation had made him so perfect in them, that he could in a very short time give an account of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, Arms, &amp; Antiquity of any Family of the Nobility or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of this Nation.</p>
                  <p>Before I give an account of
<pb facs="tcp:51860:96"/>
Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s last sickness, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to tell the Reader that he was of a healthful constitution, chearful and mild, of an even temper, very moderate in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and had had little sickness, till some few years before his death; but was then every Winter pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with a <hi>Diarrhea,</hi> which left him not till warm weather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd and remov'd it: And this distemper did, as he grew elder, seize him oftner, and continue longer with him. But though it weakned him, yet it made him rather indispos'd than sick, and did no way disable him from studying (indeed too much.) In this decay of his strength, but
<pb facs="tcp:51860:97"/>
not of his memory or reason (for this distemper works not upon the understanding) he made his last Will, of which I shall give some account for confirmation of what hath been said, and what I think convenient to be known, before I declare his death and burial.</p>
                  <p>He did in his last Will give an account of his Faith and Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in point of Religion and Church Government, in these very words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I Robert Sanderson</hi> Dr. of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, an unworthy Minister of Iesus Christ, and by the providence of God Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> being by
<pb facs="tcp:51860:97"/>
the long continuance of an habitual distemper brought to a great bodily weakness and faintness of spirits, but (by the great mercy of God) without any bodily pain otherwise, or decay of understanding, do make this my Will and Testament (written all with my own hand) revoking all former Wills by me heretofore made, if any such shall be found. First, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my Soul into the hands of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, as of a faithful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which I humbly beseech him mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully to accept, looking upon it, not as it is in it self (infinitely polluted with sin) but as it is redeemed and purged with the precious blood of his only beloved Son, and my most sweet Saviour Iesus Christ, in confidence of
<pb facs="tcp:51860:98"/>
whose merits and mediation alone it is, that I cast my self upon the mercy of God for the pardon of my sins, and the hopes of eternal life. And here I do profess, that as I have lived, so I desire, and (by the grace of God) resolve to dye in the Communion of the Catholick Church of Christ, and a true Son of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which, as it stands by Law established, to be both in Doctrine and Worship agreeable to the Word of God, and in the most, and most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Points of both, conformable to the faith and practice of the godly Churches of Christ in the primitive and purer times, I do firmly believe: led so to do, not so much from the force of custom and education (to
<pb facs="tcp:51860:98"/>
which the greatest part of mankind owe their particular different perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in point of Religion) as upon the clear evidence of truth and reason, after a serious and unpartial exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the grounds, as well of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery as Puritanism, according to that measure of understanding, and those opportunities which God hath afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me: and herein I am abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied, that the Schism which the Papists on the one hand, and the Superstition which the Puritan on the other hand, lay to our charge, are very justly chargeable upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves respectively. Wherefore I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseech Almighty God, the Father of Mercies, to preserve the Church by his power and providence, in peace,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:99"/>
truth, and godliness, evermore to the worlds end: which doubtless he will do, if the wickedness and security of a sinful people (and particularly those sins that are so rise, and seem daily to increase among us, of <hi>Unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, Riot,</hi> and <hi>Sacriledge</hi>) do not tempt his patience to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And I also farther humbly beseech him, that it would please him to give unto our gracious Sovereign, the Reverend Bishops, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, timely to consider the great danger that visibly threatens this Church in point of Religion by the late great increase of Popery, and in point of Revenue by sacrilegious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closures; and to provide such whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and effectual remedies as may
<pb facs="tcp:51860:99"/>
prevent the same before it be too late.</p>
                  <p>And for a further manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his humble thoughts and desires, they may appear to the Reader, by another part of his Will which follows.</p>
                  <p>As for my corruptible Body, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath it to the Earth whence it was taken, to be decently buried in the Parish Church of <hi>Bugden,</hi> towards the upper end of the Chancel, upon the second, or (at the farthest) the third day after my decease; and that with as little noise, pomp, and charge as may be, without the invitation of any person how near soever related unto me, other than the Inhabitants of <hi>Bugden;</hi> without the unnecessary expence of Escocheons, Gloves, Ribons,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:100"/>
&amp;c. and without any Blacks to be hung any where in or about the House or Church, other than a Pulpit Cloth, a Hearse Cloth, and a Mourning Gown for the Preacher; whereof the former (after my Body shall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred) to be given to the Preacher of the Funeral Sermon, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Curat of the Parish for the time being. And my will further is, That the Funeral Sermon be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my own Houshold Chaplain, containing some wholesome discourse concerning Mortality, the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dead, and the last Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that he shall have for his pains <hi>5 l.</hi> upon condition, that he speak nothing at all concerning my person, either good or ill, other than I
<pb facs="tcp:51860:100"/>
my self shall direct; only signifying to the Auditory that it was my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press will to have it so. And it is my will, that no costly Monument be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for my memory, but only a fair flot Marble stone to be laid over me, with this Inscription in legible Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Characters, <hi>Depositum Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berti Sanderson nuper Lin<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:51860:101"/>
mind, as being altogether unusual, and not according to the mode of these times; yet it is agreeable to the sense of my heart, and I do very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire my Will may be carefully obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved herein, hoping it may become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary to some or other: at least howsoever testifying at my death (what I have so often and earnestly professed in my life time) my utter dislike of the flatteries commonly used in Funeral Sermons, and of the vast Expences otherwise laid out in Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Solemnities and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with very little benefit to any, which (if bestowed in pious and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable works) might redound to the publick or private benefit of many persons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:101"/>I am next to tell, that he died the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> 1662. and that his Body was buried in <hi>Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> the third day after his death; and for the manner, that 'twas as far from ostentation as he desir'd it; and all the rest of his Will was as punctually performed. And when I have (to his just praise) told this truth, <hi>That he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far from being rich,</hi> I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back to visit, and give a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account of him on his last Sick-bed.</p>
                  <p>His last Will (of which I have mentioned a part) was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three weeks before his death, about which time finding his strength to decay by reason of
<pb facs="tcp:51860:102"/>
his constant infirmity, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptive cough added to it, he retir'd to his Chamber, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a desire to enjoy his last thoughts to himself in private, without disturbance or care, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially of what might concern this world. And that none of his Clergy (which are more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous than any other Bishops) might suffer by his retirement, he did by Commission impower his Chaplain, Mr. <hi>Pullin,</hi> with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal Power to give Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to all Livings or Church Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, during this his disabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to do it himself. In this time of his retirement he long'd for his Dissolution; and when some that
<pb facs="tcp:51860:102"/>
lov'd him pray'd for his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if he at any time found any amendment, he seem'd to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd, by saying, <hi>His Friends said their Prayers backward for him: and that 'twas not his desire to live a useless life, and by filling up a place keep another out of it, that might do God and his Church service.</hi> He would often with much joy and thankfulness mention, <hi>That du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his being a House-keeper (which was more than</hi> 40 <hi>years</hi>) <hi>there had not been one buried out of his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that he was now like to be the first.</hi> He would also often mention with thankfulness, <hi>That till he was threescore years of Age, he had never spent</hi> 5s. <hi>in Law, nor
<pb facs="tcp:51860:103"/>
(upon himself) so much in Wine: and rejoyc'd much that he had so liv'd, as never to cause an hours sorrow to his good Father; and hop'd he should die without an Enemy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He in this retirement had the Church Prayers read in his Chamber twice every day; and at nine at night some Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers read to him and a part of his Family out of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man.</hi> As he was remarkably punctual and regular in all his studies and actions; so he us'd himself to be for his Meals. And his dinner being appointed to be constantly ready at the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Prayers, and he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and calling for it, was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:103"/>
                     <hi>It would be ready in a quarter of an hour.</hi> To which his reply was, <hi>A quarter of an hour? Is a quarter of an hour nothing to a man that probably has not many hours to live.</hi> And though he did live many hours after this, yet he liv'd not many days; for the day after (which was three days before his death) he was become so weak and weary of either motion or sitting, that he was content, or forc'd to keep his bed. In which I desire he may rest, till I have given some account of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour there, and immediately before it.</p>
                  <p>The day before he took his bed (which was three days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:51860:104"/>
his death) he, that he might receive a new assurance for the pardon of his sins past, and be strengthned in his way to the <hi>new Ierusalem,</hi> took the blessed Sacrament of the Body and Blood of his, and our blessed <hi>Iesus,</hi> from the hands of his Chaplain Mr. <hi>Pullin,</hi> accompanied with his Wife, Children, and a Friend, in as awful, humble, and ardent a manner, as outward reverence could express. After the praise and thanksgiving for it was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he spake to this purpose; <hi>Thou, O God, took'st me out of my mothers womb, and hast been the powerful Protector of me to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent moment of my life; thou hast
<pb facs="tcp:51860:104"/>
neither forsaken me now I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come grey-headed, nor suffered me to forsake thee in the late days of temptation, and sacrifice my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for the preservation of my liberty or estate. 'Twas by grace that I have stood, when others have fallen under my trials: and these mercies I now remember with joy and thankfulness; and my hope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is, that I may die praising thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The frequent repetition of the <hi>Psalms of David</hi> hath been noted to be a great part of the Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Primitive Christians: The Psalms having in them not only Prayers and holy Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but such Commemorations of God's Mercies, as may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb facs="tcp:51860:105"/>
comfort, and confirm our dependance on the power, and providence, and mercy of our Creator. And this is mention'd in order to telling, that as the holy Psalmist said,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 147.</note> that <hi>his eyes should prevent both the dawning of the day and the night watches, by meditating on God's word:</hi> so 'twas Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s constant practice every morning to entertain his first waking thoughts with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of those very Psalms, that the Church hath appointed to be constantly read in the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Morning Service; and having at night laid him in his bed, he as constantly clos'd his eyes with a repetition of those appointed
<pb facs="tcp:51860:105"/>
for the Service of the Evening, remembring &amp; repeating the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Psalms appointed for every day; and as the month had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ended and began again, so did this Exercise of his Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if his first waking thoughts were of the World, or what concern'd it, he would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and condemn himself for it. Thus he began that work on earth, which is now his imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in heaven.</p>
                  <p>After his taking his Bed, and about a day before his death, he desir'd his Chaplain, Mr. <hi>Pullin,</hi> to give him Absolution: And at his performing that Office, he pull'd off his Cap, that Mr. <hi>Pullin</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:106"/>
might lay his hand upon his bare head. After this desire of his was satisfied, his Body seem'd to be at more ease, and his mind more chearful; and he said, <hi>Lord, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake me not now my strength faileth me, but continue thy mercy, and let my mouth be filled with thy praise.</hi> He continued the remaining night and day very patient, and thankful for any of the little Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that were perform'd for his ease and refreshment; and during that time, did often say the 103 <hi>Psalm</hi> to himself, and very often these words, <hi>My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed where true joy is to be found.</hi> His thought sseem'd now to be wholly of death,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:106"/>
for which he was so prepar'd, that that <hi>King of Terrors</hi> could not sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise him <hi>as a thief in the night</hi>; for he had often said, <hi>he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd, and long'd for it.</hi> And as this desire seem'd to come from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; so it left him not, till his Soul ascended to that Region of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Spirits, whose Imployments are to joyn in consort with him, and sing <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> to that God, who hath brought them to that place, <hi>into which sin and sorrow cannot enter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus this pattern of <hi>meekness</hi> and primitive <hi>innocence</hi> chang'd this for a better life. 'Tis now too late to wish that my life may be like his; for I am in the eighty
<pb facs="tcp:51860:107"/>
fifth year of my Age; but I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseech Almighty God, that my death may; and do as earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beg of every Reader to say A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>AT my return to this place, I made a yet stricter search after the Letters long ago sent me from our most excellent Dr. <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> before the happy Restoration of the King and Church of <hi>England</hi> to their several Rights; in one of which Letters more especially, he was pleas'd to give me a Narrative both of the rise, and the progress, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons also, as well of his younger, as of his last and riper Judgment, touching the famous Points controverted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Calvinians</hi> and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians,</hi> as they are commonly (though unjustly &amp; unskilfully) mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called on either side.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:109"/>The whole Letter I allude to does consist of several sheets, whereof a good part has been made publick long ago by the most learned, most judicious, most pious Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> (to whom I sent it both for his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and for the publick satisfaction, if he thought fit) in his excellent Book, intituled [A Pacifick Discourse of God's Grace and Decrees, in full accordance with Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>:] To which Discourse I referr you for an account of Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> and the History of his Thoughts in his <hi>own hand-writing,</hi> wherein I sent it to <hi>Westwood,</hi> as I receiv'd it from <hi>Boothby Pannel.</hi> And although the whole Book (printed in the year 1660. and reprinted since with his other Tracts in Folio) is very worthy of your perusal; yet for the Work you are about, you shall not have need to read more at present, than from the 8<hi>th</hi> to the 23<hi>th</hi> page, and as far as the end of §. 33.

a Master of Arts. How his first read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>learned Hooker</hi> had been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by certain <hi>Puritanical Pamphlets</hi>; and how good a <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> he found it for his reading of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s <hi>Institutions,</hi> the <hi>honour of whose name</hi> (at that time especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>gave such credit to his Errors.</hi> How he erred with Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> (whilst he <hi>took things upon trust</hi>) in the <hi>sublapsarian way.</hi> How being chosen to be a Clerk of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Diocese of <hi>Lincol, 1625.</hi> He reduced the <hi>Quinquarticular Controversie</hi> into <hi>five Schemes or Tables</hi>; and thereupon <hi>discerned a necessity of quitting the Sublapsari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an way (of which he had before a better liking) as well as the Supra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsarian, which he could never phancy.</hi> There you will meet with <hi>his two weighty Reasons against them both</hi>; and find his happy <hi>change of Iudgment</hi> to have been ever since the year 1625, even 34 years before the World either <hi>knew,</hi> or (at least) <hi>took notice of it.</hi> And more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly

                     </note>I now proceed to let you know from Dr. <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>'s own hand, which was never printed (and which you can hardly know from any, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less from his Son, or from my self) That, when that Parliament was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, and the Convocation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with dissolved, a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, by occasion of some discourse about these Points, told him of a Book not long before pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished at <hi>Paris</hi> (<hi>A. D.</hi> 1623.) by a <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Arriba.</hi>
                     </note> Spanish Bishop, who had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to clear the Differences in the great Controversie <hi>De Concordiâ Gratiae &amp; Liberi Arbitrij.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Friend perceived he was greedily desirous to see the Book; he sent him one of them, containing the four first Books of twelve which he
<pb facs="tcp:51860:110"/>
intended then to publish. When I had read (says Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> in the following words of the same Letter) his Epistle Dedicatory to the Pope (<hi>Greg. 15.</hi>) he spake so highly of his own Invention, that I then began rather to suspect him for a Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank, than to hope I should find sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from his performances. I found much confidence, and great pomp of words, but little matter as to the main Knot of the Business, other than had been said an hundred times before, to wit, of the coexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of all things past, present, and future <hi>in mente divinâ realiter ab aeterno,</hi> which is the subject of his whole third Book; only he interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the word <hi>realiter</hi> so, as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port not only <hi>praesentialitatem obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivam</hi> (as others held before him) but <hi>propriam &amp; actualem existenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</hi> Yet confesseth 'tis hard to make this intelligible. In his fourth Book he endeavours to declare a twofold manner of God's working <hi>ad extra</hi>; the one <hi>sub ordine Praedestinationis,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:111"/>
of which Eternity is the proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; the other <hi>sub ordine Gratiae,</hi> whereof Time is the measure. And that God worketh <hi>fortiter</hi> in the one (though not <hi>irresistibiliter</hi>) as well as <hi>suaviter</hi> in the other, wherein the Freewill hath his proper working also. From the Result of his whole performance I was confirmed in this Opinion, That we must acknowledge the work of both (Grace and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will) in the conversion of a sinner. And so likewise in all other events, the Consistency of the Infallibility of God's foreknowledge at least (though not with any absolute, but conditional Predestination) with the liberty of man's will, and the contingency of inferiour causes and effects. These, I say, we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge for the <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, I thought it bootless for me to think of comprehending it. And so came the two <hi>Acta Synodalia Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drectana</hi> to stand in my Study, only to fill up a room to this day.</p>
                  <p>And yet see the restless curiosity of
<pb facs="tcp:51860:111"/>
man. Not many years after, to wit <hi>A.D. 1632.</hi> out cometh Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> his <hi>Vindiciae Gratiae</hi>; a large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume purposely writ against <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi> And then notwithstanding my former resolution, I must needs be medling again. The respect I bore to his person and great learning, and the long acquaintance I had had with him in <hi>Oxford,</hi> drew me to the reading of that whole Book. But from the reading of it (for I read it through to a syllable) I went away with many and great dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions. Sundry things in that Book I took notice of, which brought me into a greater dislike of his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion than I had before. But especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally these three: First, that he bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tometh very much of his Discourse upon a very erroneous Principle, which yet he seemeth to be so deeply in love with, that he hath repeated it (I verily believe) some hundreds of times in that work: to wit this, [That whatsoever is first in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is last in execution, and <hi>è

<pb facs="tcp:51860:112"/>
converso.</hi>] Which is an Error of that magnitude, that I cannot but wonder, how a person of such acuteness and subtilty of wit could possibly be deceived with it. All Logicians know, there is no such universal Maxim as he buildeth upon. The true Maxim is but this, <hi>Finis qui primus est in Intentione, est ultimus in Executione.</hi> In the order of final Causes, and the Means used for that end, the Rule holdeth perpetually: But in other things it holdeth not at all, or but by chance; or not as a Rule, and necessarily. Secondly, that, foreseeing such Consequences would naturally and necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from his Opinion, as would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the ear of a sober Christian at the very first sound, he would yet rather choose not only to admit the said harsh Consequences, but profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly indeavour also to maintain them, and plead hard for them in large Digressions, than to recede in the least from that opinion which he had undertaken to defend. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb facs="tcp:51860:112"/>
that seeing (out of the sharpness of his wit) a necessity of forsaking the ordinary Sublapsarian way, and the Supralapsarian too, as it had diversly been declared by all that had gone before him (for the shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of those Rocks, which either of those ways must unavoidably cast him upon) he was forced to seek out an untroden Path, and to frame out of his own brain a new way (like a Spider's web wrought out of her own bowels) hoping by that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to salve all Absurdities could be objected; to wit, by making the glory of God (as it is indeed the chiefest, so) the only end of all other his Decrees, and then making all those other Decrees to be but one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire coordinate Medium conducing to that one end, and so the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to it, but not any one part thereof subordinate to any other of the same. Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> should have done well to have been more sparing in imputing the <hi>studium Partium</hi> to others, wherewith his own eyes
<pb facs="tcp:51860:113"/>
(though of eminent perspicacity) were so strangely blindfolded, that he could not discern, how this his new Device, and his old dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Principle (like the <hi>Cadmean Sparti</hi>) do mutually destroy the one the other.</p>
                  <p>This Relation of my pass'd thoughts having spun out to a far greater length than I intended, I shall give a shorter accompt of what they now are concerning these points.</p>
                  <p>For which account I referr you to the following parts of Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> Book aforesaid, where you may find them already printed. And for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account at large of Bishop <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson</hi>'s last Judgment concerning <hi>God's Concurrence</hi> or <hi>Non-concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> with the <hi>Actions of men,</hi> and <hi>the positive entity of sins of commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> I referr you to his Letters alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy printed by his consent, in my large <hi>Appendix</hi> to my <hi>Impartial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the Nature of Sin.</hi> §.68. <hi>p.</hi> 193. <hi>as far as p.</hi> 200.</p>

                  <head>THE BISHOP OF LINCOLN'S LETTER.</head>
                  <opener>My worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Walton,</hi>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Am heartily glad, that you have undertaken to write the Life of that excellent person, and (both for learning and piety) eminent Prelate, Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> late
<pb facs="tcp:51860:115"/>
Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>; because I know your ability to know, and integrity to write truth: and sure I am, that the life and actions of that pious and learned Prelate will afford you matter enough for his commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the imitation of Posterity. In order to the carrying on your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended good work, you desire my assistance, that I would communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to you such particular passages of his life, as were certainly known to me. I confess I had the happiness to be particularly known to him for about the space of 20 years, and (in <hi>Oxon</hi>) to injoy his conversation, and his learned and pious Instructions while he was <hi>Regius Professor</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vinity there. Afterwards, when (in the time of our late unhappy confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions) he left <hi>Oxon,</hi> and was retir'd into the Countrey , I had the benefit of his Letters; wherein (with great candor and kindness) he answered those doubts I propos'd and gave me that satisfaction, which I neither had, nor expected from some others of
<pb facs="tcp:51860:115"/>
greater confidence, but less judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and humility. Having (in a Letter) named two or three Books writ (<hi>ex professo</hi>) against the being of any original sin; and that <hi>Adam</hi> (by his fall) transmitted some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity only, but no Crime to his Posterity; The good old man was exceedingly troubled, and bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the misery of those licentious times, and seem'd to wonder (save that the times were such) that any should write, or be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to publish any Error so contradictory to truth, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> established (as he truly said) by clear evidence of Scripture, and the just and supreme power of this Nation, both Sacred and Civil. I name not the Books, nor their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, which are not unknown to learned men (and I wish they had never been known) because both <hi>the Doctrine, and the unadvis'd Abettors of it are (and shall be) to me Apocryphal.</hi>

                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:116"/>Another little story I must not pass in silence, being an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s Piety, great Ability and Judgment as a Casuist. Discoursing with an<note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rob. Boyle,</hi> Esq.</note> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Person (whose Piety I value more than his Nobility and Learning, though both be great) about a Case of Conscience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Oaths and Vows, their Nature and Obligation; in which (for some particular Reasons) he then desired more fully to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; I commended to him Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi>'s Book <hi>De Iuramento:</hi> which having read (with great sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction) he as'kd me, if I thought the Doctor could be induced to write Cases of Conscience, if he might have an honorary Pension al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him, to furnish him with Books for that purpose? I told him I believ'd he would: and (in a Letter to the Doctor) told him what great satisfaction that Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Person (and many more) had reaped by reading his Book
<pb facs="tcp:51860:116"/>
                     <hi>De Iuramento</hi>; and ask'd him, whether he would be pleased (for the benefit of the Church) to write some Tract of Cases of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science? He reply'd, That he was glad that any had received any benefit by his Books: and added further, That if any future Tract of his could bring such benefit to any, as we seem'd to say his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer had done, he would willingly (though without any Pension) set about that work. Having receiv'd this Answer, that honourable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (before mention'd) did (by my hands) return 50 <hi>l.</hi> to the good Doctor (whose condition then (as most good mens at that time were) was but low) and he presently revised, finished, and published that excellent Book <hi>De Conscientiâ.</hi> A Book little in bulk; but not so if we consider the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit an intelligent Reader may receive by it. For there are so many general Propositions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conscience, the Nature and
<pb facs="tcp:51860:117"/>
Obligation of it, explained and proved with such firm consequence and evidence of Reason, that he who reads, remembers and can (with prudence) pertinently apply them <hi>Hic &amp; nunc</hi> to particular Cases, may (by their light and help) rationally resolve a thousand particular doubts and scruples of Conscience. Here you may see the charity of that Honourable Person in promoting, and the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Industry of the good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in performing that excellent work.</p>
                  <p>And here I shall add the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that learned and pious Prelate concerning a passage very pertinent to our present purpose. When he was in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and read his publick Lectures in the Schools as <hi>Regius Professor</hi> of Divinity, and by the truth of his Positions, and evidences of his Proofs, gave great content and satisfaction to all his hearers; especially in his clear Resolutions of all difficult Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb facs="tcp:51860:117"/>
which occurr'd in the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the subject matter of his Lectures; a Person of Quality (yet alive) privately asked him, What course a young Divine should take in his Studies to ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to be a good Casuist? His answer was, That a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent understanding of the Learned Languages (at least of Hebrew, Greek and Latin) and a sufficient knowledge of Arts and Sciences presuppos'd; There were two things in humane Literature, a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of which would be of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great use, to inable a man to be a rational and able Casuist, which otherwise was very difficult, if not impossible. 1. A convenient knowledge of Moral Philosophy; especially that part of it which treats of the Nature of Humane Actions: To know,
<q>quid sit actus humanus (spontaneus, invitus, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus) unde habent bonitatem &amp; malitiam moralem? an ex genere &amp; objecto, vel ex circumstantiis?</q>
                     <pb facs="tcp:51860:118"/>
How the variety of Circumstances varies the goodness or evil of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions? How far knowledge and ignorance may aggravate or excuse, increase or diminish the goodness or evil of our Actions? For every Case of Conscience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only this — <hi>Is this action good or bad? May I do it, or may I not</hi>? He who (in these) knows not how and whence hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions become morally good and evil, never can (<hi>in Hypothesi</hi>) rationally and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly determine, whether this or that particular Action be so. 2. The second thing, which (he said) would be a great help and advantage to a Casuist, was a convenient knowledge of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Obligation of Laws in general: To know what a Law is; what a Natural and a Positive Law; what's required to the <hi>Latio, dispensatio, derogatio, vel abrogatio legis</hi>; what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation is antecedently requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:51860:118"/>
to the Obligation of any Positive Law; what ignorance takes off the Obligation of a Law, or does excuse, diminish or aggravate the transgression: For every Case of Conscience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only this — <hi>Is this lawful for me, or is it not</hi>? and the Law the only Rule and Measure, by which I must judge of the lawfulness or unlawfulness of any Action: It evidently follows, that he, who (in these) knows not the Nature and Obligation of Laws, never can be a good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suist, or rationally assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (or others) of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or unlawfulness of Actions in particular. This was the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and good counsel of that learned and pious Prelate; and having (by long experience) found the truth and benefit of it, I conceive, I could not without ingratitude to him, and want of charity to others, conceal it. — Pray pardon this rude, and (I fear)
<pb facs="tcp:51860:119"/>
impertinent Scrible, which (if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else) may signifie thus much, that I am willing to obey your Desires, and am indeed</p>

                  <opener>SIR,</opener>
                  <p>WHEREAS you desire to know what my judgment and practice is concerning the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing or forbearing the establish'd Liturgy (either in whole,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51860:122"/>
or in part) in the publick Service of God, and Office of the Church: If it be any satisfaction to your Friend, I shall fully acquaint you what my practice is (whereunto if my own Judgment be not conform, I am, without all excuse, my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demner) and upon what considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have, according to the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the times, varied from my self therein.</p>
                  <p>So long as my Congregation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued unmixt with Souldiers, as well after as before the Promulgation of the Ordinance of the two Houses for the abolishing of the Common Prayer, I continued the use of it, as I had ever formerly done in the most peaceable and orderly times, not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting those very Prayers, the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing whereof I could not but know to have been chiefly aim'd at in the Ordinance (<hi>viz.</hi>) three for the King and Queen and Bishops; and so I did also though some Souldiers were casually present, till such time as a whole Troop coming to Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51860:122"/>
in the Town (with a purpose to continue a kind of Garison or Head-quarter among us) were so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd at my reading of it the first Sunday after they came, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Morning Service ended, they seiz'd upon the Book, and tore it all in pieces. Thence-forward during their continuance there for full six months and upwards (<hi>viz.</hi>) from the beginning of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> till they were call'd away to <hi>Naseby</hi> Fight in <hi>May</hi> following, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that for want of a Book of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity I must, I saw that it also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoov'd me, for the preventing of farther Outrages, to wave the use of the Book for the time, at least in the Ordinary Service; only I read the Confession, the Lord's Prayer, all the Versicles, and the Psalms for the day. Then after the first Lesson in the Forenoon <hi>Benedictus</hi> or <hi>Iubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>; and in the Afternoons <hi>Cantate.</hi> After the second Lesson also, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Creed, sometimes the Ten Commandements, and sometimes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51860:123"/>
neither, but only sang a Psalm, and so to Sermon. But in all that while, in the Administration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Solemnization of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, Burial of Dead, and Churching of Women, I constantly used the ancient Forms and Rites to every of them respectively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing, according to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Book; only I was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all the rest to make choice of such times and opportunities as I might do them with most secresie, and without disturbance of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. But at the Celebration of the Eucharist I was the more secure to do it publickly, because I was assur'd none of the Souldiers would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
                  <p>After their departure I took the liberty to use either the whole Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, or but some part of it, omitting sometimes more, sometimes less up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occasion, as I judg'd it most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in reference to the Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, especially if any Souldiers, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unknown persons hapned to be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51860:123"/>
present. But all this while the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of what I omitted I contriv'd into my Prayer before Sermon, the phrase and order only varied, which yet I endeavour'd to temper in such sort, that any person of ordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity might easily perceivve what my meaning was, and yet the words left as little liable to exception or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil as might be.</p>
                  <p>About two years ago I was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd (but in a friendly manner) by a Parliament man of note in these parts, that at a publick Meeting at <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> great complaint was made by some Ministers of the Presbyterian Gang, as I afterwards found, of my refractoriness to obey the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Order in that behalf. The Gentleman told me withal, <hi>That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they knew what my judgment and practice was, yet they were not forward to take notice of it before complaint made, which being now done in so publick a manner, if they should not take notice of it, the blame would lie upon them.</hi> He therefore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51860:124"/>
advised me to consider well what I had to do, for I must resolve either to adventure the loss of my Living, or to lay aside Common Prayer; which if I should continue after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint and admonition, it would not be in his power, nor in the power of any Friend I had to preserve me. The effect of my then Answer was, That if the case were so, the deliberation was not hard: I having long ago considered of the case, and resolved what I might do with a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and what was fittest for me in prudence to do, if I should ever be put to it (<hi>viz.</hi>) to forbear the use of the Common Prayer Book so far as might satisfie the letter of the Ordinance, rather than forsake my Station.</p>
                  <p>My next business then was to be-think my self of such a course to be thenceforth held in the publick work in my own Parish, as might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved neither to bring danger to my self by the use, nor to give scandal to my Brethren by the disuse of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51860:124"/>
establish'd Liturgy. And the course was this, to which I have held me ever since.</p>
                  <p>I begin the Service with a Preface, and an Exhortation infer'd to make Confession of Sins; which Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have fram'd out of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation and Absolution in the Book, contracted and put together, and exprest for the most part in the same words and phrases, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely here and there transplac'd, that it might appear not to be, and yet to be the very same.</p>
                  <p>Then follows the Confession it self in the same Order; it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd only with the addition of some words, whereby it is rather explain'd than alter'd. The whole frame whereof, both for the fuller satisfaction in that particular, and that you may conjecture what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of addition and change I have made proportionably hereunto (yet none so large) in other parts of the holy Office, I have here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51860:125"/>O Almighty God and merciful Father, we thy unworthy Servants do with shame and sorrow confess, that we have all our life long gone astray out of thy ways like lost sheep; and that by following too much the vain devices and desires of our own hearts, we have grievously offended against thy holy laws both in thought, word, and deed. We have many times left undone those good duties which we might and ought to have done, and we have many times done those evils, when we might have avoided them, which we ought not to have done. We confess, O Lord, that there is no health at all, nor help in any Creature to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us; but all our hope is in thy mercy, whose justice we have by our sins so far provoked. Have mercy upon us therefore, O Lord, have mercy upon us miserable Offenders: Spare us good Lord who confess our faults, that we perish not, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy gracious promises de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto mankind in Christ Iesu
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51860:125"/>
our Lord, restore us upon our true Repentance into thy grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake, that we hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth study to serve and please thee by leading a godly, righteous, and sobèr life, to the glory of thy holy Name, and the eternal comfort of our own Souls, through Iesus Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Confession the Lord's Prayer with the Versicles, and <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Patri,</hi> and then Psalms for the Day, and the first Lesson: After which in the Forenoon, sometimes <hi>Te Deum,</hi> (but then only when I think the Auditory will bear it) and sometimes an Hymn of mine own, gathered out of the Psalms and Church Collects, as a general Form of Thanksgiving (which I did the rather, because I have noted the want of such a Form as the only thing wherein the Liturgy seem'd to be defective). And in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, after the first Lesson the 98<hi>th.</hi> Psalm, or the 67<hi>th.</hi> then the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51860:126"/>
second Lesson, with <hi>Benedictus</hi> or <hi>Iubilate</hi>; after it in the Forenoon and Afternoon a singing Psalm. Then followeth the Creed, with <hi>Dominus Vobiscum</hi>; and sometimes the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicles in the end of our Letany [<hi>From our Enemies defend us</hi>] if I lik'd my Auditory, otherwise I omit the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicles. After the Creed, and instead of the Letany and the other Prayers appointed in the Book, I have taken the substance of the Prayer I was wont to make before Sermon, and dispos'd it into several Collects or Prayers, some longer and some shorter, but new modell'd into the language of the Common Prayer Book much more than it was before. And in the Pulpit, before Sermon I use only a short Prayer in reference to the hearing of the Word, and no more. So that upon the matter, in these Prayers I do but the same thing I did before, save only that what before I spake without Book, and in a continued Form in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, I now read out of a written Book
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51860:126"/>
broken into parcels, and in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Desk or Pue. Between which Prayers and the singing Psalms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sermon, I do also daily use one other Collect, of which sort I have for the purpose compos'd sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, made up also (as the former) for the most part out of the Church Collects, with some little enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or variation; as namely, the Collects Adventual, Quadragesimal, Paschal, or Pentecostal, for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per seasons; and at other times Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of a more general nature, as for Pardon, Repentance, Grace, &amp;c. And after one or more of them in the Forenoon, I usually repeat the Ten Commandements, with a short Collect after them for Grace to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to keep them.</p>
                  <p>This hath been my practice, and is like still to be, unless some happy Change of Affairs restore us the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of using the old way again, or it be made appear to my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by some able charitable Friend, That I therein have done
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51860:127"/>
otherwise then I ought to have done: For I may say, that I have not yet met with any thing in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, either with my own Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or others, of sufficient strength to convince me that I have done any thing, but what may stand with the Principles as well of Christian Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity as Prudence.</p>
                  <p>There are but three things, that I know of, that are of any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion oppos'd, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The Obligation of the Laws.</item>
                        <item>2. The Scandal of the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</item>
                        <item>3. The unseemly symbolizing at least with Schismaticks, if not partaking with them in the Schism.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1. Law. Object. 1.</note>The first and strongest Objection (which I shall therefore propose to the most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Objector) is that which is grounded upon the Laws, and their Obligation: For it may be Objected, That every humane Law
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51860:127"/>
rightly establish'd, so long as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth a Law, obligeth the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (and that for Conscience sake) to the observation thereof in such manner and form as in the same Law is prescribed, and according to the true meaning and intention of the Law-giver therein. That a Law is then understood to be rightly establish'd, when it containeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is honest and lawful, and is enacted by such person or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as have full and sufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make Laws. That a Law so establish'd continues a Law, and is so in force, till it be either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed by as good and lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as that by which it was made, or else antiquated by a long continued uninforc'd disuse with the tacit or presumed consent of the Law-giver. That the Act printed before the Common Prayer Book, and entituled (<hi>An Act for the Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>) was such a Law, being it was established in a full and free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in peaceable times, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51860:128"/>
by the Royal Assent, That it still continues in force, and being not yet Repealed, but by such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as (at least in the Opinion of those that maintain the Dispute) for want of the Royal Assent, have not a sufficient right or authority to do such an Act, nor disused but of late times, and that by enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as is presum'd, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the mind of the Law-giver. That therefore it still retains the power of obliging in part of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; that power being so essential and intrinsecal to every Law, <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi> a Law, that it can in no wise be sever'd from it.</p>
                  <p>And that therefore no Minister publickly officiating in the Church, can with a good Conscience either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any part of that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the aforesaid Law, or use any other Form than what is contained in the foresaid Book, but must either use the Form prescribed in the Book, or else forbear to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51860:128"/>The Answer to this Objection (granting all in the Premisses besides) dependeth upon the right understanding of that which is affirmed concering the Obligation of the Laws according to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law-giver;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> which if it should be understood precisely of that particular, actual, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate intention which the Law-giver had declared by the words of the Law (in which sense only the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection proceedeth) will not hold true in all cases. But there is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd besides that, in Law-giver, a more general, habitual, &amp; ultimate intention of a more excellent and transcendent nature that the former, which is to have an influence into, and over-ruling power over all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Laws (<hi>viz.</hi>) an intention by the Laws to procure and promote the publick good. The former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention binds, when it is subservient to the latter, or consistent with it, and consequently bindeth in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cases, and in orderly times, or else
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51860:129"/>
the Law is not a wholesome Law. But when the observation of the Law, by reason of the conjuncture of circumstances, or the iniquity of the times (contingencies which no Lawgiver could either certainly foresee, or if foreseen, sufficiently provide against) would rather be prejudicial than advantageous to the Publick; or is manifestly attended with such inconveniencies and sad consequents to the Observers, as all the imaginable good that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the Publick thereby, cannot in any reasonable measure counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail: In such case the Law obligeth not, but according to the latter and more general intention only; even as in the operations of nature, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Agents do ordinarily move according to their proper and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inclinations; yet upon some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, and to serve the ends and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of universal nature (for the avoiding of some things which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abhors) they are sometimes car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with motions quite contrary to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51860:129"/>
their particular natures; as the Air to descend, and the Water to ascend for the avoiding of vacuity, &amp;c. The common received Maxim (which hath been sufficiently misapplied, and that sometimes to very ill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses since the beginning of these unhappy divisions) in the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it looketh this way, <hi>Salus populi suprema Lex:</hi> the equity of which Maxim, as it leaveth in the Law-giver a power of dispensing with the Law (which is a suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Obligation thereof for the time in respect of the proper and particular intention) so he shall see it expedient in order to the publick good; so it leaveth in the Subject a liberty upon just occasions (as in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of great exigency, and for the preventing of such hazards and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies as might prove of noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some consequence to the Publick) to do otherwise than the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. And neither is the exercise of that power in the Lawgiver to be thought an unreasonable Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51860:130"/>
nor the use of this liberty in the Subject an unreasonable presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; inasmuch as the power of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensing with particular Laws is such a Prerogative, as without which no Commonwealth can be well govern'd, but Justice would be turn'd into Gall and Wormwood: Nor can the Supream Governour, without forfeiture of that faithfulness which he oweth to the Publick Weal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest himself thereof.</p>
                  <p>And he that presumeth of the Law-givers consent to dispense with him for the Observation of the Law in such needful cases (where he hath not the opportunity to consult his pleasure therein) presumeth no more than he hath reason to do. For it may well be presum'd that the Law-giver, who is bound in all his Laws to intend the safety of the Publick, and of every member thereof in his due proportion, hath no intention by the strict observation of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Law, to oblige any person, who is a Member of the Publick, to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51860:130"/>
his destruction or ruin, when the common good is not answerably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted thereby: Upon which ground it is generally resolv'd by Casuists, That no Constitution (meerly hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane) can lay such Obligation upon the Conscience of the Subject, but that we may (according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igency of circumstances) do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than the Constitution requireth, provided it be done <hi>extra casum scandali &amp; contemptûs, i.e.</hi> without either bewraying in himself any contempt of the Authority of the Law-giver by his carriage, or giving any just occasion of scandal to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by his example in so doing.</p>
                  <p>I have been somewhat the longer in explaining this point, not only for the better clearing of the present doubt, but also in respect of the use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of this consideration for the preventing and removing of many scruples that may happen to consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious men in such times as these, wherein so many things are (and are like to be) commanded and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51860:131"/>
contrary to the establish'd Laws, and those (as they are perswaded) yet standing in force. The best rule that I know to guide men in their deliberations and actions in such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent cases (according to what hath been already delivered) is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly and impartially to weigh the benefit &amp; inconveniencies, as well on the one side, as on the other, as they stand in relation unto the Publick Good: and if after such examination and comparison made, it shall then evidently (or but in the judgment of probability) appear, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Law, according to the proper intention of the Law-giver therein, though with hazard of Estate, Liberty, or even life it self, hath a greater tendency to the Publick Good, and the preservation of church or Commonwealth in safety, peace, and order, than the preventing of the foresaid hazards, or other evil consequents, by doing otherwise than the Law requireth, can have; or (which cometh to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51860:131"/>
one) if the violating of the Law shall then to be more prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the publick Good, than the preservation of the Subject's Estate, Liberty, or Life can be beneficial hereunto: In such case the Subject is bound to hazard all he hath, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo whatsoever inconveniencies and calamities can ensue thereupon, rather than violate the Law with contempt of that Authority to which he oweth subjection.</p>
                  <p>But if it shall (after such compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison made) evidently (or but more probably than the contrary) appear, That that preservation of such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Life, Liberty, Estate, would more benefit the Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, than the punctual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Law at that time, and with those circumstances, would do; it were an unseasonable, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and pernicious scrupulosity for such a person to think himself in such a case obliged for the observing of the Law (perhaps but once or twice) with little or no benefit to the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51860:132"/>
Publick, to ruin himself, whereby to render himself unuseful and unser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Publick for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>To bring this Discourse home, and to apply it to the business now under dispute. Suppose we ten, twenty, or One hundred godly Ministers, well affected to the establish'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, and actually possess'd of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, with the Charge of Souls thereto belonging, should, thinking themselves in Conscience obliged to the use of the whole Form of the Book, as is by the Act appointed, without any addition, omission, or alteration whatsoever (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the present conjuncture of Affairs) resolve to use the same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, it would be well consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what the effects and consequents thereof would be.</p>
                  <p>Besides other evils, these three are visible, which must all unavoidably follow one upon another, if any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy shall be found (as doubtless with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in short time there will be found one
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51860:132"/>
or other) to inform and prosecute against them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The utter undoing of so many worthy persons, fit to do God and his Church good service, together with all those persons that depend upon them for their livelyhood, by putting the fruits of their Benefices, wherewith they should buy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bread, under Sequestrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The depriving of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the opportunity of discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duties that belong unto them in their Ministerial Calling, in not permitting them, after such Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, to teach or instruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple belonging to their Charge, or to exercise any thing of their Function publickly in the Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The delivering over the Sheep of Christ, that lately were under the hands of the faithful Shepherds, into the Custody of ravenous Wolves, when such Guides shall be set over the several Congregations, as will be sure to mis-teach them one
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51860:133"/>
way or other (<hi>viz.</hi>) either by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling into them Puritanical and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Principles, that they may the more securely exercise their Presbyterian Tyranny over their Judgments, Consciences, Persons, and Estates, or else by setting up new Lights before them, to lead them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a maze of Anabaptistical confusion and frenzy.</p>
                  <p>These consequents are so heavy to the Sufferers, so certain to ensue upon the use of Common Prayer, and so much without the power of the Law-givers (in this state of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs) either to prevent or remedy, that it is beyond the wit of man what benefit to the Publick can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue by the strict observation of the Act, that may in any proportion countervail these mischiefs. In which case, that man must needs suppose a strange austerity in the Law-giver, that dares not presume of his consent to disoblige him (for the time) from observing the same. It would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so well considered, Whether he that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51860:133"/>
by his own over-nice scrupulosity runs all these hazards, be not (in some measure) guilty of his own undoing, of deserting his station, and of betraying his flock, and do not thereby lose much of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which a Christian Confessor may take in his sufferings, when they are laid upon him by the Hand of God, and not pull'd upon himself by his own hands. And more I shall not need to say as to that first Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>The next thing objected is,<note place="margin">Object. 2. Scandal.</note> 
                     <hi>The danger of the Scandal that others might be ready to take at the Example, who seeing the Law so little regarded by such men (men that have Cure of Souls, and perhaps also of some eminency and esteem in the Church, and whose Example will be much look'd upon) will be easily encourag'd by this Example to set light by all Authority, and to take the liberty to obey and disobey the Laws of their Soveraign at their pleasure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:51860:134"/>But this Objection, after we are once satisfied concerning the former, need not much trouble us. For,
<list>
                        <item>1. It seemeth an unreasonable thing in cases of great Exigence (such as we now suppose) that the fear of scandalizing our weak Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (which is but <hi>Debitum charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> only) should lay upon us a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory necessity of observing the Law punctually, whatsoever inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies and mischiefs may ensue thereupon: when the duty of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to our known Governours (which is <hi>Debitum justitiae</hi> also, and therefore more Obligatory than the other) doth not impose that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity upon us; as hath been already shewn.</item>
                        <item>2. Besides, Arguments drawn from scandal in things neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful nor (setting the reason of Scandal aside) inexpedient, as they are subject to sundry frailties other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, so they are manifestly of no weight at all, when they are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpois'd with the apparent danger
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51860:134"/>
of evil consequents on the other side. For in such cases there is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly equal danger (if not rather something more) of Scandal to be taken from the Example the quite contrary way. We may see it in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating the point now in hand: It is alledged on the one side, That by laying aside the use of the Common Prayer, men that are over scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous will be encourag'd to take a greater liberty in dispensing with the Laws (to the despising both of Laws and Governours) than they ought. And why may it not, by the same reason, be as well alleg'd on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, That by holding up a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of using the Common Prayer, men that have tender Consciences may be induc'd to entertain scruples (to their utter undoing, and to the destruction of their people) when they need not?</item>
                        <item>3. But that in the third place, which cometh up home to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and taketh off the Objection clearly, is this, That in judging Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51860:135"/>
of scandal, we are not so much to look to the event, what it is, or may be, as to the cause, whence it cometh. For sometimes there is given just cause of Scandal; and yet no Scandal followeth, because it is not taken: Sometimes scandal is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and yet no just cause given: and sometimes there is both cause of Scandal given, and Scandal taken thereat. But no man is concern'd at any Scandal that happeneth to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother by occasion of any thing done by him, neither is chargeable with it farther than he is guilty of having given it. If then we give Scandal to others, and they take it not, the whole guilt is ours, and they are faultless. If we give it, and they take it, we are to bear a share in the blame as they, and that a deep share; (<hi>Vae homini, Wo to the man by whome the offence cometh, Matth.</hi> 18.7.) But if they take offence when we give none, it is a thing we cannot help, and therefore the whole blame must lie upon them.</item>

                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:51860:135"/>Wherefore, if at any time any doubt shall arise in that case of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, How far forth the danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may obligue us to the doing or not doing of any thing propos'd; The Resolution will come on much the easier, if we shall but rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what it is to give Scandal, or how many ways a man may become guilty of scandalizing another by his Example.</p>
                  <p>The ways (as I conceive) are but these four.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <p>1. When a man doth something before another, which is in it self e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, unlawful, and sinful. In which case, neither the intension of him that doth it, nor the event as to him that seeth it done, is of any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: For it matters not whether the doer hath an intention to draw the other into sin, or not; the very matter and substance of the action being evil, and done before others, is sufficient to render the doer guilty of having given Scandal, though neither he had intention himself so
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51860:136"/>
to do, nor was any other person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually scandaliz'd thereby: because whatsoever is in its own nature evil, is of it self, and in its own nature scandalous, and of ill Example.</p>
                        <p>Thus did <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Eli,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 17.22.</note> give Scandal by their wretched prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and greediness about the Sacrifices of the Lord, and their shameless abusing the Women. And so did <hi>David</hi> also give great Scandal in the matter of <hi>Vriah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. Here the Rule is,
<q>Do nothing that is evil, for fear of giving Scandal.</q>
                        </p>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The second way is, when a man doth something before another with a direct intention and formal purpose of drawing him thereby to commit sin. In which case neither the matter of the action, nor the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent is of any consideration: For it makes no difference as to the sin of giving Scandal, whether any man be effectually entic'd to commit sin or not thereby; neither doth it make
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51860:136"/>
any difference, whether the thing done were in it self unlawful, or not, so as it had an appearance of evil, and from thence an aptitude to draw another by the doing of that (by i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation) which should be really and intrinsecally evil. The wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention alone (whatsoever the effect should be, or what means soever should be us'd to promote it) sufficeth to induce the guilt of giving Scandal upon the doer. This was <hi>Ieroboam</hi>'s sin, in setting up the Calvos, with a formal purpose and intention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (for his own secular and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ends) to corrupt the purity of Religion, and to draw the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Idolatrous Worship. For which cause he is so often stigmatiz'd with it, as a note of Infamy, to stick by him whilst the World lasteth, being scarce ever-mention'd in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but with this addition, <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> the son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> which made <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> to sin. Here the Rule is,
<q>Do nothing, a good or evil, with an intention to give Scandal.</q>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="32" facs="tcp:51860:137"/>3. The third way is when a man doth something before another, which in it self is not evil, but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and so according to the Rule of Christian Liberty, lawful for him to do, or not to do, as he shall see cause (yea, and perhaps otherwise commodious and convenient for him to do) yet whereas he probably fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeth that others will take Scandal, and be occasioned thereby to do evil. In such a case, if the thing to be done be not in some degree prudentially necessary for him to do, but that he might, without very great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience or prejudice to himself or any third person, leave it undone: He is bound in Charity to his Brother's Soul (for whom Christ died) and for the avoiding of Scandal, to abridge himself in the exercise of his Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Liberty for that time, so far as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to suffer some inconvenience himself by the not doing of it, than by the doing of it to cause his Brother to offend. The very Case which is so often, so largely, and so earnestly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51860:137"/>
insisted upon by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.13,21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1, 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 87, 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.12, 15, 19, 22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23.33. Here the Rule is,
<q>Do nothing that may be reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly forborn, whereat Scandal will be taken.</q>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. The last way is, when a man doth somthing before another, which is not only lawful, but (according to the exigencies of present Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances) <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofful, and even prudentially ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for him to do, but foreseeth that the other will be like to make an ill use of it, and take encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereby to commit sin, if he be not withal careful, as much as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in him lieth, to prevent the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal that may be taken thereat: For, <hi>Qui non prohibet peccare, cum potest, jubet.</hi> In such case the bare neglect of his Brother, and not using his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most endeavour to prevent the evil that might ensue, maketh him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Upon which consideration stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Equity of the Judicial Law
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51860:138"/>
given to the Jews,<note place="margin">Exod. 21. 33, 34.</note> which ordered, That in case a man dig a Pit for the use of his Family, and looking no farther than his own convenience, put no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver upon it, and leave it open, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it hapneth his Neighbours Beast to fall thereinto and perish, the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Pit is to make it good, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he was the occasioner of that loss to his Neighbour, which he might and ought to have prevented. Here the Rule is
<q>Order the doing of that, which may not be well left undone, in such sort that no Scandal (so far as you can help it) may be taken thereat.</q>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>To apply this. The thing under debate, <hi>viz.</hi> the Action propos'd to present enquiry is, The laying aside the Common Prayer, being enjoyn'd by Law, and using instead thereof some other Form of Church Service of our own devising. And the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry concerning it is, Whether it may be done with a good Conscience
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51860:138"/>
in regard of the Scandal that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or at least may be taken thereat, Yea or No?</p>
                  <p>Now forasmuch as in this Enquiry we take it for granted, That the thing to be done is not in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture simply evil, but rather in this state of affairs prudentially necessary; and that they who make scruple at it upon the point of Scandal, have not the least intention of drawing other of the Laws into contempt, or their Brethren into sin by their Example. It is manifest that three of the now mention'd Cases, with the Rules to each of them appending, are not pertinent to the present Enquiry. But since the last of the four only proveth to be our Case, we have therefore no more to do for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our Judgments, and quieting of our Consciences, and the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our Practice in this Affair, than to consider well what the Rule in this Case given obligeth us unto; which is not to leave the Action un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for the danger of Scandal,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51860:139"/>
which (besides the Inconveniencies formerly mention'd) would but start new Questions, and those beget more to the multiplying unnecessary Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>in infinitum</hi>: But to order the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it so, that (if it were possible) no Scandal at all might ensue thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or at least wise not by our default, through our careless or undiscreet managery thereof. Even as the Jew that stood in need to sink a Pit for the service of his House or Ground, was not (for fear his Neighbours Beast should fall into it, and be drown'd) bound by the Law to forbear the making of it, but only to provide a sufficient cover for it, where he had made it. The thing then in this Case is not to be left undone, when it so much behoveth us to do it; but the Action to be carried on (for the manner of doing, and in all respects and circumstances thereunto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) with so much chariness and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, moderation and wisdom (to our best understanding) that the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of our so doing, with the true
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51860:139"/>
cause thereof, may appear to the World, to the satisfaction of those that are willing to take notice of it; and that such persons as would be willing to make use of our Ensample to do the same thing, where there is not the same necessity, may do it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own score, and not be able to vouch our practice for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse; which how it may be best done for particular directions, every cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and conscientious man must ask his own discretion. Some gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral helps thereunto I shall lay down in answering the next Objection, where they would fall in again not improperly, and so stop two Gaps with one Bush.</p>
                  <p>The last Objection is that of Shism.<note place="margin">Object. 3. Schism.</note> The Objectors hold all such persons as have oppos'd either Liturgy or Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they were by Law estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd within this Realm, for no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Schismaticks; and truly I shall not much gain-say it. But then they argue, That for them to do the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51860:140"/>
same thing in the publick worship of God that Schismaticks do (and for doing whereof especially it is that they avow them Schismaticks) would (as they conceive) involve them in the Schism also, as partakers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in some degree with the other: And their Consciences also would, from <hi>Rom. 14.22.</hi> condemn them either of hypocrisie, in allowing that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and in their own practice, which they condemn in others; or of uncharitableness, in judging others as Schismaticks for doing but the same thing which they can allow themselves to practise. For all that such persons, as they call Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, do in this matter of the Church Service, is but to leave out the Churches Prayers, and to put in their own. Or say, this should not make them really guilty of the Schism they so much detest, yet would such their symbolizing with them seem at least a kind of unworthy compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them, more than could well become the simplicity of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51860:140"/>
much less of a Minister of the Gospel,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1 Thess. 5.</hi>
                     </note> whose duty it is to shun even the least <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil.</hi> Besides, that by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they should but confirm such men in their Schismatical Principles and Practice.</p>
                  <p>This Objection hath 3 Branches. To the first whereof I oppose the old saying, <hi>Duo cum faciunt idem, non est idem</hi>; which, although spoken quite to another purpose, yet is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry capable of such a sense which will very well fit our present purpose al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.</p>
                  <p>I Answer therefore in short. To do the same thing that Schismaticks do (especially in time of Confusion, and till things can be reduc'd unto better Order, and when men are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated thereunto to prevent greater mischiefs) doth not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily infer a partaking with them in Schism, no, nor so much as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, unless it may appear upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable presumption otherwise, that it is done out of the same Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51860:141"/>
Spirit, and upon such Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Principles as theirs are.</p>
                  <p>The other two Branches (<hi>viz.</hi> That of seeming compliance with Schismaticks, and That of the ill use they make of it to confirm them in their Schism) do upon the matter fall in upon the aforesaid point of Scandal, and are in effect but the same Objection, only put into a new dress, and so have receiv'd their Answer already. And the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against both these Fears (as well that of Scandal, as this of Schism) is the same which was there prescrib'd, Even to give assurance to all men, by our carriage and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our therein, that we do not lay aside Common Prayer of our own accord, or out of any dislike thereof, neither in contempt of our rightful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, or of the Laws, nor out of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny base compliance with the Times, or unworthy Secular own ends, nor out of any Schismatical principles, seditious designs, or innovating hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; but meerly enforc'd thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51860:141"/>
by such a necessity, as we cannot otherwise avoid in order to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and the Publick Good, for the preservation of our Families, our Flocks, and our Functions: And that with the good leave and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance (as we have great reason to believe) of such as have power to dispense with us and the Laws in that behalf.</p>
                  <p>This if we shall do <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> and with our utmost endeavours, in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleness of heart, and with godly discretion, perhaps it will not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to prevail with either the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of inconsiderate and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable persons, or the ill use that may be made of our Example, through the ignorance or negligence of some (<hi>scandalum pusillorum</hi>) or through the perversness and malice of others (<hi>scandalum pharisaeorum</hi>) as the Schools term them: But assuredly it will be sufficient in the sight of God, and the witness of our own hearts, and to the Consciences of charitable and considering men,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51860:142"/>
to acquit us clear of all guilt, either of Scandal or Schism in the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Which we may probably do by observing these ensuing, or such other like general Directions (The liberty of using such meet accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, as the circumstances in particular Cases shall require, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more allowed and reserved). <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <item>1.

                        <item>2. If we shall retain, as well in common discourse, as in our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and holy Offices of the Church, the old Theological and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal terms and forms of Speech, which have been generally received and used in the Churches of Christ, which the people are well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

with, and are wholsome and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, and not follow our new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in that uncouth affected garb of Speech, or Canting Language rather (if I may so call it) which they have of late taken up, as the signal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction and characteristical note of that, which in that their new Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage they call The Godly Party, or Communion of Saints.</item>
                        <item>3. If in officiating we repeat not only the Lord's Prayer, the Creed, the ten Commandements, and such other passages in the Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Book, as (being the very words of Scripture) no man can except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst; but so much of the old Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy besides, in the very words and syllables of the Book, as we think the Ministers of State in those parts wherein we live will suffer, and the Auditory, before whom we officiate, will bear; sith the Officers in all parts of the Land are not alike strict, nor the people in all Parishes alike disaffected in this respect.</item>
                        <item>4. If, where we must of necessity

vary from the words, we yet fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Order of the Book in the main parts of the holy Offices, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the substance of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and embellishing those of our own making, which we substitute into the place of those we leave out, with phrases and passages taken out of the Book in other places.</item>

should interpose herein, both by farther Explanation of her Doctrine in the points questioned, and by the Exercise of her Discipline upon such persons as will not rest in her deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.

                     <p>Sithence most of the differences now in question do arise from the different conceits which men have concerning the Decrees of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout man's Salvation, and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of those Decrees; it could not but be a work of singular use for the composing of present, and the preventing of farther differences, if some learned and moderate men (all prejudice and partiality laid aside) would travel with faithfulness and sobriety in this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> to order those Decrees consonantly to the tenor of Scripture, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the ancient Church, as to avoid those inconveniencies into which the extreme Opinions on both hands run. For, considering often with my self, that the abettors of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51860:155"/>
either extreme are confirmed in their Opinions, not so much from the assurance of their own grounds, as from the inconveniencies that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the opposite extreme: I have ever thought that a middle way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both might be fairer and safer to pitch upon, than either extreme. What therefore upon some agitation of these Points, both in Argument with others upon occasion, and in my private and serious thoughts, I have conceived concerning the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of God's Decrees, desiring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to keep my self within the bands of Christian sobriety and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, I have at the request of some Friends here distinctly laid down, not intending hereby to prescribe unto other men, nor yet to tie my self to mine own present Judgment, if I shall see cause to alter it; but only to present to the abler Judgments of some learned Friends that way, which hath hitherto given me bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter satisfaction than any other, and which I have not yet observed to be

subject to so great difficulties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, neither in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the matter, nor in the manner of explication, as the ways, which either the rigid <hi>Calvinists,</hi> or the <hi>Arminians</hi> have taken. <hi>Quaere</hi> then, whether or no the Eternal Decrees of God concerning man's Salvation may not be conveniently conceived in this order, <hi>viz.</hi> That he decreed

There can lie no imputation upon the justice of God, though he have reprobated some, and elected others, who were both equal in the sinful mass of corrupt nature; rather his mercy is to be magnified, in that he hath not reprobated all: Which if he had done, his justice must yet have stood clear, though examined but even at the Bar of Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for so much as all had deserved to be Reprobates, and that most just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their sin in <hi>Adam.</hi> They that make the Decree of Reprobation to precede all respect to the fall, are put to many difficulties how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press themselves so as to avoid cavil; and much ado they have to assert

the Decrees of God from being how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever unjust, being enforced to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the justice of God, by flying to that absolute right and power he hath in and over the Creature: whereas this way cutteth off an hundred of those Cavils the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> commonly use, and justifieth the proceedings of our most righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God in all respects so clearly, that his justice, both in the Decrees themselves, and in the execution thereof, is not only apparent, but also illustrious and glorious.</item>

Anabaptists,</hi> and what not?

Is it not evident, that the thing which made <hi>the master</hi> angry, and <hi>the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> an offender in <hi>that case,</hi> was not (<hi>precisely</hi> and <hi>formally</hi>) the leaving of the thing <hi>undone,</hi> (which, had it not been <hi>commanded,</hi> might have been left <hi>undone</hi> without any <hi>fault</hi> or <hi>blame</hi> at all;) but <hi>the refusing</hi> to do it, when he that had a right to his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51860:168"/>
service <hi>commanded</hi> him? Wherefore <hi>thirdly,</hi> that which is said of some mens <hi>doting</hi> so extremely on <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> might have been well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough spared. I know no true Son of <hi>the Church of England,</hi> that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth upon any <hi>Ceremony,</hi> whatsoever opinion he may have of <hi>the decency</hi> or <hi>expediency</hi> of some of them. If any do, let him <hi>answer</hi> for himself. Among wise men, he will hardly pass for a <hi>wise man,</hi> that <hi>doteth</hi> upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Nor will he, I doubt, prove a much <hi>wiser man,</hi> that runs into <hi>the contrary</hi> extreme, and <hi>abhorreth</hi> all. It is true <hi>fourthly,</hi> that there have been long and <hi>unkind quarrels</hi> about these things; More is <hi>the pity!</hi> but where is <hi>the fault</hi>? To whom is <hi>the beginning,</hi> and to whom <hi>the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance</hi> of a quarrel rather imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? to him that <hi>demandeth</hi> his right? or to him that <hi>withholdeth</hi> it from him? For this is the plain <hi>Case</hi> in short; <hi>The Bishops</hi> (<hi>under the King</hi>) require <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>Laws Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical</hi>; these men <hi>refuse</hi> to give
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51860:168"/>
it. So <hi>began the quarrel</hi> at first, and upon the same terms it <hi>continued.</hi> If the <hi>Obedience</hi> challenged were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed due to these Laws, then did our <hi>Brethren</hi> both <hi>begin</hi> the quarrel, and <hi>hold it on:</hi> if it were not, then must the whole <hi>blame</hi> lie upon them that <hi>claimed it unjustly,</hi> and not upon them. So that in the winding up of the business, the whole <hi>Controversie</hi> will devolve upon this point, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>Laws Ecclesiastical</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience be due or not? For the right determining whereof (for so much as it is confest on all hands, that <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> is due to <hi>lawful autority</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>lawful things</hi>) <hi>two</hi> other <hi>points</hi> are to be resolved; the one cocerning <hi>the authority</hi> by which the Constitutions were made; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning <hi>the lawfulness</hi> of the things therein required: <hi>The Presbyterians of the Kirk</hi> flatly and directly deny both: <hi>Ours,</hi> less for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to declare their opinion in <hi>the former</hi> point, have chosen rather to stand upon <hi>the latter</hi> only. And so
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51860:169"/>
                     <hi>the point in issue</hi> is briefly this, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>the things</hi> commanded (and particularly the <hi>Ceremonies</hi>) be <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> yea or no.</p>
                  <p>When for <hi>decency, order,</hi> or <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities</hi> sake any <hi>Constitutions</hi> are made concerning <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> there is the same <hi>necessity</hi> of obeying such <hi>Constitutions,</hi> as there is of obeying other <hi>laws</hi> made for the good of <hi>the Commonwealth,</hi> concerning any other <hi>indifferent</hi> things. That such <hi>necessity,</hi> either in the one or the other, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not properly from <hi>the authority</hi> of the immediate <hi>lawgiver</hi>; but from <hi>the Ordinance of God,</hi> who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to obey <hi>the Ordinance of men</hi> for his sake. That such <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of obedience,</hi> notwithstanding <hi>the things</hi> remain in the same <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> as before; every way, in respect of their nature and <hi>quoad rem</hi> (it being not in the power of <hi>accidental relations</hi> to change <hi>the natures</hi> of things) and even in respect of their <hi>use,</hi> and <hi>quoad nos,</hi> thus far, that there is <hi>a liberty</hi> left for men, upon extraordinary and other just occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51860:169"/>
sometimes to do otherwise than the Constitution requireth, <hi>extra ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum scandali &amp; contemptûs: A li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> which we dare not either take our selves, or allow to others, in things properly and absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary: Upon which very account (I mean the consideration of the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency of the things in themselves) and upon which account alone it is, that many of the Episcopal (that is to say, the true English Protestant) Divines, who sadly resent the voting down of the Liturgy, Festivals, and Ceremonies of the Church by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny former Laws established, heartily desired heretofore the continuance, and as heartily still wish the restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are (by God's help) rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with their Tongues, Pens, and Sufferings to maintain and justifie the lawful use of the same; do yet so far yield to the sway of the times, and are perswaded they may with a good Conscience so do, as to forbear the use thereof in the publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, till it shall seem good to those
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51860:170"/>
that are in place of Authority, either to restore them to their former state (as it is well hoped, when they shall have duly considered the evil conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of that Vote, they will) or at leastwise, and in the mean time to leave them arbitrary, for men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their several different judgments, to use or not to use, which seemeth but reasonable, the like favour and liberty in other kinds having been long allowed to almost all other sorts of men, though of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so distant perswasions one from another. Lastly, That all <hi>Laws</hi> made concerning <hi>Ceremonies</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>indifferent</hi> things, whether <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> are <hi>mutable:</hi> and as they were at first made <hi>by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority,</hi> so may they from time to time be <hi>by humane authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> abrogated and repealed. And then and thenceforth they lose their <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> whereby <hi>the necessity</hi> of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>obedience</hi> thereunto wholly ceaseth and determineth; and <hi>the things</hi> thereby <hi>commanded</hi> or <hi>prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:51860:170"/>
return to their primitive and natural <hi>indifferency,</hi> even in their <hi>use</hi> also, and <hi>in respect of us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in the Case of our Church now it is far otherwise: <hi>Cap, Surplice, Cross, Ring,</hi> and other <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which are the matter of our differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, though they be things <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> for their <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>; yet are not so for their <hi>use,</hi> and <hi>unto us.</hi> If <hi>the Church</hi> had been silent, if <hi>Authority</hi> had prescribed nothing herein, these <hi>Ceremonies</hi> had then remained for their <hi>use,</hi> as they are for their <hi>nature,</hi> indifferent, <hi>Lawful,</hi> and such as might be <hi>used</hi> without sin; and yet <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> and such as might be also <hi>forborn</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sin. But men must grant (though they be unwilling, if yet they will be reasonable) that every <hi>particular Church</hi> hath power for <hi>decency and orders</hi> sake, to ordain and constitute <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> which being once or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and by publick Authority enjoyned, cease to be <hi>indifferent</hi> for their <hi>use,</hi> though they remain still so
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51860:171"/>
for their <hi>nature</hi>; and of <hi>indifferent</hi> become so <hi>necessary,</hi> that neither may a man without sin <hi>refuse</hi> them, where Authority requireth, nor <hi>use</hi> them, where Authority restraineth the use.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this accession of <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> any impeachment to <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> or <hi>insnaring</hi> of mens <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,</hi> as some have objected: For then do we ensnare mens Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by <hi>humane constitutions,</hi> where we thrust them upon men as if they were <hi>Divine,</hi> and bind mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences to them <hi>immediately,</hi> as if they were immediate parts of <hi>God's worship,</hi> or of absolute necessity unto Salvation. This <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation</hi> over mens Consciences <hi>the Pharisees</hi> of old did, and <hi>the Church of Rome</hi> at this day doth exercise, and we justly hate in her, equalling, if not preferring her <hi>Constitutions</hi> to the <hi>Laws</hi> of God. But our <hi>Church</hi> (God be thanked) is far from any such impious presumption; and hath sufficiently <hi>declared</hi> her self by so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solemn
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51860:171"/>
                     <hi>protestation,</hi> enough to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie any ingenuous impartial judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that by requiring obedience to these <hi>ceremonial constitutions,</hi> she hath no other purpose, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all <hi>her children</hi> to an <hi>orderly conformity</hi> in the <hi>outward worship</hi> of God; so far is she from seeking to draw any opinion, either of <hi>divine necessity</hi> upon the <hi>constitution,</hi> or of <hi>effectual holiness</hi> upon the <hi>ceremony.</hi> And as for the prejudice which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be hereby given to <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> it is so slender a conceit, that it seemeth to bewray in the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors a desire, not so much of <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> as <hi>cavil.</hi> For first, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of a Christian to all indifferent things is in <hi>the mind</hi> and <hi>conscience,</hi> and is then infringed, when the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> is bound and strained, by imposing upon it an opinion of <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal necessity.</hi> But it is no wrong to <hi>the Liberty</hi> of a Christian man's conscience, to bind him to <hi>outward observation</hi> for <hi>orders</hi> sake, and to impose upon him <hi>a necessity of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:51860:172"/>
Which one distinction of <hi>Doctrinal</hi> and <hi>Obediential necessity</hi> well weighed, and rightly applied, is of it self sufficient to clear all doubts in this point. For, to make all <hi>restraint</hi> of the outward man in matters <hi>indifferent</hi> an impeachment of <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> what were it else, but even to bring flat <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> and <hi>Anarchy</hi> into the Church? and to overthrow all bond to <hi>subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to lawful autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? I beseech you consider, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in can <hi>the immediate power</hi> and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Fathers, Masters,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Rulers</hi> over their inferiours consist, or the due <hi>obedience</hi> of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours be shewn towards them, if not in these <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> things? For, things <hi>absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,</hi> as commanded by God, we are bound to do, whether human Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>require</hi> them or no: and things <hi>absolutely unlawful,</hi> as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by God, we are bound <hi>not to do,</hi> whether humane Authority <hi>forbid</hi> them or no. There are none
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51860:172"/>
other things left then, wherein to express properly <hi>the Obedience</hi> due to superiour Authority, than these <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things.</hi> And if a <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Master</hi> have power to prescribe to his <hi>child</hi> or <hi>servant</hi> in indifferent things, and such restraint be no way prejudicial to <hi>Christian liberty</hi> in them, why should any man, either deny the like power to <hi>Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi> to make <hi>Ecclesiastical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi> concerning indifferent things? or interpret that power to the prejudice of <hi>Christian liberty</hi>? And again, <hi>secondly,</hi> Men must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that it is an errour to think <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> to be things <hi>meerly indifferent</hi>; I mean in the general. For howsoever every <hi>particular Ceremony</hi> be indifferent, and every <hi>particular constitution</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and alterable; yet that there should be some <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <hi>necessitate absoluta,</hi> inasmuch as no outward work can be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without <hi>ceremonial</hi> circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, some or other: and that there
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51860:173"/>
should be some <hi>constitutions</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, it is also necessary (though not simply and absolutely, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yet <hi>ex hypothesi,</hi> and) <hi>necessitate convenientiae:</hi> Otherwise, since some <hi>Ceremonies</hi> must needs be used, every <hi>Parish,</hi> may every <hi>man</hi> would have his own fashion by himself, as his humour led him, whereof what other could be the issue, but infinite <hi>distraction</hi> and unorderly <hi>confusion</hi> in the Church? And again, <hi>thirdly,</hi> to return their weapon upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, if every restraint in <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things</hi> be injurious to <hi>Christian liberty,</hi> then themselves are injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, no less by their <hi>negative</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint from some Ceremonies, <hi>Wear not, Cross not, Kneel not,</hi> &amp;c. than they would have the world believe our Church is by her positive <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint</hi> unto these Ceremonies of <hi>wearing,</hi> and <hi>crossing,</hi> and <hi>kneeling,</hi> &amp;c. Let indifferent men judge, nay let themselves that are parties judge, whether is more injurious to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Liberty, <hi>publick Authority</hi> by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51860:173"/>
mature advice commanding what might be forborn, or <hi>private spirits,</hi> through humorous dislikes, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what may be used; the <hi>whole Church</hi> imposing the <hi>use,</hi> or a <hi>few Brethren</hi> requiring the <hi>forbearance</hi> of such things as are otherwise and in themselves equally <hi>indifferent</hi> for use, for forbearance.</p>
                  <p>But they say, <hi>our Church</hi> makes greater matters of <hi>ceremonies</hi> than thus, and preferreth them even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the most <hi>necessary duties</hi> of preaching and administring <hi>the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi>; inasmuch as they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon <hi>Ministers</hi> under pain of <hi>Suspension</hi> and <hi>Deprivation</hi> from their Ministerial Functions and Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. First, for actual Deprivation, I take it, unconforming Ministers have no great cause to complain.
<q>Our Church, it is well known, hath not always used that rigour she might have done. Where she hath been forced to proceed as far as <hi>Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> she hath ordinarily by her fair, and slow, and compassionate
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51860:174"/>
proceeding therein, sufficiently manifessed her unwillingness thereto:</q>
and declare her self a Mother everyway indulgent enough to such ill-nurtured Children as will not be ruled by her. <hi>Secondly,</hi> those that are <hi>suspended</hi> or <hi>deprived,</hi> suffer it but justly for their <hi>obstinacy</hi> and <hi>contempt:</hi> For, howsoever they would bear the world in hand, that they are <hi>the only persecuted ones,</hi> and that they suffer for their <hi>consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi>; yet in truth they do but abuse the credulity of the simple therein; and herein (as in many other things) jump with the <hi>Papists,</hi> whom they would seem above all others most abhorrent from. For as <hi>Seminary Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuits</hi> give it out that they suffer for <hi>Religion,</hi> when the very truth is, they are justlty execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their prodigious Treasons, and felonious or treacherous <hi>practices</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst lawful Princes and Estates: So <hi>the Brethren</hi> pretend they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted for their <hi>consciences,</hi> when they are indeed but justly <hi>censured</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:51860:174"/>
for thier obstinate and pertinacious <hi>contempt</hi> of lawful authority. For it is not <hi>the refusal</hi> of these <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> they are deprived for, otherwise than as <hi>the matter</hi> wherein they shew their <hi>contempt:</hi> It is <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> it self, which <hi>formerly</hi> and properly subjecteth them to just <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical censure</hi> of Suspension or Deprivation. And <hi>contempt of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> though in the smallest mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, deserveth no small punishment; all <hi>authority</hi> having been ever soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous (as it hath good reason) above all things to vindicate and preserve it self from <hi>contempt,</hi> by inflicting sharp punishments upon <hi>contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> persons in <hi>the smallest</hi> matters, above all other sorts of offenders in any degree whatsoever. Thus have we shewed and cleared the <hi>first</hi> and main difference betwixt <hi>the case</hi> of my Text, and the case of our Church, in regard of <hi>the matter</hi>; the things whereabout they differed, being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way <hi>indifferent,</hi> ours not so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:51860:175"/>The determination of <hi>Superiours</hi> may and ought to restrain us in the outward exercise of our <hi>Christian liberty.</hi> We must <hi>submit our selves to every Ordinance of man,</hi> saith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. and it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary we should do so; for <hi>so is the will of God,</hi> ver. 15. Neither is it against <hi>Christian liberty</hi> if we do so; for we are still as free as before: ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if we do not so, we <hi>abuse our liberty for a cloak of maliciousness,</hi> as it followeth there, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us we <hi>must needs be subject, not only for fear,</hi> because the Magistrate <hi>carrieth not the Sword in vain; but also for conscience sake,</hi> because <hi>the powers that are, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God.</hi> This duty, so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pressed and so uniformly by these two grand Apostles, is most apparent in <hi>private societies.</hi> In a family, <hi>the Master,</hi> or <hi>pater familias,</hi> who is a kind of <hi>petty Monarch</hi> there, hath authority to prescribe to his <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> and <hi>servants</hi> in the use of those <hi>indifferent things</hi> whereto yet they,

                  <p>Now look what power the <hi>Master</hi> hath over his <hi>Servants</hi> for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of his <hi>family,</hi> no doubt the

circumstances</hi> to be used in <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical</hi> Offices and Assemblies: As the Apostles in the first <hi>Council</hi> holden at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. laid upon the Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles for a time a restraint from <hi>the eating of blood, and things sacrificed to Idols, and strangled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we see our <hi>Christian liberty</hi> unto the Creatures may without prejudice admit of some <hi>restraints</hi> in <hi>the outward exercise</hi> of it, and namely from the three respects, of Christian <hi>Sobriety,</hi> of Christian <hi>Charity,</hi> and of Christian <hi>Duty</hi> and Obedience. But now in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of these together, when there seemeth to be a repugnancy between one and another of them, there may be some difficulty: and the greatest difficulty, and which hath bred most trouble, is in comparing the cases of <hi>scandal</hi> and <hi>disobedience</hi> together, when there seemeth to be a repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy between <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Duty.</hi> As for example; Suppose in a thing which simply and in it self we may
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51860:177"/>
                     <hi>lawfully,</hi> according to <hi>the Liberty</hi> we have in Christ, either use or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear; <hi>Charity</hi> seemeth to lay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint upon us one way, our <hi>weak</hi> brother expecting we should <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> a quite contrary way, <hi>Authority</hi> requiring <hi>the use:</hi> in such a case what are we to do? It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>charity</hi> to offend <hi>a brother</hi>; and it is against <hi>Duty</hi> to disobey <hi>a superiour.</hi> And yet something must be done; either we must <hi>use,</hi> or <hi>not use; forbear,</hi> or <hi>not forbear.</hi> For the untying of this knot (which, if we will but lay things rightly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath not in it so much hardness as it seemeth to have) let this be our <hi>seventh Position.</hi> In the use of <hi>the Creatures,</hi> and all <hi>indifferent things,</hi> we ought to bear a greater regard to our <hi>publick Governours,</hi> than to our <hi>private Brethren</hi>; and be more careful to <hi>obey</hi> them, than to <hi>satisfie</hi> these, if the same course will not in some mediocrity satisfie both. Alas, that our Brethren, who are contrary minded, would but with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51860:178"/>
the spirit of sobriety admit <hi>common Reason</hi> to be umpire in this case: Alas, that they would but consider what a world of <hi>contradictions</hi> would follow upon the contrary <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> and what a world of <hi>confusions</hi> upon the contrary <hi>practice.</hi> Say what can be said in the behalf of a <hi>brother,</hi> all the same, and more may be said for a <hi>Governour</hi>: For a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi> is a <hi>Brother</hi> too, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more; and <hi>Duty</hi> is <hi>Charity</hi> too, and something more. If then I may not offend my <hi>Brother,</hi> then certainly not my <hi>Governour</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is my <hi>brother</hi> too, being a <hi>man,</hi> And a <hi>christian,</hi> as well as the other is. And the same <hi>charity</hi> that bindeth me to satisfie <hi>another Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> equally bindeth me to satisfie <hi>this.</hi> So that, if we go no farther, but even to the common bond of <hi>charity,</hi> and relation of <hi>brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> that maketh them <hi>equal</hi> at the least; and therefore no reason, why I should satisfie one that is but a <hi>private brother,</hi> rather than <hi>the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51860:178"/>
publick magistrate,</hi> who (that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick respect set aside) is my <hi>brother</hi> also. When the Scales hang thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, shall not the accession of <hi>magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy</hi> to common <hi>brotherhood</hi> in him, and of <hi>Duty</hi> to common <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in me, be enough to cast it clear for <hi>the magistrate</hi>? Shall a <hi>servant</hi> in a Family, rather than <hi>offend</hi> his fellow-servant, <hi>disobey</hi> his Master? And is not a <hi>double scandal</hi> against <hi>charity</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> both (for <hi>duty</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth <hi>charity</hi>) greater than a <hi>single scandal</hi> against <hi>charity</hi> alone? If pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men will be offended at our <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to publick <hi>Governours,</hi> we can but be sorry for it: We may not redeem their <hi>offence</hi> by our <hi>disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> He that <hi>taketh</hi> offence where none is <hi>given,</hi> sustaineth a double person, and must answer for it, both as <hi>the giver</hi> and <hi>the taker.</hi> If of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence be taken at us, there is no wo to us for it, if it do not come by us; <hi>Wo to the man by whom the offence cometh:</hi> And it doth not come by us, if we do but what is our duty to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51860:179"/>
do. <hi>The Rule</hi> is certain and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; The respect of <hi>private scandal</hi> ceaseth, where <hi>lawful authority</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth our <hi>liberty</hi>; and that <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint</hi> which proceedeth from <hi>speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al duty,</hi> is of superiour reason to that which proceedeth but from <hi>common charity.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the King and Parliament ought to impose any more upon us in matters of Religion, than is <hi>imposed</hi> in the Scripture? or whether every one ought not to be left to serve God according to his best apprehensions out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>Opinion</hi> is, that to do any thing at all without direction from <hi>the Scripture</hi> is unlawful and sinful. Which if they would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand only of the substantials of <hi>Gods worship,</hi> and of the exercises of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and supernatural graces,</hi> the assertion were true and sound; but as they extend it to <hi>all the actions of common life</hi> whatsoever, whether natural or civil, even so far as to the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51860:179"/>
                     <hi>taking up of a straw,</hi> so it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther false and indefensible. I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel what warrant they that so teach have from <hi>the Scripture</hi> for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Doctrine; or where they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded so to <hi>believe</hi> or <hi>teach.</hi> One of their chiefest refuges is <hi>the Text</hi> we now have in hand; but I shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non drive them from this shelter. The other places usually alledged speak only, either of divine and <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural truths</hi> to be believed, or else of <hi>works of grace or worship</hi> to be performed, as of necessity unto salvation; which is not to the point in issue. For it is freely conscised, that in things of such nature <hi>the holy Scripture</hi> is, and so we are to account it, a most <hi>absolute sufficient</hi> direction. Upon which ground we heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all <hi>humane traditions,</hi> devised and intended as <hi>supplements</hi> to <hi>the doctrine of faith</hi> contained in the <hi>Bible,</hi> and annexed as <hi>Codicils</hi> to the holy <hi>Testament</hi> of Christ, for to supply the defects thereof. The question is wholly about things in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51860:180"/>
their nature <hi>indifferent</hi>; such as are the use of our <hi>food, raiment,</hi> and the like, about which <hi>the common acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of life are chiefly conversant: Whether in the choice and use of such things, we may not be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times sufficiently guided by the light of <hi>reason</hi> and the common rules of <hi>discretion</hi>; but that we must be able (and are so bound to do, or else we <hi>sin</hi>) for every thing <hi>we do</hi> in such matters, to deduce our <hi>warrant</hi> from some place or other of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before <hi>the Scriptures</hi> were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <hi>ten,</hi> it pleased God by <hi>visions,</hi> and <hi>dreams,</hi> and other like <hi>revelations,</hi> immediately to make known his good pleasure to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> and by them unto the People: which kind of <hi>revelations</hi> served them to all the same intents and purposes, whereto the sacred <hi>Scriptures</hi> now do us, <hi>viz.</hi> to instruct them what they should <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>do</hi> for his better <hi>service,</hi> and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of their own <hi>salvations.</hi>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:51860:180"/>
Now as it were unreasonable for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man to think, that they either had or did expect an <hi>immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> from God every time they <hi>eat,</hi> or <hi>drank,</hi> or <hi>bought,</hi> or <hi>sold,</hi> or did any other of <hi>the common acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of life, for the warranting of each of those particular actions to their Consciences; no less unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it is to think, that we should now expect the like <hi>warrant</hi> from <hi>the Scriptures</hi> for the doing of the like actions. Without all doubt <hi>the law of nature,</hi> and <hi>the light of reason,</hi> was <hi>the rule</hi> whereby they were guided for the most part in such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which the wisdome of God would never have left in them or us, as a <hi>principal relick</hi> of his decayed <hi>image</hi> in us, if he had not meant that we should make use of it for <hi>the direction</hi> of our lives and actions thereby. Certainly God never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused any <hi>power</hi> into any creature, whereof he intended not some <hi>use.</hi> Else, what shall we say of <hi>the Indies</hi> and other barbarous Nations, to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51860:181"/>
whom God never vouchsafed <hi>the lively Oracles</hi> of his written word? Must we think that they were left <hi>a lawless people,</hi> without any <hi>Rule</hi> at all whereby to order their <hi>actions</hi>? How then come they to be guilty of <hi>transgression</hi>? For where there is <hi>no law,</hi> there can be no <hi>transgression.</hi> Or how cometh it about that their <hi>consciences</hi> should at any time, or in any case, either <hi>accuse</hi> them, or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse</hi> them, if they had no <hi>guide</hi> nor <hi>rule</hi> to walk by? But if we must grant they had <hi>a Rule</hi> (and there is no way, you see, but grant it we must;) then we must also of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty grant, that there is some <hi>other Rule</hi> for humane actions besides <hi>the written word</hi>; for that we presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed these Nations to have wanted. Which <hi>Rule,</hi> what other could it be than <hi>the Law of Nature,</hi> and of <hi>right reason,</hi> imprinted <hi>in their hearts</hi>? Which is as truly <hi>the Law</hi> and <hi>Word of God,</hi> as is that which is printed <hi>in our Bibles.</hi> So long as our <hi>actions</hi> are <hi>warranted</hi> either by
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51860:181"/>
the one or the other, we cannot be said to want <hi>the warrant of God's Word: Nec differet Scriptura an ratione consistat,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian</hi>; it mattereth not much from whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both we have our <hi>direction,</hi> so long as we have it from either.</p>
                  <p>You see then those men are in a great errour, who make the holy Scriptures the <hi>sole rule</hi> of all humane actions whatsoever. For the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance whereof, there was never yet produced any piece of an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either from <hi>reason,</hi> or from <hi>authority</hi> of holy writ, or from the <hi>testimony</hi> either of the ancient <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> or of other classical <hi>Divines</hi> of later times; which may not be clearly and abundantly answered, to the satisfaction of any rational man not extremely fore-possessed with prejudice.
<q>They who think to salve the matter by this <hi>mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that at leastwise our actions ought to be framed according to those <hi>general rules</hi> of <hi>the law of Nature,</hi> which are here and there
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51860:182"/>
in the Scriptures dispersedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained (as <hi>viz. That we should do, as we would be done to; That all things be done decently and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and unto edification; That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done against conscience,</hi> and the like) speak somewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to <hi>the truth,</hi> but little to <hi>the purpose.</hi> For they consider not, First, that these <hi>general rules</hi> are but <hi>occasionally</hi> and <hi>incidentally</hi> mentioned in Scripture, rather to manifest unto us <hi>a former,</hi> than to lay upon us <hi>a new obligation. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> that those <hi>rules</hi> had been of force for the ordering of mens actions, though <hi>the Scripture</hi> had never <hi>expressed</hi> them; and were of such force before <hi>those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> were written, wherein they are now <hi>expressed.</hi> For they bind not originally <hi>qua scripta,</hi> but <hi>qua justa</hi>; becuase they are <hi>righteous,</hi> not because they are <hi>written. Thirdly,</hi> that an action conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to these <hi>general Rules</hi> might not be condemned as <hi>sinful,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51860:182"/>
the doer thereof should look at those rules meerly as they are the dictates of <hi>the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>; and should not be able to vouch his <hi>warrant</hi> for it from any place of <hi>Scripture,</hi> neither should have at the time of the doing thereof any present thought or consideration of any such place. The contrary whereunto, I permit to any man's reasonable judgment, if it be not desperately <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>uncharitable</hi> to affirm. <hi>Lastly,</hi> that if mens actions done agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to those <hi>Rules</hi> are said to be <hi>of faith,</hi> precisely for this reason, because those rules are contained in <hi>the word:</hi> then it will follow, that before those <hi>particular Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> were written, wherein any of those <hi>Rules</hi> are first delivered, every action done according to those rules had been done <hi>without faith</hi> (there being as yet <hi>no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> for it) and consequently had been a sin. So that by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it had been a sin (before the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51860:183"/>
witing of S. <hi>Matthew's Gospel</hi>) for any man to have done to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as he would they should do to him; and it had been a sin (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the writing of <hi>the former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to the Corinthians</hi>) for any man to have done any thing <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently</hi> and <hi>orderly</hi>; supposing these <hi>two Rules</hi> to be in those <hi>two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> first mentioned: because (this supposed) there could then have been no warrant brought from <hi>the Scriptures</hi> for so doing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Well then, we see the former Opinion will by no means hold, neither in <hi>the rigour</hi> of it, nor yet in <hi>the mitigation.</hi>
                     </q> We are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to beware of it, and that so much the more heedfully, because of the <hi>evil consequents</hi> and effects that is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue from it; to wit, a world of <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions,</hi> uncharitable <hi>censures,</hi> bitter <hi>contentions, contempt</hi> of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, <hi>perplexities</hi> of conscience. <hi>First,</hi> it filleth mens heads with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>superstitious</hi> conceits, making them to cast <hi>impurity</hi> upon sundry
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51860:183"/>
things, which yet are <hi>lawful</hi> to as many as use them lawfully. For the taking away of <hi>the indifferency</hi> of any thing that is indifferent, is in truth <hi>superstition,</hi> whether either of the two ways it be done; either by <hi>requiring</hi> it as <hi>necessary,</hi> or by <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding</hi> it as <hi>unlawful.</hi> He that condemneth a thing as <hi>utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,</hi> which yet indeed is <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi> and so lawful, is <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>superstition,</hi> as well as he that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth a thing as <hi>absolutely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,</hi> which yet indeed is but <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi> and so arbitrary. They of <hi>the Church of Rome,</hi> and some in <hi>our Church,</hi> as they go upon quite contrary <hi>grounds,</hi> yet both <hi>false</hi>; so they run into quite contrary <hi>errours,</hi> and both <hi>superstitious.</hi> They decline too much on <hi>the left hand,</hi> denying to <hi>holy Scripture</hi> that <hi>perfection</hi> which of right it ought to have; of containing all appertaining to that <hi>supernatural doctrine</hi> of faith and holiness, which God hath revealed to his Church for the attainment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51860:184"/>
salvation; whereupon they would impose upon Christian people, &amp; that with an opinion of <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,</hi> many things which <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> require not; and that is a <hi>superstition.</hi> These wry too much on <hi>the right hand,</hi> ascribing to the <hi>holy Scripture</hi> such a kind of <hi>perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> as it cannot have; of being the sole directour of all <hi>humane actions</hi> whatsoever: whereupon they <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid</hi> unto Christian people, and that under the name of <hi>sin,</hi> sundry things which the holy <hi>Scripture</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not; and that is a <hi>superstition</hi> too.</p>
                  <p>From which <hi>superstition</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in the second place, <hi>uncharitable censuring</hi>; as evermore they that are the most <hi>superstitious,</hi> are the most <hi>supercilious.</hi> No such severe <hi>censurers</hi> of our blessed Saviour's person and actions, as the <hi>superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Scribes and Phariseees were. In this Chapter, the special fault, which the Apostle blameth in the <hi>weak ones</hi> (who were somewhat <hi>supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously</hi>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:51860:184"/>
affected) was their <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>uncharitable judging</hi> of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And common and daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience among our selves sheweth how freely some men spend their <hi>censures</hi> upon so many of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as <hi>without scruple</hi> do any of those things, which they upon false grounds have <hi>superstitiously</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as <hi>utterly unlawful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then <hi>thirdly,</hi> as unjust <hi>cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> are commonly entertained with <hi>scorn</hi> and contumely; they that so liberally condemn their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>prophaneness,</hi> are by them again as freely slouted for their <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseness:</hi> and so whiles both parties <hi>please themselves</hi> in their own ways, they cease not mutually to <hi>provoke</hi> and scandalize and exasperate one the other, pursuing their private spleens so far, till they break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>open contentions</hi> and oppositions. Thus it stood in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> when this Epistle was written. They <hi>judged</hi> one another, and <hi>despised</hi> one another, to the great disturbance of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51860:185"/>
                     <hi>the Churches peace,</hi> which gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to our Apostles whole dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course in this Chapter. And how far the like <hi>censurings</hi> and <hi>despisings</hi> have embittered <hi>the spirits,</hi> and whetted both <hi>the tongues</hi> and <hi>pens</hi> of learned men one against another in our own Church; the stirs that have been long since <hi>raised,</hi> and are still <hi>upheld</hi> by the factious opposers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our <hi>Ecclesiastical constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, government,</hi> and <hi>ceremonies,</hi> will not suffer us to be ignorant. Most of which stirs, I verily perswade my self, had been long ere this either wholly buried in silence, or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise prettily well quieted, if <hi>the weakness</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> of the errour whereof we now speak, had been more timely discovered, and more <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>frequently</hi> made known to the world than it hath been.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let that Doctrine be once admitted, and all <hi>humane au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> will soon be <hi>despised.</hi> The commands of <hi>Parents, Masters, and Princes,</hi> which many times require
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51860:185"/>
both <hi>secrecy</hi> and <hi>expedition,</hi> shall be taken into slow deliberation, and the <hi>equity</hi> of them sifted by those that are bound to <hi>obey,</hi> though they know no cause why, so long as they know no cause to the contrary. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licata est obedientia, quae transit in causam deliberativam.</hi> It is <hi>a nice</hi> obedience in St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s judgment, yea rather <hi>troublesome</hi> and odious, that is over-curious in <hi>discussing</hi> the commands of <hi>superiours,</hi> boggling at every thing that is enjoyned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring <hi>a why for every wherefore,</hi> and unwilling to stir until the <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> and <hi>expediency</hi> of the thing commanded shall be demonstrated by some manifest <hi>reason</hi> or undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>authority</hi> from the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> The admitting of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine would cast such a snare upon men of weak <hi>judgments,</hi> but <hi>tender consciences,</hi> as they should never be able to unwind themselves again. Mens <hi>daily occasions</hi> for themselves or friends, and <hi>the necessities of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon life,</hi> require the doing of <hi>a

thousand things</hi> within the compass of a few days, for which it would puzzle the best <hi>Textman</hi> that liveth, readily to bethink himself of <hi>a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the Bible,</hi> clear enough to satisfie a scrupulous conscience of <hi>the lawfulness</hi> and <hi>expediency</hi> of what he is about to do; for which, by hearkening to the rules of <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>discretion,</hi> he might receive easie and speedy resolution. In which cases if he should be bound to <hi>suspend</hi> his resolution, &amp; delay to do that which his own <hi>reason</hi> would tell him were presently needful to be done, until he could haply call to mind some <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> or <hi>example</hi> of Scipture for his warrant, what <hi>stops</hi> would it make in the course of his whole life? what <hi>languishings</hi> in the duties of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? how would it fill him with <hi>doubts</hi> and irresolutions, lead him into a maze of <hi>uncertainties,</hi> entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle him in a world of woful <hi>perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities,</hi> and (without the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, and better instruction) plunge him irrecoverably into the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51860:186"/>
gulph of <hi>despair</hi>? Since the chief end of the publication of <hi>the Gospel</hi> is to <hi>comfort</hi> the hearts, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and refresh the spirits of <hi>God's</hi> people, with the glad tidings of <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> from the spirit of <hi>bondage</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and of gracious <hi>acceptance</hi> with their God; to anoint them with <hi>the oyl of gladness,</hi> giving them <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for ashes,</hi> and instead of <hi>sackcloth</hi> girding them with <hi>joy:</hi> we may well suspect that <hi>Doctrine</hi> not to be <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical,</hi> which thus setteth the Consciences of men upon <hi>the rack,</hi> tortureth them with continual <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>perplexities,</hi> and prepareth them thereby unto <hi>hellish despair.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What are the dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of <hi>scrupling</hi> some indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Although difference of <hi>judgment</hi> should not alienate our <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> one from another, yet daily experience sheweth it doth. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that <hi>self-love,</hi> and <hi>envy,</hi> and other corruptions that abound in us, it is rarely seen that those men are of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51860:187"/>
                     <hi>one heart,</hi> that are of <hi>two minds.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> found it so with the <hi>Romans</hi> in his time: whilst some condemned that as <hi>unlawful,</hi> which others pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised as <hi>lawful</hi>; they <hi>judged</hi> one another, and <hi>despised</hi> one another, perpetually. And I doubt not, but any of us, that is any-whit-like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the wretched <hi>deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of man's heart,</hi> may easily conclude how hard a thing it is (if at all possible) not to think some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hardly of those men, that take <hi>the liberty</hi> to do such
<q>things as we judge <hi>unlawful.</hi> As for example; If we shall judge all <hi>walking</hi> into the fields, <hi>discoursing occasionally</hi> on the occurrences of the times, <hi>dressing of meat</hi> for dinner or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or even <hi>moderate recreations on the Lord's day,</hi> to be grievous <hi>prophanations of the Sabbath</hi>; how can we chuse but <hi>judge</hi> those men that use them to be grievous <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaners of God's Sabbath</hi>? And if such our <hi>judgment</hi> concerning <hi>these things</hi> should after prove to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51860:187"/>
be <hi>erroneous</hi>; then can it not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, but that such our <hi>judgment</hi> also concerning <hi>the persons</hi> must needs be <hi>uncharitable.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This mis-judging of things filleth the world with endless niceties and <hi>disputes,</hi> to the great disturbance of <hi>the Churches peace,</hi> which to every good man ought to be precious. The multiplying of <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>writings Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing of <hi>arguments</hi> with heat and opposition, doth rather <hi>lengthen</hi> than <hi>decide</hi> Controversies; and instead of destroying <hi>the old,</hi> begetteth <hi>new ones:</hi> whiles they that are <hi>in the wrong</hi> out of obstinacy <hi>will not,</hi> and they that stand <hi>for the truth</hi> out of Conscience <hi>dare not,</hi> may not <hi>yield</hi>; and so still the war goeth on.</p>
                  <p>And as to <hi>the publick peace</hi> of the Church, so is there also, <hi>thirdly,</hi> by this means great prejudice done to <hi>the peace</hi> and tranquillity of private <hi>mens Consciences</hi>; when by <hi>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory Doctrines</hi> of some strict and <hi>rigid masters</hi> the Souls of many a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51860:188"/>
well-meaning man are miserably disquieted with a thousand <hi>unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary scruples,</hi> and driven sometimes into very woful <hi>perplexities.</hi> Surely it can be no light matter thus to lay <hi>heavy burdens</hi> upon other mens shoulders, and to cast <hi>a snare</hi> upon their Consciences, by making <hi>the narrow way to Heaven</hi> narrower than ever God meant it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Hereby Christian <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> come to be robbed of a great part of that <hi>honour</hi> that is due unto them from their people, both in their <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>subjection.</hi> For when they shall see cause to exercise over us that <hi>power</hi> that God hath left them in <hi>indifferent things,</hi> by commanding such or such thing to be done, as namely, <hi>wearing</hi> of a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice, <hi>kneeling</hi> at the Communion, and the like: if now we in our own thoughts have already <hi>prejudged</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the things so commanded to be <hi>unlawful,</hi> it cannot be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:51860:188"/>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> If these things be so, how comes it to pass that so many godly men should incline so much to this way?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> But you will say, if these things were so, how should it then come to pass that so many men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to <hi>godliness</hi> (and <hi>thousands</hi> of them doubtless such as they <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi>; for it were an uncharitable thing to charge them all with <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie</hi>) should so often and so grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously offend this way? To omit those two more <hi>universal causes</hi>; Almighty <hi>God's permission</hi> first, whose good pleasure it is for sundry wise and gracious ends, to exercise <hi>his Church,</hi> during her warfare here, with <hi>heresies</hi> and <hi>scandals:</hi> And then the <hi>wiliness</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> who cunningly observeth whether way our hearts incline most, to <hi>loosness,</hi> or to <hi>strictness,</hi> and then frameth his <hi>temptations</hi> thereafter: So he can but put <hi>us out of the way,</hi> it is no great matter to him <hi>on whether hand</hi> it be; he hath <hi>his end</hi> howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51860:189"/>
Nor to insist upon sundry more <hi>particular causes</hi>; as namely, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural proneness in all men to <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi>; in many an <hi>affectation</hi> of <hi>singularity,</hi> to go beyond the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary sort of people in something or other; the difficulty of shunning one without running into <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary extreme</hi>; the great force of <hi>education</hi> and <hi>custome</hi>; besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold <hi>abuses, offences,</hi> and <hi>provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> arising from <hi>the carriage</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the rest; I shall note but these two only, as the <hi>two</hi> great <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> of Errour (to which also most of the other may be reduced) <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and <hi>Partiality</hi>; from neither of which God's dearest Servants and Children are in this life wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ignorance</hi> first is a fruitful Mother of <hi>Errours; Ye err not knowing the Scriptures, Matth.</hi> 22. Yet not so much <hi>gross ignorance</hi> neither; I mean not that. For your meer <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro</hi>'s, what they err, they err <hi>for company</hi>; they <hi>judge</hi> not at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51860:189"/>
according to <hi>the appearance,</hi> nor yet <hi>righteous judgment:</hi> They only <hi>run on</hi> with the <hi>herd,</hi> and <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> as they are <hi>led,</hi> be it right or wrong, and never trouble themselves farther. But by <hi>Ignorance</hi> I mean <hi>weakness of judgment,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in a <hi>disproportion</hi> between <hi>the affections</hi> and <hi>the understanding</hi>; when a man is very <hi>earnest,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al very <hi>shallow</hi>; readeth much, and heareth much, and thinketh that he knoweth much, but hath not <hi>the judgment</hi> to sever truth from fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, nor to <hi>discern</hi> between a sound <hi>argument</hi> and a captious <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy.</hi> And so for want of ability to examine the soundness and strength of those <hi>principles</hi> from whence he fetcheth his <hi>conclusions,</hi> he is easily carried away, as our Apostle else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where speaketh, with <hi>vain words</hi> and <hi>empty arguments.</hi> As St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> said of <hi>Donatus, Rationes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripuit,</hi> he catcheth hold of some reasons (as <hi>wranglers</hi> will <hi>catch</hi> at a small thing, rather than <hi>yield</hi> from
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51860:190"/>
their opinions) <hi>quas considerantes, verisimiles esse potius quam veras invenimus,</hi> which saith he, we found to have more <hi>shew of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> at the first appearance, than <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of truth</hi> after they were well considered of.</p>
                  <p>And I dare say, whosoever shall peruse with a judicious and unpartial eye most of those <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> that in this daring Age have been thrust into the world against <hi>the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of the Church, against <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Government</hi> (to pass by things of lesser regard and usefulness, and more open to <hi>exception</hi> and <hi>abuse,</hi> yet, so far as I can understand, unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned as things <hi>utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi>; such as are <hi>lusorious lots, dancing, Stage-plays,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of like nature) when he shall have drained out the bitter <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives,</hi> unmannerly <hi>jeers,</hi> petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant <hi>girding</hi> at those that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, impertinent <hi>digressions,</hi> but above all those most bold and <hi>perverse wrestings</hi> of holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:51860:190"/>
wherewith such Books are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely stuffed, he shall find that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle poor remainder that is left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind to contain nothing but <hi>vain words and empty arguments.</hi> For when these great Undertakers have snatch'd up the Bucklers, as if they would make it good against all comers, that such and such things are <hi>utterly unlawful,</hi> and therefore ought in all reason and conscience to bring such <hi>proofs</hi> as will come up to that <hi>conclusion, Quid dignum tanto</hi>? very seldome shall you hear from them any other Arguments, than such as will conclude but an <hi>inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency</hi> at the most. As, that they are apt to <hi>give scandal</hi>; that they carry with them an <hi>appearance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>; that they are often <hi>occasions of sin</hi>; that they are <hi>not commanded</hi> in the Word, and such like. Which <hi>Objections,</hi> even where they are <hi>just,</hi> are not of force (no not taken <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> much less any of them <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly</hi>) to prove a thing to be <hi>utterly unlawful.</hi> And yet are they glad
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51860:191"/>
many times, rather than sit out, to play very <hi>small Game,</hi> and to make use of <hi>Arguments</hi> yet <hi>weaker</hi> than these, and such as will not reach so far as to prove a bare <hi>inexpediency:</hi> As, that they were invented by <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>; that they have been abused in <hi>Popery,</hi> and other such like: which, to my understanding, is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>strong presumption,</hi> that they have taken a very <hi>weak cause</hi> in hand, and such as is wholly destitute of sound proof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether what the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> have <hi>determined</hi> may be <hi>altered</hi> to <hi>satisfie</hi> private men?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> While things are in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>private men</hi> may, if any thing seem to them <hi>inexpedient,</hi> modestly tender their <hi>thoughts,</hi> together with the <hi>reason</hi> thereof, to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those that are in <hi>authority,</hi> to whose care and wisdom it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in prescribing any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>indifferent things,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with all just advisedness and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51860:191"/>
moderation, that so the <hi>Subject</hi> may be encouraged to perform that <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> with chearfulness, which of necessity he must perform howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. It concerneth <hi>Superiours</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to look well to the <hi>expediency</hi> and <hi>inexpediency</hi> of what they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn in indifferent things; wherein if there be a fault, it must lie upon their account; <hi>the necessity of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is to us a sufficient discharge in that behalf. Only it were good we did remember, that they are to give up that account <hi>to God only,</hi> and <hi>not to us.</hi> But after that things are once concluded and <hi>established</hi> by publick Authority, <hi>Acts</hi> passed, and <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi> made concerning the same, and the will and pleasure <hi>of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er powers</hi> sufficiently made known thererein; then for <hi>private men</hi> to put in their vie, and with <hi>unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diligence</hi> to call in question the <hi>decency</hi> or <hi>expediency</hi> of the things so established, yea with <hi>intolerable pride</hi> to refuse <hi>obedience</hi> thereunto meerly upon this pretension, that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51860:192"/>
they are <hi>undecent</hi> or <hi>inexpedient,</hi> is it self the most <hi>indecent</hi> and <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi> thing that can be imagined.</p>
                  <p>For that the fear of <hi>offending a private brother,</hi> is a thing not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in comparison of the duty of <hi>obedience to a publick Governour,</hi> might be shown so apparently by sundry arguments, if we had time to <hi>enlarge</hi> and illustrate them, as might sufficiently <hi>convince</hi> the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any man not wilfully obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in that point. I shall only crave leave briefly to touch at some of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First</hi> then, when <hi>Governours</hi> shall have appointed what seemed to them <hi>expedient,</hi> and <hi>private men</hi> shall refuse to observe the same, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it to be <hi>inexpedient,</hi> who shall judge thereof? Either they themselves that take the exceptions must be <hi>judges,</hi> which is both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable and preposterous; or else <hi>every man</hi> must be his own judge, which were to overthrow all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to bring in a confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51860:192"/>
every man to do what is <hi>good in his own eyes</hi>; or else <hi>the known Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> must judge, and then you know what will follow, even to <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> and <hi>obey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To allow men, under the pretence of <hi>inexpediency,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of <hi>some offence</hi> that may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thereat, to disobey <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> made by those that are in Authority, were the next way to cut the sinews of all <hi>Authority,</hi> and to bring both <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> into contempt. For what <hi>Law</hi> ever was made, or can be made so just and so reasonable, but some man or other either did, or might take offence thereat: And what man that is disposed to disobey, but may pretend one <hi>inexpediency</hi> or other, wherewith to countenance out such his <hi>disobedience</hi>?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is agreed by consent of all that handle the matter of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> that we may not commit any sin whatsoever, be it never so small, for the avoiding of any <hi>scandal,</hi> be it
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51860:193"/>
never so <hi>great:</hi> But to <hi>disobey</hi> law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority in lawful things, is a <hi>sin</hi> against the <hi>fifth Commandment.</hi> Therefore we may not redeem a <hi>scandal</hi> by such our <hi>disobedience,</hi> nor refuse to do the thing command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by such <hi>Authority,</hi> whosoever should take offence thereat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Though <hi>lawfulness</hi> and <hi>unlawfulness</hi> be not, yet <hi>expediency</hi> and <hi>inexpediency</hi> are (as we heard) capable of the degrees of <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less</hi>; and then in all reason, of <hi>two inexpedient things</hi> we are to do that which is <hi>less inexpedient,</hi> for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of that which is more <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.</hi> Say then there be an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expediency</hi> in doing the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Authority, when a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is thereby offended; is there not a greater <hi>inexpediency</hi> in <hi>not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it, when the <hi>Magistrate</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>disobeyed</hi>? Is it not more <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi> and conducing to the <hi>common good,</hi> that a <hi>publick Magistrate</hi> should be obeyed in a <hi>just command,</hi> than that a <hi>private person</hi> should be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51860:193"/>
gratified in a <hi>causless scruple</hi>?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When by refusing <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to the lawful commands of our <hi>Superiours,</hi> we think to shun <hi>the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of one or two</hi> weak brethren, we do in truth incur thereby a far <hi>more grievous scandal,</hi> by giving <hi>offence to hundreds</hi> of others, whose Consciences by our disobedience will be emboldned to that, whereto cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature is but too too prone, to affront the Magistrate, and <hi>despise the Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> Where we are not able to discharge both, <hi>debts of justice</hi> are to be payed before <hi>debts of charity.</hi> Now the duty of <hi>obedience</hi> is <hi>debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum justitiae,</hi> and a matter of <hi>right</hi>; my Superiour may challenge it at my hands as his due, and I do him <hi>wrong</hi> if I withhold it from him. But the care of not giving offence is but <hi>debitum charitatis,</hi> and a matter but of <hi>courtesie.</hi> I am to perform it to my brother <hi>in love,</hi> when I see cause, but he cannot challenge it from me as <hi>his right</hi>; nor can justly
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51860:194"/>
say I do him <hi>wrong</hi> if I neglect it. It is therefore no more lawful for me to <hi>disobey</hi> the lawful command of a <hi>Superiour,</hi> to prevent thereby the <hi>offence</hi> of one or a few <hi>brethren,</hi> than it is lawful for me to do one man <hi>wrong,</hi> to do another man a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie withal; or than it is lawful for me to rob the <hi>Exchequer</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve an <hi>Hospital.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I see not yet how any of these <hi>six Reasons</hi> can be fairly avoided; and yet (which would be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) if but <hi>any one</hi> of them hold good, it is enough to <hi>carry the cause</hi>; and therefore I hope there need be no more said in this matter. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then, for the point of <hi>practice</hi> (which is the main thing I aimed at in the choice of <hi>this Text,</hi> and my whole Meditations thereon) we may take our direction in these <hi>three Rules,</hi> easie to be understood and remembred, and not hard to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in our practice, if we will but bring our good wills thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:51860:194"/>
                     <hi>First,</hi> If God command we must <hi>submit</hi> without any more ado, and not trouble our selves about <hi>the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency,</hi> or so much as about <hi>the unlawfulness</hi>: for both, <hi>Abraham</hi> never disputed whether it were <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi> for him, nor yet whether it were lawful for him to sacrifice his Son or no, when once it appeared to him that God would have it so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If our <hi>Superiours,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with lawful Authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, command us any thing, we <hi>may,</hi> and (where we have <hi>just cause of doubt</hi>) we <hi>ought</hi> to enquire into <hi>the unlawfulness</hi> thereof; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with such <hi>anxious curiosity,</hi> as if we desired to find out some <hi>loop-hole</hi> whereby to evade, but with such <hi>modest ingenuity,</hi> as may witness to God and the World the unfeigned sincerity of our desires, both to <hi>fear God,</hi> and to <hi>honour those</hi> that he hath set over us. And if ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving used ordinary <hi>moral diligence, bonâ fide,</hi> to inform our selves the best we can, there appear no <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:51860:195"/>
in it, we are then also to <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> without any more ado, never troubling our selves farther to enquire whether it be <hi>expedient,</hi> yea or no. Let them that <hi>command</hi> us look to that; for it is they must <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for it,</hi> and not we.</p>
                  <p>But then <hi>thirdly,</hi> where <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> hath left us <hi>free,</hi> no <hi>command,</hi> either of God, or of those that are set ever us under God, having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed any thing to us in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, there it is at our own <hi>liberty,</hi> and <hi>choice</hi> to do as we shall think good. Yet are we not left so loose, as that we may do what we list, so as the thing be but <hi>lawful</hi> (for that were <hi>licenciousness,</hi> and not <hi>liberty</hi>;) but we must ever do that, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the exigence of <hi>present circumstances</hi> (so far as all <hi>the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> we have will serve us to judge) shall seem to us <hi>most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi> and profitable to mutual <hi>edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> This is the way; God give us all grace to walk in it: so shall we bring <hi>glory</hi> to him, and to our <hi>selves
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51860:195"/>
comfort:</hi> so shall we further his <hi>work</hi> onward, and our own <hi>account</hi> at the last.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether they that have taken the <hi>Covenant</hi> may Renounce it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ. Thirdly,</hi> Beware of <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging thy self to sin.</hi> It is a fearful thing when sin hath got <hi>a tie</hi> upon a man. Then is one properly <hi>in the snare of the Devil,</hi> when he hath him as it were in a string, and may <hi>lead him captive</hi> to what measure of <hi>presumption</hi> he will. And sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ways may a man thus entangle himself; by a <hi>Verbal,</hi> by a <hi>Real,</hi> by a <hi>sinful Engagement.</hi> He shall do best to keep himself out of all these <hi>snares:</hi> but if once he be in, there is no way out again but one, even this, <hi>To loose his pledge,</hi> to break in sunder <hi>the bonds</hi> wherein he is tied, as <hi>Sampson</hi> did the <hi>green withs,</hi> and to cast a way those cords from him.</p>
                  <p>A man hath bound himself rashly by some <hi>promise, vow,</hi> or <hi>covenant,</hi> to do something he <hi>may not do,</hi> or
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51860:196"/>
not to do something he <hi>ought to do,</hi> he is now <hi>engaged</hi> in a sin; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath got <hi>this tie</hi> upon him: And though <hi>his Conscience</hi> tell him he cannot proceed without <hi>sin,</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his <hi>Vow,</hi> or his <hi>Oath,</hi> he is <hi>wilful,</hi> and must on. It was <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s Case for taking off the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi>'s head; it was <hi>against his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> to do it, for he knew he had <hi>not deserved</hi> it; yea, and it was <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his mind</hi> too to do it; for the Text faith, <hi>he was exceeding sorry</hi> that his Neece should put him upon it. But yet, saith the story withal, <hi>for his Oath sake,</hi> and because <hi>the great ones</hi> about him should not say but the King would be <hi>as big as his word,</hi> he resolved it should be done, and gave <hi>commandment</hi> accordingly to have it done. This I call <hi>a Verbal Engagement.</hi>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether we English men may think our selves bound by the Solemn League and Covenant?</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Without betraying the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which by our Protestation we are bound, and in the third Article of this Covenant must swear, <hi>with our lives and fortunes to preserve.</hi> To which Liberty the imposition of a new Oath, other than is establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Act of Parliament, is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>the Petition of Right,</hi> and by the Lords and Commons in their <hi>Declarations</hi> acknowledged to be contrary.</p>

Without acknowledging in the imposers a greater power than, for ought that appeareth to us, hath been in former times challenged; or can consist with our former Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (if we rightly understand it) is sundry the most material branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es thereof.</p>
                  <p>Neither, <hi>secondly,</hi> are we satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, although the Covenant should not be imposed on us at all, but only recommended to us, and then left to our choice.</p>

How we should in wisdom and duty (being Subjects) of our own accord and free will, enter into a Covenant, wherein he, whose Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects we are, is in any wise concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without his consent, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed or reasonably presumed.

How we can (now that his Majesty hath by his publick <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> sufficiently made known his pleasure in that behalf) enter into a Covenant, the taking whereof he hath expresly forbidden, without forfeiting that Obedience, which (as we are perswaded) by our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Allegiance and former Oaths we owe unto all such his Majesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as are not in our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions repugnant to the will of God, or the positive Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What shall a man do, that scruples in Conscience what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity enjoyns as unlawful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> But then <hi>thirdly,</hi> if <hi>the liberty</hi> of the agent be determined by the command of some <hi>superiour power</hi> to whom he oweth <hi>obedience,</hi> so as he is not now <hi>sui juris ad hoc,</hi> to do or not to do at his own choice, but to do what he is <hi>commanded:</hi> this one circumstance quite altereth the whole case, and now he is bound in Conscience to do <hi>the thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi>; his <hi>doubtfulness</hi> of mind, whether that thing be <hi>lawful</hi> or no, notwithstanding. To do that whereof he <hi>doubteth,</hi> where he hath <hi>free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> to leave it undone, bringeth upon him (as we have already shewn) the guilt of <hi>wilful trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression</hi>; but not so, where he is not left to his own <hi>liberty.</hi> And where <hi>lawful authority</hi> prescribeth <hi>in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terutram partem,</hi> there the liberty <hi>ad utramque partem contradictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> is taken away, from so many as are under that Authority. If they
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51860:198"/>
that are over them have determined it <hi>one way,</hi> it is not thenceforth any more at their choice, whether they will take <hi>that way</hi> or <hi>the contrary:</hi> but they must go the way that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them, without gainsaying or grudging. And if in the deed done at <hi>the command</hi> of one that is endued with lawful Authority there be a <hi>sin,</hi> it must go on his score that requireth it wrongfully, not on his that doth but his duty in obeying. A Prince commandeth his <hi>Subjects</hi> to serve in his Wars; it may be the quarrel is <hi>unjust,</hi> it may be there may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the understanding of the Subject great likely hoods of such <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,</hi> yet may <hi>the Subject</hi> for all that <hi>fight</hi> in that quarrel; yea, he is bound in Conscience so to do: nay, he is deep in disloyalty and treason if <hi>he refuse</hi> the service, whatsoever pretentions he may make of <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> for such refusal. Neither need that fear trouble him, left he should bring upon himself the guilt of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood</hi>; for <hi>the blood</hi> that is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51860:198"/>
unrighteously shed in that quarrel, he must answer for that <hi>set him on work,</hi> not he that <hi>spilt it.</hi> And truly it is a great wonder to me, that any man endued with understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that is able in any measure to weigh the force of those <hi>precepts</hi> and <hi>reasons</hi> which bind <hi>inferiours</hi> to yield obedience to their <hi>superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,</hi> should be otherwise minded in cases of like nature. Whatsoever is commanded us by those whom God hath set over us, either in Church, Commonwealth, or Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (<hi>Quod tamen non sit certum dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicere Deo,</hi> saith St. <hi>Bernard</hi>) which is not evidently contrary to <hi>the Law</hi> and will of God, ought to be of us received and <hi>obeyed</hi> no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, than as if <hi>God</hi> himself had commanded it, because God himself hath commanded us to <hi>obey the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er powers,</hi> and to <hi>submit our selves to their ordinances.</hi> Say it be not well done of them to command it, <hi>Sed enim quid hoc refert tuâ</hi>? saith he, What is that to thee? Let them
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51860:199"/>
look to that whom it concerneth: <hi>Tolle quod tuum est, &amp; vade.</hi> Do thou what is thine own part faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and never trouble thy self fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Ipsum, quem pro Deo habemus, tanquam Deum in his quae apertè non sunt contra Deum audire debemus; Bernard</hi> still. God's Vicegerents must be heard and <hi>obeyed</hi> in all things that are not manifestly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>the revealed will</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p>But the thing required is <hi>against my conscience,</hi> may some say, &amp; I may not go against my <hi>conscience</hi> for any mans pleasure. Judge I pray you what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versness is this, when the B. Apostle commandeth thee <hi>to obey for Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake,</hi> that thou shouldst <hi>disobey,</hi> and that for <hi>Conscience sake</hi> too: He chargeth thee upon thy Conscience to <hi>be subject,</hi> and thou pretendest thy Conscience to <hi>free thee</hi> from subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. This by the way; now to the point. Thou sayest it is <hi>against thy Conscience</hi>; I say again, that (in the case whereof we now speak, the case of <hi>doubtfulness</hi>) it is not against thy Conscience: For doubting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51860:199"/>
is <hi>motus indifferens in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramque partem contradictionis,</hi> when the mind is held in suspence between <hi>two ways,</hi> uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both to take to; when the Scales hang even (as I said before) and <hi>in aequilibrio,</hi> without any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table propension or inclination to the one side more than to the other. And surely where things hang thus <hi>even,</hi> if <hi>the weight of Authority</hi> will not cast the Scale either way, we may well suppose that either <hi>the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> is made very <hi>light,</hi> or else there is a great fault in <hi>the beam.</hi> Know (Brethren) the <hi>gainsaying Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> is one thing, and the <hi>doubting Conscience</hi> another. That which is done <hi>repugnante conscientiâ,</hi> the Conscience of the doer flatly <hi>gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying</hi> it, that is indeed <hi>against a man's Conscience,</hi> the Conscience ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already passed <hi>a definitive sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> the one way, and no respect or circumstance whatsoever can free it from sin. But that which is done <hi>dubitante conscientiâ,</hi> the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51860:200"/>
of the doer only doubting of it, and no more; that is in truth no more <hi>against a man's Conscience</hi> than <hi>with</hi> it (the Conscience as yet not having passed <hi>a definitive sentence</hi> either way;) and such an action may either be <hi>a sin,</hi> or <hi>no sin,</hi> according to those qualifications which it may receive from other respects and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. If the Conscience have already passed <hi>a judgment</hi> upon a thing, and <hi>condemned</hi> it as simply unlawful; in that case it is true, that a man ought not by any means to do that thing, no not at <hi>the command</hi> of any Magistrate; no, not although his <hi>Conscience</hi> have pronounced a wrong <hi>sentence,</hi> and erred in that judgment; for then he should do it <hi>repugnante conscientiâ,</hi> he should go directly against his own <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which he ought not to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever come of it. In such a case certainiy he may not obey <hi>the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi>; yet let him know thus much withal, that he sinneth too in <hi>disobeying</hi> the Magistate; from which
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51860:200"/>
sin the following of <hi>the judgment</hi> of his own <hi>Conscience</hi> cannot acquit him. And this is that fearful <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity</hi> whereof I spake, whereunto many a man casteth himself by his own <hi>errour</hi> and <hi>obstinacy,</hi> that he can neither go <hi>with</hi> his Conscience, nor <hi>against</hi> it, but he shall sin. And who can help it, if a man will needs cherish <hi>an errour,</hi> and persist in it? But now if <hi>the Conscience</hi> be only <hi>doubtful,</hi> whether a thing be <hi>lawful</hi> or no, but have not as yet passed a <hi>peremptory judgment</hi> against it (yea, although it rather incline to think it <hi>unlawful</hi>) in that case if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate shall <hi>command</hi> it to be done, the Subject with a good Conscience <hi>may</hi> do it; nay, he cannot with a good Conscience <hi>refuse</hi> to do it, though it be <hi>dubitante conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will yet say, that in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cases <hi>the safer part</hi> is to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen. So say I too; and am content <hi>that rule</hi> should decide <hi>this question</hi>; only let it be rightly applied. Thou
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51860:201"/>
thinkest it <hi>safer,</hi> where thou doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of the unlawfulness, <hi>to forbear</hi> than <hi>to do:</hi> As for example, if thou doubtest whether it be lawful <hi>to kneel</hi> at the Communion, it is safest in thy opinion therefore for thee <hi>not to kneel.</hi> So should I think too, if thou wert left meerly to thine own <hi>liberty.</hi> But thou dost not consider how thou art caught in thine own net, and how the edge of thine own weapon may be turned upon thee point-blank, not to be avoided, thus.</p>
                  <p>If Authority command thee <hi>to kneel,</hi> which whether it be lawful for thee to do, or not, <hi>thou doubtest</hi>; it cannot choose but thou must needs <hi>doubt</hi> also, whether thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est lawfully <hi>disobey,</hi> or not. Now then here apply thine own Rule, <hi>In dubiis pars tutior,</hi> and see what will come of it. Judge, since thou canst not but <hi>doubt</hi> in both cases, whether it be not <hi>the safer</hi> of the two, <hi>to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey</hi> doubtingly, than to <hi>disobey doubtingly. Tene certum, demitte incertum,</hi> is St. <hi>Gregory</hi> his rule,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51860:201"/>
where there is <hi>a certainty,</hi> and <hi>an uncertainty,</hi> let the uncertainty go, and hold to that which is certain. Now <hi>the general</hi> is <hi>certain,</hi> that thou art to obey <hi>the Magistrate</hi> in all things not contrary to the will of God; but <hi>the particular</hi> is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,</hi> whether the thing now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee by <hi>the Magistrate</hi> be contrary to the will of God; (I say uncertain <hi>to thee,</hi> because thou doubtest of it.) Deal <hi>safely</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and hold thee to that which is <hi>certain,</hi> and obey.</p>
                  <p>But thou wilt yet alledge, that <hi>the Apostle</hi> here condemneth the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any thing, not only with a <hi>gainsaying,</hi> but even with <hi>a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Conscience, because <hi>doubting</hi> also is contrary to <hi>faith</hi>; and <hi>he that doubteth is</hi> even for that <hi>condemned, if he eat.</hi> O beware of misapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Scripture!</hi> it is a thing easily done, but not so easily answered. I know not any one Gap that hath let in more, and more dangerous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours into the Church, than this,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51860:202"/>
That men take <hi>the word</hi> of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Text, fitted to <hi>particular oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,</hi> and to the condition of the <hi>times</hi> wherein they were written, and then <hi>apply</hi> them to themselves, and others, as they find them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due respect had to <hi>the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> that may be between those <hi>times</hi> and <hi>cases,</hi> and the present. Sundry things spoken of in Scripture agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to that <hi>infancy</hi> of the Church, would sort very ill with the Church in her fulness of <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>; and sundry directions very expedient in times of <hi>persecution,</hi> and when Believers lived mingled with <hi>Infidels,</hi> would be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonably urged, where the Church is in a <hi>peaceable</hi> and <hi>flourishing</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, enjoying the <hi>favour,</hi> and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under <hi>the protection</hi> of graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and religious Princes. Thus <hi>the Constitutions</hi> that the Apostles made concerning <hi>Deacons</hi> and <hi>Widows</hi> in those primitive times, are with much importunity, but very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely withal, urged by <hi>the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinarians:</hi>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:51860:202"/>
And sundry other like things I might instance of this kind, worthy the discovery, but that I fear to grow tedious. Briefly then, the Apostles whole Discourse in this Chapter, and so wheresoever else he toucheth upon the point of <hi>Scandals,</hi> is to be understood only in that case where men are left <hi>to their own liberty</hi> in the use of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things: The <hi>Romans, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> and others to whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote about these matters, being not <hi>limited</hi> any way in the exercise of their <hi>liberty</hi> therein by any over-ruling <hi>Authority.</hi> But where the Magistrates have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and thought good upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture advice to <hi>impose Laws</hi> upon those that are under them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their <hi>liberty</hi> is (not <hi>infringed,</hi> as some unjustly complain, in the <hi>inward judgment,</hi> but only) <hi>limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in the <hi>outward exercise</hi> of it; there the Apostolical directions will not hold in the same <hi>absolute man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> as they were delivered to those
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51860:203"/>
whom they then concerned; but only in <hi>the equity</hi> of them, so far forth as the cases are alike, and with such meet <hi>qualifications</hi> and <hi>mitigations,</hi> as the difference of the cases otherwise doth require. So that a man ought not, out of private fancy, or meerly because he would not be observed for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as others do, or for any the like weak respects, to do that thing, of the <hi>lawfulness</hi> whereof he is not <hi>competently perswaded,</hi> where it is <hi>free</hi> for him to do otherwise; which was the case of these <hi>weak ones</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>the Romans,</hi> for whose sakes principally the Apostle gave these directions. But the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Magistrates intervening so, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the case, that such a forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as to them was necessary, is to as many of us as are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do this or that, altogether <hi>unlawful,</hi> in regard they were <hi>free,</hi> and we are bound, for the Reasons already shewn, which I now rehearse not. But you will
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51860:203"/>
yet say (for in point of <hi>obedience</hi> men are very loath to <hi>yield,</hi> so long as they can find any thing <hi>to plead</hi>) those that lay <hi>these burdens</hi> upon us, at leastwise should do well to satisfie <hi>our doubts,</hi> and to <hi>inform</hi> our Consciences concerning <hi>the lawfulness</hi> of what they enjoyn, that so we might render them <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> with better <hi>chearfulness.</hi> How willing are we sinful men to leave the blame of our miscarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges any where, rather than upon our selves! But how is it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous the while, that those men should <hi>prescribe rules</hi> to their Governours, who can scarcely brook their Governours should <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe Laws</hi> to them? It were good we should first <hi>learn</hi> how <hi>to obey,</hi> ere we take upon us <hi>to teach</hi> our betters how <hi>to govern.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, what <hi>Governours</hi> are bound to do, or what is fit for them to do in the point of <hi>information,</hi> that is not now the question. If they fail in any part of <hi>their</hi>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:51860:204"/>
bounden <hi>duty,</hi> they shall be sure to reckon for it one day; but their <hi>Iailing</hi> cannot, in the mean time, excuse <hi>thy disobedience.</hi> Although I think it would prove a hard task for whosoever should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, to shew that <hi>Superiours</hi> are always bound <hi>to inform</hi> the Consciences of their Inferiours concerning the lawfulness of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing they shall command. If sometimes they do it, where they see it <hi>expedient</hi> or <hi>needful</hi>; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again (and that perhaps oftner) it may be thought more <hi>expedient</hi> for them, and more <hi>conducible</hi> for the publick peace and safety, only to make known to the people what their pleasures are, reserving to themselves <hi>the Reasons</hi> thereof. I am sure, in the point of <hi>Ecclesiastical Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> (in which case the aforesaid Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are usually most stood upon) this hath been abundantly done in our Church, not only in the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51860:204"/>
learned writings of sundry <hi>private men,</hi> but by the <hi>publick declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> also of Authority, as is to be seen at large in <hi>the Preface</hi> commonly printed before <hi>the Book of Common Prayer,</hi> concerning that Argument, enough to satisfie those that are peaceable, and not disposed to stretch their wits to cavil at things established. And thus much of the <hi>second Question,</hi> touching <hi>a doubting Conscience</hi>; whereon I have insisted the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, because it is a point both so proper to the <hi>Text,</hi> and whereat so many have stumbled.</p>
                  <p>There remaineth but one <hi>other Question,</hi> and that of far smaller difficulty; What is to be done when the Conscience is <hi>scrupulous</hi>? I call that a <hi>scruple,</hi> when a man is reasonably well perswaded of <hi>the lawfulness</hi> of a thing, yet hath withal some <hi>jealousies</hi> and <hi>fears,</hi> lest perhaps it should
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51860:205"/>
prove unlawful. Such scruples are most incident to men of <hi>melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi> dispositions, or of <hi>timorous</hi> Spirits, especially if they be <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conscienced</hi> withal; and they are much encreased by the false <hi>suggestions</hi> of Satan, by reading <hi>the Books,</hi> or hearing <hi>the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> or frequenting <hi>the company</hi> of men more strict, precise, and austere in sundry points, than they need or ought to be; and by sundry other means which I now mention not. Of which <hi>scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> it behooveth every man, <hi>first,</hi> to be wary that he doth not at all <hi>admit them,</hi> if he can choose: Or if he cannot wholly avoid them, that, <hi>secondly,</hi> he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, so far as may be, <hi>to eject</hi> them speedily out of his thoughts, as <hi>Satan's snares,</hi> and things that may breed him worfer inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies: Or, if he cannot be so rid of them, that then, <hi>thirdly,</hi> he resolve to go on according to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51860:205"/>
the more <hi>profitable perswasion</hi> of his mind, and <hi>despise</hi> those scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. And this he may do with a good Conscience, not only in things <hi>commanded</hi> him by lawful <hi>Authority,</hi> but even in things <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> and arbitrary, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is left to his own <hi>liberty.</hi>

                     <p>First, That whereas no Oath, which is contradictory to it self, can be taken without Perjury; because the one part of every contradiction must needs be false: this Covenant either indeed containeth, or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise (which to the point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is not much less effectual) seemeth to us to contain sundry Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions; as namely, amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, these.</p>

                  <p>AS all the Creatures of God, which attain their highest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by process of time, are in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:51860:261"/>
their first beginning raw; so man in the end of his race the perfectest, is at his entrance thereunto the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and thereby longer enforced to continue a subject for other mens compassions to work upon volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, without any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swader, besides their own secret Inclination, moving them to repay to the common Stock of Humanity such help, as they know that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before must needs have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed; the state and condition of all slesh being herein alike. It cometh hereby to pass, that although there be in us, when we enter into this present world, no conceit or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of our own misery, and for a long time after no ability, as much as to crave help or succour at other mens hands; yet through his most good and gracious Providence, which feedeth the young, even of feathered Fowls and Ravens (whose natural significations of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities are therefore termed in Scripture <hi>Prayers and Invocations</hi>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:51860:261"/>
which God doth hear) we, amongst them, whom he values at a far high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rate than millions of brute Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, do find by perpetual experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, daily occasions given unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of us, religiously to acknowledge with the Prophet <hi>David, Thou, O Lord, from our birth hast been mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful unto us,</hi> we have tasted thy goodness hanging even at our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Breasts. That God, which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Infancy preserveth us without our knowledge, teacheth us at years of discretion how to use our own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities for procurement of our own good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</hi> For whosoever doth ask, shall receive; whosoever doth seek, shall find; the door unto every one which knocks shall be opened.</p>
                  <p>In which words we are first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>ask, seek,</hi> and <hi>knock</hi>: secondly, promised grace answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto every of these endeavours;
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:51860:262"/>
                     <hi>asking,</hi> we shall <hi>have; seeking,</hi> we shall <hi>find; knocking,</hi> it shall be <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> unto us: thirdly, this grace is particularly warranted, because it is generally here averred, That no man asking, seeking, and knocking shall fail of that whereunto his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious desire tendeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of asking or praying I shall not need to tell you, either at whose hands we must seek our aid, or to put you in mind that our hearts are those golden Censers from which the Fume of this Sacred Incense must ascend. For concerning the one, you know who it is which hath said, <hi>Call upon me</hi>; and of the other, we may very well think, that if any where, surely first and most of all in our Prayers, God doth make his continual Claim, <hi>Fili, da mihi cor tuum,</hi> Son, let me never fail in this duty to have thy heart.</p>
                  <p>Against invocation of any other than God alone, if all Arguments else should fail, the number where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is both great and forcible, yet
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:51860:262"/>
this very barr and single challenge might suffice; That whereas God hath in Scripture delivered us so many patterns for imitation when we pray, yea, framed ready to our hands in a manner all, for suits and supplications, which our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life on earth may at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time need, there is not one, no not one to be found directed unto Angels, Saints, or any, saving God alone. So that, if in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as this we hold it safest to be led by the best Examples that have gone before, when we see what <hi>Noah,</hi> what <hi>Abraham,</hi> what <hi>Moses,</hi> what <hi>David,</hi> what <hi>Daniel</hi> and the rest did; what form of Prayer Christ himself likewise taught his Church; and what his blessed Apostles did practice, who can doubt but the way for us to pray so as we may undoubtedly be accepted, is by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming our Prayers to theirs, whose Supplications we know were acceptable?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:51860:263"/>Whoso cometh unto God with a gift, must bring with him a chearful heart, because he loveth <hi>hilarem da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem,</hi> a liberal and frank affection in giving. Devotion and fervency ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth unto prayers the same that ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity doth unto gifts; it putteth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and life in them.</p>
                  <p>Prayer proceedeth from want, which being seriously laid to heart, maketh Suppliants always importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; which importunity our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ did not only tolerate in the woman of <hi>Canaan, Matth.</hi> 15. but also invite and exhort thereunto, as the Parable of the wicked Judge sheweth, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. Our fervency shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us sincerely affected towards that we crave: but that which must make us capable thereof, is an humble spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; for God doth load with his grace the lowly, when the proud he send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth empty away: and therefore to the end that all generations of the world might know how much it stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them upon to beware of all lofty and vain conceits when we offer up
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:51860:263"/>
our Supplications before him, he hath in the Gospel both delivered this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat, and left it by a special chosen parable exemplified. The Pharisee and Publican having presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in one and the same place, the Temple of God, for performance of one and the same duty, the duty of Prayer, did notwithstanding in that respect only so far differ the one from the other, that our Lords own verdict of them remaineth as (you know) on record, <hi>They departed home,</hi> the sinful Publican, through humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of prayer, just; the just Pharisee, through pride, sinful. So much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth he accept of a contrite <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavi,</hi> than of an arrogant <hi>Deo gratias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Asking is very easie, if that were all God did require: but because there were means which his Providence hath appointed for our attainment unto that which we have from him, and those means now and then intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, such as require deliberation, study, and intention of wit; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he which imboldeneth to ask,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:51860:264"/>
doth after invocation exact inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a work of difficulty. The baits of sin every where open, ready always to offer themselves; whereas that which is precious, being hid, is not had but by being sought. <hi>Praemia non ad magna praevenitur nisi per magnos labores, Bernard</hi>: strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and roughness are qualities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident unto every good and perfect way. What booteth it to others that we wish them well, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for them? As little our selves it must needs avail, if we pray and seek not. To trust to labour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prayer, it argueth impiety and prophaneness; it maketh light of the Providence of God: and although it be not the intent of a religious mind; yet it is the fault of those men whose Religion wanteth light of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Judgment to direct it, when we joyn with our prayer slothfulness &amp; neglect of convenient labour. He which hath said, <hi>If any man lack wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, let him ask</hi> — hath in like sort commanded also to seek wisdom,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:51860:264"/>
to search for understanding as for treasure. To them which did only crave a seat in the Kingdom of Christ, his answer, as you know, in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel was this, To sit at my right hand and left hand in the Seat of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not a matter of common gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but of Divine assignment from God. He liked better of him which enquired, <hi>Lord, what shall I do that I may be saved</hi>? and therefore him he directeth the right and ready way, <hi>Keep the Commandments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I noted before unto you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain special qualities belonging unto you that ask: In them that seek there are the like: which we may observe it is with many as with them of whom the Apostle speaketh, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7. They <hi>are alway learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Ex amore non quaerunt,</hi> saith <hi>Bernard</hi>; they seek because they are curious to know, and not as men desirous to obey. It was distress and perplexity of mind which made them inquisitive, of whom St. <hi>Luke</hi>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:51860:265"/>
in the <hi>Acts</hi> reporteth, that sought counsel and advice with urgent soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation: Men and Brethren, sith God hath blessed you with the spirit of Understanding above others, hide not from miserable persons that which may do them good; give your counsel to them that need and crave it at your hands, unless we be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forlorn: shew us, teach us, what we may do and live. That which our Saviour doth say of Prayer in the open streets, of causing Trumpets to be blown before us when we give our Alms, and of making our Service of God a means to purchase the praise of men, must here be applied to you, who never seek what they ought, but only when they may be sure to have store of lookers on. <hi>On my bed,</hi> saith the <hi>Canticles, there did I seek whom my soul doth love.</hi> When therefore thou resolvest they self to seek, go not out of thy chamber in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the streets, but shun that frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which distracteth; single thy self from thy self, if such sequestration
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:51860:265"/>
may be attained. When though seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, let the love of obedience, the sense and feeling of thy necessity, the eye of singleness and sincere mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guide thy footsteps, and thou canst not slide.</p>
                  <p>You see what it is to ask and seek; the next is Knock. There is always in every good thing which we ask, and which we seek, some main wall, some barr'd gate, some strong impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment or other objecting it self in the way between us and home; for removal whereof, the help of stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hands than our own is necessary. As therefore asking hath relation to the want of good things desired, and seeking to the natural ordinary means of attainment thereunto; so knocking is required in regard of hindrances, lets, or impediments, which are doors shut up against us, till such time as it please the goodness of Almighty God to set them open. In the mean while our duty here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired is to knock. Many are well contented to ask, and not unwilling
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:51860:266"/>
to undertake some pains in seeking; but when once they see impediments which flesh and blood doth judge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, their hearts are broken. <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> subject to miseries of intolerable servitude, craved with sighs and tears deliverance from that estate, which then they were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswaded they could not possibly change, but it must needs be for the better. Being set at liberty to seek the Land which God hath promised unto their Fathers, did not seem te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious or irksome unto them: This labour and travel they undertook with great alacrity, never troubled with any doubt, nor dismayed with any fear, till at the length they came to knock at those brazen gates, the barrs whereof, as they have no means, so they had no hopes to break asunder. Mountains on this hand, and the roaring Sea before their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; then all the forces that <hi>Egypt</hi> could make, coming with as much rage and fury as could possess the heart of a proud, potent, and cruel
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:51860:266"/>
Tyrant: In these straits, at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, Oh that we had been so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to die where before we lived a life, though toylsom, yet free from such extremities as now we are fallen into! Is this the milk and honey that hath been so spoken of? Is this the Paradise, in description whereof so much glosing and deceiving elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence hath been spent? have we after four hundred and thirty years left <hi>Egypt</hi> to come to this? While they are in the midst of their muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous cogitations, <hi>Moses</hi> with all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy beateth, and God with the hand of his Omnipotency casteth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the gates before them, maugre even their own both infidelity and despair. It was not strange then, nor that they afterward stood in like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining terms; for till they came to the very brink of the River <hi>Iordan,</hi> the least cross accident, which lay at any time in their way, was evermore unto them a cause of present recidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and relapse. They having the Land in their possession, being
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:51860:267"/>
seated in the heart thereof, and all their hardest encounters past, <hi>Ioshua</hi> and the better sort of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, who saw the wonders which God had wrought for the good of that people, had no sooner ended their days, but first one Tribe, than another, in the end all delighted in ease; fearful to hazard themselves in following the conduct of God, weary of passing so many strait and narrow gates, condescended to igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious conditions of peace, joyned hands with Infidels, forsook him which had been always the Rock of their Salvation, and so had none to open unto them, although their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of knocking were great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, moe and greater than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Concerning <hi>Issachar,</hi> the words of <hi>Iacob,</hi> the Father of all the Patriarchs, were these; <hi>Issa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char,</hi> though bonny and strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough unto any labour, doth couch notwithstanding as an Ass under all burthens; He shall think with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that rest is good, and the Land
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:51860:267"/>
pleasant, he shall in these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions rather endure the burthen and yoke of tribute, than cast himself into hazard of war, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. We are for the most part all of <hi>Issachar</hi>'s disposition, we account ease cheap, howsoever we buy it. And although we can happily frame our selves sometimes to ask, or endure for a while to seek; yet loth we are to follow a course of life, which shall too often hem us about with those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, the dangers whereof are manifestly great.</p>
                  <p>But of the Duties here prescribed of asking, seeking, knocking, thus much may suffice. The Promises follow which God hath made.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Ask and receive, seek and find, knock and it shall be opened unto you.</hi> Promises are made of good things to come; and such, while they are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, have a kind of painfulness with them; but when the time of performance and of present fruition cometh, it bringeth joy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> did somewhat rejoyce
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:51860:268"/>
in that which he saw would come, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though knowing that many Ages &amp; Generations must first pass: Their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultation far greater, who beheld with their eys, and imbraced in their arms him which had been before the hope of the whole world. We have found that Messias, have seen the salvation; <hi>Behold here the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world.</hi> These are speeches of men not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted with the hope of that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, but rap'd with admiration at the view of enjoyed bliss.</p>
                  <p>As oft therefore as our case is the same with the Prophet <hi>Davids</hi>; or that experience of God's abundant mercy towards us doth wrest from our mouths the same acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which it did from his, <hi>I called on the Name of the Lord, and he hath rescued his servant: I was in misery and he saved me: Thou Lord hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling:</hi> I have ask'd and received, sought and found, knock'd and it hath been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opened
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:51860:268"/>
unto me: Can there less be expected at our hands, than to take the Cup of Salvation, and bless, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, and extoll the mercies heaped upon the heads of the sons of men? <hi>Ps.</hi> 116. Are we in the case of them, who as yet do any ask and have not received? It is but attendance a small time, we shall rejoyce then; but how? we shall find, but where? it shall be opened, but with what hand? To all which demands I must</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer,</hi> Use the words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ, <hi>quid hoc ad te,</hi> what are these things unto us? Is it for us to be made acquainted with the way he hath to bring his counsel &amp; purposes about? God will not have great things brought to pass, either altogether without means, or by those means altogether which are to our seeming probable and likely. Not without means, lest under colour of repose in God we should nourish at any time in in our selves idleness: not by the meer hability of means gathered together through our own providence, lest
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:51860:269"/>
prevailing by helps which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon course of nature yieldeth, we should offer the Sacrifice of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for whatsoever prey we take to the Nets which our singers did weave; than which there cannot be to him more intolerable injury offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Vere &amp; absque dubio,</hi> saith St.<hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, hoc quisque est pessimus quo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus, si hoc ipsum quo est optimus ascribat sibi</hi>; the more blest, the more curst, if we make his graces our own glory, without imputation of all to him; whatsoever we have we steal, and the multiplication of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours doth but aggravate the crime of our Sacriledge: He knowing how prone we are to unthankfulness in this kind, tempereth accordingly the means, whereby it is his pleasure to do us good. This is the reason, why God would neither have <hi>Gideon</hi> to conquer without any Army, nor yet to be furnish'd with too great an host. This is the cause why, as none of the promises of God do fail, so the most are in such sort brought to pass,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:51860:269"/>
that, if we after consider the circuit, wherein the steps of his Providence have gone, the due consideration thereof cannot choose but draw from us the very self same words of asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, which the blessed Apostle hath; <hi>O the depth of the riches of the wisdom of God! How unsearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are his counsels, and his ways past finding out!</hi> Let it therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent us always to have his word for an absolute warrant; we shall receive and find in the end; it shall at length be opened unto you: however, or by what means, leave it to God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now our Lord groundeth every mans particular assurance touching this point upon the general Rule and Axiom of his Providence, which hath ordained these effects to flow and is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue out of these causes; gifts of suits, finding out of seeking, help out of knocking; a principle so generally true, that on his part it never faileth.</p>
                  <p>For why? it is the glory of God to give; his very nature delighteth in it; his mercies in the current,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:51860:270"/>
through which they would pass, may be dried up, but at the head they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail. Men are soon weary both of granting and of hearing suits, because our own insufficiency maketh us still affraid, lest by benefiting of others we impoverish our selves. We read of large and great proffers, which Princes in their fond and vainglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moods have poured forth: as that of <hi>Herod</hi>; and the like of <hi>Ahasue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> in the Book of <hi>Hester. Ask what thou wilt, though it reach to the half of my Kingdom, I will give it thee:</hi> which very words of profusion do ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that the ocean of no estate in this world doth so flow, but it may be emptied. He that promiseth half of his Kingdom, foreseeth how that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone, the remainder is but a a moiety of that which was. What we give we leave; but what God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth benefiteth us, and from him it taketh nothing: wherefore in his propositions there are no such fearful restraints; his terms are general in regard of making, <hi>Whatsoever ye
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:51860:270"/>
ask the Father in my Name</hi>; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral also in respect of persons, <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever asketh, whosoever seeketh.</hi> It is true, St. <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>Ye ask, and yet ye receive not, because you ask amiss</hi>; ye crave to the end ye might have to spend upon your own lusts. The rich man sought Heaven, but it was then, when he felt Hell. The Virgins knocked in vain, because they overslipped their opportunity; and when the time was to knock, they slept: But <hi>quaerite Dominum dum inveniri potest,</hi> perform these duties in their due time and due sort. Let there, on our part, be no stop, and the bounty of God we know is such, that he granteth over and above our desires. <hi>Saul</hi> sought an Ass, and found a Kingdom. <hi>Solomon</hi> named wisdom, and God gave <hi>Solomon</hi> wealth also, by way of surpassing. <hi>Thou hast prevented thy servant with blessings,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid. He asked life, and thou gavest him long life, even for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> God a giver; <hi>He giveth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:51860:271"/>
and upbraideth none in any wise:</hi> And therefore he better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth than we the best times, and the best means, and the best things, wherein the good of our Souls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth.</p>
