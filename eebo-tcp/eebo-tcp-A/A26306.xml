         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But as <hi>Reaſon</hi> is not uſeleſs to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Body in <hi>Nature,</hi> neither is it ſo to the Sanctification of the Soul in <hi>Religion;</hi> it ſupports <hi>Faith,</hi> and confirms <hi>Senſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They who deſire to know Morality by <hi>Faith,</hi> need but read the Goſpel: They who deſire to know it by inward <hi>Senſe,</hi> need but ſearch for it in their own Hearts, with the help of <hi>Revelation,</hi> which GOD directs them unto; and the Conjunction of theſe Two Methods will not fail to furniſh them with all the Principles of the Science of Living well.</p>
            <p>But 'tis to he hop'd, That no One will blame our Deſign in this Writing, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting Men by Reaſon, as far as it ſhall be poſſible towards that End, whereunto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion conducts us by Faith, and Conſcience leads us by Senſe. Reaſon, as well as Faith and Conſcience, is a Gift which GOD hath beſtow'd upon us: Its Lights do aſſuredly proceed from the Father of Lights, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of every excellent Gift; and I know not what better uſe we can make of our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47885:9"/>
Mind, then by employing it in the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what is of greateſt Importance and Concernment to us.</p>
            <p>This Study is none of the ſhorteſt, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the pure Learning of theſe Duties; but it is extreamly proper to nouriſh the Gratitude, which we ought to bear to the Author of our Being; to confirm the Faith we have in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to remove from the Incredulous this haughty Prejudice, That our <hi>Morality</hi> is calculated only for ſuch Perſons as have not Wit enough to avoid Deception: And laſtly, To elevate our Mind and Heart, by ſhewing us the Ways of GOD, in the Inclinations of Men, and the Duties of Man in the the Ways of GOD.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſee, thro' this Meditation, the Divine Relations that are between Nature and the Goſpel; and that Reaſon leads us to the Confines of Religion. We ſhall learn, that Natural Light, when it is pure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from Prejudices, doth of it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us to the moſt ſublime Duties of <hi>Man,</hi> and repreſent unto us his lofty Deſtinies, and the Glory of his Condition.</p>
            <p>We ſhall endeavour to ſay Nothing but what relates to the Principles of our <hi>Faith,</hi> which we will evince to be the ſame with thoſe of Nature, as far as they concern the Knowledge of Manners; and if we be oblig'd at firſt to inſiſt upon abſtract Truths, we ſhall do this no farther than as they conduct
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47885:10"/>
us to ſenſible Truths. In a word, We will ſearch not only after Truth, but alſo for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and Profit in our Diſcoveries, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the Deſign of the <hi>Science</hi> which we treat of.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Morality</hi> being to our Soul the ſame that <hi>Phyſick</hi> is to our Body, and having for its End and Scope the curing us of our ſpiritual Maladies, it muſt apply it ſelf prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally unto Two Things: Firſt, to know the Evil, and afterwards to ſearch for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies that may effect the Cure. Theſe two Deſigns do divide Morality, but they are too vaſt, and would lead us too far, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we confine our ſelves to the former, waiting till <hi>Providence</hi> put us in a way to handle the other.</p>
            <p>We do here ſearch for the Knowledge of Man, but not as <hi>Phyſick, Anatomy, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſick, Logick, Medicine,</hi> which conſider him as a Corporeal Being, or ſimply as a Spiritual Subſtance, as an Animal, or as a reaſonable Animal. We ſhall conſider him only as a Creature capable of Vertue and Happineſs, and which finds it ſelf in a State of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Miſery. Not but this reſpect under which Morality obliges us to conſider our ſelves, engages us to borrow from ſome of theſe other <hi>Sciences,</hi> certain Principles, which we ſhall take from what is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in them. For in order to have a perfect Knowledge of the Corruption and Miſery
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47885:10"/>
of Man, 'tis neceſſarily requiſite we ſhould have ſome Knowledge of his Nature, his End and his Excellence. But if what we have to ſay on this ſubject, ſeem in ſome places ſomewhat Abſtract, above the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Capacity of Men, it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd, that we treat of the Sources of <hi>Morality;</hi> and if it be perceived that we do not always accomodate our ſelves to vulgar Opinions, it muſt be conſider'd, that this is not a fit place for reſpecting Prejudices, ſince we write meerly to diſentangle the Confuſion of our <hi>Idea's,</hi> and to juſtify by Reaſon that which we perceive by Senſe.</p>
            <p>This Work muſt therefore be divided into Two Parts. In the Firſt, We will ſhew what Man is, to what is Obliged, and for what he is Able; that is to ſay, We will treat of his Nature, his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, his End, his Duties and natural Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, his Strength, Motives and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that may principally determine him in his Actions.</p>
            <p>In the Second, We ſhall treat of his Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities in general and particular, we ſhall ſearch for the Original of his <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> we ſhall conſider the Rivulets flowing thence, we ſhall view the Force of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, the Extent of his Paſſions, the Principle of his Vices, and all along we ſhall ſhew the Rule, in order to make known the Irregularities; and we will
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47885:11"/>
juſtify the Greatneſs of our Fall, by ſhewing the Degree of our Riſe and Elevation.</p>
            <p>May GOD, who is the Maſter of Minds, purify mine by his <hi>Grace,</hi> to the end, That I may ſay nothing but what refers to his Glory, and is conformable to the Holy and Eternal Truths of his Goſpel. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Wherein we give a General Idea of the Vileneſs and Miſery of Man, which are the Firſt of his Qualities that occur to our Mind.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT is certain, That Man ſeems to be a very inconſiderable Being, when we judge of him thro' the Prejudices of the Senſes: We are not far from finding him uncapable of Vertue, when we conſider his <hi>Vileneſs;</hi> and uncapable of Happineſs, when we reflect upon his <hi>Miſery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Smallneſs of his Body is the firſt that occurs to the Eyes; the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denotes it, by telling us, <hi>That Man has his Foundation in the Duſt, That he dwelleth in a Tabernacle of Clay,</hi> and <hi>That he is conſumed at the meeting of a Worm:</hi> And Nature
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47885:12"/>
moreover ſo clearly repreſents it to our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that 'tis impoſſible for our Pride to conteſt or diſpute it. 'Tis true, That as we are accuſtom'd to meaſure every thing with Relation to Our Selves, we uſe to look upon our ſelves as the Center of Perfection, and to think the Bodies that ſurround us, either too great, or too little, according as they are more or leſs proportion'd to the Bulk of our own: But you need but only change your State, and view things with other Eyes than your own; or conſider them in a ſenſe of Oppoſition, in order to diſabuſe your ſelf on this account. Go up a Mountain, and tell how big thoſe Men appear who ſtand in the Vallies beneath. Suppoſe the <hi>Heavenly Bodies</hi> were Animated with ſuch a Mind as yours, and that they had Eyes to look upon you; pray what would your Body ſeem to them: Or compare the Dimenſions of this Body to theſe vaſt <hi>Spheres,</hi> wherewith you are environ'd, with theſe moveable and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Worlds, which the Hand of the <hi>Creator</hi> ſeems to have planted round about you, to convince you more throughly of the Smallneſs of this Tabernacle of Fleſh which you inhabit. The Infirmity of Man is proportion'd to his Smallneſs, and his Meanneſs to his Infirmity; and the one, and the other, was in the Mind of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> when he cry'd out, ſpeaking to GOD, <hi>Wilt thou ſhew thy Strength againſt a Leaf which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47885:12"/>
the Wind carries away:</hi> Or, in the Mind of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> when he ſaid, by a kind of Hyperbole, fraught with Senſe and Truth, <hi>That if Man ſhould be weighed with Nothing, we ſhould find that Nothing would turn the Scale.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may indeed ſay, That <hi>Nothing</hi> does encompaſs Man on every ſide: By the Time paſt he is no more, by the future he does not yet Exiſt, by the preſent he partly is, and partly is not. In vain does he endeavour to fix the paſt by Memory, and to anticipate the future by Hope, that he may ſtretch the preſent to a greater length. He's a Flower that ſprings in the Morning, ſpreads at Noon, and withers in the Evening. <hi>Man,</hi> conſider'd in his various States, is a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſtantly Miſerable; Who, as an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> very well ſays,
<q>Meets with Sin in his Conception, Labour in his Birth, Pain in in his Life, and Deſpair of an inevitable Neceſſity in his Death.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>All his Ages bring him ſome Infirmity, or ſome particular Miſery: Infancy is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Oblivion and Ignorance of One ſelf; Youth a durable Paſſion, a long Madneſs; and Old Age nothing but a Death, languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Appearances of Life, with ſo great a Troop of Infirmities is it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                  <p>There are few things round about him but what do put him in Mind of his End, he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47885:13"/>
diſcovers the Principles of his Death, which he dreads above all things, both in the Air which he breaths, in the Aliments which he receives, and in the Sources of his Life, which conſumes and gnaws away its own Bowels: And ſuch is his Fate, that after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhun'd the greateſt Dangers, Fires, Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks, and Diſeaſes, he at laſt finds all theſe pretended Deliverances terminated by <hi>Death.</hi> His Body is the Center of Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, his Mind is fill'd with Errors, and his Heart with irregular Affections: He ſuffers both by the Conſideration of what is paſt, which is Irrevocable; and of the future, which is Inevitable. In vain does he deſire to ſtay himſelf a while, that he may have leiſure to Taſt ſome Pleaſures which preſent themſelves in his Way: Time is like a <hi>Whirl-pool,</hi> which carries him away, inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Regrets and Complaints. When we are alone we cannot endure the View of our ſelves, and of the Neceſſity that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the Pleaſures of the World, of paſſing away in a Moment. United with others in Society, we do but multiply our Selves, as I may ſo ſay, into other <hi>ſelves,</hi> in order to a greater Participation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Miſery of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a very grievous thing to a Creature that loves it ſelf ſo well, to behold it ſelf continually Dying, and to perceive <hi>Life</hi> no more than proportionably as it loſeth it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47885:13"/>
is Dead to make way for Youth, Youth for Ripeneſs of Years, Ripeneſs of Years for Advanc'd Age; and this latter for extream Old Age: We are Dead in reſpect of thoſe many well-belov'd Perſons whom we have loſt, and in reſpect of many Pleaſures and Advantages, which following the Fate of the World, are conſum'd away by their own proper Uſe, no Relick thereof remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, but only a ſlight Remembrance, which is uncapable of yielding us any Satisfaction, and is very proper to vex and torment us.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe the Life of <hi>Man</hi> were very long and durable, yet the appendant Happineſs of it would be inconſiderable; and were the Felicity, which we meet with here in theſe lower Regions, as full as it is Defective, yet 'twould be very inſignificant, ſeeing it muſt be cut off at laſt by the fatal Sword of <hi>Death.</hi> What then will this be, when we are convinced of the Deceitfulneſs of theſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and of the ſhortneſs of Life, which is ſuch, that to ſpeak the down-right Truth, 'Tis hardly long enough to give us time to regulate our Affairs, to take leave of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and in a fit manner to make our Will?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Man,</hi> who is naturally convinc'd, of theſe Truths, enquires after Means of ſolacing himſelf at theſe Calamities, to which the Quality of <hi>Man</hi> expoſes him; therefore he avoids the Repreſentation of himſelf, to his own View, and the putting himſelf forward
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47885:14"/>
under this Quality. He would fain be look'd upon only as a <hi>Being</hi> inveſted with certain external Advantages, which make the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Conditions, and the diſtinction of Perſons: But if there be ſo much Dignity in <hi>Man,</hi> as Religion repreſents to us, there would be a Thouſand times greater Grounds for Valuing himſelf upon the Qualities which we have in common, than upon thoſe which characteriſe and diſtinguiſh us. And if, on the contrary, the Poſſeſſion of theſe external Advantages were ſo Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable as the <hi>World</hi> would make us believe, Man in himſelf muſt needs be a very trivial and inconſiderable Being; which we cannot think without betraying not only the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Nature, but alſo the Sentiments of our Vanity.</p>
                  <p>Methinks we may give this Definition of the <hi>Worldling,</hi> who to cure or comfort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his Poverty and natural Miſery, loves to cloath himſelf with Imaginary Goods: <hi>A Phantome that walks among ſuch things as have only an Appearance.</hi> I call a Phantome, not the <hi>Man of Nature,</hi> compounded of a Body and Soul, which GOD hath framed, but the <hi>Man of Concupiſcence,</hi> compounded of the Dreams and Fictions of Self-love. I call the Things which have only an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance (and this after the Pſalmiſt) the Advantages which the World ſeeketh after with ſo great Paſſion and Ardour, theſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47885:14"/>
great Vacuities taken up with our own Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or rather theſe great <hi>Nothings,</hi> which occupy ſo great a ſpace in our extravagant Imagination.</p>
                  <p>When we endeavour to Annihilate and Deſtroy this <hi>Phantome</hi> of Pride and Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, which we diſcover'd in Man, 'tis not our Deſign to ſubſcribe to the Eternal Arreſt of our Miſery and Vileneſs.</p>
                  <p>Let us make a deep Search into theſe Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, which ſeem'd at firſt ſo ſad and diſmal, and we ſhall find ſome Reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our ſelves: but in order to diſcover that which we deſire, we muſt ſearch for Man in <hi>Man,</hi> and not in theſe external Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which Concupiſcence ſeeketh after with ſuch a paſſionate Deſire: For it is not the deſign of GOD to raiſe one Man, or a certain Order of Men, to a proper and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Happineſs.</hi> Concupiſcence deceives in the very firſt Step it makes you take in your Search of the Supream <hi>Good.</hi> You en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after a particular Happineſs, a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Glory, ſo much the worſe for you if you chance to find it, ſince the true Good whereunto you ought to Aſpire, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Felicity which ſhould be participated by an Infinity of Creatures, that ought to make up the Family of GOD.</p>
                  <p>Having conſider'd the <hi>Man of Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence,</hi> who made himſelf, let us now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſider the <hi>Man of Nature,</hi> who is the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47885:15"/>
Work of the Creatour, and to that end take a Survey of the Faculties of his Soul.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall not inſiſt upon the Faculty of <hi>Imagination,</hi> which, properly ſpeaking, is nothing but a Collection of weak <hi>Senſations,</hi> that do ſtill ſubſiſt in our Soul, by occaſion of the Traces which outward Objects left in our Brain: A Collection, I ſay, of Senſations, which the Soul diſpoſes and afterwards makes uſe of in the Perception of other Objects.</p>
                  <p>But we cannot ſufficiently admire this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect</hi> of Man, which rectifies the Senſes, corrects the Fancy, purifies and enlarges Bodily Perceptions, which unites together various Ideas in the Judgment it frames of Things, and various Judgments in Diſcourſe; which weighs, compares, examines, enquires, and by the Relation it finds between Things, makes the Dependance of <hi>Arts, Sciences, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,</hi> and produces all the Wonders of reaſonable Society.</p>
                  <p>Is it not a piece of Extravagance to ſay that this Intellect hath for its Principle a natural Motion, that it is nothing but a meer <hi>Congeries</hi> of Atomes, which agitated after a certain manner, obtain a new Situation? Does any Man clearly conceive that an <hi>Atom</hi> without going beyond the Confines of the Body, runs thro' the Earth and Heavens in a moment, that it goes every where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being moved, in a more noble and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47885:15"/>
manner than if it were mov'd? Can one Portion of Matter have the Knowledge of others, and afterward know it ſelf, Act upon it ſelf, reflect not only upon it ſelf, but alſo upon its manner of Acting, upon the Manner of this Manner, and upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection which it makes upon this manner in <hi>Infinitum?</hi> Can a parcel of <hi>Atomes,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in I know not what little Pipe, judge of the Model of the Univerſe, the Deſign of the World, and underſtand the Wiſdom of the Creatour? Is it a property of this Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Motion, not only to put theſe Atomes into Motion, but alſo to repreſent that of the Celeſtial Bodies, which are only in the order of poſſible Things? Have theſe Atoms, whoſe jumbling and claſhing is a Thought, this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Faculty of being able, as often as they meet and juſtle, to hit only the general Degree of <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Subſtance,</hi> without hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Individual in this Motion, which Thought we term, <hi>Preciſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did we ever hear of a Motion, properly ſo call'd, without a proper Tranſlation of one Body from another; like Thought, which goes from the Time paſt, which is no more, to the future, which is not yet come; and from that Nothing which preceded our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to that Annihilation which terminates the Hopes of the Incredulous.</p>
                  <p>The Mind of Man is not only above the Condition of Matter; but, which is Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47885:16"/>
it hath a kind of Infinity in its Actions, for it flies from Object to Object, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies them in <hi>Infinitum:</hi> 'Tis never wearied with Knowing, and altho' its Perfections be really limited, ſince it does not know all Things; yet certainly its Excellency is in ſome Senſe unlimited, ſince it can know all Things ſucceſſively.</p>
                  <p>As the <hi>Mind</hi> of Man is never wearied with Knowing, ſo his <hi>Heart</hi> is never weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Deſiring, and ſuch as is our Abyſs of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> ſuch is the Abyſs of our <hi>Deſire.</hi> This Ambitious <hi>Prince,</hi> whoſe Heart was greater than the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> of which he was Maſter, had not in the Bottom more vaſt and elevated Inclinations, than are hidden in the ſecret Diſpoſitions of every One of us; and the Heart of an Heroe is not different from any other Man's. He that dwells in a Cottage wants nothing but Proſperity, and great Occaſions, to inſpire him with Wiſhes for new Worlds to Conquer.</p>
                  <p>When a Man is oppreſt with Poverty, a Supply of Things neceſſary is the utmoſt Term of his Wiſhes. After he has poſſeſſion of thoſe Things which Nature requires, he demands Things neceſſary to State and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, when he has arrived to that Pitch of Grandeur, he has obtain'd all that his Heart ſeems capable of Deſiring: Yet ſtill againſt the Dictates of Reaſon, he forms new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. Behold the Maſters of the World, who
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47885:16"/>
after having been at a Height of Greatneſs above other Men, wiſh for the Condition of Beaſts; this they cannot but deſire, tho' they are never like to obtain it.</p>
                  <p>Such is the Excellency of Man, that it ſhews it ſelf even in his moſt ſhameful Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities: For I do not imagine, that this inſatiable Deſire of our Heart does origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſpring from our <hi>Corruption.</hi> Men are to be blamed for applying themſelves with too great Earneſtneſs to the Reſearch of Worldly Goods, but they have good Reaſon for not placing their Contentment in finite Enjoyments, who are deſigned for the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the <hi>Supream</hi> Good.</p>
                  <p>It muſt needs fall out thus, For we ſee that in Nature every Thing is ſatisfy'd with thoſe Goods that are proper to its <hi>ſpecies.</hi> The Fiſh are contented with the Water they ſwim in, Birds are ſatisfy'd with flying in the Air, the Beaſts of the Field obtain the End of their Deſire, when they have met with ſuch Graſs as ſerves for their Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: whence then does it come to paſs, that Man has ſo little ſatisfaction in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Advantages, if theſe be all that fall to to his ſhare? Shall we believe that the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Creatour is inconſiſtent with it ſelf preciſely in this? Has it not had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Knowledge, either of the Nature of Worldly Goods, as uncapable of yielding us Satisfaction, or of the Nature of our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47885:17"/>
Heart, as uncapable of being ſatisfy'd with 'em? Or rather, does it not proceed from this, that having known the Goods of the World, our Heart, and the natural Diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between them both, GOD has fram'd things after this manner, becauſe he reſerv'd our Soul to himſelf, that he might fill it, ſatisfy it, and anſwer by his <hi>Excellency</hi> and infinite <hi>Beatitude,</hi> the infinite ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of our Thoughts and Deſires: Or, if you will, the infinite Enquiries of a Mind, which ſearches for the Knowledge of all Things, becauſe 'tis deſign'd for the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of GOD; and the infinite Deſire of an Heart, which is not ſatisfy'd with the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of any particular Good, becauſe it is deſign'd for the Poſſeſſion of the ſupream Good, which includes all the others.</p>
                  <p>The Nature, Perfections and End of Man, do make up what we call his <hi>Natural Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> but all this depends upon the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his Duration. We ſhould reap but little Profit from being Spiritual in our <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> did not this Idea include that of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality: But 'twould be extravagant to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that becauſe whatſoever is diſſolv'd periſhes, therefore what is uncapable of Diſſolution doth periſh alſo. What do I ſay? <hi>Extention</hi> is not loſt tho' it acquire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manners of Being, and the Body of Man after Death doth not ceaſe to be a Body by being turn'd into Aſhes, Fleſh, Clay, Worms,

                  <p>But as the Nature and Perfections of Man have given us a proſpect of his End, ſo his End informs us what are his Duties and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Obligations, which we ſhall conſider in the following Chapter.</p>

                  <p>OUr Duties flow from Nature, and owe not their Birth to Education, as ſome Men imagine.

The Second is, That together with this Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to love our ſelves, Nature hath given us a Faculty of Reaſon to conduct and guide us. We love our ſelves naturally; this is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now from thence, that Nature orders us to ſearch for our own <hi>Good,</hi> it follows that Man cannot be ſaid, without an evident Contradiction, to be void of Duty and Law. We muſt grant an Eſſential Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

under the Idea of an immortal <hi>Being,</hi> will not place his End in thoſe Pleaſures, which the Author of Nature affixes to that, which cauſes the Preſervation or Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body. We ſhall not deſire to injure other Men, if we do not only fear a return of Juſtice in this <hi>Life;</hi> but if more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over we dread the doing to our ſelves, by that means, an eternal Prejudice. Whoſoever is buiſy'd as he ought, about his <hi>Natural Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> which undoubtedly raiſes him far above the Abuſes he can poſſibly receive, will be ſo far from ſatisfying himſelf at the Expence of God's Glory, that he will hardly conceive any Reſentment, how ill ſoever he be dealt with. Laſtly, if this Natural and Temporal Communion, which we have with Men in <hi>Society,</hi> be capable of producing any mutual Benevolence, which is intended and encreas'd according to the Degree of the Temporal Commerce we entertain with them; what Motives of Love and Beneficence do we not diſcover in the Idea of this Eternal <hi>Society,</hi> which we ought and can have with them?</p>
                  <p>Thus the Natural Law is in <hi>Man;</hi> but the Perfection and Extent of this Law is in the <hi>Immortal Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But theſe Four kinds of Laws do conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute what we call the Law of Nature, which is the moſt Ancient, moſt General, moſt Eſſential of all, and the Foundation of the reſt. 'Tis the moſt Ancient, Seeing that the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47885:19"/>
Love of our ſelves, and Reaſon, are antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in us to all manner of Inclinations and Laws. 'Tis the moſt General, For there have been many Men, who never heard of Reveal'd Right; but never did any come into the World without this Law, which inclines 'em to ſearch for their proper Good. 'Tis the moſt Eſſential, For this is neither the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nor <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſimply taken, it is the Law of <hi>Men:</hi> it does not belong only to the <hi>Law,</hi> or ſimply to the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> but to Nature, in what State ſoever it be. Laſtly, 'tis the Foundation of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>This plainly appears if we conſider, That all other Laws are nothing elſe but the Law of Nature renewed and adapted to certain Conditions of Men; you diſcover the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, in that which God gave to our Firſt Parents: The <hi>Legiſlator</hi> does there ſuppoſe that Man loves himſelf, ſeeing that his Law is grounded upon Promiſes and Threatnings. Good and Evil are ſet before him; he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd to know the one, and the other: He is engag'd to the Acknowledgment and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which Nature it ſelf preſcribes to us. God requires an Homage of him, in token of thoſe many Favours he beſtows upon him, and this Homage conſiſts in abſtaining from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47885:20"/>
what is more juſt, than to yield to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor the Empire and Dominion over his Creatures, and not to gape at the uſe of his Creatures whether he will or no. This then is the Law of Nature accommodated to the Condition wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was at that time placed.</p>
                  <p>Indeed he could not be as yet prohibited the uſe of Idols, which were unknown to him: nor Blaſpheming the Name of the Lord when he had but juſt began to Bleſs it: nor to reſt one Day of the Week, who was to reſt always: nor the Killing his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that was not yet in Being: nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Adultery, when there was but one Woman in the World: nor Stealing, when he was Maſter of all Things: nor bearing falſe Witneſs, when he could bear it againſt no one but himſelf: nor Coveting, ſince all Things were his own.</p>
                  <p>But when Men were multiplied upon the Earth, as their Condition chang'd, God from time to time made new Editions of this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Law,</hi> and gave it to Men under another Form, becauſe it was to be proportion'd to their particular Circumſtances; for which Reaſon it muſt not be imagin'd, that when we ſay the <hi>Decalogue</hi> contains the Law of Nature, we mean, that it includes nothing elſe but theſe ſimple and common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which are to Guide the Conduct of all Men. I confeſs indeed, the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47885:20"/>
is the Natural Law renewed and freſh drawn to the Eyes of the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> but withal it is certain, that 'tis the Natural Law accommodated to the State of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at that time. The following Obſervations will ſet this Point beyond all doubt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had been delivered from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Captivity, whence the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor covers and ſhrouds himſelf, as it were, with this Benefit, in order to draw them to the Obedience they owe to him: <hi>I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Aegypt, out of the houſe of Bondage, thou ſhalt have none other Gods, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis plain that this Motive has not the ſame Force upon the Heart of thoſe Men who did not partake of this Deliverance; 'twill be to no purpoſe to ſay, that tho' they did not all partake of the Temporal Deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> yet have they been Spiritually deliver'd from the <hi>Egypt</hi> of Sin. Myſtical Senſes are good in a ſimple Doctrine, deſign'd to inſtruct: but are of no uſe in a Precept, which requiring an exact Obedience, cannot be conceived in Terms too preciſe or too proper. And again, what a number of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are there in the World, to whom God hath certainly given the Natural Law as well as to other Men, who yet have never heard of the Deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes:</hi> and who conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cannot find an Emblem of their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Deliverance?</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:47885:21"/>2. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being in a Deſart, where they could have no other Drink but Water, nor other Meat but <hi>Manna,</hi> had no need of any Inſtruction or Precept to incline them to Sobriety, by making them to avoid Drunkenneſs and Gluttony. No other reaſon can be given of this, why the Lawgiver has not forbidden this kind of Intemperance in the Decalogue, which hath always paſs'd for a Capital Vice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Canaanites,</hi> who had incurr'd the Diſpleaſure of God, and born the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own Sins, did nevertheleſs ſeem accurſed outwardly and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as the Schools ſpeak, by occaſion of the Crime of <hi>Cham,</hi> who diſcover'd his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Shame, and was puniſhed by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Malediction, which preſag'd the Ruine of <hi>Canaan</hi>'s Poſterity, The Son of the Impious One. It cannot be deny'd, but that the Decalogue manifeſtly alludes to this in the Fifth Commandment, conceiv'd in theſe Words: <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, that thy Days may be long in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</hi> 'Tis certain that by the Land muſt be underſtood, not the Land of the Living in general, but this Land which had been allotted to the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> which evidently appears from this Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>which the Lord thy God giveth thee:</hi> And doubtleſs the ſenſe of the Law is, That they ought to avoid the Crime of <hi>Cham,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47885:21"/>
fatal to his Poſterity; and endeavour to obtain, by an oppoſite Conduct and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, the Benediction of God, who is able to confirm them in their Poſſeſſions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. 'Tis certain, that Nature teaches us to Conſecrate a part of our Life to the Service of God: For ſince we receive from him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment of our Duration, <hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> require us to Dedicate ſome of them to Him; and particularly to ſet apart ſome certain Seaſons for Piety and Devotion. But to obſerve the <hi>Seventh</hi> Day, and to extend the Obſervation of it even to Beaſts, is an Injunction that bears no relation to Nature, but to the Condition of this People at that time. God was not willing the memory of the Benefit of the <hi>Creation</hi> ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, thro' neglect of obſerving a Feaſt that had been inſtituted with a deſign to perpetuate the Remembrance of this great Event.</p>
                  <p>It appears by all theſe Characters, That the Law of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> doth not differ from the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> as to its Eſſence and firſt Principles; but only as to its man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the Extenſion which were requiſite to be given it to adapt it to the Condition and Exigencies of the People of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This is evident from a general Obſervation which may be made upon this Subject: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That the grand Motives, which ſupport the Precepts of this <hi>Law</hi> in general, are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47885:22"/>
Temporal Benedictions and Maledictions, Motives, which the Soveraign <hi>Law-giver</hi> imploy'd to make himſelf obey'd; he who could menace Men with eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments deſign'd for the Wicked, and promiſe to thoſe who obſerv'd his Law, an eternal and moſt happy Life; how does he come to ſuppreſs theſe powerful Motives, theſe dreadful Objects, or at leaſt to declare them but darkly and confuſedly, whilſt he takes all the Force of his Promiſes and Threats from the greatneſs of Bodily Goods and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils? 'Tis becauſe he proportions his Law to that preſent State of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the Time being not yet come for clearly reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life, and moſt Bleſſed Immortality in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who among other Characters of his Divine <hi>Vocation</hi> was to have this of a clear and abundant Revelation.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Where we continue to make certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the </hi>Decalogue,<hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as the Expreſſion of the Law of </hi>Nature,<hi> accommodated to the State of the </hi>Iſraelites.</head>
                  <p>THe firſt Precept, which it contains, is of ſo great Importance, that it ſeems of it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47885:22"/>
ſelf to be a <hi>Compendium</hi> of Morality and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It includes a Command and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition; the Command is to love God with all our Heart, with all our Strength, and with all our Mind; the prohibition is, not to have any other God before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>For the better underſtanding of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, 'tis to be obſerv'd in general, that a Man may love Three ways, by Senſe, or by Reaſon, or by Senſe and Reaſon both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To love by Senſe, is to love One for the Good he doth us, or for the Pleaſures he creates to us. To love by Reaſon is to love Perfection for Perfection's ſake. To love by Senſe and Reaſon too, is to love One both upon the account of the Merit and Perfection wherewith he is endued, and of the Good which he does, or is capable of doing us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Love</hi> of Reaſon ſeems not eſſentially to differ from Eſteem, and it imports no more than an Eſteem, intereſs'd in the behalf of the Object eſteem'd, which ſearches for Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of doing it Good, or wiſhes it Well. Thus we love extraneous and remote De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, ſuch as no way relates to us; but as we ſhall ſee hereafter, Love of this Character is rarely to be found.</p>
                  <p>We love our ſelves on the contrary by Senſe, and not by Reaſon. The <hi>Love</hi> of our ſelves precedes the Judgment which we make, that we ought to love our ſelves; and tho' we ſhould propoſe a thouſand Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47885:23"/>
againſt this Inclination, yet for all that, we ſhould not ceaſe to love our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, God loves Himſelf both by Reaſon and Senſe; by Reaſon, becauſe He knows His proper Perfections; by Senſe, becauſe He taſts His infinite <hi>Beatitude:</hi> And in like manner we are obliged to love Him both by Reaſon and Senſe; by Reaſon, becauſe he is endued with all Perfections; by Senſe, becauſe He communicates to us all the Goods we can enjoy and poſſeſs. God ſeems here to demand the Love of Senſe; He doth not ſay, I am the God of all Perfections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I am the <hi>Eternal,</hi> thy <hi>God</hi> who brought thee out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. And 'tis remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that this Character is common to all His Revelations, which he addreſſes to Men upon Earth: this is to manifeſt Himſelf unto them, cloathed with ſome of His Benefits, that He may win their Heart by an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and Gratitude. He was ſerv'd in the Old World under the Name of <hi>God who is, and who is the Rewarder of them that call upon Him.</hi> He was afterwards known under the Name of the <hi>God of Abraham, of Iſaac, and of Jacob.</hi> After that He gave His Law by declaring Himſelf the <hi>Lord who had brought this People out of the land of Egypt.</hi> Afterwards a Prophet declares that the Time is come, in the which Men will no longer ſay, the Eternal is He who brought His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi>; but the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47885:23"/>
is He, that hath brought up His People out of the Country of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Laſtly, ſo ſoon as the time for Man's Redemption is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd, God is no longer call'd by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name, than the God of Mercy, and the Father of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They therefore are very much miſtaken, who fancy 'tis an Offence againſt God to love Him any otherwiſe than for the Love of Himſelf, and His intrinſick Perfections; and that there is no intereſted Motion in our Heart but what is Criminal. In order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute theſe Speculations, we need but make reflection upon the Conduct of God, who not only conſents that we ſhould love Him by the Motives of the Good which we find in the Poſſeſſion of Him: but alſo wills and proportions His <hi>Revelations</hi> to this Deſign; and it may likewiſe be ſaid, that we glorify the Supream Good, when we deſire it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and feel no Repoſe or Joy but in Communion with it.</p>
                  <p>This grand Precept may be propoſed to the <hi>Mortal Man,</hi> to confound and baffle him, by ſhewing him the Impoſſibility he lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of fulfilling the Divine Law; but 'tis the <hi>Immortal Man</hi> alone, that is capable of fulfilling this Duty. 'Tis not the dying Man that perceives himſelf under great Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to God: but the Man that ſubſiſts to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. And 'tis not in a heap of periſhing Favours, but in the Aſſemblage of incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47885:24"/>
Goods that we find the Motives of ſuch a Love and Gratitude, as are worthy of God.</p>
                  <p>So alſo the <hi>Man of Nature,</hi> conſider'd as a Man that hath ſhort and tranſitory Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to other Men, neither can nor ought to love others ſo much as himſelf. Were we obliged to love an indifferent and unknown Perſon, with the ſame degree of Affection that Children love their Parents, certainly the whole World would be a <hi>Scene</hi> of Diſorder and Confuſion. We ought to love our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren more than Perſons that are indifferent to us; now as it is the <hi>Love</hi> of our ſelves, that makes this Inequality and this Variety of our Affections: it follows that there is an Original Law of Nature, which dictates that we ſhould love our ſelves more than other Men.</p>
                  <p>But the immortal Man hath other Views and Obligations; all the divers kinds of Proximity and Relation, which reſpect this Life, diſappear and vaniſh at the proſpect of the Relations of that Eternal Society, which we are to enjoy. A Temporal <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> whom Nature points out to us, is not ſo conſiderable as the Eternal <hi>Neighbour</hi> which Faith diſcovers in him. But ſome perſons love themſelves to ſuch an exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Degree, that 'tis in no wiſe convenient they ſhould be affected with the ſame Love if others as of themſelves. For pray tell me, of One ſhould ſay to a Man, I wiſh you were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47885:24"/>
Ungrateful, Blind, Paſſionate, Revengeful, Proud, Voluptuous, Covetous, that you might take more Pleaſure and Enjoyment in the World, would he not have Reaſon to think that either we dote, or have a Mind to make him a very courſe Compliment; and yet this would be to love our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as we love our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>If we would love our Neighbour as our ſelves, we ought to love him with Relation to <hi>Eternity.</hi> None but the immortal Man is in a Capacity of obſerving this Precept ſtrictly and well.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps the Queſtion may be ask'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the Law enjoyns us to love our Neighbour as our ſelves, it means that we ſhould love by the Motives of that Love we bear to God, or of that which we have for our ſelves?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer by diſtinguiſhing ſtill betwixt Rational and Senſual Love; when we love our Neighbour with a rational Love, 'tis certain that the Motives of this Love ought to proceed from the Love we have for God. When we love our Neighbour with a Love of Senſe, or ſenſual Love, the Motives of Love ſhould proceed purely from the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we have for our ſelves. Thus it may be reply'd, that we ought to love him by both theſe Motives, and the Law of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue</hi> ſeems to confirm us in this Opinion: for it puts the Precept which refers to our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47885:25"/>
                     <hi>Neighbour,</hi> immediately after that which refers to <hi>God,</hi> to teach us, that the One de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Other; and that we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to love our Neighbour with the ſame kind of Affection that we bear to God: And on the other ſide, it calls him, whom it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends to our Love, by the Name of <hi>Neighbour,</hi> to intimate to us, that we are concern'd to love him, becauſe he is a Perſon that belongs to us.</p>
                  <p>Reaſon tells us, That God, being the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream and infinite Beauty, is Amiable for his own Sake; and that all things become ſo for the Love of him. It therefore requires us to love Objects according as they ſtand related to God. The Experience we have of our own Being, accompany'd with Joy and Delight, obliging us to love our ſelves in the firſt place, Nature teaches us to love Perſons according to the degree of Proximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Relation which they have to <hi>Us.</hi> Theſe two Laws are not oppoſite to each other; the One, as I may ſay, is the Law of Reaſon, the Other is the Law of Senſe; the one is the Inſtinct of the <hi>mortal</hi> and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature, the other of the <hi>immortal</hi> and incorruptible Nature; the one relates to the ſhort and tranſient Society, which we ought to have one among another; the other to the Eternal Commerce and Friendſhip we ought to have in God.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Where we ſhew the Extent of the Natural Law, by conſidering it in the Goſpel, and with Relation to the Immortal Man.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IF the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> were the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, accomodated to the Condition of the mortal Man, and to the State of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in particular; the Goſpel is the Law of Nature, accommodated to the State and Relations of the immortal Man.</p>
                  <p>This ſufficiently appears from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Genius and Conduct of the two Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Under the Oeconomy of the <hi>Law,</hi> God ſeems to make no farther Manifeſtation of Himſelf, than to break thro' Walls, open the Abyſſes of the Earth, inflame Mountains, ſend down Fire from Heaven, menace the Body with his Judgments, or to execute the Arreſts of his Juſtice upon the <hi>periſhing</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but, under the new Diſpenſation of <hi>Grace,</hi> we ſee Perſons animated with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, contemn the Injury of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the perſecution of Men: ſuffer with ſo great Conſtancy as if they ſuffer'd in a Body which was not their own; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported with Joy in the midſt of conſuming Flames, and triumphing to ſee the Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47885:26"/>
of that Compound, which is ſo precious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and carefully preſerved by other Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſupported and encouraged by the Idea of <hi>Eternity,</hi> whereof the Divine Mercy has given them a diſtinct Knowledge. Not but the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> includes ſome Relation to Eternity; for this Law had at leaſt the Shadow of good things to come: alſo it cannot be deny'd, but that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſuppoſes the Idea's of Man's Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mortality; for it includes all our Remedies and Conſolations againſt it: but thus much is true, that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> regards the preſent Life directly, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity indirectly, whereas the Goſpel regards Eternity as its principal Object, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life indirectly. As for Nature, that is equally diſcover'd under both Oeconomies. The Goſpel, if I may ſo ſpeak, is hidden in in Nature, Nature in the Goſpel: but we muſt here underſtand the immortal Nature, and that will put us in a way to unravel ſome Difficulties, which might poſſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle and perplex us.</p>
                  <p>Indeed it ſeems contrary to Nature to love our Enemies, to look upon Adverſity as a Bleſſing, and Afflictions as a ſubject of Joy, and ſo far to yield up the Cudgels to Juſtice, as to render not only as much, but even more than it demands, which are Maxims of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:47885:26"/>I confeſs all this goes againſt the Grain of the Corruptible <hi>Nature,</hi> which mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures every Thing according as it ſtands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to this preſent Life: but 'tis far from being oppoſite to the Intereſts of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Nature, which values not <hi>Time,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts all its Actions in a proſpect of Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Our Enemies are an Obſtacle to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of our Fortune in the World; but nothing except the Hatred we may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bear them, is an hindrance to our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this is the Thing which the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Man conſiders, he deſpiſes thoſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reaſons of Hating, which <hi>Concupiſcence</hi> ſuggeſts to our Heart, and regards thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Relations we have to Others in God, who is our common Father, as the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Motives of the Love we have for our Neighbour.</p>
                  <p>Plenty and Proſperity charm ſuch a Heart as hath limited the utmoſt of its Hopes and Pretenſions to the tranſitory World; but the immortal Man finds in that State ſo much more ſubject of Fear as there is more of Senſe, he dreads theſe imaginary Goods which buiſy us, and never ſatisfy; theſe lively Senſations which hinder the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his real Intereſts. He looks upon Proſperity as the Reign of the Paſſions, which ſeduce and miſguide us. He's perſwaded that Afflictions, by depriving us of theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Senſations, do but only chaſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47885:27"/>
Troop of Impoſtors from the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Soul.</p>
                  <p>And he does not think that Worldly Goods deſerve our Envy, and to make us rival each other in purſuing them; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when <hi>Religion</hi> aſſures him, that theſe Hatreds and Conteſtations which are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd by the corruptible World, are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing him an Eternal prejudice: For which Reaſon, tho' Man has a Right of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding what belongs to him, God having for this End eſtabliſh'd <hi>Tribunals</hi> in Society, which would be but an union of Robbers, and a ſucceſſion of Murthers and Villanies without the Exerciſe of Juſtice; yet the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the immortal Man permits him not to exact his Rights with rigour and ſeverity, when he ſees but the leaſt probability of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring, by that means, the Intereſts of his Soul. Whence we may conclude, That the Morality of the Goſpel is but purely the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the immortal Man's Heart: but we ſhall have an Opportunity to ſpeak more of this elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeen, that the Perfections of Man roll upon his <hi>Immortality,</hi> which alone can render him capable of Happineſs; and we have juſt now ſeen, that this Immortality founds the Extent of our Duties and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. We proceed to ſhew that 'tis this alſo that makes the <hi>Strength</hi> of our Soul, or the Weight that can determine us to well-doing.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndure this Pain. 'Tis very eaſy to conceive, That the damn'd <hi>Spirits</hi> hate themſelves, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>heir Puniſhment; and that, tho' Self-love has been in this World the Source of their Corruption, Hatred of themſelves becomes hereafter Inſtrumental to their Puniſhment. Moreover we conceive that 'tis impoſſible to have a Senſe of Pleaſure, without loving it, and wiſhing the preſervation of this <hi>Self</hi> which is the Subject of it. Pleaſure makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> love our Exiſtence, becauſe without
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47885:28"/>
our Exiſtence this pleaſure cannot ſubſiſt. Thence it follows, that 'twas in the power of God, when He form'd Man, either to make him love, or not love <hi>Himſelf,</hi> ſince it depended upon His Will to affix, or not affix Pleaſure to certain Objects.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Love of our ſelves is in it ſelf a natural Inclination; 'tis Nature that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us to love Pleaſure, and hate Pain; and 'tis Nature that makes us love our ſelves. This Inclination does not wait for intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Reflections to give it Birth in our Soul; it precedes all our Reaſonings. The <hi>Stoicks</hi> have juſtly deſerv'd to be ſcorn'd and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul'd by all poſterity, if they really held thoſe Opinions, which are uſually attributed to them. They pretended that the way for a Man to be Wiſe, was to put off Humanity; this at the firſt daſh was a very great piece of Extravagance: but they fail'd no leſs in conceiving a kind of Infirmity and Baſeneſs in the moſt natural Spring of our <hi>Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Self-love</hi> is an Inclination moſt Divine in its Original: We love our ſelves for this very Reaſon, becauſe God has loved us. Had God hated us, we ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hate our ſelves; therefore 'tis unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and groundleſs to cry down all thoſe Actions which Self-love excites us to, as if they were ſo many Crimes and Infirmities: according to the dangerous Morality of ſome, who have pretended to annihilate the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47885:28"/>
of all the Vertues upon this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, That they all proceeded from the Womb of Self-love, and were grounded meerly in Intereſt, a very bad Conſequence; ſince Self-love is an Inclination of a moſt Divine and Heavenly Extraction. Laſtly, the Love of our ſelves is a neceſſary Inclination, it muſt not be imagin'd, that our Soul is indifferent to tend or not tend towards that, which it judges advantagious and profitable; theſe Indifferences of <hi>Free-will</hi> are the Dreams and Fancies of thoſe who have not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſtudy'd Nature, or are not willing to have the Knowledge of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But God has thought fit to mingle Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Senſe together, that the former might regulate and guide the latter; and the latter might fix the former. Had Man no other Faculty but Reaſon, we ſhould Err in our Thoughts, and ſpend our ſelves in vain <hi>Speculations,</hi> applying our ſelves to know e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing elſe, but what would be of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Concernment to us. Senſe is therefore deſign'd to fix this Intellect, and confine it principally to thoſe Objects which concern it. Were there nothing elſe but Senſe in Man, he might indeed then have ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities and deſires as this Senſe ſhould produce: but would fail of Light and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for finding out thoſe Things to which theſe Deſires do naturally tend, and the Love of pleaſure being blind and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47885:29"/>
would throw him down into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Precipices; wherefore Reaſon is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to regulate Senſe.</p>
                  <p>Reaſon is the Soul's <hi>Councellor:</hi> Senſe, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as it were, the Force and Weight that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it. And theſe Forces are greater or leſſer proportionably to the Difference<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of Senſe. In the Compariſon we make of them, the Soul conſiders not only what excites in it preſent, but alſo what is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of creating to it future Pleaſure. It compares Pleaſure with Pain, the preſent Good with Abſent, the Good it hopes for, with the Dangers to be endur'd; and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it ſelf according to the Inſtruction it receives in theſe various Enquiries: its <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> being, as I may ſo ſpeak, no more than the Extent of its Knowledge, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it hath of not chooſing, after having made a deep Scrutiny, and throughly examin'd.</p>
                  <p>The Caſe being thus, 'tis eaſy to judge, that 'tis either preſent Advantage, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in an actual Senſe of Pleaſure; or future, which conſiſts in whatſoever can hereafter careſs us with Delight, and render us Happy, or preſerve our Happineſs by preſerving us our ſelves; that makes all the <hi>Strength</hi> of our Soul for determining it ſelf in its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Conduct.</p>
                  <p>This Strength is very ſmall, when inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within the Circle of worldly Objects. The <hi>Power</hi> we have, as Men, for avoiding
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47885:29"/>
Covetouſneſs will conſiſt in the Fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring our Honour by the ſordidneſs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; the <hi>Power</hi> we have to hinder us from being Prodigal, will conſiſt in the Fear of ruining our Affairs, when we aſpire at gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a famous Reputation by our Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Fear of Diſeaſes will make us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Temptations of Pleaſure; <hi>Self-love</hi> will render us moderate and circumſpect, and even thro' Pride we ſhall appear humble and modeſt. But this is only to paſs from one Vice to another; if we would give our Soul ſtrength enough to riſe above one Infirmity without relapſing into another, we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and ſtir it up by Motives not taken from the <hi>World.</hi> The proſpect of Time may cauſe it to paſs from Diſorder to Diſorder; but the bare view of <hi>Eternity</hi> includes ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives as are proper to elevate it far above the Region of all its Infirmities. None but this Object touches and ſanctifies, becauſe this alone mounts us high enough for to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally renouncing the World. We have ſeen ſome Preachers, of a ſublime and lofty Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, work no Effect, becauſe they did not well underſtand how to intereſt and engage the <hi>Immortal Nature</hi>; and on the contrary, we have ſeen a very mean Talent touch and affect all the World by inartificial Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, becauſe they ſhot the right Mark, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aid hold of Men by the Motives of <hi>Eternity.</hi> Motives, which repeated a thouſand ways
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47885:30"/>
and ſometimes very groſly and unpolitely, have won the moſt enlighten'd and purify'd Souls, becauſe they take them by what is greateſt and moſt weighty in them, and moſt conſiderable in all external Objects. The Motives of <hi>Time</hi> have but a limited, but the Motives of <hi>Eternity</hi> have as it were an infinite Strength, which is ſuſpended meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by our Corruption.</p>
                  <p>Hence it follows, that as <hi>Self-love</hi> is the general Source of thoſe Motives which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine our Heart, ſo 'tis Self-love, as it looks towards Eternity, that makes all the ſtrength we have to raiſe ourſelves above the Confines of the World. There is no better way to juſtify this laſt Truth, than by ſeeing what the ſenſe of our Immortality is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of working in us, what Influence it has upon our Motions and Actions, and of what uſe it is in our Heart. This we proceed to examine at large.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>WE certainly ſee, that whatſoever comforts, raiſes and ſatisfies us, takes its Birth from this Original; 'tis only
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47885:30"/>
in the Idea and Senſe of our <hi>Immortality,</hi> that we find true and ſolid Conſolations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Fears of Death, as 'tis eaſy to ſhew by conſidering this Object every way.</p>
                  <p>The Idea of <hi>Death</hi> includes Six others: an Idea of Deſertion or Leaving, an Idea of Neceſſity, an Idea of Solitude, an Idea of Deſtruction, an Idea of Judgment, and an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of Miſery. The Idea of <hi>Deſertion</hi> or Leaving imports, that we leave All, and all leaves us. This Idea mortifies and afflicts Self-love, becauſe it repreſents to it the rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and diſappointment of its Applications and Deſires. It beholds its loſs of the Time preſent, and a Curtain is drawn upon the Future; and indeed, I confeſs, Man has very good reaſon to be afraid till the Curtain is, as it were, drawn back by Repentance; and he can aſſure himſelf of the Remiſſion of his Sins, without which, he is uncapable of any Comfort either in Life or Death; but when he hath made his Peace with his God, which he may know by the State of his Heart and the Sentiment of his Conſcience, he certainly ought to have quite different Ideas of <hi>Death:</hi> what he regrets and bemoans is of very ſmall Moment, if he compare it not only with the glorious Eternity, promis'd him in the Goſpel, but alſo with his own natural Excellency. He ought to make it a Matter of the greateſt Wonder, that a Mind, which by the inviolable Inclinations
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47885:31"/>
of its Nature flies up to <hi>Infinity,</hi> ſhould ſo long buiſy it ſelf with the Trifles of this Life; and one may ſay, without adding an Hyperbole to this <hi>Mind,</hi> that if it has loſt any thing, 'tis Life, and not Death, that ought to bear the Blame. Life has involv'd it in the Loſs of many precious things, its Sanctity, the ſenſe of God's Love, &amp;c. and to retrieve its Damage, has given it nothing but Shows and Appearances, but Death will advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly indemnify and repair its Loſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it depart in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Death deprives us of our Five Senſes; whereupon <hi>Self-love</hi> makes this Reſentment, That if it be a great Affliction for a Man to loſe his Seeing or Hearing, 'tis a much greater to loſe all his Senſes at once: but Self-love is miſtaken, for we are ſo far from loſing all our five Senſes, that 'tis certain we do not really loſe one of them: we don't become uncapable of Seeing, Hearing and Speaking; 'Tis not the Nature of Things, but the free Inſtitution of God, that hath affix'd theſe Perceptions of our Soul to the Organs of our Body, to which they had naturally no more Relation, than to the <hi>Matter</hi> which is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Center of the Earth, howſoever Men may be prejudic'd in this Matter. Would we ſay ſuch a Man has loſt his Sight, the natural Diſpoſition of whoſe Faculties God ſhould have ſo chang'd as to have order'd that his Eyes ſhould have no more Priviledge
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47885:31"/>
than the reſt, and that all the parts of his Body ſhould be capable of Seeing? This is the Idea of a Man that loſes one way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and ſees this infinite Abyſs of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, which is naturally in him, adequate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fill'd.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Loſſes which prejudic'd Nature imagines it is at by Death, become ſo much the more ſenſible as they are unavoidable, and impos'd by a fatal <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſiſted.

                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:47885:32"/>Our Soul aſſuredly owes a great part of its Repugnancy, and Unwillingneſs to leave the Body, to <hi>Custome</hi> and <hi>Prejudices;</hi> to ſee this, we need only reflect upon our paſt Life, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark and muſter up together all its Pleaſures and ſeriouſly ask our ſelves, whether all that countervails our paſt Grief and Trouble? On one ſide, what if it pleas'd the Author of Nature to endow a Soul, which is form'd to animate a Body, with a moſt diſtinct Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Dignity and Perfections of its <hi>Nature,</hi> the Grandeur of its <hi>End,</hi> and the Nobility of its <hi>Extraction;</hi> and on the other it were inform'd diſtinctly of all the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of all the baſe and painful Dependances which it goes to eſpouſe, by eſpouſing this Body, pray would not the very firſt Moment of its Life certainly ſeem the beginning of Death? So for this reaſon 'twas neceſſary that the confus'd <hi>Senſations</hi> of Nature, which alligate and faſten us to Life, ſhould precede the diſtinct <hi>Ideas</hi> which are proper enough in themſelves to free and looſen us from it, and that the former ſhould be naturally of greater Force and Activity than the latter. For tho' God would not have us be exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fond of Life, yet the Author of Nature was oblig'd to intereſs and engage us in the Preſervation of Corporeal <hi>Nature,</hi> without which there would be no Society.</p>
                  <p>Death has two very different, and alſo very oppoſite Aſpects, as we conſider it with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47885:32"/>
reference to the Soul. For <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> may both be ſaid to make the Debaſement and Glory of Man. Life makes the Glory of the Body, and the Debaſement of the Soul; 'tis by Life, that the <hi>Body</hi> is extended to the juſt and natural Proportion of its Parts. Life gives it Health, Strength, Agility, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and makes, in a word, all its Perfections. But Life cauſes the Debaſement of our Soul, it confines it to ſuch Objects as are no ways related to its natural Excellency, it makes this Mind buiſy it ſelf in trivial Affairs, and place its whole Concern in the management of a Family, a Field, a Vineyard, and the moſt abject and ſordid neceſſities of the Body, as if this immortal Mind was made for no higher and nobler Imployment, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long for ſome Moments the Duration of this frail <hi>Machine,</hi> to which it is united.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Life</hi> makes the Glory of the Body, and the Debaſement of the Soul, <hi>Death</hi> may be ſaid to make the Glory of the Soul, and the Debaſement of the Body. The Body falls, but the Soul riſes up and ſoars, as it were, to its native Heaven. The Body conſumes, and in proceſs of time relapſes into Duſt, but the Mind extends and enlarges it ſelf like a Divine <hi>Sphere,</hi> which becomes greater and greater proportionably to the nearneſs of its Approach to God. The Body is depriv'd of its former Motion, the Soul acquires ſuch Knowledge as it had not before. The Body
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47885:33"/>
mingles it ſelf with the Earth, the Soul is re-united to God.</p>
                  <p>The Debaſement, which enſues upon Death, lights upon an inſenſible lump of <hi>Matter.</hi> A Carcaſs, gnaw'd by devouring Worms, endures no Pain, it ſmells not thoſe noiſom Odours it exhales, is not terrify'd with the ſurrounding Darkneſs, nor is out of Conceit with it ſelf, even when 'tis nothing elſe but an horrid Miſcellany of Blood and Dirt, of Bones and Putrefaction. 'Tis an Illuſion and Cheat of prejudic'd Nature, that makes us affix our proper Ideas and Perceptions to ſuch Objects as do only occaſion them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Matter,</hi> when depriv'd of Life and Senſe, is plac'd in its natural State; this is no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement or Degradation to it; all the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſhonour and Turpitude is meerly in our Fancy. But the caſe is not the ſame, in reſpect of that Imbaſement and Degradation to which <hi>Life</hi> expoſes us. This is not the natural State of ſuch a Soul as ours; and doubtleſs the Author of Nature had never abandon'd it to ſuch a Condition but upon the account of Sin: Man indeed would have liv'd, but his Life would have been more Noble and Excellent. 'Tis a great miſtake to pretend, that Man's Death commences the Puniſhment of his Corruption. Life has already puniſh'd criminal Man by thoſe ſad Dependances, which alligate and confine the Thoughts, Cares, Deſires and Affections of ſo great and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47885:33"/>
noble a Soul, to the ſupport and preſervation of this ſordid Maſs of Clay, which we term our <hi>Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet ſuch is the Imbecillity and Weakneſs of Man, that he would needs fancy himſelf Debaſed where really he is not; and is not willing to perceive himſelf Debas'd where really he is ſo. An imaginary Debaſement frightens and terrifies him, and yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee a proper and real Debaſement.</p>
                  <p>But what if the Body be truly Degraded, ſo the Gain of the Soul does infinitely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate the Loſſes of the Body? Are we ſo weak as to think, that our <hi>Happineſs<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is ſo confin'd and fix'd to certain Affairs, Poſſeſſions, Offices, Houſholds, and a certain Circle of Perſons, with whom we have So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, as that we cannot be Happy without all theſe things?</p>
                  <p>We have almoſt the very ſame Notions of <hi>Death,</hi> as Children have, when they fancy they ſhall be weary with abiding in the Grave; and not dare to be alone in the <hi>Abyſs</hi> of ſurrounding Darkneſs. We terrify our ſelves with our own <hi>Phantomes</hi> and <hi>Chimae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s, we make ſuch a Confuſion of our proper Perceptions with the Grave, which is their Object, that we are ready to imagine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that Horrour in the Sepulchre, which is meerly a Creature of our own Fancy, and exiſts no where elſe but in our own Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:47885:34"/>We ſhould not fear this pretended <hi>Solitude,</hi> and apparent Privation which attend Death, if ſubſtituting the diſtinct Ideas of Reaſon, inſtead of the confuſed Perceptions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we would conſider that by Death we are not depriv'd either of the Subject, or the Cauſe of thoſe Delights which this World may have afforded us. For the Subject is our <hi>Soul,</hi> which ſtill remains; and the Cauſe is <hi>GOD,</hi> who is immortal and immutable. The reaſon why we regret and bemoan the loſs of the Sky, Earth, Elements, Society, is becauſe we inveſt theſe Things, with thoſe agreeable Senſations which they occaſion'd; not conſidering that we carry away with us the Colours, Cloth, Paint and Pencil which are neceſſary for drawing this admirable <hi>Picture;</hi> and that if God fail us not, we can nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r want any thing.</p>
                  <p>Nor ought the Idea of <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> which is included in Death, to trouble us any more than this Idea of <hi>Solitude,</hi> which we have been ſpeaking of. 'Tis true, Death ſeems to deſtroy Man ſeveral ways. In his account it deſtroys the World, it being certain that the Sun, Moon, Stars, Air, Earth, Sea, although they be not abſolutely Annihilated in themſelves, may yet be ſaid to be annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in reſpect of him, ſeeing that he cannot enjoy any longer Uſe of them. Man is not annihilated in himſelf, but in the <hi>Nature</hi> which he admires, and which periſhes as to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47885:34"/>
him; in the Society he has been us'd to, and which ceaſes to be any longer in his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; in his <hi>Body,</hi> the Inſtrument of his Pleaſures, which periſhes and moulders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the Duſt of the Grave. Let us ſee whether there be any thing Real in either of theſe Three kinds of Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, external Things cannot be ſaid to be annihilated both in themſelves, and in reſpect of thei. Uſe; for how do we know but the ſame Inſtitution in kind may ſtill remain and be in Force, tho' the manner of it ceaſe. Indeed there is no great likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of our having ſuch kind of <hi>Senſations</hi> after Death, as we had during our Life; for 'tis no longer neceſſary that theſe Senſations ſhould be proportion'd to the Condition and Preſervation of a Body, which in reſpect of us, ceaſes to ſubſiſt: The deſign which the Author of Nature hath had of engaging us in the Preſervation of this Body, by the Pleaſure which the Aliments excite in us, being accompliſh'd, and come to its intended Period, we eaſily conceive, that there being no longer Pleaſure to be excited in us by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments, <hi>Taſting</hi> has no place after Death, and is not a proper Faculty for the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the other World, unleſs God affix it to other Objects for different Ends. But methinks <hi>Hearing</hi> and <hi>Seeing</hi> being not only deſign'd for the Preſervation of the Body, but alſo for the Search and Purſuit of all
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:47885:35"/>
that may nouriſh the Admiration and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude we bear to the Creatour, we have no reaſon to believe, that theſe Senſations are terminated by Death. Indeed, I own, we ſhall not ſee by the Motion of the <hi>Optick Nerve</hi>; but yet we may be ſaid to ſee for all that. For pray, what has the ſhaking of the Optick Nerve common with the Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Light? Theſe things have no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Relation to each other; and if we ſee Light and viſible Things, by the occaſion of the Optick Nerve, mov'd after a certain manner, nothing hinders but we may have the ſame <hi>Senſations,</hi> by the occaſion of the Aethereal Matter, which us'd to agitate the Optick Nerve; which may be ſaid propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably of <hi>Hearing.</hi> But ſuppoſe we ſhould not have theſe very Senſations, what does that ſignify, ſince we ſhall certainly have Others, and thoſe of a more noble and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Kind? For as by loſing the Body we ſhall not be depriv'd of any thing but what confin'd and degraded us, we ought not to fear that our Soul will loſe any thing of the Purity and Excellency of its Operations, by diſentangling it ſelf from the Embraces of Matter.</p>
                  <p>'Tis neither our Duty nor Intereſt to meddle, and ſpend our Conjectures about thoſe things, which God thought fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal from our Knowledge: but, I believe, 'twould not be a piece of too great Boldneſs
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47885:35"/>
and Preſumption to conjecture, That as the <hi>Imbaſement</hi> and Vileneſs of Man during this Life, conſiſts in having his Reaſon ſubjected to Senſe; ſo the <hi>Glory,</hi> that will follow Death, conſiſts in a perfect ſubmiſſion of Senſe to the Empire of Reaſon. Indeed at preſent, as the Soul is deſcended from Heaven to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit a Tabernacle of Clay, it buiſies not it ſelf in enlarging its Views, or extending its Lights: but on the contrary, 'tis employ'd in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>cking and confining 'em, that it may not di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>dain to uſe them in preſerving the Body. But then, as the Soul will take its flight from theſe lower Regions, to its Heavenly Station, where it will have no longer need to care for the Support and Preſervation of the <hi>Body,</hi> but its whole Buſineſs will be to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God; 'twill no longer beſtir it ſelf to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and confine, but to purify and enlarge its Knowledge, in order to render it more worthy of God, about whom it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond <hi>Deſtruction</hi> we apprehend in Death is no leſs Imaginary; for tho' we ſee the Links which ty'd us to Society diſſolve and break, yet we ought not, for all that, to think we ſhall be exempted from all manner of Friendly Obligations. The Society of <hi>Spirits</hi> does very well countervail the Society of <hi>Bodies,</hi> whatever weak and prejudic'd Nature may think of it. And when we ſhall put off theſe Eyes and Ears, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47885:36"/>
for our Commerce and Converſation with Men, we ſolace our ſelves with this Lenitive, That we ſhall undoubtedly acquire other ways of Senſation and Knowledge, by vertue of another Inſtitution, proportion'd to our future Condition.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I grant that One, who ſtill lives in this World, and is depriv'd of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his <hi>Body,</hi> is to be pitty'd. But when a Man is tranſported into another <hi>World,</hi> ſees another Oeconomy of Objects, what ſhould he do with theſe Senſes, which have indeed ſome Relation to this preſent World, but not to his glorify'd <hi>State?</hi> The Miſchief ariſes from hence, That in the ordinary Idea we have of our ſelves, we attribute too much to the Body, and too little to the Soul; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as following the diſtinct Ideas of Things, we cannot aſcribe too much to a Spirit, nor too little to Matter.</p>
                  <p>And here I durſt advance a Maxim, which will ſeem a very great <hi>Paradox:</hi> Namely, That altho', according to the confus'd No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have of theſe things, <hi>Death</hi> be more capable of humbling us than <hi>Life;</hi> yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſtinct Notion, and in the reallity of the Thing it ſelf, Life is a more humbling and debaſing Object than Death.</p>
                  <p>Death humbles the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> the <hi>Prince,</hi> the <hi>Monarch:</hi> but Life humbles the <hi>Man,</hi> which is more than all that. Death ſnatches from us the props and ſupports of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47885:36"/>
our Vanity: but Life in the Debaſement, to which it pulls us down, ſuſpends in us moſt of the Senſe of our true <hi>Grandeur.</hi> Death brings the Body down into the Grave; but Life, as it were, calls down our Soul from <hi>Heaven.</hi> Death puts a Period to our ſecular Commerce with Men; but Life ſuſpends that natural Commerce we ought to have with God, and which our Heart perceives to be the <hi>End</hi> for which it was made. The Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuivants of Death are, Darkneſs, Worms and Putrefaction, whereof we are not ſenſible: Life is totally made up of Weakneſs, Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Infirmities, Diſgraces, of which we are ſenſible.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we are certainly prejudic'd and miſtaken, when we terrify our ſelves with the Ideas of <hi>Deſertion, Neceſſity, Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Deſtruction,</hi> which are not really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Image of Death; but herein indeed we do not miſtake, when we dread the Judgment of God, which accompanies Death; for certainly this cannot but ſeem terrible to a Conſcience that feels it ſelf la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with the Weight of a multitude of Sins, and pray where is there a Man, that finds not himſelf in this Condition, if he reflect but never ſo little upon his paſt Life? This <hi>Moment</hi> truly is dreadful, upon which we conceive all Eternity to depend; but 'tis certain that, even in this, the Heart of Man ſuggeſts to it ſelf many Cheats and Illuſions.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47885:37"/>
It fancies the Moment of Death to be the Price of Eternal <hi>Life:</hi> And conſiders not, that 'tis not this Inſtant, but its whole Life which God requires; that this moment hath nothing more pleaſing to God than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that its whole Importance conſiſts ſimply in this, That it is the concluding Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life: And Laſtly, That 'tis not this Moment that contracts and covenants with the Divine Juſtice, but all the Time we paſt in our Impenitence.</p>
                  <p>The Sentiments therefore of our <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,</hi> our <hi>Perfections,</hi> and our <hi>End,</hi> will har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monize and agree together admirably well; and with the other Sentiments and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Nature, and the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which God has given us for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, againſt all the ſeeming Frightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Horrour of this <hi>King of Terrors.</hi>

                  <p>CErtainly the Idea of our <hi>Immortality</hi> can never be too preſent to our Mind, for our Comfort and Conſolation, amidſt this eternal Circle of thoſe ſad and diſmal

                  <p>After all, what ſignifies it that we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and mortal in our Bodies? This State cannot laſt long. Why ſhould we embaraſs and perplex our ſelves with Cares and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude for the ſhort <hi>Futurity</hi> of this tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Life? Have we not another Futurity in View, which very well deſerves the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Care and Occupation of our Heart and Mind? What need we value the Menaces and Threats of the World? What can it do to us? It may indeed cruſh our Body into Atomes, but cannot deſtroy us. What if the Frame of the World periſh, Nature decline and ſhake, the Elements corrupt and decay, what if our Body be converted into Duſt, Worms or Vapour, what if it deſcend again into the Womb of its Mother <hi>Earth,</hi> or be diſpers'd into the fluid Air; the Ruines of the <hi>World</hi> will not cruſh and deſtroy our Soul, nor diſſolve that Divine Principle, which is in its own Nature uncapable of a Diſſolution? We think the Body, which cloaths us, is <hi>Our-ſelf:</hi> This is a miſtake; this Clay is not <hi>Our-ſelf,</hi> nor ever will be.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47885:38"/>
but this Union will not be with the ſame Submiſſion and Dependance: The Soul will not then follow the Condition of the Body, but the Body will be adjuſted, as far as is poſſible, to the State and Nature of the Soul; and as the Soul was once debaſed, even to the mean Condition of the Body, ſo as to fly God, and bend its Inclinations to Earthly Things; the Body will now be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to elevate it ſelf to the State of the Soul, ſo as to decline and quit all Earthly Cares, and to betake it ſelf to a joyful Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the <hi>Glory</hi> of God in the Heavenly Choir.</p>
                  <p>Certainly 'tis not to be wonder'd, That the <hi>Goſpel</hi> adminiſters more Comfort to us, I will not ſay, than Humane <hi>Wiſdom</hi> has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done; but yet much more than the <hi>Law,</hi> as Divine as it was: This is, becauſe it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reveals to us Life and Immortality, which are the only Objects that are capable of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying ſuch a Mind and Heart as ours, and ſo have Divine Relations to our Nature: But as this Obj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Here we diſcover the Grandeur of the Paſſions, the Grandeur of the Mind, to whoſe Empire they are Subject; and the Grandeur of Vertue, which regulates the Mind.

                  <p>'Tis not requiſite to ſhew, that our Vanity fails of obtaining theſe two Ends at which it aims.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47885:44"/>
when Men look hard upon us, proceeds not from this, That we know our ſelves too well, But that we know not our ſelves enough.</p>
                  <p>Such is <hi>Baſhfulneſs,</hi> the moſt polite and reaſonable of all the Vertues: Or rather the Artificial Diſguiſement of our Intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Pleaſure, which tho' ſuffering us even with delight to think of thoſe Pleaſures, of which we do not ſpeak without trouble and uneaſineſs, has the Care of regulating our Deſires; as if Corruption conſiſted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Expreſſions than Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Vertue,</hi> as Defective and Falſe as it is, ſprings from a very good Source; it certainly riſes from a ſenſe of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Excellency. Had <hi>Nature</hi> deſign'd us for none but Animal Actions, as we conceive Beaſts to have no other End, we ſhould be as far from Bluſhing, as they, at thoſe Actions which bear a Character of our Conformity and Likeneſs to them: But <hi>Immortal</hi> and Incorruptible, as Naturally we are, 'tis hard, That, notwithſtanding that State of Vileneſs and Ignorance, to which <hi>Sin</hi> has reduc'd us, we ſhould not ſee ſomething of that Dignity which does ſo nobly Diſtinguiſh us; and conſequently, that we ſhould not have ſome ſenſe of <hi>Shame,</hi> at any Thing which ſeems to Vilify and Degrade us.</p>
                  <p>But Laſtly, this Vertue, as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid, does not riſe very high, when we exerciſe it only by the confus'd Sentiment

Certainly 'tis not the Property, of the Carnal and Animal Man, to Bluſh at the <hi>Vileneſs</hi> of Nature; 'tis the incommunicable Property of the immortal Man, to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at this: The Shame indeed, of a <hi>Worldling,</hi> may aſpire at gaining the Eſteem of other Men, by an affected Purity; but the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Much the ſame is to be ſaid of <hi>Modeſty,</hi> as of <hi>Baſhfulneſs:</hi> Were the Approbation of Men a ſufficient Reward, we ſhould have no Reaſon to conceal and cloak our Deſign of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting it, nor the Joy wherewith it careſſes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47885:45"/>
and tickles us; but as the Inſtinct, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us of our Excellency, ſecretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces us, That this Eſteem is too trivial and inconſiderable for limiting all our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, 'tis not to be wonder'd, if we take care to hide our Deſire of being eſteem'd, or the Eſteem and Value we have for our ſelves: Yet if we look ſomewhat cloſely in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we ſhall find, that moſt commonly there is nothing but Falſhood and Hypocriſy in this Vertue, as 'tis uſually practic'd in the World. Men that ſeem Modeſt when they are prais'd, are not ſo when they are Blam'd and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; This is no wonder, for that Vertue cannot be of any great Force, which ows its Original to our <hi>Infirmity;</hi> and we are not rais'd very high, when we fall down again to the Center of our <hi>Vanity,</hi> which makes an apparent Grandeur and real Debaſement. The <hi>Modeſty,</hi> which ſprings from the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our immortal Condition, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of our Situation above the Sphere of that Eſteem, which ties and confines us to temporal Things, has a much greater Forcc and Elevation: It ſeems almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Diſ-praiſe,</hi> and is ready to put 'em in an equal Ballance; and makes us Eſteem and Value none but thoſe Things which relate to this grand <hi>Eternity</hi>; which is the Rule, whereby we meaſure the Price and Worth of all other Things: And as we ſee, that Perſons very Eminent, or
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47885:45"/>
who are ſo at leaſt in their own Conceits, ſeem more capable of <hi>Modeſty</hi> than others; becauſe their real, or imaginary Elevation and Advancement, places 'em above the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the Vulgar ſort: So may we more truly ſay, That One well inſtructed by the diſtinct Ideas of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the Promiſes of <hi>Religion,</hi> concerning the lofty Deſtinies of Man, has no great Temptation to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported and dazzled, at what Degree ſoever of Proſperity, and temporal Glory he finds himſelf Advanc'd.</p>
                  <p>To this I add, That <hi>Humility,</hi> which is the very Soul of <hi>Modeſty,</hi> and all the other Vertues, cannot proceed from any other Source, than a ſenſe of our Natural <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</hi> Whilſt you make light of Man, as Man, you can Eſteem only thoſe weak and mean Advantages, which make the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Conditions, and the Diſtinction of Perſons; and conſequently, cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and deſpiſe thoſe, who fail of theſe Advantages; deal with 'em Diſreſpectfully, prefer your ſelves before 'em, and Advance, as it were, above their Lowneſs, which is the moſt dangerous Character of <hi>Pride:</hi> But if you are perſwaded, that <hi>Man</hi> is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Thing, which deſerves Eſteem in Man, you'll reſpect in your <hi>Neighbour,</hi> whatever is common to him with you: And tho' the Order of Society, which is that of GOD Himſelf, eſtabliſhing a mutual Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47885:46"/>
aſſures you of his Submiſſion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Homages, yet will you have for him an inward Reſpect and Veneration, as he hath for you; and diſcover thro' theſe nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <hi>Dependances,</hi> which make you his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, an Original and Eternal <hi>Grandeur,</hi> which renders him your Equal in that, which you look upon, as the moſt eſtimable Part of your Nature.</p>
                  <p>Then indeed we may conceive Man to be moderate, in the Abundance of temporal Goods, conſtant in Adverſity, and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in all Conditions; tho' the <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which Worldlings make a ſhow of, in the higheſt Elevations of Earthly Pageantry be but a ſecret Deſire of ſeeming Greater, than thoſe things which raiſe 'em: The <hi>Moderation,</hi> of the immortal Man, is purely a Senſe of his own Excellency, which truly raiſes him above all thoſe things that ſeem'd capable of raiſing and advancing him. 'Tis the Property of <hi>Pride</hi> to diſguiſe it ſelf, that it may hide the Diſproportion betwixt what a Man is, and what he believes is in the World. <hi>Piety,</hi> which looks on thoſe things as <hi>Atomes,</hi> which ſeem like vaſt <hi>Coloſſus's</hi> in the World's Eye, need but bear it ſelf up in the Height of its natural Situation, to ſee under its Feet the vain Pomp of Humane <hi>Grandeur;</hi> and the equally vain Multiplicity of Diſgraces and Calamities, which, like a Whirl-wind; agitate and toſs this Lump of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47885:46"/>
Clay, and reverſe theſe Tabernacles of Duſt. The Worldling can put on an affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Conſtancy,</hi> to make People think him ſtronger than Adverſity; and that this <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> places him above the reach of bad Fortune: This Sentiment becomes not a Man that includes all his Remedies in <hi>Time</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but is fitly plac'd in his Breaſt, who finds himſelf made for <hi>Eternity:</hi> without a counterfeit and feign'd Magnanimity, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Religion do ſufficiently raiſe him for making him patient under all Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conſtant without Affectation.</p>
                  <p>Such a Man can fill, and adequately an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the Idea and Model of the <hi>higheſt Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi> when his Vocation calls him to expoſe his Perſon to the Dangers of War; and to let Men ſee what they never yet ſaw in the World, A Man valiant by Reaſon, and ſtout without external Cultivation and Diſcipline His Fortitude will not owe its Force to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, which hinders him from reflecting on what he does; nor to Example, which obliges him to follow in Danger, the Steps of other Men; nor to Worldly Concerns, which bid him not flinch and give Ground, where <hi>Honour</hi> calls; nor laſtly, to an heap of Conſiderations, wheh may ſerve as a Veil to hinder him from ſeeing the impendent Danger: The immortal Man expoſes himſelf to Death, becauſe he very well knows that he cannot Dye.</p>

                     </hi> ſince all its brave Men are either fearful of Death, or owe their Intrepidneſs to their own Infirmity: Thinking to be Valiant, they ceaſe to be Men; and going to look Death in the Face, they loſe the Sight of themſelves; but the immortal Man expoſes himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he underſtands and knows himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Tho' we cannot find a true <hi>Heroe</hi> in the World, yet we cannot but love thoſe who appear to be ſuch: <hi>Heroiſm</hi> in that Man's Principles, who includes all his Hopes in the World, is a meer Extravagance; yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but admire thoſe Perſons who bear this Character: This undoubtedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a Senſe of our Grandeur and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which teaches us confuſedly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the admiſſion of Reaſon to theſe Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Heart, that <hi>Man</hi> is above all. We are inwardly pleas'd and delighted to ſee a Fellow quarrelling with <hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>Fortune;</hi> we love to ſee him rais'd above Dangers by his Valour, and above all Applauſe by his Modeſty: we would have nothing ſhake his Stoutneſs and Courage, and tho' we cannot bear, that his <hi>Pride</hi> ſhould deſpiſe us, yet we love he ſhould deſpiſe all the Injuries of the Elements, the Perſecution of Men; and ſhew himſelf greater than all thoſe Things, which ſeem'd capable of pulling down his Creſt. <hi>Conſtancy</hi> ſuits not with a periſhing Man; but agrees with, I know not what, confus'd
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47885:47"/>
Senſe of our Grandeur, which finds nothing too Great for its vaſt Capacity.</p>
                  <p>Hence undoubtedly ſprung that Idea of a <hi>Wiſe Man,</hi> which the <hi>Stoicks</hi> vainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to anſwer: For truly their Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes in the Principles of One, who believes not an Eternity, are highly Extravagant; yet however Extravagant they may be, they excite a kind of Admiration in our Heart, which we uſe not to have at Things purely impoſſible. We ſhould laugh at that Man's Folly, who ſhould fancy he had <hi>Wings</hi> to fly with; and indeed the Notion of a <hi>Sage,</hi> who pretends he is rais'd above all adverſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, and yet caſts not his Eye beyond the Limits of <hi>Mortality,</hi> is no leſs unreaſonable and ſenſeleſs; yet we find in this Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſomething not altogether diſpleaſing, which our Soul inſenſibly admires: This undoubtedly proceeds purely from this Cauſe, That theſe Paradoxes agree, and ſuit with a confus'd Senſe of our natural <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> which forſakes us not, tho' it be uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unknown.</p>
                  <p>This Senſe is diſguis'd and hidden, in the midſt of the apparent <hi>Infirmities,</hi> and <hi>Baſeneſs</hi> of our Nature, as Diamonds are in the Entrails of the Earth, mingled with Dirt or Droſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as theſe muſt be purify'd and cleanſed to give 'em their native Luſtre and Brightneſs, and to know their Value or Worth: ſo is it neceſſary to purify this Senſe, of our
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47885:48"/>
natural Excellency, by the Ideas of <hi>Religion,</hi> that we may ſee its Beauty and Perfection.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtian</hi> mantains theſe Paradoxes, and fills the prodigious Vacuity of theſe Maximes: All of 'em become reaſonable upon the Principle of <hi>Immortality,</hi> provided they be rightly underſtood.</p>
                  <p>If they tell us the <hi>Wiſe Man</hi> is without Paſſion, we ſhall find, that this Character ſuits with the Immortal Man; provided, that by Paſſion you mean the Alteration, which uſually attends the Paſſions, as theſe <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> ſeem to have done: For how can a Man that is made for Eternity, if he act conformably to the exact and true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he ought to have of himſelf, be very much embaraſs'd and perplex'd, with Cares and Paſſions, which wholly relate to <hi>Time?</hi> Plac'd, as it were, upon a lofty Mountain, he hears, with a ſerene and undiſturb'd <hi>Mind,</hi> the Wind blow; the Thunder roar, and the Lightning Clouds burſt under his Feet: If few Men enjoy this Tranquillity and Regard, with a generous Indifferency, the <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Evils</hi> of this Life, 'tis becauſe they are too ignorant of their immortal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; whereof even Nature gives 'em an obſcure Glimpſe, and a confus'd Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Or, becauſe they can't keep up in that lofty Situation, to which <hi>Religion</hi> advanc'd 'em. All this ſhews, that there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat <hi>Wiſe Man;</hi> yet this does not hinder
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47885:48"/>
us from concluding, that 'tis the Character of a Wiſe Man, to live without Alteration; &amp; that we find this Character more or leſs perfect, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as a Man remembers what himſelf is.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Wiſe Man</hi> ought to be ſufficient to himſelf, may we not very well apply this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea to the <hi>Immortal Man;</hi> who cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve his true Condition of coming from, and returning to God, without being aſſur'd, That Worldly Objects, which hinder him from knowing his true Original and End, are far from ſatisfying his Wants? For this Maxim muſt not be underſtood, in a Senſe excluſive of God; without whom we are Nothing at all: But in a Senſe excluſive of the <hi>World;</hi> without which, 'tis true, we both are, and are Happy. I confeſs that he, who has fix'd all his Deſires upon Earthly Objects, can't live without Company and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; without that, he is plung'd in the Ideas of the Miſery and Vanity of all temporal Things: He cannot Live, unleſs he be diverted from the Thoughts of <hi>Death;</hi> he cannot Dye, unleſs he ſee thoſe Perſons, who ſtill buiſy him with the Thoughts of <hi>Life:</hi> His Proſperity and Fortune become inſupportable, unleſs thoſe Perſons have a ſhare with him, who divert his Mind; hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it from thinking of the fatal <hi>Neceſſity</hi> that's impos'd upon him, of ſeeing it ſpeedily come to a Period. A weak and ſilly <hi>Creature,</hi> that ſtumbles into a Precipice, and to retard
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47885:49"/>
its Fall for a Moment, lays hold of any thing it can catch by; but he's ſurpriz'd with falling down, maugre theſe vain Supports, into the inevitable Abyſs, which he ſees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. The <hi>Immortal Man</hi> has no need of making theſe Diſguiſements, in order to obtain Conſolation and Comfort, and keep the Poſſeſſion of himſelf: He affixes, even to <hi>Death,</hi> an Idea of Glory and Excellency; which makes him look upon all that with Anger and Vexation, which diverts his Thoughts from this Object: He's never bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleas'd than when he conſiders the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Condition of his Soul. The <hi>Farrago</hi> of temporal Goods, ſeems to him like an Heap of Duſt thrown into his Eyes, to hinder him from the Enjoyment of his own Perfections; whatſoever diverts, and pleaſes the Heart and Mind of other Men, is a Burthen to him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it keeps him from meditating, and thinking of his real <hi>Happineſs.</hi> This Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox therefore is not at all Extravagant in the Mind of that Man, who knows and loves himſelf as he ought; if it fail of Truth, this is to be imputed to our <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,</hi> and nothing but our Error and Folly do render it Unreaſonable and Senſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>Let the <hi>Wiſe Man</hi> command and govern the Stars, be rais'd above Fate, and more happy and perfect than <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf; theſe Expreſſions are ſo much the more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, as they ſeem Impious and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47885:49"/>
but we may put a favourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction upon them: And certainly if the immortal Man be ſaid to be rais'd above the Stars, above the Concatenation of natural Things, and thoſe <hi>Heroes,</hi> who, after their Death, were ſet up for Gods; or, even thoſe Gods, ſo much like weak and ſinful Men, which <hi>Paganiſm</hi> invented, 'tis no more than what is true. We know the Stars, tho' they know not us; we owe them Nothing, but they are beholding to us for the glittering Luſtre of their Perfections: And, I dare ſay, 'tis more Natural, that they ſhould be in a State of Dependance upon us, than we upon them; and tho' it pleas'd the Author of Nature, that they ſhould make a neceſſary Impreſſion upon us; yet 'tis not for their Glory, but our Advantage, that he eſtabliſh'd this Order in the <hi>Univerſe.</hi> The <hi>Sun</hi> rules over the Day, and the <hi>Moon</hi> the Night; but <hi>God</hi> alone rules over Man: And his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are excellently confirm'd by Religion, when it teaches us, That God made him Maſter over the Works of his Hands, and <hi>King</hi> of the viſible World. If Fate be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of external Objects, and ſecond Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it can have no power over Man; becauſe theſe Objects periſh and come to an End, but Man does not. If <hi>Jupiter</hi> be a God, guilty of Ambition, Injuſtice and Intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the Idea of this pretended <hi>Divinity</hi> is much more ignoble and inferior than that of a

He's troubled to ſee People crying about him; the ſympathiſing of Others, with his pretended Miſery, caſts him down, and calls him back, as it were, from <hi>Heaven,</hi> to theſe gloomy Regions: In Solitude and Retirement, he finds himſelf advanc'd above outward Accidents, and the Opinions of Men; he can freely ſay, what a confus'd Notion of Man's Excellency, caus'd a <hi>Heathen</hi> Poet to utter:

                  <p>But if our Comfort and Elevation be grounded in the Senſe of our <hi>Immortality,</hi> 'tis from thence likewiſe, that our real Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Contentment proceeds.</p>
                  <p>Our Heart is a kind of devouring Fire, which mounts up higher and higher, and never ſays, 'tis Enough: Give it all it can reaſonably ask, 'twill but ſtill form new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; if it be Maſter of the Univerſe, 'twill either, like <hi>Alexander,</hi> Wiſh for <hi>new Worlds to Conquer;</hi> or will grow out of Conceit with its proper Grandeur, like thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, who, when come to be Lords and Maſters of Mankind, diſ-reliſh and nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeate their Puiſſance and Greatneſs; find an extream Diſproportion betwixt the Good they have obtain'd, and the Ardour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they deſir'd it.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47885:53"/>
Knowledge. We term Heart, Will, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, the <hi>Soul,</hi> as it has the Affections of Love, Hatred, Deſire, Fear, Joy, Hope, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, or any other of the Paſſions. I think we ſhall not be much out of the Way, if we define the Mind, <hi>the Soul as it knows;</hi> and the Heart, <hi>the Soul as it loves:</hi> For as Conceptions, Judgments, and Diſcourſes, are but different Modes of Knowledge, ſo 'tis certain that Deſire, Fear, Hope, and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral all other Affections, are only Modes or different Manners of Love; but this is not to be inſiſted upon at preſent.</p>
                  <p>Our Buſineſs here is to know, Whether the Original Source of our <hi>Corruption,</hi> be in the <hi>Mind,</hi> or in the <hi>Heart:</hi> Whether the firſt Spring of our <hi>Evil,</hi> be in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our <hi>Soul,</hi> or in its Affections. We anſwer, That 'tis not in the Mind, becauſe then the Mind would have been order'd to conduct and regulate it ſelf, by the Dictates of the Heart; whereas we ſee the Heart has been order'd to regulate it ſelf by the Mind. For 'twould be unreaſonable, that what is leſs Corrupted, ſhould be guided by that which is more irregular and diſorderly; and that the Source of our Corruption, ſhould be the Rule of our Conduct: and indeed were it ſo, A Man would not be oblig'd to ſteer and guide himſelf by his Reaſon, 'till he ſhould have been aſſur'd, that God had extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily enlightned him; and he muſt wait

for an <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> and immediate Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before he could have Right to act in the Quality of a Rational Creature.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the Holy <hi>Scripture</hi> always attributes the Offuſcation, and Darkneſs of the Mind, to the evil Affections of the Heart: <hi>If our Goſpel be hidden,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, 'tis hidden to them that periſh, whoſe Underſtandings the God of this Age has blinded.</hi> 'Tis eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, That by the God of this Age, he means the <hi>Demon</hi> of Concupiſcence: And upon almoſt the like Account, our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How can ye believe, ſeeing that ye ſeek for Glory one of another?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly, were the <hi>Mind</hi> the Original of our Depravation, 'twould always, and in all Circumſtances, have its natural Obſcura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Darkneſs; 'twould be as blind in the Study of the <hi>Sciences,</hi> as of <hi>Religion,</hi> and 'twould ſucceed no better in knowing ſuch Objects, as are indifferent to it, than thoſe, which intereſs and concern it. When an Eye is cover'd with a Web, or clos'd up by an Obſtruction, 'tis not in a Condition to ſee one Object, more than another; but when its Darkneſs proceeds from the Obſtacle of Clouds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fog, or any exterior Veil, 'tis eaſier for it to perceive diſtant Objects, and 'twill ſee very clearly when the extraneous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment is remov'd, without receiving any Change or Alteration in it ſelf.

                  <p>This is a common Matter of Fact<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One that has a Rectitude of Mind, and Exactneſs of admirable Reaſon, for apprehending what is moſt abſtruſe, and intricate in the <hi>Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> who knows when to doubt and ſuſpend his Aſſent to things that are Dubious; to affirm true Things, and deny Falſe; to have a ſimple Opinion of probable Things, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate thoſe that are Certain, who will not miſtake True for Falſe, nor one Degree of Truth for another; will no ſooner have a Point of <hi>Intereſt</hi> to manage, but his former Rectitude of Mind forſakes him; his Reaſon bends to the Humour of his Deſires, and Evidence is confounded with Utility and Profit. Whence proceeds this Darkneſs? From the Objects? No, For theſe Objects are eaſier and clearer, than thoſe of the ſublime and lofty <hi>Sciences,</hi> which he ſo well-pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated and underſtood. Is it from any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Defect of the Mind?

and put it to Diſcourſe of ſecular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, provided they be not its own, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man's, 'twill reaſon about 'em with the ſame Exactneſs.</p>
                  <p>But if after you have carried the <hi>Mind</hi> of this Man, from the Objects of the <hi>Sciences,</hi> to the <hi>Affairs</hi> of Life, you call it again from thence, to the Conſideration of the Truths of <hi>Religion,</hi> you'll perhaps find his Mind yet more obnoxious to Falſhood and Illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Becauſe a greater Intereſt, does alſo produce a greater Errour. Such a Paſſion as <hi>Intereſt,</hi> is of very great Prevalence and Force, in obſcuring the Light of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but yet thoſe Paſſions, which directly oppoſe <hi>Reaſon,</hi> are more capable of producing this ill Effect: For, 'tis not, as Men commonly imagine, the Degree of Darkneſs, which is originally in the Underſtanding, that cauſes the Number of our Paſſions; but 'tis the Number and Vehemency of the Paſſions, that cauſe this Degree of Darkneſs in our Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>But were the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> originally Darken'd, it would not be remedied, unleſs by a new and extraordinary Infuſion of Light, which is contrary to Experience: For the Underſtanding of a <hi>Sinner,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to a ſtrict Repentance for his Tranſgreſſions, is not fill'd with other Ideas and Knowledge, than he had before: I mean, according to the ordinary Courſe of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47885:55"/>
Things. A Man indeed, after his Converſion, has the Ideas of <hi>God, Salvation</hi> and <hi>Eternity,</hi> he's convinc'd of his own Mortality, and the Frailty of Humane Things: He looks upon Piety, as a moſt proper Means, for procuring Repoſe and Tranquillity in Life; Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Comfort in Death, and a Glorious Reſurrection from the Grave. But yet he was fully perſwaded, of all theſe Truths, before his Repentance: (For I ſuppoſe he Sinn'd not in Incredulity.) Wherefore he cannot be ſaid, to have acquir'd any new Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but to have tranſcrib'd that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge into Practice, which before was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Speculative. And our Saviour does partly teſtify this, in declaring to his Enemies, That the Degree of their <hi>Knowledge,</hi> aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated their Blame. Indeed the want of Light excuſes a Man from the Faults he commits, when this Privation is neceſſary and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary: For is any One to be blam'd, for not ſeeing that which 'twas impoſſible for him to ſee? Nor can we excuſe him, whoſe Blindneſs we ſuppoſe to be voluntary, and willful. He that is deceiv'd and miſtaken by reaſon of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and not thro' any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural want of Light, ſees and not ſees: He has <hi>Knowledge</hi> enough to perceive, that he follows not his own Light; and this ſeems the only Means of reconciling two Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> which appear very Contradictory: For one while it accuſes the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47885:55"/>
                     <hi>Sinner</hi> of Ignorance, Folly, Stupidity, Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of walking in Darkneſs, of not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he does; another while it blames him for Sinning againſt his own Light; for reſiſting the Truth which enlightens him; for being condemn'd by his own Thoughts, and reprehended by his Conſcience. All theſe Expreſſions are true, and only ſeem to be oppoſite: The <hi>Sinner</hi> does both ſee, and not ſee: He ſees by the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> which God hath given him, capable of knowing and making uſe of the Truth; he is Blind, and does not ſee, by his <hi>Heart,</hi> which evaporates and ſends up, to the Seat of the Superior Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul, continual Fumes and Clouds, which obnubilate and darken the <hi>Underſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant, that the <hi>Schools</hi> uſe to make a Diſtinction, betwixt two ſorts of Knowledge or Light, that they may ſolve this Difficulty: <hi>viz.

                  <p>If we look narrowly into this Point, we ſhall find, That Knowledge is ordinarily ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Speculative,</hi> or <hi>Practical,</hi> according as it concerns, or not concerns our <hi>Heart.</hi> When we conſider <hi>Truth,</hi> in the <hi>Sciences,</hi> we have uſually no more than a <hi>Speculative</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it; but conſidering it in the Objects, which intereſt and concern us, as in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of civil Life, or Points of Religion, we hate it, or love it, according as 'tis agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or diſagreeable; and it determines us to Action, or Averſation, according as it bears one, or t'other of theſe Characters: Hence you ſee, that the <hi>Practical Truth</hi> of the <hi>School-men</hi> is that, which has ſome Force and Efficacy; but <hi>Truth</hi> draws its whole Force from the <hi>Heart.</hi>

                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:47885:58"/>Its no matter, tho' the <hi>Vulgars</hi> are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, in apprehending the Stars like Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys: But 'tis a great exorbitance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Fault for thoſe <hi>Sages,</hi> who have ſuch exact Ideas of the Magnitude of the Heavenly Bodies, yet to look upon Eternity, GOD, and Religion, as but ſo many Points, or rather ſo many Shadows and remote Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances. Our <hi>Reaſon</hi> may be enlighten'd, tho' it has the former Prejudice; but if it has the latter, it muſt needs be blind.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis very eaſy to juſtify the Mind, and to make it appear, that 'tis not the original Fountain of our <hi>Corruption,</hi> by examining its different ways and manners of Knowing: For, to begin with the ſimple Conceptions of our Underſtanding; no <hi>Idea</hi> in our <hi>Soul</hi> is Evil as ſuch, or as it repreſents an Object to us. The Objects of Pleaſure, Glory, nay, and of Sin it ſelf, have nothing Criminal in themſelves, ſeeing we are permitted to know theſe Objects; the ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>Judgments,</hi> and <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> of the <hi>Soul.</hi> Nor are the firſt Notions Criminal, ſeeing that they are of ſo clear and ſo eaſy Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the Mind no ſooner begins to exerciſe and uſe its Reaſon, but it preſently apprehends 'em. <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> is a kind of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r'd Knowledge, which will never deceive us unleſs the <hi>Heart</hi> interpoſe and mingle it ſelf with it; For 'tis an uſual ſaying, that <hi>Common Senſe never deceives;</hi> to denote that Man Reaſon's well Naturally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:47885:58"/>Yet, by the way, 'tis to be obſerv'd, that, among our different kinds of Knowledge, <hi>Ideas</hi> have more Force to determine our Will, than the <hi>Judgments,</hi> or <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> of the Mind; this is true Generally ſpeaking: The reaſon of it is, becauſe our Notices, as we have already remark'd, have no Force of themſelves; but borrow it all from the Affections of the <hi>Heart.</hi> And hence it comes to paſs, that Men are never very ſucceſsful in Perſwading, unleſs they interpoſe, as it were, a mixture of Senſe among their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Knowledge. Now none, but a remote Good, can be mingled with Reaſons; for ſeeing you are oblig'd to uſe Reaſonings and Diſcourſes, in order to make it known, it appears, that 'tis at ſome Diſtance off: Whereas an <hi>Idea,</hi> or ſimple Perception, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the Quality, and being either pleaſant or unpleaſant, according to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of its Object, makes you of it ſelf actually feel and perceive that which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe makes you only expect and wait for.</p>
                  <p>But yet this is not the Source of the <hi>Evil.</hi> The Irregularity proceeds from this, That ſpiritual Ideas don't make near ſo great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon our Soul, as Corporeal Ideas, which enter'd in by the Channel of Senſe; whereas by right they ſhould make a much greater, ſince the Perception of our own Soul ought to be more vivid and lively than that of external Objects, and the experience
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47885:59"/>
of ſpiritual Things ſhould more nearly touch and affect us than the Knowledge of the Senſes, which concern us only in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Objects. <hi>Corporeal Ideas</hi> ſeem to be deſign'd for no other Purpoſe but for the good of the Body, which they conduct and guide, whereas <hi>Spiritual Ideas</hi> ought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our Soul, and lead it to the Sources and Fountains of its Happineſs; ſo that as much as the Value of our Soul exceeds that of the Body, ſo much are <hi>Spiritual Ideas</hi> Naturally more important, than <hi>Corporeal,</hi> and as they are more neceſſary, ſo ought they Naturally to make a greater and more lively Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                  <p>As Ideas are a kind of internal Senſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſant or unpleaſant, according to the Character of the Things they repreſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they partake of the Quality of their Objects; 'tis no miſtake to ſay, that they belong in ſome ſort to the Affections or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the Soul, which are either Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, as Senſations, or Spiritual, as the Affections of the <hi>Heart;</hi> ſo tho' we ſay the <hi>Corruption</hi> of Man ariſes from hence, That Corporeal Ideas make too lively and ſtrong Impreſſions upon the Soul, yet this does not contradict our Principle, that the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Reaſon</hi> proceeds from that of the <hi>Heart.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>THis Impoſture of the <hi>Heart,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the <hi>Mind,</hi> proceeds from volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Inapplications, affected Diſtractions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Ignorances, from Errours, occaſion'd by the ardent Deſire we have to Cheat our ſelves, and from this Inclination, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves and alienates our <hi>Mind</hi> from all that is Afflictive, and firmly binds it to all that is pleaſing and delightful.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Thing then, which the <hi>Heart</hi> does, is to fill us with unprofitable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that it may diſtract and divert us from thoſe, the Conſideration whereof would be more important and uſeful to us, tho' the ſight of 'em ſeem afflictive and unpleaſant. We find, among Others, two Ideas in our Soul, which we fear and dread above all the reſt; which are the Ideas of our <hi>Miſery</hi> and our <hi>Duty</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Idea of our <hi>Miſery</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends that of the Frailty of the World, of our own Mortality, our Sins, the Juſtice of GOD, our Vices, Infirmities, and of the Shame, which naturally follows 'em. The Idea of <hi>Duty</hi> includes a Thouſand Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are painful to ſuch a voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47885:60"/>
Soul as ours, troubleſome and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to an <hi>Heart</hi> affected with nothing but Pleaſure, mortifying to Pride, and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Self-love.</hi> Hence the moſt trivial Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, the moſt inſipid Diverſions, the moſt infructuous Knowledge, the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable Employments, become the Object of our Application or Enquiry, as if they were capable of rendering us Happy. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeems delightful but what unſettles and diſtracts us. Any thing that paſſes the Time away merrily and inſenſibly, and plunges us in the Ignorance of our ſelves, charms and allures us. The <hi>Gameſter</hi> ſpends his whole Life in a continual Tranſport from Joy to Sadneſs, from Hope to Fear; if any one ſhould hinder him from the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Succeſſion of his Thoughts and various Agitations, he would certainly deprive him of the whole Pleaſure of his Life: But you need not wonder at it; this Agitation and Hurry buiſies and employs him, and that's enough. He thinks himſelf Happy, if he can but be diſpenc'd with from Reflecting upon his <hi>Miſery:</hi> His Hope flatters him, even when he Loſes; and his Soul is always ſo flexible to any pleaſing Proſpect, that when he Wins, he believes he can never Loſe; and when he Loſes, he fills himſelf with Hopes of Winning. The Caſe is the ſame with the divers Profeſſions of Men: <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> follow by turns in that Path, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47885:60"/>
are connected to it, as we know too well by Experience; but our Soul is conſtant in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying its Regard to nothing elſe, but what tickles and flatters it; and if it chance to meet with an Evil, inſtead of the Good it expected, it forms to it ſelf an imaginary <hi>Felicity,</hi> made up purely of its own <hi>Chimera</hi>'s and Illuſions. Give an Ambitious Man what he demands; place him in the Rank he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd at, yet he'll hardly reap any other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, than to be able to conceive farther Hopes, and to put upon himſelf new Cheats and Impoſtures. We love and delight in <hi>War,</hi> not as 'tis an hazardous Profeſſion, that often expoſes us to Danger; or as 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious, by putting us to ſuffer great Hardſhip, but becauſe it buiſies our <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> by the extream Variety of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it preſents to 'em; and in ſome meaſure anſwers this eternal Agitation of our Soul, which flies and ſhuns the Sight or it ſelf, and ſeeks after Subjects for new Illuſions, wherewith to feed and divert it.</p>
                  <p>You don't think how remarkable the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions, and Impoſitions of the <hi>Heart</hi> are in the Affairs of civil Life. We firſt deceive and cheat our ſelves, and afterwards, if poſſible, other Men. Don't truſt my Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, my Honeſty, nor my long experienc'd Fidelity: Indeed I have Maxims of Equity and Rectitude in my <hi>Mind,</hi> which I uſe to regard; but the Corruption of my <hi>Heart</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:47885:61"/>
makes a Play-Game of theſe general Rules. To what purpoſe do I reſpect the Law of Juſtice, if I do it no farther than it ſtands with my Pleaſure and Conveniency; and if it be in the Power of my <hi>Heart,</hi> to perſwade me of the Juſtice, or Injuſtice of a Thing? Don't put any Confidence in it; the Vertue and Juſtice, by which I have attracted a great Name, and Reputation thro' the whole Courſe of my Actions, are not really in me, they only make an outward Appearance, to the end that Men may truſt and confide in me; whilſt Injuſtice lies in the Bottom of my <hi>Heart,</hi> to put <hi>Reaſon</hi> upon Action; and abſconds and hides it ſelf, that it may catch and ſurprize you with more Facility and Eaſe. But the greateſt Miſchief of it is, that one Illuſion breeds a great many others: For as an <hi>Heart,</hi> intereſted to pre-occupy and prejudice the <hi>Mind,</hi> to its own Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Concern, in oppoſition to the Truth, makes uſe of a multitude of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but falſe Reaſons, in order to ſupport its Pretences. The <hi>Soul,</hi> which affects its Reaſons, conſidering 'em with Pleaſure, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten re-collecting 'em and turning their beſt ſide outward, comes inſenſibly to take the Degree of its own Application for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their Evidence, and then it receives 'em as infallible Maxims, makes 'em a Source of Prejudices, which being falſe, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſuppoſed to be true, become to it a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47885:61"/>
perpetual Fountain of Error and Illuſion. Moreover, when in any Concern we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd againſt a Man for our own Intereſt and Profit; the Hatred we bear to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, makes us condemn all his Reaſons, and any that are Kin to thoſe which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in defending his Cauſe; as we ſee the Averſion we have to an Enemy will make us hate even an indifferent Perſon, if he do but any way reſemble him; and I leave any Man to gueſs, what Influence theſe Prejudices afterwards have upon our Actions and Conduct.</p>
                  <p>But to return to our <hi>Diſtractions,</hi> and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Inapplications: I think nothing is more extraordinary, than the Carriage and Proceeding of <hi>Democritus,</hi> who after having judg'd the Affairs, and Common-pleas of the <hi>Abderites,</hi> for many Years, with ſuch Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs and Ability, as put the whole World in Admiration, conſidering the Meanneſs of this Occupation, and willing to enjoy and live to himſelf, abandon'd Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society, and retir'd into a Deſart, that he might diligently follow the Study of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and the <hi>Knowledge of Himſelf;</hi> where <hi>Hippocrates</hi> thinking to go and Cure him of the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>What can be leſs reaſonable than this ſaying of <hi>Cyneas</hi> to <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> which Hiſtory relates as a very wiſe Speech, <hi>Reſt without going ſo far:</hi> Does he imagine 'tis ſo eaſy a Thing for a Man to reſt himſelf; <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> might more eaſily Conquer the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due <hi>Italy, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> than over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the natural Repugnance of his <hi>Heart</hi> to Quiet and Repoſe, which this importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Fellow advis'd him to, thinking it might hinder him from going out of the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>himſelf.</hi>

                     <hi>Mind;</hi> and on the other, becauſe they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliz'd and diſtinguiſh'd 'em: For, by the way, 'tis an Errour to imagine, that our Soul loves <hi>Truth</hi> purely for its own ſake. No <hi>Truths</hi> are more evident and certain, than thoſe which are obvious to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all Men; yet none ſeem more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.

                  <p>But if the <hi>Sages</hi> themſelves are cully'd and impos'd upon, by the Effort of their Paſſions, it cannot be imagin'd that thoſe, at the lower End of the World, are exempted from this Voluntary Darkneſs of the <hi>Heart.</hi> Every <hi>Paſſion</hi> has a particular Impoſture: The <hi>Paſſions</hi> heretofore form'd a Religion exactly ſuited to their own Humour; namely, the <hi>Pagan.</hi> Indeed they could not prevail quite ſo much in the Sun-ſhine of <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> Yet they endeavour it the utmoſt they can; and though they have not been compleatly Succeſsful, they have very near the matter ſhot the Mark they aim'd at: So prodigiouſly do they diſguiſe the Religion, which our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> brought into the World, and which declares open War againſt the whole Circle of the <hi>Paſſions.</hi> 'Tis certain that every Vice has its Morality: There's a Morality of <hi>Intereſt, Pride, Pleaſure, Revenge,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Sometimes 'tis forc'd to make a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of two Objects, One whereof is the Object of a lawful and reaſonable Deſire, the Other of a Temptation and Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: It muſt needs ſide with one or t'other. <hi>Reaſon</hi> is call'd to judge and paſs Sentence; but with how great Partiality does it exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this Office? Where the Object of Duty has Ten Degrees of Evidence, the <hi>Soul</hi> will perceive ſcarce Two; it diſcerns not the reſt, becauſe a clear Manifeſtation often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a particular Search, which it dreads, and never makes but with regret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs. On the contrary, the Object of the Temptation appears in its full Luſtre, this it turns every way, takes a diſtinct View of all its Faces and Appearances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47885:63"/>
ſuch a Conſideration as this, fixes its Application with Delight and Pleaſure; the <hi>Soul</hi> is Inventive in diſcovering ſuch Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as favour and countenance its Deſire, becauſe each of theſe Reaſons excites in it a ſenſible Agreement and Delight; but on the contrary, 'tis very ſlow and dull in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending thoſe which oppoſe its Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho' never ſo obvious and plain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis troubled and mortify'd at finding that, which it does not ſeek, and can never have a very good Opinion of that, which it does not receive, but with Regret and Uneaſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Heart</hi> breaking off, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the Reflections of the <hi>Mind</hi> as often as it pleaſes, and carrying away its Thoughts to the Intereſt of its Paſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting meerly its own Pleaſure, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in its Compariſon of Things, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily omitting what oppoſes its Deſires, having but languid and frozen Perceptions of Duty; conceiving on the contrary with all poſſible Attention, Delight and Ardour, whatſoever favours its Inclination: no wonder, if it make ſport, and put tricks upon the Light of the <hi>Mind;</hi> and if we judge of Things, not according to Truth, but the Biaſs of our own Propenſities.</p>

                  <p>'Tis eaſy to conceive, that in this State, the <hi>Corruption</hi> of Man, can't be Cur'd by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Remedies: For in this continual Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Illuſions and Deviations, which make the <hi>Mind</hi> deceive and impoſe upon the <hi>Heart,</hi> whence can there be any Light and Rectitude?

                     </gap>ng that Faculty which is productive of all the reſt. We have already ſaid, That the firſt Root of this Diſorder is grounded in this, That our <hi>Imagination</hi> acts in a more vigorous and lively manner than our <hi>Reaſon;</hi> that is, Corporeal Ideas make a vivid and ſtrong Impreſſion upon our Soul, whilſt Spiritual Ideas ſeem weak and languid. 'Tis eaſy to conceive, that in order to re-eſtabliſh our Soul, in its due State of Rectitude and Uprightneſs, 'tis requiſite that <hi>God</hi> ſhould ſo bring it about, by his <hi>Grace,</hi> that the Spiritual Ideas of Duty, Vertue, Eternity, &amp;c. may make a ſtronger and more lively Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion than they us'd to do; and that on the contrary, the Images of the World, of Pleaſure, Delight, and in General of ſenſible Goods, may ſeem but dull, and almoſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible.</p>
                  <p>God does the firſt, by fixing in the <hi>Mind</hi> Spiritual Ideas, afterwards by rendering 'em pleaſant and agreeable; and Laſtly, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and enlarging 'em <hi>Grace</hi> fixes in our Mind good Ideas, juſt as <hi>Melancholly</hi> fixes ſad and diſmal Notions in the Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let a melancholy Perſon uſe his utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,

to chaſe from his Mind horrid and afflictive Ideas, they'll ſtill return, and haunt him wherever he goes. So thoſe ſalutary and good Ideas we ſpeak of, being fix'd by <hi>Grace,</hi> in vain will our <hi>Corruption</hi> ſtrive to remove 'em, they ſtill return, preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again, repreſs and bridle <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> ſtop its Exorbitances; nay, and ſometimes prevent, even the Reflections of our Mind: For we ſee, an Honeſt Man exerts good Actions, as it were by Inſtinct, and without Premeditation. Becauſe, tho' not perceiving it, he follows the Ideas which <hi>Grace</hi> has fix'd in his Underſtanding. God enlarges Spiritual Ideas, by fixing 'em in our Mind, thro' His <hi>Grace;</hi> that is, He makes us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Spiritual Objects in their juſt Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and natural Form Whence 'tis to be obſerv'd, that the Ideas of Piety, having a kind of Oppoſition to the Ideas of the World, the one cannot be enlarg'd, without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers be contracted and limited.

he cannot long enjoy and partake of thoſe things, which bear ſo little Proportion to the Extent of his Duration; blameleſs and untainted, he caſts his Eyes on Earthly things, becauſe he conſider's 'em all with Indifferency.</p>
                  <p>He is not pre-poſſeſt with <hi>Pride:</hi> A Man is not very careful to raiſe himſelf a great Name in a Place, where he is to ſojourn but for a very ſhort time: Nor with <hi>Intereſt;</hi> his Reaſon does not ſhew it ſelf partial for his Lucre and Profit, ſeeing he is in View of an other <hi>Intereſt,</hi> to free him from all other Prejudices.</p>
                  <p>And certainly right Reaſon and Prudence may be ſaid to be proper to him alone; tho' a Man be Cunning and Ingenious to heap up Riches, to Conquer or Govern <hi>Provinces,</hi> yet if his Knowledge reach no farther, he is ſtill no better than a Fool: Indeed he has fram'd the Edifice with a great deal of Reaſon and Dexterity, but he laid its Foundation upon the Sand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Worldly Men</hi> are Wiſe enough in the Choice of thoſe Means, which they employ to bring about the Ends of their Deſigns; but are irrational and ſenſeleſs in chooſing the End which they propoſe.

But yet as they tend to our Advantage, by the Deſign and Intention of <hi>Nature,</hi> thro' an Effect of our <hi>Corruption,</hi> they are perverted to be inſtruments of our Damage and Prejudice; which happens, when falſe Goods excite in our <hi>Heart</hi> reall Affections: When we are but coldly bent, towards that which deſerves the whole Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and Study of our Souls; and on the contrary, we deſire with all the Ardour imaginable, ſuch Goods as deſerve but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and indifferent Affection: For then we reverſe the Order of <hi>Nature,</hi> change the End into the Means, and the Means into the End; are raſh and precipitate in our Actions, err in our Conduct, and a meer ſhadow of Good makes us loſe the original Source of it; and running after Appearances we miſs the Truth.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now as we ſearch for the Source of our Irregularities, we muſt not inſiſt upon any particular One, unleſs it has an Influence upon all the others. 'Tis evident, that the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47885:69"/>
Root of our <hi>Natural Evil,</hi> conſiſts not in a peculiar Diſpoſition of the Temperament, ſeeing that thoſe who are of quite contrary Temperaments, are corrupted for all that: Nor is Intereſt the Principle of our <hi>Evil,</hi> ſince that has commonly ſomething in it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with Pride; neither is Pride, ſeeing that is in ſome ſort repugnant to Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Yet 'tis certain, that there is ſomething, wherein the Vices are oppoſite, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, wherein they agree: They are, in ſome reſpect oppoſite, ſeeing that one ſerves as a kind of Remedy for the other; and they agree in ſome reſpect, ſince the Soul, after it has fall'n into one, has a further Inclination after another, which ſeem'd of a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Nature.</p>
                  <p>This Truth will appear more plainly, if we, as it were, Anatomize and Diſſect the <hi>Heart,</hi> by entering upon the Conſideration of all its particular <hi>Paſſions.</hi> Robbery ſprings from Injuſtice, Injuſtice from Intereſt, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt from an Exceſs of Self-love: Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy is nothing but a ſtrict Adherence, which Self-love make us have to our own Fancies and Opinions. Pride is a meer Drunkenneſs, and Intoxication of Self-love, which repreſents us to our own Imagination greater and perfecter than really we are: Revenge is but a deſire to defend our ſelves againſt thoſe that hate us, or to reap a kind
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47885:69"/>
of Self-ſatisfaction by puniſhing thoſe who have offended us. In a word, Take a through Survey, and Conſideration of all the <hi>Vices,</hi> and <hi>Paſſions</hi> of Man, and you'll find they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in <hi>Self-love:</hi> 'Tis this, that gives 'em Birth; foraſmuch as all the Motives of Vice have this Foundation, That we ſeek for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing which flatters and relates to this <hi>Me,</hi> which is the firſt Object of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Affections: Upon this depends, either their Life or Death; for when two <hi>Paſſions</hi> violently Combat, <hi>Fear,</hi> for inſtance, and <hi>Revenge,</hi> the Soul retires into its own Tent; and makes uſe of no other Counſel, but that of <hi>Self-love,</hi> to know which ſide it ought to take; and according as <hi>Self-love</hi> judges, or not judges, Revenge to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, it pronounces in Favour either of Reſentment, or Moderation: So that as <hi>Self-love</hi> firſt produc'd theſe two Paſſions, ſo likewiſe it foments and cauſes the One to live, and continue to the Prejudice of the Other. Now what elſe can we ſay of that <hi>Paſſion,</hi> to which all our irregular Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tend, in which all the Vices terminate, by whoſe means they both Live and Die, which ſtops and ſuſpends their Career, but that this general Diſorder, is undoubtedly the original Fountain of all the others; and what we call'd the primitive Root of our <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Corruption?</hi>

Humility debaſes and pulls it down; Temperance mortifies it; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, as it were, robs it; Moderation diſcontents it; Fortitude expoſes it; Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, Piety and Zeal ſacrifice it.</p>
                  <p>And indeed <hi>Self-love</hi> is ſo eſſential an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient, of the Definitions of the <hi>Vices</hi> and <hi>Vertues,</hi> that without it we can't have a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now here there is a ſeeming Contradiction in our Syſtem, For on One hand <hi>Self-love</hi> appears to be the Principle of our Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and Diſorders; on the Other, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the <hi>Love of Our-ſelves,</hi> is a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification for the Diſcharge of our Duties. <hi>Corruption</hi> draws its whole Force from <hi>Self-love;</hi> and GOD on the other ſide derives from it all the Motives, He makes uſe of, to incline us to the Study of our Sanctification: For to what purpoſe, would he have made Promiſes and Threatnings, were it not with a Deſign to intereſt <hi>Self-love.</hi>

                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:47885:70"/>This Difficulty preſently vaniſhes, after we ſuppoſe the ſame thing, touching <hi>Self-love,</hi> which we have already ſaid of the <hi>Affections</hi> of the <hi>Heart</hi> in general: Namely, That they have ſomething of innocent and lawful which belongs to <hi>Nature,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of vicious and irregular, which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to their <hi>Corruption.</hi> 'Tis an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, that it can diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>L'amour propre,</hi> and <hi>L'a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour de nons mêmes;</hi> the former ſignifies <hi>Self-love</hi> as 'tis vicious and corrupted, the latter denotes this Love as 'tis lawful and natural.</p>
                  <p>Now our preſent Enquiry being after the Sources of Man's <hi>Corruption,</hi> our Deſign here engages us to examine, wherein the Diſorder of <hi>Self-love</hi> conſiſts.

                  <p>
                     <hi>SElf-love</hi> can ſin but only Two ways, either in Exceſs or Direction; its Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity muſt conſiſt either in this, That we love our ſelves too much, or that we take
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47885:71"/>
not a right Method in ſhewing this Love to our ſelves, or in both theſe Faults together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Self-love</hi> does not ſin in Exceſs, as appears from this, That we are permitted to love our ſelves, as much as we pleaſe, ſo it be with good and reall Love: Indeed to love One-ſelf, is to deſire One's Good, to fear One's Hurt, and to ſearch for One's Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now I confeſs, that many times our Deſire and Fear are too great, or we are too eagerly addicted to our Pleaſure, or that, which we look upon as our <hi>Happineſs:</hi> But you may obſerve, that the Exceſs proceeds from the Fault that refers to the Object of your <hi>Paſſions,</hi> and not from the too great Meaſure of the <hi>Love of our ſelves;</hi> which appears from hence, That you both can, and ought to have an unlimited Deſire of the <hi>Supream Good,</hi> and a boundleſs Fear of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Miſery: And 'twould be a Vice for us to deſire an infinite Good, but with a finite and limited Appetite.</p>
                  <p>Truly, were Man oblig'd to love himſelf, but to a certain Meaſure, the Vacuity of his <hi>Heart</hi> ought not to be infinite; and were not the Vacuity of the <hi>Heart</hi> infinite, it would follow, that he was not made for the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of <hi>God;</hi> but only for the Fruition of finite and limited Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: Yet we are taught the contrary, both by Experience and <hi>Religion.</hi> Nothing is more lawful and reaſonable, than this inſatiable
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47885:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Deſire; which even, after the Poſſeſſion of worldly Advantages, makes us ſtill reach after the <hi>Supream Good,</hi> which no Man ever found in the Objects of this Life. <hi>Brutus,</hi> who made a particular Profeſſion of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> believ'd he ſhould not be miſtaken, if he ſearch'd for it in <hi>Vertue;</hi> but as he loved <hi>Vertue</hi> for its own ſake, whereas indeed it has nothing amiable and laudable but in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to GOD; guilty of a Genteel and Spiritual Idolatry, was no leſs miſtaken then thoſe who ſought for Happineſs in Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things; and at his Death was oblig'd to acknowledge his Errour, when he Cry'd out: <hi>O Vertue! I own that thou art nothing but a miſerable Phantom.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore this inſatiable Deſire, of Man's <hi>Heart,</hi> is not Evil in it ſelf: 'Twas ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Men ſhould be endu'd with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, to qualify and diſpoſe 'em for ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after GOD.</p>
                  <p>Now what in a Figurative and Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Idea we term an <hi>Heart,</hi> that has an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Capacity, a Vacuity which cannot be fill'd by the Creatures, ſignifies in the proper and literal Notion a Soul, that naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires an <hi>Infinite Good,</hi> that deſires it without Limits, and cannot be ſatisfy'd till it has obtain'd it. If then it be neceſſary, that the Vacuity of our <hi>Heart,</hi> ſhould not be fill'd with created Goods, 'tis neceſſary that our Deſires ſhould alſo be infinite; which is as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47885:72"/>
much as to ſay, that we ought to love our ſelves without Meaſure; For to love <hi>One-ſelf,</hi> is to love One's <hi>Happineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as we may be truly ſaid, not properly to love the Creature, when we love it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, becauſe then we place the Creature upon the Throne of the Creatour, which is an Idolatry of the Mind, and moſt dangerous of all; ſo alſo may we be ſaid, not to love God as our <hi>Supream Good,</hi> when we love him but finitely, and conceive but moderate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after him; for then we debaſe God to the Condition of the Creatures, thro' an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of the <hi>Heart,</hi> no leſs Criminal than <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether we look upon God as our <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Good,</hi> or repreſent him as a <hi>Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Perfect,</hi> tis certain that our Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Adherence to him ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited; and to this End the Creatour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lac'd a kind of Infinity in Man's Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Affections, to capacitate him, in ſome meaſure, for the Enjoyment of this <hi>Infinite Good</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know very well, that our Nature being finite, is not capable, exactly ſpeaking, of forming Deſires intenſively infinite: But tho' theſe Deſires be not infinite in this Senſe, yet they are ſo in another; for 'tis certain, that our Soul deſires according to the whole Extent of its Powers; that if the Number of Spirits, neceſſary to the Organ,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47885:72"/>
could be multiply'd in <hi>Infinitum,</hi> the Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence of its Deſires would encreaſe propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably; and that tho' the Act it ſelf have not an Infinity, yet the Diſpoſition of the <hi>Heart</hi> has, which is naturally inſatiable.</p>
                  <p>I own, if we lov'd our ſelves by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> we might conceive, that <hi>Self-love</hi> would be in a limited Meaſure in the <hi>Heart:</hi> for we don't find in our Mind an Infinity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for loving our ſelves: But the Author of <hi>Nature,</hi> whoſe Wiſdom judg'd it not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that Men ſhould be <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> in order to take care of their Preſervation, thought fit that we ſhould love our ſelves by <hi>Senſe;</hi> which is ſo true, that 'tis not even conceivable how we can feel Delight and Joy, without loving this <hi>Self,</hi> which is the ſubject of it; ſo that as there is an unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Variety, and an Infinity of Degrees, in the Joy we are capable of taſting, ſo in like manner, there is not any meaſure or bounds in the Deſire of that <hi>Happineſs,</hi> in the which this Joy eſſential<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ters; nor conſequently, in the <hi>Love of our ſelves,</hi> which is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of this Deſire.</p>
                  <p>I alſo grant, That had <hi>Man</hi> been made to be a Rival of the <hi>Deity,</hi> he would not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to love himſelf without Meaſure; becauſe then <hi>Self-love</hi> would ſtand in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition, and interfere with the Love of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Man naturally loves himſelf, with ſo great Vehemency, meerly that he may be
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47885:73"/>
capable of loving God. The unmeaſurable Meaſure of <hi>Self-love,</hi> and theſe kind of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Deſires, are the only Links that tye, and unite him to God; ſince, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid, finite and moderate Deſires are capable of binding Man's <hi>Heart</hi> to none but the <hi>Creatures,</hi> and we don't properly love God, but only a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> which we form to our ſelves inſtead of God, when our Love of him exceeds not a Mediocrity.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, 'tis a great Errour to oppoſe <hi>Self-love</hi> to Divine, when 'tis well regulated: For pray, what elſe is it, duly to love our ſelves, but to love God; and to love God, but duly to love our ſelves? The Love of God, is the right ſenſe of the Love of our ſelves, and that gives it Life and Perfection. When <hi>Self love</hi> is diverted, and carried to other Objects, it no longer deſerves the Name of Love, 'tis of more dangerous Conſequence than the moſt cruel and ſavage Hatred; but when 'tis converted towards God, it falls in, and mingles with <hi>Divine Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And certainly, Nothing is ſo eaſy as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, beyond all Diſpute, what our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries have taught us in this Matter. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, for inſtance, Whether the <hi>Bleſſed</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, who undoubtedly love themſelves neither too much nor too little, ſeeing that they are in a State of Perfection, can love God with an infinite Affection; and yet not perceive the Joy, ariſing from the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47885:73"/>
of him? I would know in the next place, Whether we can feel Joy and Delight without loving <hi>One-ſelf,</hi> proportionably to this Perception?</p>
                  <p>Why then ſhould we trouble our ſelves with ſuch vain and contradictory Queries, As whether the <hi>Saints</hi> love God, better than themſelves? I had as live they'd ask me, Whether they love Themſelves, better than Themſelves: For theſe two Expreſſions have in reallity the ſame ſignification; and not to love God is, in ſome meaſure, to hate <hi>One-ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To let you ſee, that this is but meer Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Quibling in words, we muſt divide the <hi>Love</hi> of God into two Sorts, a Love of Intereſt, and a Love of pure Friendſhip, as <hi>Divines</hi> call it. I underſtand this latter to have no Intercourſe at all with <hi>Self-love,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Notion of it; but I would know, which of theſe two Kinds of Love you mean, when you ask me, Whether the Love, we ought to have of God, be not greater than that of our ſelves: If you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, by the Love of God, <hi>Love of pure Friendſhip,</hi> whoſe only Object is <hi>Known-Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> I anſwer, that this Love cannot be compar'd with the Love of our ſelves, which is of quite another Nature; ſince, as I have already ſaid, we love not our ſelves by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> but <hi>Senſe;</hi> and Corporeal, or Spiritual Pleaſure, naturally engages us to love our
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47885:74"/>
ſelves, even before we are capable of making Reflection. But if by the Love, we ought to have for God, you mean <hi>Love of Intereſt,</hi> which is ty'd to him as our <hi>Supream Good,</hi> you don't apprehend, that you oppoſe the ſame thing to it ſelf; ſeeing that to love <hi>One-ſelf,</hi> and the <hi>Soveraign Good,</hi> is all one; and does not make two diſtinct ſpecies of Love, but are one and the ſame, conſider'd under different Reſpects, namely, in reference to its Principles and its Objects.</p>
                  <p>It therefore appears, That the Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity conſiſts not in this, that we love our ſelves too much, ſeeing we are allow'd to love our ſelves, as much as we pleaſe, with Relation to the <hi>Supream Good:</hi> But herein lies the <hi>Evil,</hi> that we take a wrong Method, in exerting this Love; that is, we love our ſelves with relation to falſe Objects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Self love,</hi> ſimply taken, is innocent and harmleſs: It becomes corrupted, when 'tis diverted towards the <hi>Creatures;</hi> and Holy, when converted and ſteer'd towards God. Purſuant to the fore-going Doctrine, we may diſtinguiſh Three Hearts in Man; the Heart of the <hi>Man,</hi> the Heart of the <hi>Sinner,</hi> and the Heart of the <hi>Faithful:</hi> The Heart of the <hi>Man</hi> is the Soul, as it naturally loves it ſelf; the Heart of the <hi>Sinner</hi> is the Soul, as it loves the World; and the Heart of the <hi>Faithful</hi> is the Soul, as it loves God. The <hi>Natural Heart</hi> is eſſentially included in the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:47885:74"/>
other Two, and the natural Love of our ſelves, which is the Principle of all our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, the Mobile that actuates either <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Corruption,</hi> and receives either the Love of God, or the World. The Heart of <hi>Man</hi> loves. The Heart of the <hi>Worldling</hi> loves Vanity. The Heart of the <hi>Faithful</hi> loves the infinite, and eternal <hi>Good.</hi> The firſt is the Heart of <hi>Man,</hi> the ſecond the Heart of the <hi>mortal Man;</hi> the third is the Heart of the <hi>immortal Man.</hi>

                  <p>I Said before, that <hi>Self-love</hi> is the Principle of all our natural <hi>Affections:</hi> For all our Deſires, Fears and Hopes, are the devoted Servants, and Off-ſpring of Self-love.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, the Affection we have for other Men, ſometimes cauſes us to Deſire, Fear and Hope: But what is the Principle of this Affection, but the <hi>Love of our ſelves?</hi> Do but throughly conſider, and weigh all the Sources of our Friendſhip, and you'll find they are reduc'd to Intereſt, Gratitude, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Sympathy, and a delicate Agreement of that Vertue with <hi>Self-love,</hi> which makes us think, that we love it for its own
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47885:75"/>
ſake; whereas indeed, we love it meerly for the ſake of our ſelves, and it wholly termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in <hi>Self-love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis from hence, that <hi>Relation</hi> borrows all its Rapture, and Strength, for kindling our Affections. We love our Children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are our Children. Were they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man's Children, they would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to us: Therefore we don't pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly love them, but the Relation which links us to 'em. 'Tis true, Children don't love their Parents, with the ſame Degree of Affection, as Parents do their Children; tho' theſe two Affections ſeem to be founded upon the ſame reaſon of Relation, but this Difference proceeds from another Cauſe, <hi>Children</hi> ſee themſelves Die in the Perſon of their <hi>Parents;</hi> and <hi>Parents,</hi> on the contrary, ſee themſelves Revive in the Perſon of their <hi>Children:</hi> Now nature inſpires us with the Love of Life, and Hatred of Death. Alſo Parents behold in their Children, as it were, <hi>other ſelves;</hi> but other ſelves ſubject, and dependant upon 'em: They think it an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to have brought 'em into the World; they conſider 'em with Delight, becauſe they conſider 'em as their own Workmanſhip: They are exceedingly pleas'd, at having ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and inviolable Rights over 'em. This is their <hi>Magiſtracy, Royalty,</hi> and <hi>Empire:</hi> But the ſame Pride, which cauſes the <hi>Parents</hi> to love Superiority, makes the Children hate
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47885:75"/>
Dependance. Nothing lays ſo heavy a weight upon us, as a Benefit when 'tis too great; becauſe it depreſſes us to too great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: We look upon it as a delicate, but very ſtrong Chain, which links our Heart, and conſtrains our Liberty. This is the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of that common Maxim; <hi>Blood never riſes:</hi> But as there is a Relation of Blood, Profeſſion, Religion, Country, &amp;c. the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are infinitely diverſify'd, according to theſe various Reſpects: But woe be to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation if it be combated by Intereſt: For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt will infallibly get the better: That tends to us directly, Relation only by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection. Hence Intereſt is always more ſtrong and prevalent, than Relation; but in this, as in every thing elſe, particular Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces very much alter the general Propoſition.</p>
                  <p>What we commonly experience, That no Hatred is more violent, than that which happens between thoſe who were formerly very great Friends; is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to almoſt the ſame reaſon. 'Tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Perſons found either Profit or Pleaſure in loving one another. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted their <hi>Self-love:</hi> but when they come to change their Sentiment, the Motives of <hi>Love</hi> joyn themſelves with the Motives of <hi>Hatred;</hi> they revolt and riſe up in Arms, both by reaſon of the Idea of the Wrong that's done 'em, and of the Pleaſures of that Friendſhip which they renounce; and they
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47885:76"/>
ſuffer, not only by the Hatred, which is kindled, but alſo by the Affection, which is extinguiſh'd; which excellently confirms our <hi>Syſtem,</hi> and ſhews, that there's no Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection kindled in our <hi>Heart</hi> independently from <hi>Self-love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We ſhall be further convinc'd of the Truth of this Opinion, by conſidering, not only, that Relation is a Source of Friendſhip; but alſo, that our Affections vary and differ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Degree of Relation, that we have to thoſe Perſons, who are the Object of 'em. The Quality of <hi>Man,</hi> which we all bear, makes this general Benevolence, which we term Humanity, <hi>Homo ſum, humani nihilà me alienum puto.</hi> 'Tis certain, that if there were but only Two Men in the World, they would have a tender Affection for each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but this general Relation being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and confounded, with the infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe different Relations, we have one among another, it happens, that this natural Affection, which it firſt produc'd, is loſt in the rabble and throng of the <hi>Paſſions;</hi> which ſo great a Variety of other Objects produce in our Heart. We don't ſee in our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the Quality of <hi>Man,</hi> whereby he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles us, whilſt we ſee in him a Rival, an Emulator, and Enemy of our Welfare and Proſperity (as we are of his;) A proud Man, who eſteems nothing but himſelf; who by the Luſtre of his Qualities and Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47885:76"/>
attracts the Eſteem and Attention of the World, and puts us in Obſcurity and Diſ-repute; and who by his <hi>Paſſions</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually buiſy'd in circumventing us, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon our Properties: But no ſooner has Death uncloath'd his Perſon of theſe odious Relations, but we find in him that general Relation which made us love him; never thinking him a Man, till he ceas'd to be a Mortal, and then at laſt, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to enroll him in the Number of our Friends, when Death has retrench'd him from the Society of the Living.</p>
                  <p>The Relation of <hi>Country,</hi> uſually inſpires Men, with a kind of Benevolence, whereof they are inſenſible whilſt they dwell in their own Nation; becauſe this Relation is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and too much divided, by the Number of thoſe that have a Title to it; but becomes very ſenſible, when two or three Natives of the ſame <hi>Country,</hi> happen to meet in a ſtrange Climate: Then <hi>Self-love,</hi> ſtanding in need of ſome Supports and Conſolations, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em in the Perſon of thoſe, whom a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel Intereſt, and like Relation ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire with the ſame Diſpoſition, never fails to make a perpetual Attention to this Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; unleſs it be prevented by a more powerful Motive of its own Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Relation of <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> commonly produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more Averſion, than Friendſhip; by the jealouſy it cauſes Men to have one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47885:77"/>
But that of <hi>Conditions,</hi> is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with Benevolence and Love. 'Tis no wonder, that Grandees have no great Affection for ordinary People; the reaſon is, becauſe looking with the Eyes of <hi>Self-love,</hi> they ſee them at a great diſtance off; they look not upon 'em as Neighbours; they are very far from perceiving this <hi>Proximity</hi> and Nearneſs, whoſe Mind and Heart are wholly concern'd about the Diſtance, that ſeparates and removes 'em from other Men; and who make of this Object the Delights of their Vanity.</p>
                  <p>Yet muſt it be granted, That Relation of <hi>Blood,</hi> is uſually more prevailing than any other: tho' it be a common Saying, <hi>That a Good Friend is better than many Parents;</hi> and this be true in it ſelf, yet 'tis certain, that Men naturally prefer their Parents before their Friends, and eſpecially upon any great and important Occaſion: The Reaſon of it is, becauſe they conſider their Parents as neceſſary Friends, that can by no means be diſ-united from 'em; and their Friends as voluntary Parents, whoſe Affection reaches no farther than their Pleaſure. Now tho' free and unconfin'd Friendſhip be of greater Obligation than neceſſary, yet 'tis not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as ſuch by the Eyes of <hi>Self-love:</hi> It may indeed inſpire us with a greater degree of Gratitude, but can't ſo much touch our Intereſt.</p>

by the Complaiſance that Men uſe to 'em upon the account of their <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds it ſelf at the Thoughts of having done you a Benefaction: It conſiders with delight the Obligations you owe it, and by that means inclines the <hi>Heart</hi> to have a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for you: But 'tis dangerous to do very great Services, when our whole Deſign is to inſinuate into the Favour of thoſe whom we oblige. <hi>I tremble to think of this great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> ſaid a Courtier to a Noble Man, who told him he ſhould never forget the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he ow'd him; and he was in the right of it: Great Obligations do oftentimes prove great Offences, and at leaſt it always hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſo then, when either we cannot or will not acknowledge 'em.</p>

Ingratitude tho' it think of him with great Uneaſineſs, being oblig'd to confeſs whether we will or no, that we are under his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, and owe him more than we wiſh we did. Moreover 'tis very natural to a Man to let People ſee, by his Carriage towards a Benefactor, that he deſerves the Benefit. Laſtly, we are very glad to be deliver'd from the Remorſe which attends Ingratitude; which Remorſe is more biteing, and more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural than that which is conſequent upon the Violation of Juſtice; for tho' Injuſtice be repugnant to Reaſon, as well as Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, yet certainly 'tis more oppoſite to the Dictates of <hi>Self-love</hi> to be Ungrateful, than Unjuſt; and doubtleſs that Remorſe is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt which ariſes not only from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but alſo the <hi>Love of our ſelves,</hi> when its Laws have been tranſgreſſed.</p>

from the <hi>Love of our ſelves,</hi> which reſpects in him even the ſimple Power of doing you a Kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Self-love</hi> makes you have a Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Eſteem for a Perſon, whom you are aſſur'd you ſhall never be the better for, meerly by conſidering in him the bare Power of doing you a good Turn, is it at all to be wonder'd at, that this ſame Principle cauſes you to love One, who by his <hi>Vertue</hi> is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be Beneficent to you, tho' you very well know that he cannot actually exert this Inclination?</p>
                  <p>Say we then, that the <hi>Heart</hi> has its Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions as well as the <hi>Mind;</hi> and as this knows how to define Good in general, tho' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t can draw more to the Life in our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any particular Good: So the <hi>Heart</hi> loves theſe general Conformities and <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of Objects to it ſelf, tho' particular ones do infinitely more affect and touch it; and it cannot but think well of a Vertuous Man, by reaſon of theſe delicate Relations, <hi>Vertue</hi> has to <hi>Self-love.</hi> This is beyond all doubt, becauſe your Love of the Vertues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes proportionably to their Relation and <hi>Agreement</hi> to you. We have naturally a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opinion of Clemency, than Severity; of Liberality, than Oeconomy and Thrifty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; tho' they all equally partake of the Nature of Vertue; which can be for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, but becauſe our Affection is

'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the firſt of theſe Sentiments diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and makes way for the Second, the Second for the Third, and the Third for Fourth. We can't throughly conſider, what a great Unhappineſs and Miſery it is, to abandon and forſake God, without deſiring his Communion, by Motives taken from our <hi>Intereſt.</hi> We can't love God as the Principle of our Joy and Felicity, without a grateful <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> of Benefits receiv'd at his Hands. 'Tis natural, and even neceſſary, that he who loves God as the <hi>Supream Good,</hi> and as his great and eternal Benefactour, ſhould attend with Complacency and Delight
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47885:85"/>
to the Conſideration of his adorable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; that this Meditation ſhould excite in him Joy and Satisfaction, and ſo bring him to love God in the View of his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and <hi>Vertues.</hi> Now all the previous Diſpoſitions to this laſt Affection, which is the Nobleſt of all, being taken from <hi>Self-love,</hi> it follows, that neither the pure <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> which is converſant about God, does <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

it can't be ſaid that they have for him, in that reprobate State, the Affection which we term pure <hi>Friendſhip</hi>; and conſequently there muſt be ſome other Motives of this Love, beſides <hi>Known Perfection;</hi> if Light be not ſufficient to kindle it, it muſt riſe from the Flame of ſome <hi>Affection</hi> of our Heart; ſince <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> are the whole Contents of our Soul. Perhaps you'll ſay, that in order to capacitate a Soul for conceiving this Love of pure <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> 'tis not requiſite that <hi>Self-love</hi> ſhould directly produce it, but only that it may not oppoſe and hinder it: But I ſay, if <hi>Pure Friendſhip</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from <hi>Known Perfection,</hi> and nothing elſe be required to produce it, the Oppoſition of <hi>Self-love</hi> is inſignificant; and as the Love of our ſelves can't derobe God of theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, nor hinder our Soul from knowing 'em, ſo neither can it obſtruct the Birth of this pure Affection.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt we conſider God as a Judge, as a terrible Executioner of Vengeance, and as ſtanding ready with a Thunderbolt in his Hand, we may indeed admire his infinite and adorable <hi>Excellencies,</hi> but can't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an <hi>Affection</hi> for Him. And 'tis very certain, that could we but any ways Evade even this Admiration of God, we ſhould be very cautious in applauding him with it, for in this State we regard him as our Enemy, &amp; render to him no more but what we needs
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47885:86"/>
muſt. And whence can this Neceſſity of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring God proceed, unleſs it ſpontaneouſly ariſe from <hi>Known Perfection?</hi> If then we conceive pure <hi>Friendſhip</hi> to have preciſely the ſame Source with Admiration, that is to ſay, if we conceive it to have no other Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine but <hi>Known Perfection,</hi> we may ſafely conclude that pure <hi>Friendſhip</hi> will ariſe in our Soul, beyond all Poſſibility of any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Twill be to no purpoſe to make a wild and indefinite Anſwer, that 'tis the Corruption of our <hi>Heart,</hi> which renders us uncapable of lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God purely for his own ſake, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick Perfections, whilſt we ſuppoſe him not to love us.

For our <hi>Corruption</hi> does not hinder the <hi>Admiration</hi> of our Soul, it being certain that the <hi>Devils,</hi> who far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed us in Wickedneſs, admire God, tho' they are at the ſame time conſcious of his being the Object of their Hatred and Averſion; ſo neither can this <hi>Corruption</hi> hinder pure <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> if that, as well as Admiration, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives its Birth from Known Perfection.</p>
                  <p>Nothing will better confirm this Truth, than by ſeeing what's the Uſe of <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Religion.</hi> So long as Men live in a State of Ignorance, which makes 'em imagine that God looks upon 'em with Indifferency and Diſregard, they in like manner ſeem to have
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47885:87"/>
but indifferent Sentiments of the <hi>Deity,</hi> ſuch were the <hi>Pagan Philoſophers.</hi> Whilſt Men think they are the Object of God's Hatred, they deteſt and abhor the <hi>Divinity.</hi> The <hi>Romans,</hi> who had already kindled the Fire of their Sacrifices, to give Thanks to the <hi>Gods,</hi> at the falſe Report of the Recovery of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> run into their Temples with Fury and Rage; when they hear the too true News of his Death, they drag their Images in the Dirt, throw 'em into <hi>Tiber,</hi> and ſignalize their Grief by a Specimen of Impiety. All Men ſeem to have the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Diſpoſition which the <hi>Romans</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſhew'd, and the Violence which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>No ſooner does the <hi>Goſpel</hi> reſound in the World for the Conſolation of Men; but, as the Teſtimoines of the Divine Love to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are every where manifeſted, ſo likewiſe Men's ardent Love of God becomes univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally Conſpicuous, <hi>Faith,</hi> which aſſures us of this immenſe Charity of God, is there look'd upon as the Key of our <hi>Heart,</hi> and the firſt Degree of our Sanctification; to this the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> attributes our Salvation. When <hi>Faith</hi> has throughly perſwaded us that we are the Objects of God's Love, we are ſufficiently diſpos'd to affect and love Him.</p>

                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:47885:87"/>But as our Affections eſſentially ſpring from <hi>Self-love,</hi> our Hatred and Averſions proceed from the ſame Original. We hate Men by Intereſt, when they are our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors in the Purſuit of Temporal Goods. We hate one that is Intemperate, becauſe he'd rob us of our Pleaſures; we can't en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure an Ambitious Man, becauſe he takes the upper-hand of us in Preferment and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; nor can we love a Proud Man, becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

We don't only hate thoſe who actually prejudice and injure us, but even thoſe that have an Inclination to hurt us, tho' they want fit Occaſions, or ſome Impediment hinder 'em from exerting their Malice. Our Hatred reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as far as a Man's Power of doing us an Injury: For which reaſon <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> are many times the Incentives of Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and Ill-will; and as there are few Perſons in the World but meet with ſome who either actually do 'em a Miſchief, or would at leaſt, if it laid in their Power, or were it for their <hi>Intereſt</hi>; it muſt be own'd, that ſecret Motives of <hi>Hatred</hi> do perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually enter in our Heart, and that nothing is more dangerous than the Temptations to which we are expos'd on this Account. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are oftentimes Enemies to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47885:88"/>
when we are ignorant of it. We many times both love and hate the ſame Perſon, becauſe <hi>Self-love</hi> conſiders him under diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Reſpects: And it happens that we real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hate thoſe, whom we think to be the Objects of our beſt Affection: and ſometimes thoſe, whom we have all the reaſon imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to love and eſteem; which appears from this, That in all their Diſgraces and Misfortunes, there's ſomething that does not wholly diſpleaſe us. This unjuſt and unnatural Sentiment which the Vail of <hi>Pride</hi> hides from our Eyes, proceeds from theſe two Principles: Namely, That we <hi>Our ſelves</hi> are not the Objects of this Diſgrace, (which is a Reflection that Self-love inſtantly makes) and that we ſee a <hi>Man</hi> degraded and pull'd down, who in regard of his being a Man, can't fail to rival us upon ſome Account or other; a Sentiment, which is chang'd into Compaſſion, when either Death, or ſome irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable Adverſity, finally exempts him from the Number of thoſe, who pretend and aim at the Goods, which are the Objects of our own Deſire.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Hatred</hi> is a turbulent Paſſion, which puts the whole Body into a violent Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all whoſe Effects are ſo ſenſible and obvious, that 'tis the moſt faithful Mirrour for diſcerning the Degree of Vehemence which attends all our other <hi>Affections.</hi> If you would know how much you love <hi>Vain-Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All Men in general are neceſſarily agreed in this Principle, and I wonder the <hi>Schools</hi> ſhould ſet 'em at Variance about it.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47885:90"/>
Fruition. The Ambitious Man's aim, in ſeeking after Dignities, is to be rais'd in the World above the Level of his Brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the Revengeful would never make any Retaliation, did he not hope to find Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in Vengeance.</p>
                  <p>This true Maxim is not oppoſite to the Religion, and Morality of Jeſus Chriſt; for he ſays, that he did not come to deſtroy, but to perfect Nature. He does not oblige us to renounce the Love of Pleaſure, but propoſes to us more pure, more noble, more ſpiritual, more certain, and more laſting <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> than thoſe which the World promiſes: And he defines <hi>Happineſs</hi> by its Sources; <hi>This is Life eternal, to know Thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt, whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> And he very well knows, that <hi>Happineſs</hi> eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially conſiſts in Joy, and unſpeakable Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: For 'tis a Feaſt, new Wine, a River of Delights, Torrents of Peace and Joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Expreſſions, under the <hi>Emblem</hi> of temporal Pleaſures, inform us of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pleaſures of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>

                  <p>Men's Idea of <hi>Happineſs,</hi> aſſuredly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a ſenſe of Pleaſure. The Vicious ſeeks after the Pleaſures of Intemperance, Vain-glory, Revenge, Ambition: On the other Hand, the Vertuous Man purſues the Pleaſures of Vertue; namely, of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Beneficence, Temperance, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Piety.</p>

But tho' this Definition of <hi>Happineſs</hi> appear ſo reaſonable, as it had been Dictated by the Oracle of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> her ſelf; yet but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Knowledge of Man's <hi>Heart,</hi> and

'Tis not in our Power to ſleep ſecurely, to have a healthy and vigorous Temper of Body, and yet Nature it ſelf teaches us, that <hi>Happineſs</hi> is in ſome meaſure in our Power: For why ſhould it have engraven, upon the <hi>Heart</hi> of Man, a Deſire to be Happy, if he were uncapable of arriving to that End? But Men miſtake in this Point, becauſe they don't underſtand a double Language, which Nature ſpeaks to 'em, in this reſpect. For on one Hand, by ſhewing 'em ſo many Goods, which they naturally deſire, and which are not in their Power, it plainly declares to 'em that Happineſs is not in their own Breaſt; and on the Other, by inſpiring into 'em ſo natural a Deſire of <hi>Happineſs,</hi> as that they can never deface, or put it off, in what State ſoever they be, it teaches 'em that they are notwithſtanding capable of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that End.</p>

                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:47885:93"/>But to return to our <hi>Poet,</hi> I add, that this Deſcription of <hi>Happineſs</hi> is not made up of Goods, ſufficiently noble and excellent; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly 'tis not much above the Condition of <hi>Beaſts,</hi> of which it may be truly ſaid, that their Goods come by Succeſſion; that their Riches are not got by Labour, that the Earth is fruitful to 'em, and that they fail not of Cloaths agreeable to their State, made by the Hand of Nature; that they want not Health, Strength and Reſt, that their Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity is prudent, and tho' they ſeem unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Reflection, yet we ſee 'em moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, and Diſcreet in the <hi>Sphere</hi> of thoſe Objects, which their <hi>Intereſt</hi> obliges 'em to know; namely, for the Propagation of their Species, and Self-preſervation, that their Life is pleaſant and ſedate, that they live without Trouble and Diſquietude, that their Cups are not mingled with the Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood of Suſpicions and Jealouſies, that they are not troubled with Law-ſuits; and, which is moſt of all conſiderable, that they neither fear nor hope for Death: So that <hi>Beaſts</hi> come very near to the Enjoyment of that <hi>Happineſs,</hi> which is repreſented to us, as the moſt perfect and compleat of all. Strange! What a Miſery then is it, that we are born capable of Reaſon, that the Quality of <hi>Rational,</hi> ſhould bar us from pretending to that of <hi>Happy;</hi> that the Degree of our Perfection, ſhould make the Degree of our
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47885:93"/>
Miſery; that Beaſts ſhould be happy, for not being Men; and Men ſhould be miſerable becauſe they are not Beaſts! Certainly this can never be true: Nature is too Wiſe in all other Things, for being ſo imprudent in this Particular; and unleſs Men are willing to degrade themſelves, and to diſparage the Excellency of their Nature, they muſt needs acknowledge a <hi>Soveraign Good,</hi> which may be found, and does not cheat our <hi>Deſires</hi>

                  <p>Moreover, the fineſt Strokes, in the <hi>Poets</hi> Deſcription of Humane <hi>Felicity,</hi> are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory: For if a Man be ſo far Happy, as to be ſatisfy'd with his Condition, and not to deſire a better, how can he chooſe but fear Death, which puts a fatal Period to this Beatitude? And, if what it Deprives us off be ſo trivial and inconſiderable, as that we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſire nor fear to Die, how is it poſſible we ſhould be contented with that Condition? This Fellow ſpoke at random: He thought there was nothing in theſe Verſes;

of Man; who, as we have ſeen before, neceſſarily loves himſelf beyond all Limits: His Love of <hi>Happineſs</hi> ſtays not at a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity, and conſequently he cannot be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd, but in the Poſſeſſion of an <hi>Infinite Good</hi>: He dreads Miſery above all Things; and for that Reaſon cannot but fear Death, till he is aſſur'd of his <hi>Immortality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Alſo this is one of the greateſt Defects of that Happineſs which Men ſearch after; or the Pleaſure, which they ſo ardently purſue, that the Foundations of it are <hi>uncertain;</hi> it depends upon a Thouſand Cauſes, which are not in your Power. What Reliance can you have upon the Health of a <hi>Body,</hi> which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing threatens with Ruine and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and what Tranquillity can you build upon this, if you behold the Image of its Death in every outward Object; in the Aliments, that nouriſh you, in the Air which you breath, in the Contagion of a ſick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom you viſit, in an Inſect, that ſtings it, and in a multitude of other ſecret Cauſes, which we can neither prevent, nor avoid? Who'll aſſure me of the Poſſeſſion of my Riches? Who'll ſecure me of the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of thoſe Friends, whom I love and delight in? Who'll protect me and mine from the Accidents that are ſo ordinarily incident to Society.</p>
                  <p>The Fourth Defect of this <hi>Humane Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity</hi> is, that 'tis not only corruptible, but
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47885:94"/>
alſo tranſient and fading: 'Tis of a much ſhorter Duration than the Term of our Life. Sleep, which locks up our Senſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſts a good part of it; nor does it laſt ſo long as this Moiety of Life, which we paſs in Reflection and Awake; for we are not continually buiſy'd with taſting <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> Nay, it ſubſiſts not ſo long as the Preſence of thoſe Objects which firſt give it Birth; it laſts but for the momentany Paſſage, from Privation to Enjoyment. We perceive ſome Delight indeed in the Purſuit, but this Joy expires with the Acquiſition: The greateſt of temporal Goods, after we have poſſeſs'd 'em, but for two Days, don't very much affect and pleaſe us. This Happineſs ſeems to conſiſt in the Satisfaction of <hi>Deſire,</hi> which makes us not Happy, either in Life or Death; but only at the inſtant of Extinction or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The moſt excellent Wiſdom of <hi>Nature</hi> thought fit to let us know, that worldly Goods are not wholly to be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeeing it has affix'd Delight and Joy to the Acquiſition of 'em: But withal it would teach us that our Souls ought not to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in this Enjoyment; ſince we no ſooner commence the Perception of this <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> but it preſently vaniſhes, and cheats our <hi>Deſire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fifth Defect of <hi>Humane Felicity</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, That our Happineſs has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a mixture and allay of Miſery. Every
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47885:95"/>
Good brings ſome Evil at its Heels:

                  <p>The laſt is, that this <hi>Happineſs</hi> does not fill the Capacity of our Soul, nor anſwer the ardent Eagerneſs of the purſuit, ſo that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an extream Diſproportion betwixt the Good we have obtain'd, and the Ardour wherewith we purſu'd it, we find our ſelves tantaliz'd and ſtarv'd, as it were, in the midſt of Plenty.</p>
                  <p>Tho' <hi>Self-love</hi> delights not in thinking of all thoſe Things, which may ſhew it the Vanity of its Applications, yet certainly it has a Glimpſe of all theſe Defects, in the <hi>Happineſs</hi> it reaches at. 'Tis conſcious, that ſenſual Pleaſure is the <hi>Happineſs</hi> rather of Brutes, than of Men: It owns, that a ſolid and ſubſtantial <hi>Happineſs,</hi> muſt neceſſarily be durable: It denies not, that a certain Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity is preferable to that, whoſe Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are uncertain. It perceives, that in order to make a Man happy, this tranſitory <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> which laſts no longer than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of Acquiſition, ought to be fix'd and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47885:95"/>
ſtay'd in its Career. It grants, that true <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,</hi> ſhould be commenſurate to the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of our Soul.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore right Reaſon commands us to ſearch for other Sources of Happineſs: But the preſent Delight which intereſts it, and ſeduces the Underſtanding, by tying it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the inqueſt of Pleaſure, than Truth, takes it off from executing that Deſign; its own Illuſions ſtill ſerve it after the old Rate; If they fail of Objects, they take the Place of Qualities, and ſet up themſelves for Powers or Habits. When Man can't obtain ſuch a temporal Happineſs as ſatisfies his Reaſon, he makes his Reaſon knock under, and condeſcend to ſatisfy his Pleaſure. The prejudic'd Mind gives an extravagant, and undue Character to theſe falſe Goods; and here 'tis moſt of all admirable, to ſee what a prodigious Aſcendant the <hi>Heart</hi> has over the <hi>Mind.</hi> For to diſguiſe abſtract and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Truths is no great Matter, but to diſguiſe ſenſible and experimental Truths, is a Thing that gives us a ſpecial Evidence of the Force of our <hi>Corruption:</hi> To ſee this we proceed in the next place, by unfolding the moſt hidden Myſteries of <hi>Self-love.</hi>

                     <hi>SElf-love</hi> perceiving, that worldly Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is too groſs and impure to ſatisfy our Mind; and that indeed, 'tis not fit an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, enjoy'd by none but the Body, ſhould ſatisfy the Thirſt of the Soul; ſeeks how it may ſpiritualize and refine Corporeal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, in order to cheat and impoſe upon us, by making us think, that they are equally ſatisfactory to the Soul and Body: Hence Self-love has been pleas'd to tye, unto this groſs and carnal <hi>Felicity,</hi> the Delicacy of Sentiments; the eſteem of the Mind, and ſometimes even the Duties of Religion, by conceiving it as Spiritual, Glorious and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred.</p>
                  <p>For as to the firſt of theſe, who would not be amaz'd to ſee the prodigious number of Thoughts, Opinions, Fictions, Writings, Hiſtories, which ſenſual Pleaſure has caus'd to be invented. Muſter up together all the Tracts, that have ever been written about Morality, which is the <hi>Science of Living well;</hi> and compare 'em with thoſe, that have
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47885:96"/>
been made about the Pleaſures of Intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and you'll find a great Diſproportion between their Number. Conſidering theſe Actions in their natural Hue, there appears in 'em a ſordid Baſeneſs, which diſ-heartens our <hi>Pride;</hi> namely, the vile and abject Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity they have to other <hi>Animals.</hi> Now what Courſe can be taken to elevate, and render 'em worthy and becoming the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of <hi>Men?</hi> Why, the ready way is to ſpiritualize and refine 'em, to preſent 'em for an Object of the Delicateneſs of the Mind; make 'em a Subject of fine and delightful Senſations; to make ſome ſport of 'em to the Imagination, and turn 'em agreeably to the Humour, by the flouriſhes of Eloquence and Poetry: And laſtly, to imploy all the Faculties, and Lights of the Rational Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, to make the Delights of a Voluptuous Body go down glib and pleaſantly into an haughty Soul. I expreſs my ſelf according to the Vulgar Prejudice, for truly ſpeaking, the Body has not in it ſelf any Perception or Senſation. Hence Self-love has alſo ty'd an Eſteem and Reſpect to the moſt ſhameful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſements of Humane Nature. Pride and Pleaſure are two Paſſions, which tho' they ſpring from the ſame Original of <hi>Self-lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> yet for all that, there is ſome Difference and Oppoſition betwixt 'em. Pleaſure humbles, whereas Pride exalts us: The former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graves us with the Image of Brutes, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47885:97"/>
with the Picture of the Devil. Alſo theſe two Paſſions have many a Combat and Duel in our Heart; but the Heart can by no means approve of this Conflict, being a Friend and Well-wiſher to 'em both, and all moſt equally ſenſible of the charms of Glory and Pleaſure: It muſt beſtir its Stumps to make a Reconcilation, and to bring this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, it takes one of theſe Methods, either it tranſports Pleaſure, if I may ſo ſpeak, to the Confines of Pride, or Pride to the Region of Pleaſure. If it renounce ſenſual Pleaſure 'twill ſearch for a greater in the acqueſt of Eſteem; and ſo Pleaſure is wholly indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd: Or, if we take a Reſolution to ſatisfy its Thirſt of ſenſual <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> 'twill apply to it the Credit of <hi>Eſteem;</hi> and by this means <hi>Pride</hi> is ſolac'd at its loſs.</p>
                  <p>Were there but one only Man of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Mind, he would not eaſily ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in his Deſign; but Men unhappily meeting together, they underſtand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and having the ſame Inclination, they willingly agree to conſecrate it.</p>
                  <p>This is a <hi>Ragoo</hi> to <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it much more exquiſite than the Glory which Men's exorbitant Fancies have ty'd to it: But 'tis yet better ſeaſon'd, when we regard this <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> as an Ordinance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. A debauch'd Woman, that would make People believe in the <hi>Heathen</hi> World, that ſhe had a God for her Sweet-heart, had
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47885:97"/>
a more ſenſible Reliſh of intemperate Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and a Zealot, that takes his Pleaſure, or executes Revenge, under the ſhelter of ſome ſacred Pretext, taſts in Pleaſure a more piquant and delicious ſeaſon than is Pleaſure it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Humane <hi>Felicity,</hi> of which we are ſpeaking, may be divided into two Parts, Groſs and Senſible, which is as it were the <hi>Matter</hi> of it; and a more refin'd and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, which we'll term its <hi>Form.</hi> 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that as all the Perceptions of Joy and Pleaſure, which this World affords us, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize and enlarge the Matter of this <hi>Happineſs;</hi> ſo all the Illuſions and Tricks, which <hi>Self-love</hi> puts upon us on this account, to make it appear either reaſonable, glorious or ſacred; all the falſe Diſcourſes of Men, who are continually ſpeaking of the Objects of their Deſire; all the unhappy Idea's of Education, which adminiſter infinite Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of deceiving us in this reſpect, all the naughty Lectures, and impious Studies, a thouſand Prejudices, and falſe Maxims, ſerve to augment and encreaſe the Form of it, and to tranſplant this vain Felicity, into the ſupream Seat and Eſcurial of our Soul, which ſprang up before in the meaneſt part of its Royalty, by the occaſion of Senſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Meaſures, which <hi>Self-love</hi> takes againſt the firſt Defect, which it ſaw its pretended Happineſs; but 'tis not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:47885:98"/>
only in this: 'Tis likewiſe ſo much adulterated and mix'd, that it renders us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miſerable, than Happy; and in this, <hi>Self-love</hi> is pleas'd to put another Trick and Cheat upon it ſelf. For fearing leſt our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Attention, to the Defects and Emptineſs of worldly Goods, to their appendant Miſery and Incommodities, might diſabuſe us in this Matter, it diverts our Conſideration from whatſoever is moſt capable to repreſent that Miſery to our View, which attends the Goods and Enjoyments of this World: It finds a pretty hard Tug of it; for how ſhould it go beyond experimental and ſenſible Proofs? But yet for all this it fails not of good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, by reaſon of Men's extream Deſire to put a merry Trick and Cajole upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>To underſtand the whole ſubſtance of this Matter, you muſt know, that as the Preſent, how ſweet ſoever it appear to us, and tho' we have never ſo great an Inclination to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice all for the Sake of it, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſeems too narrow and limited to a Soul, which loves to aggrandize and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend its Bounds by Imagination; it moſt commonly intermingles the Paſt and Future in the Idea of our Condition; not the Paſt and Future as they are in Reality, but ſuch as our Soul would have 'em be. Our State therefore ſeems to us an Aſſemblage of Goods which both follow and precede us. By the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47885:98"/>
Remembrance of Pleaſures already enjoy'd, we bring back the paſt to preſent; and by the Ideas of Temporal Goods we hope to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, we anticipate the Future. If we would carry a direct and ſteddy View over all theſe Differences of <hi>Time,</hi> we ſhould find in the paſt, what we meet with in the preſent; namely, Goods mingled with the Bitterneſs and Gall of a great many Evils. For the Good we have poſſeſs'd was not more pure and unmingled, than what we now poſſeſs; and what we are like to poſſeſs hereafter, will not differ from what we before enjoy'd: But as the Soul loves to think of nothing elſe, but what delights and tickles its Fancy, it happens, that it retains the Ideas of theſe Goods which it formerly poſſeſs'd, becauſe theſe Conceptions are agreeable and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; and it forgets the Ideas of the Evils intermingled, becauſe ſuch Thoughts are attended with Melancholy and Sadneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the paſt Evil ſeeming Good to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are deliver'd from it; for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo draws in our Mind a delightful Image: As for the Future we know it only by Hope; now Hope hath not Evil, but Good for its proper Object: The paſt and future, one whereof is no more, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not yet come, Occupying a large Space in our Imagination, and always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting themſelves in the Livery of their Pleaſures, and never in the mourning Weeds

of their Miſery: No wonder, if by degrees, a bright Idea of <hi>Happineſs</hi> be form'd in our Mind; which can hardly be deſtroy'd by the Senſe of our Miſery. Our paſt Delights do ſtill remain; the Applauſes, which recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd our Merit, ſeem really preſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Pride has drawn 'em to the Life, in the Tablet of our Imagination: And what if we could add future Advantages to preſent, and obtain their Fortune, who are Objects of our Envy? Thus by a ſecond Diſorder of our Imagination, which hath the ſame Source with the firſt, we frame to our ſelves an Idea of thoſe Goods, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in another Man's Power, are become the Objects of our own Deſire; an agreeable and flattering Repreſentation, becauſe we ſee not the Troubles which attend 'em, but only caſt a Glance upon their ſpecious and glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Out-ſide. So that the Idea of our own Condition, and other Men's, the pleaſant Images of the Paſt, and a thouſand Hopes, whoſe Object are the Uncertainties of the Future, continually occurring to our Mind, whereas the Evils of the future are perceiv'd but now and then; no wonder if the Soul get Drunk with this Folly, and a thouſand Experiences fail of reclaiming it from its Errours and Illuſions.</p>
                  <p>This Blindneſs is ſometimes ſo bold and daring, as to regard this Felicity as built upon ſure and ſtable Foundations. This
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47885:99"/>
Truth appears by the Speech of him, whom the Son of God repreſents feeding up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with certain Fancies of a Happineſs, which he was preſently to be depriv'd of: <hi>My Soul,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Eat, Drink and take thy Eaſe, we have Goods laid up for many Years:</hi> Preſently he hears a terrible Voice, ſaying to him, <hi>Thou Fool, this night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee, and then whoſe ſhall all thoſe Goods be which thou haſt laid up?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But laſtly, Man is not ſo Blind but that he can ſee the End of this <hi>Happineſs,</hi> which ſo enchants and bewitches him; he knows the <hi>World</hi> will not be a perpetual Fountain of his Pleaſure, becauſe it conſiſts of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Objects; and he is not ignorant, that himſelf ſhall not always be in a Capacity of enjoying worldly Delights, foraſmuch as he is not Immortal. For want of this perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of Sentiment and Fruition which he can't obtain, he endeavours to perpetuate his Memory; and ſo he ſaves what he can from the Ship-wrack of temporal Things; but yet all that he ſaves, does not countervail his Labour: For what is Man's Glory after he is Dead? <hi>It is,</hi> ſays an Ancient, <hi>a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Gale after a Ship-wrack;</hi> And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing is more Vain, than all thoſe Means, which <hi>Self-love</hi> has invented to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize our Glory. Urns, Tombs, Pyramids, Mauſoleum's, Theatres, Temples, Cities dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Memory of famous Perſonages;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47885:100"/>
Poetry and Eloquence, Painting and Engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving employ'd to preſerve ſome Ideas of their Vertue, or certain Lineaments of their Viſage, can't avoid the Fate of corruptible Things; and as they are unable to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themſelves, they can't be capable of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing their Objects: This would be but to perpetuate Shadows, and how ſhould they perpetuate the Senſation?

I think we ſhould not be guilty of a greater Extravagance, if by the Effort of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, we ſhould at length be brought to doubt of our Mortality, than whilſt by the Seduction of our Heart, we ſearch for ſo vain an Immortality. I know indeed, that no Man ſeriouſly denies himſelf to be ſubject to the <hi>Fate</hi> of Death; but yet ſcarcely any Man perhaps tells himſelf in earneſt, that he ſhall Die: For tho' theſe two Terms have too true a Relation, yet no one is willing to joyn 'em together; and if we do happen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider 'em, 'tis with a Deſign to diſ-unite and part 'em. We ſhall be apt to conſider Death, without conſidering our ſelves; or our ſelves without conſidering Death: We never love to connect thoſe Ideas both together; and certainly nothing can be imagin'd, let Men think what they pleaſe of it, more extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and more uneaſy to the Heart, than the Conjunction of theſe two Sentiments in our Imagination.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:47885:100"/>Yet this is not all; <hi>Self-love</hi> undertakes to fix the Pleaſure, which riſes from the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of temporal Goods: with this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign it ſeeks to have a frequent Enjoyment of the Good it poſſeſſes, whether by Thought, repreſenting it to its Mind as often, and in as lively a manner as is poſſible; or by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to invent new Methods of enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pleaſure, whereunto it is accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 'Twas a great Extravagance in <hi>Caligula,</hi> to propoſe the making his Horſe <hi>Conſul,</hi> to have him led before the <hi>Senate</hi> in Conſular Robes, and the <hi>Bundles of Rods</hi> carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: But this Extravagance, which ſo much grates and contradicts the Mind, was a Feaſt of Delights to ſuch an Heart, as being us'd to Supream Power, and ſcarcely perceiving it now, found out a Means of giving it ſelf an Air of Novelty, by the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of its Guſt, and the Fantaſticalneſs of its <hi>Capricio. Caligula,</hi> in his Folly, had the Pleaſure of ſeeing how much other Men were ſubject to his Dominion.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Self-love,</hi> which one would think ought to be diſ-abus'd of the exceſſive Opinion, it conceiv'd of temporal Goods, when it ſees what a great Vacuity they leave in our Heart, yet puts upon it ſelf a further Illuſion: For finding that this Meaſure of temporal Goods, which it has obtain'd, can't render it Happy, it pre-poſſeſſeth it ſelf with Thoughts of finding that Happineſs in the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47885:101"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the Quality of theſe Advantages. Thus a Rich Man, who ought to have diſ-abus'd himſelf as to the Vanity of Riches, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience he makes of 'em, feeds himſelf with a Fancy, that he ſhall be Happy when he has made a further Augmentation of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and as the Degrees of temporal Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity are not limited, no wonder if, in what State ſoever he be, he form a Succeſſion of new Deſires.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe our Soul ſees, that worldly Goods are leſs conſiderable by their Reality than Fictitiouſneſs, 'tis ſo Ingenious as to deceive it ſelf in this too; it covets the Eſteem of other Men, and would fain be thought happy by the Mind's of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that it may hereafter make uſe of this Eſteem, to cheat and warrant it ſelf of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, upon the Word of thoſe that, don't know us. Oh! 'Tis a brave and delightful Object, for a <hi>Grandee</hi> to behold the covetous and intereſted Rabble cringing at his Heels, whoſe Officiouſneſs plainly ſhews what O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion they have of Greatneſs. This per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades him, that he is not miſtaken in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his lofty Elevation render'd him Happy: And if the inward Experience he has of his Condition, does not ſuit with his Conception, he ſuſpends the ſad Reflections of his Mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſays to himſelf, that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſo many Perſons who eſteem him Happy

                  <p>
                     <hi>HAppineſs</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> are the Two general Goods which Man naturally deſires, but not without ſome Dependance and Subordination to each other; for he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires not Happineſs for the ſake of <hi>Perfection,</hi> but Perfection for the ſake of Happineſs. Man can't be throughly contented, whilſt the Idea of his Imperfections is freſh in his Mind. This obliges him to diſguiſe 'em, as much as is poſſible, and to get rid of 'em, unleſs by renouncing his Defects, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a part of that Pleaſure, wherein he plac'd his Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the <hi>Mind</hi> always paſſing Sentence in Favour of the Applications of the <hi>Heart,</hi> oftentimes leads us into Errors, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding Vices with Vertues, Defects with Perfections. The <hi>Aethiopians</hi> count the Blackeſt People the moſt Beautiful, but in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the other parts of the World, the Whiteſt are eſteem'd the moſt handſome and fine. 'Tis not ſo eaſy, as ſome may think, to decide which of 'em is in the wrong. Juſt ſo ſtands the caſe with the Qualities of the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47885:103"/>
                     <hi>Soul.</hi> Vivacity and Sprightlineſs, which paſs in ſome Countries for very great Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, are counted in others moſt eſſential Imperfections.</p>
                  <p>And certainly 'tis a very difficult Matter, to make this juſt Diſcernment betwixt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Perfections, amidſt the Darkneſs and Prejudices which attend our Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; 'tis not ſufficient, that we conſult pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Opinion, for Men oftentimes agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to conſecrate their common Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and a Propenſity, in which they ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize and agree, they moſt frequently judge to be worthy of Eſteem, or at leaſt not to be rejected and deſpis'd. <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> in ſome Countries is counted a very ſcandalous Vice; in others it paſſes for a modiſh Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and is not thought an eſſential Crime.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore 'tis no hurt for Men to ſuſpend their Judgment, touching what is term'd Vice and Vertue, Perfection and Imperfection, till they have had Time and Leiſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the clear and diſtinct Views of their <hi>Mind,</hi> or of <hi>Religion,</hi> which is a yet ſhorter way to the Knowledge of our real Duties.</p>
                  <p>Now for putting us in a way to make this Diſcernment, 'tis to be obſerv'd, that GOD differs from the Creature in this, that he is <hi>a Being inveſted with all Perfections:</hi> So that we may affirm him to have either <hi>Formally</hi> or <hi>Eminently,</hi> every Good that falls under our Knowledge, or deſerves our Eſteem; that is, he
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47885:103"/>
poſſeſſes theſe Qualities and Perfections, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the higheſt Degree, or other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which are equivalent to 'em.</p>
                  <p>But as for the <hi>Creature,</hi> it can't pretend to be endu'd with any Perfections, but what belong to its <hi>Species.</hi> 'Tis not neceſſary a <hi>Stag</hi> ſhould have Wings, 'tis enough for him that he hath Swiftneſs for his ſhare. Birds have no uſe for Fins, Wings are ſufficient to their End of Flying.</p>
                  <p>Now in this, Men are under a double Failing: Firſt, for pretending to have ſuch Perfections as are in no wiſe due to their Species. Secondly, for renouncing thoſe which do really belong to 'em, and very well ſuit with their eſſential Perfections; for they give their Body more than is its due, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive their Soul of what it juſtly challenges. The former they endeavour to perpetuate and enlarge: They would fain procure it a kind of Eternity, whereof 'tis uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and a ſort of Grandeur, or rather Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity, which by no means ſuits with its Condition.</p>
                  <p>But Men lie under a yet greater Failure, by being unwilling to enter within the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of themſelves, or to take a Survey of their own Nature; falſly imagining that the Quality of <hi>Man</hi> includes nothing but Baſeneſs and Miſery; they are not very eager in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch of thoſe Perfections which are due to this general <hi>Quality,</hi> but aſpire at an Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47885:104"/>
from this common Condition, by the help of thoſe external Goods, and forreign Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which diſtinguiſh 'em in Society.</p>
                  <p>They leave off ſearching after the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which belong to <hi>Man,</hi> and purſue thoſe of a Magiſtrate, an Artiſt, a Scholar, a Burgeſs, a Gentleman, a Grand-Seignior; they no longer place their Honour in what may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or adorn Humane Nature, and enrich the Mind, this immortal <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and lively <hi>Image</hi> of the Deity: But in that, which is capable of making 'em ſucced and excel in their Profeſſion, tho' never ſo mean and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did in it ſelf, or of putting 'em in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to maintain, with Credit, the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of that publick Station, wherein the Circumſtances of their Life have plac'd 'em.</p>
                  <p>Hence it appears, that Men uſe to meaſure the Perfection or Imperfection of their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Endowments, meerly by the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have to that <hi>State</hi> wherein they ſuppoſe themſelves to be, and to which <hi>Self-love</hi> and <hi>Pride</hi> advance 'em with a Deſign of gaining a famous Reputation. A profeſs'd Scholar does not ſtand upon points of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: And a Souldier ſeldom concerns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with Scholarſhip. Tell the former that he's a Man of no Courage, he'll but laugh at you; but make the ſame Reproach to the latter, you'll move his Choler, and put him in a Rage: The Reaſon is, becauſe Learning is no Qualification for a Souldier, nor Valour
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47885:104"/>
for a Scholar. But this is to be underſtood when <hi>Self-love</hi> fixes the one in the Station of a Scholar, and the other in that of an Heroe; for it many times happens that a Man, thro' an incentive of Pride, affects to appear, what we term, <hi>Omnis homo,</hi> and then the Maxim changes with the Suppoſition.</p>
                  <p>It can't be expreſs'd, how many falſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices ſpring from this Original. Injuſtice, Debauchery, Fury, make uſe of this Occaſion to conſecrate themſelves. The ordinary Theft, or Burglary, ſuits not with a private Man's Fortune and Condition, whoſe Neck is forc'd at laſt to pay for his Crimes; and therefore this is counted a baſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Fault: But grand Robberies, ſuch as the Conqueſt of Cities, and Provinces, do out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly match and agree with the <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of a Potentate, and theſe therefore paſs for Heroick Enterprizes. Horrour and Infamy neceſſarily attend the ordinary Murther, which is ſubject to the Rigour of the Law, and conſequently comports not with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of private Perſons, whom the Laws retain and keep within the bounds of Duty: But an unjuſt War, which includes an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of Murthers and Robberies, if happy and ſucceſsful, is an Object of the greateſt Eſteem and Admiration.</p>
                  <p>Not to ſay, as ſome have done, that Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are conſecrated by their Greatneſs, and that Exceſs is the Glory of a Crime: This
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:47885:105"/>
Opinion would be ſomewhat extravagant; but yet we may ſafely ſay, that this fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inequality of our Prejudices, touching the very ſame Things, proceeds from an Habit, we have gotten, to judge of Qualities meerly by their Relation to the State and Condition of thoſe that poſſeſs 'em. A Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is branded with Shame and Diſgrace for being miſ-led and abus'd, and yet he who is the Author of this Seduction, makes it a Motive of his Vanity: This prejudice is aſſuredly very extravagant; yet the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is founded upon the Maxim we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd. <hi>Men</hi> are thought to have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Topicks, whereupon to build an Eſteem and Reputation; all the Fountains of Glory lye open to their Appetite. A <hi>Woman</hi> is limited in this reſpect; She can neither go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern States, command Armies, nor make a ſucceſsful progreſs in Arts and Sciences, at leaſt according to the ordinary Courſe, and for the Generality; and the Examples of the contrary are too few to lay any great ſtreſs upon: But ſhe can be Honeſt and Modeſt, for which reaſon nothing is more Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in a Woman than Chaſtity. Alſo that Empire of Beauty, which the World eſteems the Glory of Women, fails of adding the ſame Honour to <hi>Men,</hi> who are naturally deſign'd for other Purpoſes, than to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Amiable, and diſplay ſome Skill in throwing the Darts of <hi>Cupid.</hi> And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47885:105"/>
it happens that a Vice well plac'd, paſſes for a great Vertue; and a Vertue ill plac'd, is thought a great Vice. <hi>Prodigality</hi> becomes <hi>Alexander</hi> very well, who being Maſter of the World has, in his Cuſtody, the Treaſures of it. <hi>Frugality</hi> ſuits very well with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who ſupports his Armies by a Miracle, when block'd up in <hi>Italy</hi> on every ſide. Even <hi>Cruelty</hi> it ſelf, which at another time would in no wiſe become him, agrees with the Circumſtances of that Condition.</p>
                  <p>But Wiſdom, Prudence, Honeſty, Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being Qualities which ſuit with all States and Conditions, no wonder if the greateſt part of Mankind are equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd about 'em: They don't endeavour to obtain theſe Vertues as being worthy of <hi>Man,</hi> but as they match and agree with their States and Intereſts.</p>
                  <p>They ſeek for true <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> becauſe 'tis the Reality, and not the bare Appearance of theſe Vertues, that ſerves their turn, and promotes their Advantage; but they uſually content themſelves with a meer ſhew of <hi>Honeſty,</hi> becauſe they think that outward Appearances of Sincerity, are more for their Ends, than the Vertue it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Men have ſufficient reaſon to hate <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy,</hi> and to be angry at this Impoſture of Vice, which ſeems deſirous to make Fools, both of God and Men, by an execrable Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick of Appearances, and affected Out-ſides:
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:47885:106"/>
But to ſpeak the down-right Truth, <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy</hi> is a Vice which ſeems common to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. All Men ſtudy to appear, as may be moſt for their Advantage.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a miſtake to imagine, that there be Hypocrites or Diſſemblers of none but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; there be Hypocrites of Honour, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, Valour, Liberality; and there be more that counterfeit themſelves in civil Life, than who put on a Vizard in the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis pretty to ſee two Fellows, that ſcrape Acquaintance, or are going to ſwap Wares, take each other for Cullies and ſoft-Heads; and neither ſay nor do any thing but what is to carry on the Deſign of Cheating. Men affect a ſhew of Complaiſance, Politeneſs, Probity, Honour, meerly to be thought really endow'd with theſe Qualities.</p>
                  <p>All this aſſuredly proceeds from a too ſhort View of <hi>Self-love,</hi> and leſt we ſhould Err, and go out of the way, 'tis neceſſary to return from the Road we went in before, to ſearch after <hi>Man,</hi> whom we deſir'd to avoid; and taking for Perfection, not what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever diſtinguiſhes us in the World, but what ſuits with this natural Equality of Perfection and Excellency, which we have in common with other Men; to conſider our ſelves not in <hi>Our ſelves,</hi> but <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Perfections belonging to the <hi>Mortal Man</hi> are very inconſiderable: But thoſe of the <hi>Immortal Man</hi> are all worthy of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47885:106"/>
he need not put on the Mask of Hypocriſy to counterfeit himſelf to the Eyes of Mankind: He need only renounce the Fallacies of his Pride, the vain Prejudices of the World; and take off the Veil which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepts the proſpect of <hi>himſelf,</hi> to find that he's advanc'd above the <hi>Sphere</hi> of Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Even the Paſſions of Men ſet up for real Perfections, when they have their juſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the <hi>Immortal Man;</hi> and if you nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly obſerve, you'll find that the Baſeneſs we conceive in theſe Affections of our Soul, proceeds from the too narrow Limits, where unto Concupiſcence and <hi>Self-love</hi> have con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fin'd 'em: Give the <hi>Soul</hi> Liberty to take its whole flight, let it act with the full extent of its Powers, and you'll find 'tis a Divine Sphere, that grows bigger and bigger the nearer it comes to GOD.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XII. <hi>Where we Treat of the general Vices which flow from </hi>Self-love,<hi> and firſt of </hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</head>
                  <p>THere are Three ſorts of Goods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Self-love is principally apply'd the Full, which is of it ſelf ſenſible, and this is <hi>Pleaſure</hi>: A Second, which is Deſirable for its own ſake, but becomes not ſenſible of it
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:47885:107"/>
ſelf, this is <hi>Eſteem</hi>: A Third, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſible nor deſirable for its own ſake, and hath only (as the <hi>Schools</hi> ſpeak) <hi>a Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Means,</hi> and this is <hi>Riches;</hi> to which we muſt add a Fourth Good, which ſeems to include all thoſe before-mention'd, namely, <hi>Dignities;</hi> which according to the ordinary Notion Men have of 'em, are a Compound of Pleaſure, Glory and Support, in order to lead a commodious and agreeable Life.</p>
                  <p>The love of Pleaſure is Natural, that of Eſteem is Lawful, the Deſire of Riches hath nothing Criminal in it ſelf; But all theſe Inclinations immediately commence Vices, when they become head-ſtrong, and ceaſe to be directed by the Dictates of Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Self-love apply'd to irrational Pleaſure, is term'd Voluptuouſneſs; as it irregularly purſues Eſteem, it has the Name of Pride; and when 'tis converſant about Riches, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring 'em with an exceſſive Ardour, 'tis term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Covetouſneſs: Laſtly, Self-love eagerly aſpiring at Dignities, beyond the meaſures of right Reaſon, and the Tenour of Juſtice, is call'd Ambition: But as worldly Goods are reduc'd to Pleaſure and Glory, ſo the moſt general Diſorders of Self-love are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Voluptuouſneſs and Pride, an Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of which will be the Concluſion of our preſent Enquiries.</p>
                  <p>Pleaſure may be conſider'd, in reference either to the Perſon, who is the ſubject of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47885:107"/>
it, or in reference to Society, or GOD; for 'tis undoubtedly neceſſary in theſe Three reſpects. 'Tis by Pleaſure that the Author of Nature hath engag'd our Soul in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Body; we ſhould omit to repeat the uſe of Food, had it not an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Taſt. 'Tis Pleaſure that puts us upon mutual Commerce, whether in Oeconomical or Political Society, ſince the Union of Men, and even the Propagation of Mankind, is to be aſcrib'd to this Sentiment. Laſtly, 'tis the Pleaſure we find in loving, and being lov'd by God, in hoping for his Bleſſings, in receiving his Benefits, and in having a ſenſe of his Peace and Favour, that incites us to have our Converſation with him.</p>
                  <p>Hence it follows that Pleaſure is Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, either when 'tis oppoſite to the Good of the <hi>Man,</hi> who is the ſubject of it; or to the Good of Society, or the Commerce we ought to entertain with God.</p>
                  <p>The imbitter'd Pleaſures, which for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany Delight, coſt Men very durable and laſting Torments, are to be rang'd in the firſt Order. As the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God manifeſtly appears in this, That he hath affix'd Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Pleaſure to Food, and other things which naturally relate to the Preſervation of the Body; ſo his <hi>Juſtice</hi> becomes moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in the rigorous Puniſhment and Scourge of Incontinence. But we ought not to look only upon that Voluptuouſneſs, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47885:108"/>
the Body, as contrary to Man; the ſame Judgment is alſo to be paſs'd upon that which weakens or diſ-compoſes the Mind.</p>
                  <p>Moreover Pleaſure is to be thought Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, either when it tends to deſtroy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, or diſturb the mutual Order of it. Such are the Pleaſures which are founded upon Inſincerity and Infidelity, which eſtabliſh in Society a Confuſion of Family and Children, and which are attended with Suſpicions, Diſtruſts, and many times with Murthers, and Attempts upon the moſt ſacred and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Laws of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That Pleaſure is to be eſteem'd Criminal, which God hath forbidden, either by his natural Law, which he has given to all Men, or by a poſitive Law; as alſo ſuch Pleaſure as weakens, ſuſpends or deſtroys our Commerce with him, by too much confining and fixing us to the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Principle 'tis eaſy to ſee, what Judgment ought to be made of all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kinds of Voluptuouſneſs, and to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all their Characters. In general, as 'tis a natural and fundamental Truth, that the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the beſt Things is always worſt, ſo 'tis certain, that by how much more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and neceſſary any Pleaſure is to <hi>Man,</hi> in the natural and regular uſe of it, ſo much more dangerous and criminal is the Abuſe of it.</p>
                  <p>The Pleaſure of <hi>Seeing, Smelling</hi> and <hi>Hearing</hi> is perhaps the leaſt Blameable of all;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:47885:108"/>
becauſe we don't deſtroy our Being, injure any Man, or offend God, generally ſpeaking, either in beholding agreeable Objects, in ſmelling delicious Odours, or hearing melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Harmonies: I ſay, generally ſpeaking, becauſe there are infinite Circumſtances, which may render theſe Pleaſures Criminal, tho' they ſeem never ſo innocent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. A Man is to be blam'd for having ſuch an eager Deſire after publick Spectacles, Smells, or Muſick, as to neglect his own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, omit to fulfil the Duties of Society; or laſtly, for being taken off, by the continual Uſe of Pleaſures, from the ſpiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce which he ought to have with God; not to mention thoſe many dangerous Pleaſures which are involv'd in the firſt. We think many times to purſue the Pleaſure of Sight, in our fine Walks and magnificent Houſes; Yet all this while our Bent is after the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Pride and Ambition, ſaying almoſt the ſame thing to our ſelves as the <hi>Aſſyrian King</hi> did in his arrogant Heart: <hi>Is not this Babylon, the great City which I have built by the Power of my Might?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſy to conceive that <hi>Gluttony</hi> is a more criminal Pleaſure than thoſe we have been ſpeaking of; it deſtroys the Health of the Body, debaſes the Mind, calling it down from thoſe ſublime and lofty Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to which it naturally tends, to the ſordidneſs of Senſuality, which makes it a
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:47885:109"/>
Slave to Banquets and Tables, as if they were the Sources of its Happineſs;
<q>Atque affigit humi Divinae particulam Aurae.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Pleaſure of Exceſs in Eating, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conſider'd, is not near ſo Criminal as <hi>Drunkenneſs;</hi> which not only impairs the Body, and debaſes the Mind, but diſ-compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes our Reaſon, and ſuſpends us, for ſome time, from the glorious Character of <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creatures:</hi> A Man by this dangerous Pleaſure, mortgages his Reaſon, and becomes reſponſible for all the Miſdemeanours, which this Deprivation may occaſion him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; ſo that as there is no Vice in Nature, but may poſſibly enſue upon this loſs of our Underſtanding, Drunkenneſs may be ſaid to involve and comprehend all other Vices.</p>
                  <p>The Pleaſure of <hi>Love</hi> produces not quite ſo ſenſible Irregularities, but yet 'tis of no leſs dangerous Conſequence. Love is a kind of Drunkenneſs, and infatuation of the Mind and Heart of One, who gives up himſelf to the ſwinge of this Paſſion; this is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication of the Soul, as the other of the Body.</p>
                  <p>The former is guilty of an open Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, expos'd to the ſight of all the World; the latter Dotes in reality, tho' he ſeem to have the Uſe of his Reaſon: Alſo the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer renounces only the Uſe of Reaſon; whereas the other renounces at once both
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47885:109"/>
his Mind and Heart. Notwithſtanding I muſt own, that thus far the Diſorder of Drunkenneſs is much more ſenſible, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, really more enormous.</p>
                  <p>But when we come to conſider the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of theſe two Paſſions, to the Good of Society, and our Converſation with God, we find irregular <hi>Love</hi> to be, in ſome ſort, more Criminal than Drunkenneſs; becauſe this occaſions in us but a tranſient Diſorder, whereas the other is attended with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd and laſting Exorbitance. Moreover, Love is oftner the occaſion of Man-ſlaughter than Wine. Drunkenneſs is ſincere and open-hearted, but the whole Intrigue of Love is made up of Artifice and Infidelity: Laſtly, Drukenneſs is a ſhort Fury, which withdraws us from God to ſerve our Paſſion; but irregular Love is a perpetual Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>Self-love is not wholly confin'd to the purſuit of corporeal Delights, but it has a Hundred ways of mingling 'em together to highten the Guſt, and encreaſe their Reliſh: Moſt Arts are the Servants of Pleaſure, they are exercis'd in mixing Colours to delight the <hi>Eyes,</hi> Odours and Eſſences to pleaſe the <hi>Smell,</hi> Inſtruments, Tunes and harmonious Sounds to flatter the <hi>Ear.</hi> We make volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Miſcellanies of Colours, Sounds and Odours; theſe we make uſe of to raiſe and ſet off the Pleaſure of Feaſting, and this with all thoſe other agreeable Objects, we make
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:47885:110"/>
inſtrumental to yet more vicious Delights: And this ſenſual Pleaſure is ſo conſiderable in the Eyes of Men, that when they have a Mind to raiſe themſelves Credit and Eſteem, they think there's no fitter way for it, than to flatter the Senſes of their Aſſociates and Viſitants. They love to have rich and gaudy Ornaments to pleaſe the Sight, fragrant Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences to flatter the Smell, a fine Voice and skill in Muſick to charm the Ear. All theſe are the Ingredients of Men's Eſteem; we confound Pleaſures with Perfections, and think nothing Excellent but what diverts us.</p>
                  <p>Tho' this Pleaſure ſeem ſo much the more Criminal, by how much greater ſpace it takes up in our Soul, and ſo much more dangerous as 'tis common to all Mankind, yet indeed I am not of their Mind, who, by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties and nice Speculations would diſpute the natural and lawful Uſe of the <hi>Creature;</hi> and fancy that either all Pleaſures are equally ſinful, or that none of 'em can be taſted without a Crime, unleſs we have at the ſame moment an explicit Intention of referring 'em to the <hi>Glory of God.</hi> This Opinion is extravagant, there being infinite Occaſions of taking honeſt and innocent Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, tho' we find no poſitive Relation they have to the Glory of God. It therefore ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>CHAP. XIII. <hi>Where we continue our Conſideration of the divers Characters of </hi>Pleaſure.</head>
                  <p>THe Generality of Men acknowledge but one kind of Voluptuouſneſs, which is that of the Senſes; they reduce all to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Intemperance, and don't ſee that in the Heart of Man there are as many different ſorts of Voluptuouſneſs, as there are varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Delight for it to abuſe; and as great diverſity of Delights as there are Paſſions, which move and agitate our Soul.</p>
                  <p>Covetouſneſs, which ſeems willing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive it ſelf of the moſt innocent Pleaſures, and to adopt in their place none but Labour, Fatigues, Diſquietudes and Fears, fails not of its Pleaſure for all that, which retrieves the loſs of that Sweetneſs it renounces. <hi>Populus me ſibilat,</hi> ſays the Miſer deſcrib'd by Horace, <hi>at ego mihi plaudo ipſe domi, dum nummos contemplor in Arcâ.</hi> The power of enjoying temporal Goods is the ſame to him, that the actual Enjoyment is to other Men.</p>
                  <p>But as ſome Paſſions are more Criminal than others, there's a kind of ſpiritual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47885:111"/>
which is particularly dangerous. It may be reduc'd to three <hi>Species</hi>; Namely, the Pleaſure of Hatred and Revenge, of Pride and Ambition, of Incredulity and Impiety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pride</hi> takes a delight in appropriating to us thoſe Goods which are none of our own, or ſuch Qualities as are in us, but are not properly ours; or a Glory which ought to be aſcrib'd to God, and not our ſelves. As the Soul reſents a kind of Grief at being ſtript of its Honour, to cloath and adorn another, which cauſes the ſecret Repugnancies it has to Humility, ſo it finds a very ſenſible Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in derobing others of this Glory, to cover and ſet off it ſelf with their <hi>Feathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may very well wonder, what Pleaſure the <hi>Romans</hi> could find in the bloody Paſtime of the <hi>Circus,</hi> to ſee the <hi>Gladiators</hi> kill and mangle one another, to make them Sport and Recreation: This barbarous Delight may be reckon'd a Pleaſure of Ambition and Vain-glory: The Thoughts that theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants were <hi>Slaves,</hi> made the <hi>Romans</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get 'em to be <hi>Men.</hi> This was a Flattery to Ambition, letting 'em ſee that the Men were made for no other purpoſe, but their Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Divertiſement.</p>
                  <p>There's a Pleaſure of Hatred and Revenge which conſiſts in the Joy we perceive at other Men's Misfortunes. This is an hideous Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which is nouriſh'd by our Neighbours tears: Yet if you look cloſely into the Matter,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47885:111"/>
you'll find 'tis moſt agreeable to the Palate of worldly Men. This Pleaſure is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd to the degree of that Hatred which gave it Birth. Hence a <hi>Poet</hi> of our Age, who had a competent Knowlede of Man's <hi>Heart,</hi> expreſſes the Exceſs of Hatred, by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Pleaſure:
<q>
                        <l>Should Clouds diſgorge their Flames upon this Place,</l>
                        <l>And Thunder to the ground theſe Buildings raſe;</l>
                        <l>Should thy proud Laurels into Aſhes waſt,</l>
                        <l>And all the <hi>Roman</hi> Stock new breathe their laſt;</l>
                        <l>I cou'd endure theſe Objects in my fight,</l>
                        <l>Cauſe 'em my ſelf, and Dye ev'n with Delight.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Incredulity fortifies it ſelf with the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all the other Paſſions which attack Religion, and are delighted with upholding ſuch Doubts as favour the Intereſt of their Diſorder; and Impiety, which ſeems to do Evil for Evil's ſake, and without any further Advantage, yet has its ſecret Pleaſures, which are ſo much the more dangerous, the more the Soul hides 'em from it ſelf at that time, when it moſt exquiſitely taſts 'em.</p>
                  <p>It often happens, that an Intereſt of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, makes us irreverent to the <hi>Supream Being.</hi> We wou'd fain ſeem formidable to Men, by ſeeming to have no fear of God: To menace and threaten the Earth, we blaſpheme Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But yet that is not the principal Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of Impiety: Man naturally hates God, becauſe he hates the Dependance which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits him to his Dominion, and the Law
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47885:112"/>
which reſtrains his Deſires. This Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Deity lies hid in the bottom of Man's Heart, or Infirmity and Fear many times conceal it from the Eyes of Reaſon: This inward Averſion perceives a ſecret Pleaſure at any thing that dares and affronts GOD; Men love thoſe flights of Wit which ſcandalize the <hi>Divinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Victrix cauſa Diis placuit, ſed victa Catoni.</l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Il dédaigne de voir le Ciel qui le trahit.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>He ſcorns to ſee the Heaven, which betrays him.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>This ſeem'd Brave and Great, becauſe it was Impious.</p>
                  <p>I am inclinable to their Opinion, who hold that Fear is the original Source of Superſtition, provided we join Hatred and Fear together, as they are often found in the Heart of Man; it being hard for us not to have ſome Hatred and Averſion at that which we very much fear and dread. 'Tis certain, that Superſtition would not be ſo common in the World (for ordinarily 'tis made up of an inhumane Extravagance) did not Pleaſure inveigle Men to that which Reaſon forbids; and this Pleaſure conſiſts in an inward Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, at ſeeing the <hi>Deity</hi> abus'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded. The <hi>Pagans</hi> did not only meet with a Pleaſure of Pride, in raiſing Men to the Order of Gods, but alſo a Pleaſure of Hatred and Impiety, in debaſing the Gods to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Men; and it may be they were not
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:47885:112"/>
ſo much delighted with reading thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of their <hi>Poets,</hi> which related the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theoſes</hi> of Men, as thoſe which feign'd the Wounds and Defeats of the Gods, by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Arms.</p>
                  <p>So that whoever ſounds the Depth of our Heart will find, that Superſtition and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs are not ſo oppoſite as Men commonly imagine; and that they are united in this ſecret Hatred of God, which follows the State of our Corruption, and which nothing can cure but Grace.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> are united to form that vaſt Pleaſure, which Superſtition aims at, and the Delight we find in Impiety; ſo alſo they combine to make the Pleaſure of Malignity, Slander and Calumny.</p>
                  <p>Here we find a Pleaſure of <hi>Vain-glory:</hi> For we many times diſpraiſe other Men, with a Deſign indirectly to commend our our ſelves. Any Man in the World would openly praiſe himſelf, if he dar'd be ſo bold; but fearing leaſt a breach of Modeſty might make a Blemiſh in his Eſcutcheon, he's obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to go a By-way to work, to uſe Cunning and Artifice in diſplaying his Merit to the Eyes of Mankind, ſo as not to attract the Reproach of too great Vanity: He dares not commend himſelf in plain Terms, but hopes that by ſpeaking of others, he ſhall give an indirect Deſcription of himſelf; that by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſhew of Horrour and Deteſtation of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:47885:113"/>

A dull and unpolitick <hi>Self-love</hi> draws this Diſcourſe, ſaying, <hi>As for my part, tho' I have very great Defects, yet may I boaſt that I have not This:</hi> But an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and prudent <hi>Self-love</hi> knows better how to manage its Modeſty, and many times hides its Contempt, but much more the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign it has in Contemning.</p>
                  <p>But beſides this Intereſt of Pride, which makes us delighted in deſpiſing other Men, there's alſo an Intereſt of Hatred, which creates in us the like Diſpoſition. We look upon other Men as our Enemies, becauſe we regard 'em as Competitors in the purſuit of temporal Enjoyments: You'll always be pleas'd at ſeeing 'em Degraded, whilſt you think 'em in a Condition to rival you in any thing: But no ſooner does this Oppoſition ceaſe, but there's alſo an End of that Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you conceiv'd in their Debaſement; hence it happens that Slander has for its Object, not the <hi>Dead,</hi> but the <hi>Living.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this 'tis eaſy to judge, that the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Converſation, is not ſo innocent as Men commonly fancy. Indifferent things are tedious to us; thoſe which concern and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:47885:113"/>
nearly relate to us, excite a Pleaſure either of Pride, Hatred, Impiety, Ambition, or ſome other Paſſion no leſs Criminal.</p>
                  <p>As there is a Pleaſure of Converſation, there is alſo a Pleaſure of Thoughts, which proceeds from the ſame Source with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: It ariſes from this, that our Heart, being prepoſſeſs'd with certain Paſſions, can't enjoy it ſelf, but when it thinks upon certain Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and therefore ſuſpends all our other Thoughts and Reflections. Such is the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of a Lover, who forgets every thing elſe to think of the Object of his Love; he perceives a ſort of Delight in his Amorous Contemplations, (which is deſtroy'd by Paſſion) becauſe the Pleaſure of Thought yields to that of Senſe.</p>
                  <p>Men commonly imagine, that the uſual Diſtractions and Wanderings of thoſe that pray to God, or exerciſe any other Duties of Religion, are the leaſt of Faults; but if they enquire into the Cauſe of 'em, they'll change their Opinion: For indeed theſe proceed meerly from the too great Pleaſure, which the Ideas of temporal Things excite in our Minds; and that, as I may ſo ſpeak, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to retain thoſe worldly Objects by the Pleaſure of Thinking, which eſcape our reach thro' the Suſpenſion of our ſenſual Delights.</p>
                  <p>We every where ſeek for Pleaſure, juſt as Bees for thoſe Flowers which afford 'em
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:47885:114"/>
Nouriſhment; and as they many Times find what they ſearch for in foul and mooriſh places, ſo it frequently happens, that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a kind of Pleaſure in Affairs, Dangers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Labours, and ſometimes even in Affliction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it be not very great. There's a Pleaſure which might juſtly be term'd, the Pleaſure of Complaints and Tears: We take delight in lamenting the Death of illuſtrious Perſons the Glory of thoſe, who are bewail'd, ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing, in ſome ſort, even thoſe who bewai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> 'em. We take a Pleaſure to prolong and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize our Sorrow: We think to give a <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of the Conſtancy of our Soul, by an inconſolable Affliction. Laſtly, we are very glad to make an appearance of the Greatneſs of our Loſs, thinking to engage the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of others to reflect upon our own Worth.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt place, we perceive a ſort of Pleaſure even in <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> which oftentimes cauſes us to renounce all the reſt. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a certain Effeminacy and Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which makes us hate even the leaſt Pain and Incommodity: For our whole Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs being the ſearch of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom our ſelves to think, love, deſire, ſpeak and act with Pleaſure; to ſeek for ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as delights us, and to avoid all manner of diſagreeable Occupations. Hence the leaſt Inconveniency puts us in Deſpair, it being contrary to this prevailing Habit, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:47885:114"/>
the Perception of ſo many different Pleaſures, the Thoughts whereof are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſent to our Mind.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we muſt not think to find Stedfaſtneſs and Conſtancy in Voluptuous Souls: <hi>Pride</hi> indeed may cauſe 'em to affect a ſort of Hardineſs, to ſupport Diſgraces and Calamities, but certainly they never put on a real Fortitude till they are freed from the charming Idea's of Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Bodily Pleaſure is more ſenſible than Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, yet this appears more Criminal than that: For the Pleaſure of <hi>Pride</hi> is Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, which appropriates to it ſelf the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour belonging to God; the Pleaſure of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is Barbarous and Blood-thirſty, which is delighted in nothing but Deſolation and Tears; and the Pleaſure of Incredulity and Superſtition is, as we before ſhew'd, full of Impiety and Wickedneſs, which is nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and upheld by any thing that ſeems to deba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e or annihilate the <hi>Deity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſhews us, in the firſt place, that Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is as univerſal as our Corruption, it being certain, that they who are abandon'd to one ſort of Pleaſure, ſeldom fail to enſlave themſelves to another. It ſignifies but little, for Inſtance, to make great Scruples about the Uſe of ſenſual Pleaſures, when we are given up to that of the Mind, which is far more criminal and dangerous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:47885:115"/>Secondly, we may reaſonably conclude, that 'tis impoſſible to cure One-ſelf of this Vice, by Motives purely Temporal. For when you allege to a Voluptuous Man, the Conſiderations of Honour and <hi>Decorum,</hi> of his Intereſt and Eſtabliſhment in the World, you may perhaps ſo far work upon him, as to oblige him to prefer the Pleaſures of Pride and Ambition before ſenſual Pleaſure; but this will but tranſport him from one Vice to another.</p>
                  <p>If you'd find ſuch Motives as are capable of withdrawing him from all kinds of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, you muſt put the caſe to him of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking all worldly Delights, if need be; and to this End, ſet him upon making this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, That himſelf ſhall laſt to <hi>Eternity,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Pleaſures</hi> but for a Moment.</p>
                  <p>Indeed upon the Principles of a mortal and periſhing Man, the Cauſe of Pleaſure ſeems juſt and reaſonable; for 'tis natural to One that is not to be very long in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of enjoying the ſweetneſs of Pleaſure, to ſeek and purſue it, ſo long as he has an Opportunity: This Piece of Morality is prettily expreſs'd by <hi>Horace:</hi>
                     <q>Vitae ſumma brevis ſpem nos vetat inchoare longam.</q>
Were all <hi>Man's</hi> Hopes and Pretenſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to the ſhort Duration of this Life, there would be Truth and Reaſon in theſe Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47885:115"/>
But being deſtin'd to live after Death, the Light of Nature teaches us, that he ought in like manner to aſpire at thoſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Delights, whereof Religion ſo happily informs him.</p>
                  <p>To this I add, that the <hi>Immortal Man,</hi> or as I have already deſcrib'd him, he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves he is Eternal, and acts according to this Principle, eaſily renounces the Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> thro' his deſire of an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and unlimited Happineſs. 'Tis impoſſible he ſhould become a ſlave to ſenſual Delight, which he knows the Author of <hi>Nature</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd purely as a Motive to engage us in the Preſervation or Propagation of the <hi>Body.</hi> He's as far from placing his <hi>Supream Felicity</hi> in the Pleaſure of being applauded and extoll'd by a Society of Mortals, as any Man in his right Senſes would be from placing his Glory in the Praiſe and Commendation of one that's to ſee him but for a Moment. He is not affected with the Pleaſure of Revenge; he'll hardly look upon thoſe Perſons as Enemies, who do him but a temporal Prejudice. He patiently ſupports the ſhort D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>pendances of this Life, and for the ſame reaſon taſts not any crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Pleaſure, in being a Superiour, regarding his Condition as a proviſional and tranſitory State, which ſcarcely deſerves his Care and Attention. In a word, the <hi>Immortal Man</hi> has no Paſſions but what are very moderate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

in the World, is proportion'd to the Degree of his application to theſe Objects; 'tis eaſy to conceive, that he finds himſelf ſituated above the Sphere of Voluptuouſneſs; in which certainly he cannot be ſaid to loſe any thing, being advantagiouſly indemnify'd by the Commerce of Love, Gratitude, Zeal, Joy and Conſolation, which he holds with God, who by the Sentiment of his holy and unſpeakable Delights, raiſes him above the melancholly <hi>Scene</hi> of our ſad and intoxicated Pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore Man does not eſcape the fond Embraces of Pleaſure, as 'tis uſually fancy'd, either by Pride, Intereſt, Revenge or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; he that ſhuts himſelf up in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row limits of this Life, will be Voluptuous, do what he can. Let the <hi>Pagan</hi> Philoſophers tell us as many fine Precepts of Vertue, and preſcribe as many Remedies as they pleaſe againſt Intemperance, we'll indeed admire their Maxims, becauſe of the ſecret Relation they have to our natural Dignity, of which we have a confus'd and imperfect Knowlege: But ſhall never find our ſelves any farther diſpos'd to practice 'em, than as we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of our Eternity.</p>

                  <p>PLeaſure and Glory are the two general Goods, which give a ſeaſon and reliſh to all the reſt: They are, as it were, the Spirit and Salt of all the others, differing in this, as we before obſerv'd, That Pleaſure becomes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable and deſirable purely for its own ſake, whereas Glory is perceiv'd meerly upon the account of that Pleaſure which attends it.</p>
                  <p>But tho' Glory be perceiv'd only by means of that Pleaſure, wherewith 'tis accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, yet may it ſtill be ſaid in ſome ſenſe to be deſirable for its own ſake; at leaſt it muſt be certainly acknowledg'd that 'tis no eaſy matter to find out the primitive and ancient Reaſon, upon which our Love of Eſteem is founded. This is no ſatisfactory Solution, to ſay, that we deſire Eſteem becauſe of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant Pleaſure: For this Pleaſure being a Pleaſure of Reflection, the Difficulty is not ſo eaſily ended, ſince it ſtill remains to know why this Eſteem, which is ſomething for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and remote in reſpect of us, ſhould cauſe our Satisfaction?</p>
                  <p>Nor is it more to the purpoſe, to alledge the Utility and Profit of Glory, for tho' the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47885:117"/>
Eſteem and Repute, we acquire, may ſerve to make us ſucceed in our Deſigns, and procure us divers Advantages in Society, yet there are Circumſtances, under which this Suppoſition will not hold good. What proſpect of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage could <hi>Mutius, Leonidas, Codrus, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and all thoſe other Heroes propoſe to themſelves, who laid down their Lives in the Field, and purſuit of Honour? What Advantage could they ſee in ſacrificing their Goods and Themſelves upon the Altar of Pride? Thro' what Principle of Intereſt do thoſe <hi>Indian</hi> Women, who burn themſelves in the Funeral Pile of their deceas'd Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, ſeek even in deſpight of Laws and Remonſtrances, for an Eſteem which they Survive?</p>
                  <p>A certain Perſon hath ſaid upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, That <hi>Self-love</hi> delights to foſter and cheriſh an Idea of our Perfections, which is, as it were, its domeſtick Idol, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to endure any thing that oppoſes this Idea, as <hi>Contempt</hi> and <hi>Injuries</hi>; and on the other hand, paſſionately ſearching after all that flatters and magnifies it, as <hi>Eſteem</hi> and <hi>Commendations.</hi> According to this Principle the Advantage of Glory would conſiſt in this, That the Eſteem which others have for us, confirms the good Opinion we have of our ſelves: But that this is not the principal Source of the Love of Eſteem and Honour, appears from hence, That Men for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47885:117"/>
make more account of the apparent <hi>Merit</hi> which they obtain by the Eſteem of others, than of the real <hi>Merit</hi> which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the Eſteem of themſelves; or, if you will, that they had rather have thoſe Faults which Men eſteem and value, than ſuch good Qualities as are not priz'd in the Eyes of the World; and that moreover there are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Perſons, that ſeek to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſiderable and valu'd by ſuch Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments and Qualities, as they very well know they are not endu'd with, which deſtroys the <hi>Opinion,</hi> that they have recourſe to an outward and forreign Eſteem, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the good Sentiments they have of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>'Tis equally groundleſs to imagine, that we deſire Eſteem meerly for this reaſon, That we may be diſtinguiſh'd and rais'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the common Rank; for this is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the Cauſe by the Effect. We don't ſeek for Eſteem, that we may diſtinguiſh our ſelves, but we diſtinguiſh our ſelves, becauſe we would be eſteem'd, by departing from the Multitude, and leaving the Dungeon of our former Obſcurity.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Love of Eſteem in its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Idea, can't be ſaid to proceed from this Idolatry of Self-love, which aims at being Eternal and Immenſe like GOD, exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us an imaginary Eternity in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of Men, to ſave us from the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47885:118"/>
of Time, and maugre its conſuming Malignity to perpetuate our Name; and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enlarge our Dimenſions, and extend 'em to the utmoſt limits of the World, by buiſying the Minds of Men with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our Actions and Grandeur. If that were the only Source of the Love of Eſteem and Honour, 'twould follow, that we cou'd not innocently deſire the Eſteem of other Men, nor conſequently be blamable for dreading Infamy and Diſgrace, which is contrary to Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Tho' we ſearch ne're ſo long for the Springs of this Inclination, I'm perſwaded, that the reaſon of it will no where elſe be diſcover'd, but in the Wiſdom of the Creatour. For as God imploys the Uſe of Pleaſure, in order to preſerve and propagate our Body, to unite us together, and make us ſenſible of the Good and Preſervation of Society, wherein we are plac'd, ſo there's no doubt, but his Wiſdom makes uſe of the Love of <hi>Eſteem,</hi> to defend us from the Debaſements of Pleaſure, and put us upon exerting honeſt and laudable Actions (which ſo well agree with the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our Nature) and at the ſame time to unite us more conveniently one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>This Pre-caution would not have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, had Humane <hi>Reaſon</hi> acted only by it ſelf, and independently from <hi>Senſe:</hi> For then this <hi>Reaſon</hi> would be able, not only to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47885:118"/>
ſhew us what is Honeſt, but alſo to prefer it before what is Pleaſant: But becauſe this <hi>Reaſon</hi> is Partial, and many times judges in favour of Pleaſure, tying Honour and Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum to that which delights us; the Wiſdom of the Creatour thought fit to give us for the Arbitrator of our Actions, not only our own Reaſon, which ſuffers it ſelf to be corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and brib'd by the ſoftneſs of Pleaſure, but alſo the Reaſon of other Men, which is not ſo eaſily ſeduc'd.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, becauſe the Author of <hi>Nature</hi> was ſo pleas'd, that other Men's <hi>Reaſon</hi> ſhould be in ſome ſort our Law and Judge as to moral Honeſty, and the Decorums of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Nature: Upon this very account he form'd us with a natural Deſire of raiſing an Eſteem of our ſelves in the Minds of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; a Deſire, which aſſuredly precedes the Reflections of our Mind.</p>
                  <p>For tho' the Utility, Pleaſure and Deſire of finding Confirmations of the Opinion we have of our ſelves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be capable of ſatisfying the Love of Eſteem, yet we have ſhewn, that they are not the Cauſe of it.</p>
                  <p>And here we might diſtinguiſh Three <hi>Worlds,</hi> which the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the Creatour has founded upon Three natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: The Animal, the Rational, and the Religious <hi>World.</hi> The firſt is a Society of Perſons united by Senſe, the ſecond of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons united by Eſteem, the third of Perſons
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47885:119"/>
united by natural Religion. The firſt has for its Principle the Love of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> the ſecond the Love of <hi>Eſteem,</hi> the third <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> All theſe three Principles are Natural, and the Grounds of 'em is not elſewhere to be ſearch'd for, than in the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the Creatour. The firſt of theſe Worlds relates to the ſecond, the ſecond to the third, and the third to the laſt. Wherefore theſe things are thus ſubordinated to each other, <hi>Eſteem</hi> regulates the Love of Pleaſure, and <hi>Religion</hi> ought to regulate the Love of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem; and this Subordination is no leſs na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural than theſe Inclinations.</p>
                  <p>The Love of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> may truly be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to Nature: But the Irregularities of Voluptuouſneſs are to be reckon'd to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Account. The Love of <hi>Eſteem</hi> may be ſaid to be Natural; but yet we are not to ſuppoſe, that the Extravagancies and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities of <hi>Pride</hi> ariſe from the Womb of <hi>Nature.</hi> To this we may aſcribe the Fear of <hi>God,</hi> and the Love of <hi>Vertue:</hi> But we ought not to give it an Appennage of all thoſe Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, which Men have been pleas'd to ingraft upon the Principles of Nature; and conſequently 'tis neceſſary, that the Love of Pleaſure, of Eſteem, and Conſcience, ſhould have their natural Law, Rules and Limits: But 'twill not be amiſs to inſiſt upon the Love of <hi>Eſteem.</hi>

                  <p>IT ſeems, that hitherto we have not had a very perfect Knowledge of <hi>Pride,</hi> and doubtleſs the reaſon was, becauſe we have not throughly diſtinguiſh'd its ſeveral Parts, nor with ſufficient Attention examin'd all its Characters. <hi>Pride</hi> in general may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Five principal Branches: Namely, to the Love of Eſteem, to Preſumption, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Ambition, and Haughtineſs. For tho' Men are wont to confound theſe Terms, and uſe 'em indifferently to ſignify the ſame Thing; 'tis certain that theſe Expreſſions have ſomewhat different Significations. The Love of Eſteem is Natural and Lawful in it ſelf, as we before obſerv'd; but 'tis Vicious and Diſorderly when it riſes to Exceſs: This is the moſt general Irregularity of <hi>Pride,</hi> for when our Deſire of <hi>Eſteem</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, 'tis natural to romage in our ſelves for ſome eſtimable Qualities, and finding we have none, our Imagination preſents us with ſome in Complaiſance to the Inclinations of the Heart, from whence ariſes <hi>Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Moreover this immoderate Love of <hi>Eſteem</hi> makes us value our ſelves upon any
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:47885:120"/>
Endowment, whether good or bad, and for want of real Sources of Glory, to aim at an Eſteem upon the account of thoſe things which are in no wiſe Eſtimable, unleſs in our own Fancy; this is properly our Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. For this Expreſſion originally ſignifies the Emptineſs of thoſe Objects, wherein we erroneouſly ſeek for Eſteem, and which are naughty Sources of Vain-glory. From this exceſſive Love of Eſteem ariſes the Deſire we have to raiſe our ſelves above other Men, having a Perſwaſion, that we can't attract a publick Eſteem and Conſideration, whilſt we are confounded with the Vulgar Rabble; and this produces Ambition. Laſtly, The Deſire we have to make a great Show, by diſtinguiſhing our ſelves from the common Rank, makes us deſpiſe other Men, ſeeking all poſſible means to degrade and pull 'em down, that we may ſtand upon their Heads. All the Irregularities of <hi>Pride</hi> being reduc'd to the exceſſive Love of <hi>Eſteem</hi> as their firſt and original Principle, we can't uſe too much Diligence in conſidering this latter. The two general Faults of this Inclination are <hi>Exceſs</hi> and <hi>Irregularity;</hi> the Firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in this, That we love Eſteem too much: the Second, That we love falſe <hi>Eſteem</hi> as well as true.</p>

in our <hi>Heart.</hi> He gave it to us for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the <hi>Body,</hi> the Good of <hi>Society,</hi> and the Exerciſe of <hi>Vertue.</hi> I ſay, for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Body, ſeeing that the Love of Eſteem defends us from thoſe Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances of corporeal Pleaſure, which would preſently tend to our Deſtruction and Death: For who doubts, that the Deſire of raiſing an Eſteem of our ſelves, is a powerful Motive to ſtave us off from that exceſs of Debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery and Senſuality, to which we are drag'd by the Love of Pleaſure, and which is of ſo fatal Conſequence even to our Body. He plac'd in us this Inclination for the Good of Sciety; for 'tis this Deſire to obtain an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem in the World, that renders us Affable and Complaiſant, Obliging and Civil; that makes us love Decency and Sweetneſs of Converſation. And yet all this while, who does not know, that the fineſt <hi>Arts,</hi> the moſt lofty <hi>Sciences,</hi> the wiſeſt <hi>Governments,</hi> the moſt juſt Eſtabliſhments, in general, moſt that is Admirable in reaſonable Society, proceeds from this natural Deſire of Glory? Let us not fancy, that our own <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence</hi> brought this excellent Benefit to Mankind; doubtleſs the wiſe Inſtructions of the Author of <hi>Nature</hi> had the chiefeſt Hand in this Matter. Laſtly, 'tis certain, that the Deſign of God was to ſteer and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us to honeſt and laudable Actions, by giving us for the Judge of our Conduct, not
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:47885:121"/>
only our own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which is oftentimes brib'd by the Enticements of Pleaſure; but alſo the Reaſon of other Men, who are not ſo partial in our Favour as we our ſelves. Indeed God may be conſider'd either as the Author of <hi>Society,</hi> or <hi>Religion.</hi> As the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Society,</hi> he thought fit Men ſhould enter into mutual Commerce, during ſome Time; and with this Intent he endow'd 'em with ſuch Inclinations as were neceſſary to the Good and Preſervation of Society. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe are to be reckon'd the Love of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and the Deſire of <hi>Eſteem:</hi> This latter is the Spring of Humane Vertues, which ought not to be ſo much cry'd down, as uſually they are, for if they are not inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to eternal Salvation, yet are they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for the Good of temporal Society; they proceed from the Intention of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature; they are a part of his Model and Platform; Love of <hi>Eſteem</hi> being the means he makes uſe of to perfect Society, as the Love of <hi>Pleaſure</hi> is deſign'd to found it. As for <hi>Religion,</hi> that has more lofty Views; for it undertakes to direct Men to the eternal and infinite <hi>Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence it follows, that the Love of <hi>Eſteem</hi> is Exceſſive: Firſt, when it tends to deſtroy the <hi>Body,</hi> inſtead of preſerving it; Secondly, when it diſturbs the good and order of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, inſtead of maintaining and ſupporting it; Thirdly, when it cauſes us to violate
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:47885:121"/>
the Precepts of Vertue, inſtead of putting us upon the Practice of 'em.</p>
                  <p>We find a pat Example of the firſt of theſe in the Fury of <hi>Duels:</hi> That, in my Opinion, is a very extravagant point of <hi>Honour,</hi> which would have us love <hi>Glory,</hi> and yet deſpiſe <hi>Life,</hi> which is the main Foundation, and partly the End of it, as we have already ſeen. What will Men's <hi>Eſteem</hi> ſignify to me, when I am not in Being to enjoy it? Without Life this Honour is nothing. Life is ſomething, even without this Honour, and God himſelf thought fit to let us know by his Conduct, that the former is more Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable than the latter; for he incites us to the Love of <hi>Honour,</hi> but by one bare Motive of <hi>Glory,</hi> and makes us in love with Life, by <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> too.</p>
                  <p>But if it be anſwer'd, That 'tis not ſo much the love of Honour and Eſteem, as fear of Contempt and Shame, that makes a Man expoſe himſelf to revenge an Affront; and that 'tis natural to a Man of <hi>Honour</hi> to be unable to live under the preſſure of Infamy: this Reply is not ſatisfactory, becauſe as 'tis a Weakneſs not to be able to endure Grief, 'tis no leſs One to be unable to ſuffer an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and groundleſs Contempt.</p>
                  <p>In the bottom we find the Love of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem,</hi> as to this Example, to be irregular in every Reſpect. For this is to love <hi>Eſteem</hi> too much, To love falſe <hi>Eſteem,</hi> and that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47885:122"/>
too more than <hi>Life,</hi> and conſequently more than the Preſervation of the Body, than Society, which is depriv'd of one or many Members by the Fury of thoſe infamous Combats: And laſtly, more than <hi>Vertue</hi>; ſince 'tis to love it more than Humanity, Juſtice, Charity and Moderation.</p>
                  <p>I know when the Caſe is put to ſpend one's Blood for the good of Society, and the Service of the <hi>Prince,</hi> who is its Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, and has its Rights and Properties deputed into his Hands, a Man ought not to make the leaſt reſiſtance, or ſcruple to expoſe his Life; but then 'tis <hi>Vertue,</hi> and not <hi>Eſteem,</hi> that he prefers before Life: He purſues the Deſign of the Author of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> conforms himſelf to his Model and Will; ſince he that made us has plac'd us in a State of Subordination and Dependance. All the Irregularity proceeds from this, That Men have not a competent Knowlege of <hi>Honour,</hi> and love it Blindfold; they have only a confus'd Notion of it, which Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Examples, and the Judgment of other Men do inceſſantly change. <hi>Honour,</hi> in its ordinary Idea, includes three Things; 'tis a Sentiment of one's Excellency, a Love of Duty, and a Deſire to be Eſteem'd. A Man of <hi>Honour</hi> ſhould be ſenſible of Vertue and Merit, and conſequently be grated and offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at any outward Contempt or Diſreſpect. He ſhould ſo far love his Duties, as even to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47885:122"/>
expoſe himſelf to the greateſt Dangers, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than fail of obſerving 'em; and he ought to love the Eſteem of rational Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and make it his endeavour to deſerve it.</p>
                  <p>This general Idea is juſt and true, but the Application, Men make of it, is ordinarily Falſe; for they attend not ſufficiently to their real Merit, which is far greater than they imagine, in not having an Idea of their Duties, which are of much larger Extent than they ſuppoſe, and being unable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern falſe Eſteem, from true, which is the Thing to which they ought to aſpire.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs 'tis probable, that Men, even in their Irregularities, have a ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Sentiment of their natural <hi>Dignity,</hi> which joyning it ſelf with their falſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of <hi>Eſteem,</hi> and worldly <hi>Glory,</hi> cauſes that Impatience, or rather Fury, at receiving Abuſes and Affronts. Would one, whoſe Merit reaches no higher than that of a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and Dying <hi>Man,</hi> reſent ſo great Horrour in Debaſement? And would he be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively vex'd at being reduc'd, even to that <hi>Nothing,</hi> which ſurrounds him on every ſide? No certainly, there's an Inſtinct in <hi>Man,</hi> which continually puts him in Mind of his Condition, and renders him ſenſible of all that oppoſes the Idea of his Perfections.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis certain, that this <hi>Glory</hi> to which we aſpire, includes many different Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47885:123"/>
which are the conſtituent Parts of it. We may diſtinguiſh Four: Namely, <hi>Eſteem, Conſideration, Reſpect,</hi> and <hi>Admiration. Eſteem</hi> is a Tribute we pay to a Man's proper Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and Perſonal Merit; <hi>Conſideration</hi> has for its Object, not only the Merit of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but alſo his external Accompliſhments, as Birth, Riches, Power, Credit, Reputation; and in general all thoſe Advantages, which make the Difference of Conditions, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Perſons in <hi>Society. Reſpect</hi> is nothing elſe but an high Conſideration; and <hi>Admiration</hi> is no more but a great <hi>Eſteem.</hi> The fineſt, or at leaſt the moſt proper <hi>Glory,</hi> conſiſts in Eſteem and Admiration: But the moſt ſenſible and conſpicuous Glory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Conſideration and Reſpect; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it is, Becauſe all the World are not capable of diſcerning a worthy and deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man, from an unworthy; whereas every one can diſtinguiſh a great Lord, from a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain, that every Man which wears a Head, may juſtly demand this Sentiment of us, when we conſider his Excellence, and natural <hi>Dignity.</hi> We owe Eſteem and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration to thoſe Perfections which GOD has pleas'd to endow a Man with. We owe Conſideration and Reſpect to the Rank and Station he has in the <hi>World:</hi> But this origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory of Man has been darken'd, and almoſt defac'd by <hi>Sin;</hi> and here we can't
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47885:123"/>
without Surprize and Amazement conſider the prodigious Depravation and Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of corrupted <hi>Man</hi>; ſee his Pride, as it were, ſpringing up from the Ruines of his Glory, and his Humility ending, where his real Vileneſs begins.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſomewhat ſtrange, to ſee Men Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementing and Praiſing one another, whilſt they equally deſerve an eternal Shame and Reproach:</p>
                  <p>But we need not wonder at it, God being willing to preſerve <hi>Society,</hi> even after the Corruption of <hi>Man,</hi> was not oblig'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of this natural Inclination towards publick Eſteem, which makes, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Perfection of civil Converſation.</p>
                  <p>The Example of thoſe <hi>Philoſophers</hi> is not to be minded, whom we have ſeen deſpiſe Men's <hi>Eſteem</hi> to ſuch a Degree, as even to count themſelves Unhappy if they chanc'd to attract it. It may be, theſe <hi>Heroes</hi> in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility did not really deſpiſe Glory, but only made an appearance of deſpiſing it to the Eyes of <hi>Men. Cicero</hi> ſays, that none of all thoſe who wrote Books concerning the Contempt of Vain-glory, ever forgot to put their Names to 'em; this is a politick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of <hi>Pride,</hi> to aſpire after Glory by ſeeming to ſhun it. When a Man openly profeſſes his Deſire of <hi>Eſteem,</hi> he meets with a great many Emulators and Rivals, who obſerving his Deſigns, are ſo much the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47885:124"/>
more eager to ſtand in his Light with their own Eſteem; and more vigorouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to deprive him of the Eſteem of other Men, with how much greater Ardour he reaches after it: But when a Man ſeems to deſpiſe this Eſteem of the World, which is ſo much courted and ſought after, then as he voluntarily ſeparates himſelf from the Number of thoſe, who directly aim at it, he's very well thought of, Men like his <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſtedneſs,</hi> and would even force him to accept of that which he ſeems to refuſe. <hi>Gloria,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Auguſtine, ſequitur fugien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> have always been at Daggers-draw, for the Upper-hand in the way to <hi>Glory.</hi> Grandees are inveſted, by the Priviledge of <hi>Fortune,</hi> with the moſt illuſtrious Honours, which uſually attract the Affections of the Multitude. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, maintaining the Rights and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> oppoſition to <hi>Fortune,</hi> have rais'd, as it were, a Party of Confederates againſt Grandeur and Renown; being uncapable of obtaining it, they betake themſelves to contemn and deſpiſe it. 'They made a Show of renouncing that ambitious Deſire, which makes Men cringe and run after the Diſpenſers of the Goods of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> leſt an eager Officiouſneſs might be a tacit Confeſſion of their Inferiority; and becauſe the <hi>Multitude</hi> condemn'd 'em by
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47885:124"/>
their intereſted Conduct, they pretended to deſpiſe vulgar Eſteem, and popular Applauſe; but let 'em once change their Condition, they'll preſently be of another Mind.</p>
                  <p>But the Irregularity conſiſts principally in this, That our Thoughts are ſo much taken up with gaining an <hi>Eſteem</hi> amongſt <hi>Men,</hi> that we don't take time to think of approving our ſelves to <hi>God:</hi> Not but the Approbation of God ſeems to us, in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, more precious and valuable than Men's Eſteem: But it falls out thus, becauſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Eſteem of Men, 'tis not requiſite that our <hi>Heart</hi> ſhould be chang'd, it ſuffices that we diſguiſe our ſelves to the Eyes of the World; whereas we can't approve our ſelves to God, unleſs we change the very Foundation of our <hi>Heart.</hi> Now 'tis no hard matter for <hi>Self-love</hi> to put on a counterfeit Viſage; but 'tis a point of Difficulty to be willing, in good Earneſt, to become new Men.</p>

                  <p>The end of Vanity is conſecrated by the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:47885:126"/>
Cuſtome of making the ſame Eſtimate of that Man's Diſpoſition, who attributes to himſelf thoſe Qualities which he truely poſſeſſes, that we do of his, who endeavours to build a Foundation of Honour upon falſe Advantages.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems, that Man's Vanity commenced, when he loſt the Sources of his real Glory, by quitting that State of Sanctity and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, wherein God had originally plac'd him.

on this Account, being ſuſceptible neither of Praiſe nor Diſpraiſe; or to ridiculous Things, which are ſo far from raiſing any real Honour, that they are the fitteſt Mark to denote our Vileneſs; or to criminal Things, and which by conſequence can't but be Shameful and Unworthy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or laſtly, to thoſe things, all whoſe ſeeming Perfection and Glory conſiſts in the Relation they have to our Defects and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</p>
                  <p>I place <hi>Riches</hi> in the firſt Rank, which tho' they have nothing Contemptible, yet neither have they any thing Glorious in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Our covetous and intereſted Deſire never informs it ſelf either of the Source, or Uſe of the <hi>Riches</hi> it ſees in other Men's Bags. Their meerly being Rich is ſufficient to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its firſt Homages, and tho' it be not actually profited by their Wealth, yet it ſtill reſpects 'em upon the bare Poſſibility of being the better for 'em one time or other.</p>
                  <p>But if your Heart would pleaſe to receive a diſtinct, inſtead of a confus'd Idea, 'twould be often ſurpriz'd at the Extravagance of its Sentiments; for ſince Riches are not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to <hi>Man,</hi> and there muſt be ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Cauſe to give him his Eſtate, it would find, that it many times eſteems his Perſon, becauſe his Father was a Profligate, or himſelf a Knave; and that when it pays
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:47885:127"/>
external Homages to <hi>Riches,</hi> it either blows a Kiſs to <hi>Robbery,</hi> or commends Infidelity and Injuſtice.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, this is not its direct Intention: It follows the Hankerings of its Deſire, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Dictates of Reaſon: But is a Perſon whom you thus court and accoſt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to correct, by all theſe diſtinctions, the Baſeneſs of your Carriage; and to ſeparate that which your Intereſt gives him, from what your Reaſon would pay him, if it did but follow its own Counſel and Advice? No, no, He receives your outward Defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Reſpect, as a Tribute to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. As your covetous Deſire draw'd you in to make a Fool of you, ſo his Pride fails not to Chowſe, and put a Trick upon him. If his Riches don't encreaſe his Deſert, yet the greatneſs of your Complaiſance enhances and augments the Opinion he has of 'em. He interprets all in a literal Senſe, and fails not to magnify and aggrandize himſelf, in his own Thoughts, at the outward Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Veneration you pay him, when you are ſcarce a Farthing the better for his Wealth. Not but there is ſomething in <hi>Riches</hi> which ſeems to render 'em an Object of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem</hi> to the Eyes of Men, as there's ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t; and this I believe is, becauſe by the former we are inveſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d with a kind <hi>Power,</hi> which advances us to a pitch above
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47885:128"/>
other Men, and puts us in a Condition to live without being beholding to 'em; whereas <hi>Poverty</hi> places us in a State of <hi>Neceſſity</hi> and <hi>Weakneſs,</hi> which forces us to rely upon the Aſſiſtance and Succour of others: But we may ſay even in this, That Opulence owes its Glory to our Ambition, and <hi>Poverty</hi> is not Shameful, but meerly thro' our <hi>Pride.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, we don't by any means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of their Carriage, who can't endure any Perſons ſhould receive the Bleſſings of Providence, but they muſt preſently vent their Malice and Outrages againſt 'em. We turn 'em every way, diligently examine all their Faults, and in that bate 'em not an Ace. Certainly if the Eſteem Men have for <hi>Riches</hi> proceed from <hi>Self-love,</hi> the Contempt and Scorn which ſome affect for wealthy People is always a Mark of <hi>Envy;</hi> and this very Envy is extreamly ſhameful and unworthy. In the bottom, the dependance of <hi>Intereſt</hi> is much more prevailing than that of <hi>Envy</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Men had rather voluntarily give Place to thoſe, from whom they expect ſome Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, than to ſpurn above 'em, and do, as it were, a forc'd Homage thro' a Diſpleaſure at the Proſperity of them, whom they envy.</p>
                  <p>Riches are to be eſtimated meerly by the good or bad Uſe Men make of 'em; as alſo Birth, Authority, and Dignities. All theſe things put Men in an Engagement to do good and laudable Actions. If you practice the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47885:128"/>
Duties to which they engage you, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Fountains and Cauſes of your Glory; if you tranſgreſs the Obligations they lay on you, they ſerve to no other purpoſe but to brand you with Infamy and Diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>They, who being arriv'd to ſome Degree of ſignal Proſperity, get Drunk with the Thoughts of their Grandeur, are not curious Artiſts in the Trade of Vain-glory; would not an apparent Moderation, which ſhould make a Shew as if they were above thoſe Things which elevate and raiſe 'em, gain 'em much more Honour, than this hair-brain'd Statelineſs, which gives People oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to think they are beneath their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; ſince they ſo little underſtand how to manage and ſupport it? This is ſo much the more ſurprizing, as 'tis not the Fate of thoſe alone, who are not ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd to know the Prejudice which this Conduct does 'em, to forget their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: But alſo of thoſe who perfectly know this Truth. The reaſon is, Becauſe when Men are advanc'd to ſome Dignity or Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they change, if I may ſo ſpeak, their inward Station, <hi>Pride</hi> mounting 'em to an higher Poſt than they were in before. In vain will <hi>Reaſon</hi> adviſe 'em to abide in their former Situation, and to affect for their Glory an Evenneſs of Temper, which may hinder 'em from taking notice of the Advancement of their Fortune: Men chooſing rather to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47885:129"/>
follow the Sentiments of the <hi>Heart,</hi> than the Lights of the <hi>Mind;</hi> it happens, that they inſenſibly forget the refin'd Intentions of their Vanity, and purſue the Career of their Inclination, to make the beſt Market of all their Advantages. They, whoſe <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur</hi> is of long ſtanding, or to whom the Splendor of a lofty Fortune was Hereditary, are not altogether ſo ſubject to thoſe Daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of <hi>Vain-glory;</hi> becauſe their Mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long accuſtomed to look down upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, from the Tallneſs of its <hi>Station,</hi> does not much concern it ſelf to render that Difference remarkable which cauſes their Diſtinction: But yet the common People are miſtaken in thinking, that theſe Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages are more humble and modeſt than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; they'd undoubtedly ſhew the very ſame Inſolence, were they in like manner apprehenſive, that Men did not ſufficiently remark their State and Elevation; their Courteouſneſs and Civility is owing to a confirm'd, and (as they think) inconteſtable Opinion of their Superiority. To be certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd of this, you ſhall ſee thoſe very Perſons, which are ſo Affable and Modeſt to thoſe that are extreamly Below 'em, Haughty and Inſupportable towards thoſe who are almoſt their Equals; the Reaſon is undoubtedly this, That the Civilities they ſhew to thoſe, who are much their Inferiors, ſeem to 'em of no unlucky Conſequence; they are ſure
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47885:129"/>
their Civilities and Condeſcenſions won't be taken in a literal Senſe, and they may gain the Name of Courteouſneſs without blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Rank: But the Caſe is not the ſame when they have to do with ſuch as may enter into a kind of Compariſon with 'em; as the Diſtance, that ſeparates 'em from theſe latter, is not very great, their <hi>Pride</hi> ſeeks to extend and enlarge it as much as lays in its Power, and puts 'em upon doing a Thouſand unreaſonable and unnatural Things, that they may cauſe all the World to take notice of that, which they are afraid is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently remark'd.</p>
                  <p>There are certain Temporal Advantages, which we take for Sources of <hi>Glory,</hi> tho' in themſelves, and ſeparately from the Uſe Men make of 'em, they deſerve neither E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, nor Commendation; but we muſt bring under this Head, That Man oftentimes values himſelf upon ſuch Qualities as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>I don't only mean thoſe who affect ſuch Accompliſhments, as they are not really en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with, tho' 'tis this that properly makes thoſe we term ridiculous People, or Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals: Men give this Quality to whom they pleaſe, and laugh at the Coſt of whom they think fit: It may be if there were an Order of reaſonable Creatures exempt from our Imperfections, they'd find the Ridiculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Humane Nature to be greater than
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47885:130"/>
we imagine. <hi>Man</hi> indeed, conſider'd in his natural Excellency, is aſſuredly a Work of <hi>God,</hi> moſt worthy of Admiration: But this is becauſe he's Admirable in one ſenſe, and Ridiculous in another. Is there any Thing, for Inſtance, more unſuitable to our natural <hi>Dignity</hi> than the Vanity which is diſplay'd in Luxury of Habits, and Superfluity of Cloaths; is it not a more Ridiculous thing than all that Men uſe to laugh and make ſport at, that Embroidery and Gilding ſhould be Ingredients in the <hi>Formal Reaſon</hi> of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem,</hi> that a Man well Dreſs'd ſhould claim an Exemption from the Laſh of Men's Tongues more than another; that an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul ſhould give its Eſteem and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to Horſes, Equipages, Furnitures, Liveries, &amp;c. and that we ſhould attribute that Glory to the Ornament of the <hi>Body,</hi> which is the moſt glittering Jewel of the <hi>Soul? Cicero</hi> reproaches it; he calls One who left off the Glory of his Profeſſion, to follow this ridiculous <hi>Vanity; Virum in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendis cauſis bene veſtitum:</hi> But he need not have paſs'd this flouting Jeer only upon one Man, who follow'd the common Prejudice, but in general upon all Mankind, who may juſtly be reproach'd for being in ſo great want of Glory, that they are put to the ſhift to ſeek for it even in that, whoſe primitive Deſign was to ſerve for a covering of their Shame and Nakedneſs. The Art of Dance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47885:130"/>
which ſome People ſeriouſly ſtudy, is a Quality that would render us Ridiculous, if conſider'd in that high and lofty Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein we are plac'd by Nature and Religion. An immortal Soul Dancing and Capering, is an Object equally odious and ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>I know, indeed, this Ridiculouſneſs does not appear, becauſe 'tis too general. Men never laugh at themſelves, and conſequently they are not much affected by this univerſal Ridiculouſneſs, wherewith all, or at leaſt, the greateſt part of Mankind are liable to be charg'd: But their Prejudice does not change the Nature of Things, and the wide Diſagreement between their Actions, and their natural <hi>Dignity,</hi> is no leſs Real for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conceal'd from their Imagination.</p>
                  <p>But, what is more grievous, Men don't only value themſelves upon Qualities which would make 'em Ridiculous, could they but duely weigh and conſider 'em, but alſo ſeek to gain a Reputation by Crimes and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
                  <p>We have ſaid before, that Men tye Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and Diſgrace to Unfortunate, but Eſteem and Credit to Succeſsful Crimes: Theft and Murther, which are Harbingers to the Gallows, are diſdain'd in a private Man, but in a <hi>Potentate</hi> the greateſt Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and moſt notorious pieces of Injuſtice, which mount him to the Empire of the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47885:131"/>
World, are very well thought of.</p>
                  <p>Old <hi>Rome</hi> is a famous Example of this: In her Birth ſhe was a Colony of <hi>Rogues</hi> and High-way Men, who fled to her Sanctuary for an Impunity of their Crimes. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhe was a Re-publick of <hi>Murderers,</hi> who extended their Injuſtices, far and wide, over all the Earth: So long as theſe Villains make it their Buſineſs to rob and plunder Paſſengers, to baniſh Peace and Security, from a little Corner of the World, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelves at other Men's Coſt, they have no very creditable Reputation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they don't ſo much as pretend to <hi>Glory:</hi> But no ſooner does a notable Proſperity put 'em in a Condition to rob whole Nations, and ſignalize their Fury and Injuſtice by dragging Princes and Sovereigns to their Triumphal <hi>Chariots,</hi> but they have no more to ſay of <hi>Impunity,</hi> they pretend to <hi>Glory;</hi> they don't only dare to juſtify, but alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate their famous Robberies. They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, as it were, the whole <hi>Univerſe</hi> in the Pomp of their Triumphs, to expoſe to open View the ſucceſs of their Crimes. They open their Temples, as if they'd bring in <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf for an Accomplice of their Ravages and Fury.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, There are very many things which Men eſteem meerly as they relate to ſome or other of their Infirmities. <hi>Pleaſure</hi> many times makes 'em think Debauchery
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47885:131"/>
honourable; <hi>Riches</hi> are beholding to poor People's greedy Deſires, for all the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they have in the World. <hi>Puiſſance</hi> derives its Worth from a certain Power of doing what one liſt, which is the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Preſent that can be made to Men; <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Dignities</hi> draw their principal Luſtre from our Ambition; and ſo it may truly be ſaid, That our Depravation, and Irregularity, is the only Source of the Glory of moſt temporal Things.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XVIII. <hi>Where we continue to examine the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Men's Vanity.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>OUr <hi>Vanity</hi> is ſo palpable and manifeſt in all theſe Things, that we need not be at any trouble to find it out: For what a piece of Blindneſs is it, for a Man to value himſelf upon thoſe Advantages, which don't go to make up the Merit of his Perſon; and upon ſuch Things as render us ridiculous, by ſhewing the extream Diſproportion betwixt what we are, and what we ought to be: Or laſtly, upon criminal Things, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thoſe which are eſſentially Shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Unworthy?</p>
                  <p>But methinks one may, at firſt ſight, make quite another Judgment of the Qualities of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47885:132"/>
the <hi>Soul,</hi> which are reduc'd to intellectual Qualities, that belong to the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and Virtues, that belong to the <hi>Heart,</hi> ſince the one and the other make up what we term, Perſonal Merit.</p>
                  <p>Yet if we look cloſely into the Matter we ſhould find, that this is far from being the Seat of ſuch real Sources of <hi>Glory</hi> as is commonly imagin'd. What if we grant the Philoſophers, who made choice of this ſort of Advantages, to raiſe themſelves Eſteem and Credit, that there's ſomething more pure in their pretended Glory, than in that which Fortune and the Prejudices of the World tye to external Goods, yet we ſhall not fail to convince 'em of <hi>Vanity,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the bottom they will not appear more reaſonable than the reſt of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>The natural Qualities are, <hi>Memory, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion,</hi> and <hi>Judgment;</hi> the acquir'd Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are Sciences or Arts: and in general, all experimental or ſpeculative Knowledge, which adorns our Mind, by inſtructing us in that which we knew not before, or which is uſeful to the purpoſes of Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Memory</hi> is not reckon'd to be very ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant in point of <hi>Vain-glory.</hi> Men don't pretend to build much Grounds of <hi>Eſteem</hi> upon this Faculty, which appears from this, That they think they may ſafely boaſt of having a good Memory without offending againſt Modeſty; and that they are not fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47885:132"/>
of blemiſhing their Character, by own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they have a bad One. 'Tis to be imputed to this Reaſon, That there being in <hi>Man</hi> Two Qualities: Inferior, which are ſerviceable to ſome higher; and Superior, which direct and rule the reſt: We natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally more eſteem the Superior and ruling Faculties, than the Inferior and inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, ſuch as <hi>Memory</hi> is, which ſerves only to furniſh the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> with Memoirs; and ſome ſay that there are various Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the <hi>Mind</hi> of Man, and that when one Power is enlarg'd, another is contracted and leſſen'd; whence 'tis thought, That Want of <hi>Memory</hi> betokens <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> In general 'tis certain, That Men never own their Faults and Imperfections for any other reaſon, but meerly to acquire a piece of Glory by vertue of this Confeſſion, which they value much more than the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity they acknowledge themſelves to want; or to appeaſe the <hi>Pride</hi> of others, by an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Humility, and oblige 'em by an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious <hi>Diſ-intereſtedneſs</hi> to render 'em their Due.</p>
                  <p>Men are as diligent and concern'd in point of <hi>Wit,</hi> as they are neglectful and careleſs in point of <hi>Memory;</hi> this appears both by the Senſibility they expreſs, when they are upbraided with the Want of it, and by the delicate Pre-cautions, their <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty</hi> takes to ſhew that they are Witty, tho'
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:47885:133"/>
they don't pretend to it. He that ſhould openly ſay; <hi>I have a great deal of Wit</hi>; would be inſupportable to Mankind; yet this would be no more than what he commonly thinks: but 'tis requiſite he ſhould diſguiſe his Thoughts, and ſtrive to gain a Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by ſeeming to turn his Back to it.</p>
                  <p>Men are undoubtedly very much behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this kind of <hi>Vanity,</hi> ſeeing they owe to it very many agreeable Productions, not to reckon the Pleaſure they take in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of thoſe Perſons who act or ſpeak by this Motive: But indeed ſometimes this Vanity becomes troubleſome and unpleaſant.</p>
                  <p>Whence ariſes the Habit Men have of contradicting in Company, but from a ſecret Envy and Deſire to make the World think that themſelves are more Enlighten'd than others, and better underſtand the Things ſpoken of, or at leaſt from a ſtrong Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they have of it themſelves? They op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe, who take an Aſcendant, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be Maſters in Converſation, more freely than others, becauſe thro' a Principle of Pride they can't away with the <hi>Pride</hi> of thoſe who would be thought to have taller Underſtandings than their Brethren. They more voluntarily contradict in a very great Company, where there are many Witneſſes of what is ſpoken, than when they are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately Diſcourſing with a ſingle Perſon, with whom they can't enter into a Conteſtation,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47885:133"/>
becauſe then the ſame Man would be Judge and Plaintiff both at once. It alſo happens, that Men contradict, tho' they have nothing Material to urge, for when themſelves can't ſhew any ſpecimen of <hi>Wit,</hi> they ſtrive at leaſt to oppoſe the Glory of thoſe, who ſeek to make an Appearance of it.</p>
                  <p>To the ſame Principle may be imputed that Liberty, which moſt Men take to blame the Conduct of their Superiours. In this there is undoubtedly both Injuſtice and Blindneſs: Injuſtice, becauſe they judge of what they neither do, nor can underſtand; it being impoſſible for private Perſons, that have not enter'd in the Councel of their Governours, to know, unleſs very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, the Reaſons of their Conduct: Of Blindneſs, becauſe 'tis commonly ſeen, that thoſe very Men, who ſet up for Judges, and Cenſurers of their Maſter's Actions, prove very great Bunglers, when they happen to be call'd to the like Employ; and how ſhould they be off of it, ſince they are uncapable to frame a right and exact Judgment, of what is before their Eyes? It being a grand Rule, among the common Sort, That Adverſity is a conſtant Token of Diſgrace; and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is a ſufficient Ground of Eſteem and Commendation.</p>
                  <p>Yet who is ignorant, that Men confound an unfortunate Ingenuity, with Ignorance; and a fortunate Ignorance obtains the Glory
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47885:134"/>
of Ingenuity? Nay, I dare ſay, and boldly maintain, that few great Events are owing to Humane Prudence; 'tis the Concourſe of Circumſtances, that cauſes the Happineſs and Succeſs of grand Exploits: There be <hi>Heroes</hi> of Fortune, if I may ſo expreſs my ſelf, and thoſe in a greater Number than Heroes of Merit.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Wit,</hi> taken for that vivacity and ſprightlineſs of Imagination, which makes us conceive things with Quickneſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs 'em with Facility and Eaſe, has a kind of Inconſiſtency with <hi>Judgment.</hi> It moſt frequently happens, that theſe impetuous ebullitions of Fancy embaraſs, inſtead of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting us: They are falſe Lights, which lead us into Precipices. <hi>Wit,</hi> to define it in a word, Is, in the Hand of the Paſſions, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of committing great Faults.</p>
                  <p>I don't ſay the ſame of <hi>Judgment,</hi> which is undoubtedly the moſt Eſtimable of all the intellectual Qualities. 'Tis certainly a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake to attribute great Things and Actions to <hi>Wit:</hi> 'Tis not <hi>Wit,</hi> but <hi>Judgment,</hi> that governs States; diſciplines Armies; excels in Trading; ſoars in the ſtudy of Arts and Sciences: But not to ſet two Qualities at Variance, which are in no wiſe oppoſite; <hi>Wit</hi> muſt be ſaid to be the Perfection of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> reciprocally the Perfection of <hi>Wit,</hi> yet with this difference, That <hi>Judgment</hi> without <hi>Wit</hi> is Something;
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47885:134"/>
whereas <hi>Wit</hi> without <hi>Judgment,</hi> is worſe than Nothing.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of Men's general Miſtake is, becauſe they imagine upon a Vulgar Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, that <hi>Wit</hi> is rarely found, and <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is very common; 'tis quite and clean the contrary. <hi>Wit,</hi> that imagines, invents, refines, and ſubtillizes, in every Thing is frequently met with; but <hi>Judgment,</hi> which compares, examines, weighs, conſiders the Connection and End of Things, determines not it ſelf but upon ſolid Reaſons, is the rareſt Thing in the World.</p>
                  <p>Moſt Men have a Portion of <hi>Wit,</hi> every Paſſion inſpires 'em with that, and even the Strength of Wine creates a Vivacity; but there's ſcarcely a Man upon Earth, who wants not Judgment; ſince there's rarely One, that makes a juſt Diſcernment of what is truly Advantagious to him, from what is of little or no Concernment.</p>

To have confuſed No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and a great deal of Vanity, is the ready way to perpetual Miſtakes; and 'tis certain, that the ordinary Learning implies the one, and the other: For 'tis impoſſible to make a Diſtinction of thoſe various Ideas and Kinds of Knowledge, which Men heap together in ſo great a Number; and it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happens, that they are mightily puft up, with the Attainment of this <hi>tenebrous Booty;</hi> as if a Man had any grounds to think

                  <p>THE exceſſive Love of <hi>Eſteem</hi> produces another Irregularity, which is <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi> becauſe our too violent Ardour, to make our ſelves Conſiderable in the World, cauſes us to aſpire at all that may render us eminent, and great upon the <hi>Theatre</hi> of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Life:</hi> Whilſt we are confounded with the common Rabble, others are equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by the <hi>Publick;</hi> if we would draw Attention, and a peculiar Deference, we muſt depart from their Company. <hi>Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> challenges the Preferences of <hi>Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Eſteem,</hi> and for this reaſon we are ambitious of attaining it.</p>
                  <p>Every One ſtrives to excel in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, be it never ſo mean; and that, not becauſe he loves the Excellency of his Art, for its own ſake; but becauſe he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more Famous and Conſiderable than others: They that expoſe themſelves to War, are not in love with the Dangers, but the diſtinguiſht <hi>Glory.</hi>

hid, be ſubject to Conteſtation, or not expos'd to general View, our <hi>Heart</hi> am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiouſly covets another kind of Elevation, which is Inconteſtable, and acknowledg'd by all Men; namely, <hi>Grandeur, Dignities,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> as we before obſerv'd.</p>
                  <p>The Fancy of <hi>Self-love</hi> is particularly tickl'd, when it ſees thoſe, whom it fear'd as Rivals in the Field of <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> court and crouch under its <hi>Superiority:</hi> 'Tis charm'd, and mightily taken with the Power that brings them under it; and loves them ſo much the more, as it leſs fears the Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of their Competition. But the ſame Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of <hi>Pride,</hi> which excites us to love thoſe, that are ſubject to our Empire, ſo much tempts them to abhor the Neceſſity, which puts 'em in a ſtate of Dependance, that no leſs than an heroick and eminent Vertue, on our ſide, can force them to hide their Malignity.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The ſame Reaſon that makes us endeavour to mount our ſelves to a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht Rank, that we may no longerly in the Obſcurity and Confuſion, which hinder us from being Remarkt in the World, inſpires us with that Inclination we have to deſpiſe and contemn our Neighbour: We are not contented to ſtand on Tip-toe, to ſeem Taller than other Men; but muſt alſo endeavour to Trip up their Heels, and throw 'em down, that we may ſeem Greater by their Fall and Debaſement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="267" facs="tcp:47885:139"/>The Pleaſure we take in <hi>Satyr,</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,</hi> is not only to be imputed to our Spite and Malignity, but alſo to our <hi>Pride.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Nuts</hi> to us to ſee other Men diſgrac'd and pull'd down; eſpecially thoſe Perſons, who hereby become uncapable of being our Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals in the Suit of <hi>Vain-glory;</hi> we take a particular Delight to ſee theſe Ridicule'd, becauſe this Debaſement ſeems greateſt and moſt incurable of all, Men being aſham'd to make thoſe the Objects of their <hi>Eſteem,</hi> whom before they derided and reproacht.</p>
                  <p>How comes it to paſs that Men, who never Laugh to ſee a Stone, or a Horſe fall down, can hardly forbear it when they ſee a Man fall; ſince the One is undoubtedly in it ſelf no more Ridiculous than the Other? 'Tis becauſe our Heart is not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, or intereſted in the Fall of a <hi>Beaſt;</hi> whereas we are ſo much intereſted in the Fall and Debaſement of other Men, that even the Image of it delights and pleaſes us: Men think their Laughing is always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and indeed 'tis always criminal and blamable.</p>
                  <p>This ſame Propenſity inſpires us with the <hi>Contempt</hi> of our Neighbour, which is term'd Inſolence, Haughtineſs, or Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance; according as 'tis Converſant about <hi>Superiours, Inferiours,</hi> or <hi>Equals.</hi> We are eager to Debaſe thoſe who were beneath us before, thinking we ſhall riſe higher, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:47885:140"/>
as they fall lower; or to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage and injure our <hi>Equals,</hi> that they may no longer be at the ſame Level with us; or to ſlight and undervalue our Superiours, becauſe the Luſtre of their <hi>Grandeur</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes ours: Herein our <hi>Pride</hi> viſibly betrays it ſelf; for if others are an Object of our <hi>Contempt,</hi> why ſhould we ambitiouſly covet their Eſteem? Or, if their Eſteem be ſo much worth, as to deſerve the moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Deſire of our Souls, how can we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe 'em? Is it not becauſe the Contempt of our Neighbour, is rather affected, than real? We behold his Grandeur and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, ſeeing his <hi>Eſteem</hi> appears to us ſo Valuable; but we uſe our utmoſt Efforts to hide and conceal it, thinking we ſhall ſeem to ſpin our Honour out of our own Bowels.</p>
                  <p>Hence ariſe Slanders, Calumnies, Ironi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Praiſes, Satyr, Malignity and Envy: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are very careful to conceal this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe 'tis a forc'd Confeſſion, we make of the Merit or Happineſs of others, and an Homage we do 'em by a kind of Conſtraint and Violence.</p>
                  <p>Of all the Sentiments of <hi>Pride, Contempt of our Neighbour</hi> is the moſt dangerous; becauſe this directly oppoſes the Good of <hi>Society,</hi> which is the End, whereunto the Love of Eſteem, by the Intention of Nature, ought to tend; and alſo renders Men moſt odious, and deteſtable in the Eyes of the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:47885:140"/>When we ſee two Fellows, one whereof makes an outward ſhew of Vanity and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; the other ſwears he can't endure this Pride of all things in the World, we may boldly conclude that the latter is more dangerouſly tainted with this Fault than the former; 'tis meerly his own Pride that gives him an Idea of the Pride of others; and 'tis a leſs criminal Effect of Pride, to preſume too much upon <hi>One-ſelf,</hi> than to degrade one's <hi>Neighbour.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Preſumption</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> are a kind of Drunkenneſs in the Soul; but <hi>Hatred, Envy, Malignity,</hi> are a down-right Fury and Madneſs.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Flattery</hi> are two very oppoſite Faults: The former makes a ſhew of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent <hi>Contempt,</hi> tho' it ſecretly carry a real <hi>Eſteem;</hi> for <hi>Envy,</hi> in the bottome, is an honouring Sentiment; it tends to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what it Eſteems; it lives and dies with Merit and Deſert: whereas <hi>Flattery</hi> cloaks a moſt real <hi>Contempt,</hi> under the Mask of an apparent <hi>Eſteem,</hi> ſince it ariſes meerly
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:47885:141"/>
from a ſuppoſition of his Infirmity and Weakneſs, who is the Object of it: And it may be ſaid, that ſome Satyrs are very Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending, and ſome Panegyricks moſt highly Abuſive. <hi>Alexander,</hi> intoxicated with the Fumes of his Vanity, ſees not, that the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian</hi> Strength and Vigour gains him more Honour, than the Idolatry of the <hi>Perſians</hi>; yet he's much oblig'd to his Friends, if they won't ridicule and make ſport at him.</p>
                  <p>'Tis eaſy to judge, from what we have ſaid upon this Subject, how odious a Fault <hi>Pride</hi> is; for all its Irregularities are moſt criminal and ſinful. The exceſſive Love of <hi>Eſteem</hi> makes us reverſe the very Courſe of Nature, by changing the <hi>End,</hi> into the <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:47885:141"/>The Vanity, which applies it ſelf to falſe Sources of Glory, makes us loſe the ſight of the true and ſolid Foundations of Honour; which are Piety, and the Fear of God. The Contempt of our Neighbour neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon our ſelves, ſeeing we are not very different from <hi>Beaſts,</hi> if we truly differ ſo much from other <hi>Men;</hi> and the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Pride,</hi> deſtroy all the Ideas of our natural <hi>Excellency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beſides all theſe, there's a more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and hidden Fault in <hi>Pride,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all the reſt; for it makes us Uſurp the <hi>Glory</hi> of God himſelf. Our Perfections are Talents, wherewith God intruſted us, to the end we might improve 'em; the Profit reſulting from 'em is the Glory, which ought to be aſcrib'd to him, as being a Rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of his own immenſe Goodneſs: But this unjuſt and ſacrilegious Pride, which robs and pillages all it meets with, has no more Reſpect to Divine, than Humane <hi>Rights:</hi> All the Reverence it has for God is, That it dares not confeſs the Injuries and Wrongs it hath done him; and, that 'tis tormented with ſo great Horrour for its Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crileges, that 'tis afraid to ſhew 'em in open View, or bring in <hi>Reaſon</hi> for its Accomplice and Confederate.</p>
                  <p>It may be gather'd, from what we have here ſaid, that <hi>Pride,</hi> as well as <hi>Corruption,</hi> in general, is almoſt equal, and the ſame in
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:47885:142"/>
all Men: In ſome it does not ſhew it ſelf ſo manifeſt as in others. All are not alike ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous and thoughtful to raiſe themſelves Eſteem and Reputation; becauſe Poverty impoſes upon many Men more preſſing Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations; but all have undoubtedly the ſame Inclination to <hi>Eſteem.</hi> This Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition may indeed ly hid, and the Sentiment of it be ſuſpended; but yet, abſolutely ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'tis alike in all Mankind; or rather, there is no difference, but what is made by <hi>Grace.</hi> Some perhaps will make a greater Appearance or Preſumption than others; but there's no leſs <hi>Pride</hi> in Timidity, and thoſe punctilious Umbrages of One, who is continually afraid, that either himſelf or others, will blemiſh his Character, than in open Preſumption.</p>
                  <p>Some Men ſeem civil and good-natur'd to others; but yet they look to take the upper hand in the way to Glory: Outward Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being, to ſpeak the plain Truth, nothing but an apparent Preference we make of our ſelves before all the World.</p>
                  <p>Again, there be ſome who are Maſters of themſelves, when commended; but not, when they are blam'd. Modeſty holds out againſt the Impreſſions of Flattery, but is diſturb'd, and out of Tune, at the Inſults of Abuſe. Pride makes it ſelf Miſtreſs of its Joy and Satisfaction, but can't command its Grief and Reſentment. Laſtly, There are
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:47885:142"/>
ſome, who ſeem elevated above the reach of of <hi>Eſteem,</hi> and make as if they are troubled at being careſs'd with publick Approbation; but ſearch deeply into the Motives of this Philoſophical Grief, and you'll find that Pride has a very great Hand in 'em. One puffed up with an Opinion of his Merit, thinks many times that Men don't render him his Due: Till all Mankind fall down to him on their Marrow-bones, he'll not leave his ill Humour; and if he be not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd, you'll ſee him a <hi>Myſanthropiſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence, in the laſt place, it appears, that <hi>Pride</hi> lives by the Errour of other Men, and the Illuſions it puts upon it ſelf: It has eſtabliſh'd, I know not what, falſe Maxims in the World, upon which all Men reaſon as upon true and ſolid Principles; by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof it endeavours to promote, and put forward its Pretenſions. Let no Man fancy, that theſe Prejudices can be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by oppoſing 'em directly with <hi>Reaſon</hi>; Men hold faſt theſe Errours, maugre the Dictates of their Judgment, which tell 'em how Irrational they are, becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Diſpoſition of the <hi>Heart.</hi> The ready way to be cur'd, of theſe Cheats, is to moderate the exceſſive Love of <hi>Eſteem,</hi> which reigns in our Heart; and there's no other Means of deſtroying this latter, but by turning the Bent of our <hi>Soul</hi> towards the eternal and infinite <hi>Good,</hi> which is GOD,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:47885:143"/>
the only Source of our <hi>Happineſs</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Summ of the Reflections had to make at preſent, upon our moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ral Inclinations, and Irregularities; wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till I make more particular Diſcoveries in the Knowledge of the <hi>Heart,</hi> which is ſo excellent, ſo important, and ſo worthy our Study and Application. May God, by his <hi>Grace,</hi> Bleſs thoſe I have made in this <hi>Writing;</hi> and make them Succeed to his Glory, and my Eternal Salvation. <hi>Amen.</hi>
