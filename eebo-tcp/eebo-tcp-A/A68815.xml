            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therfore we ought to meditate &amp; ponder the lyfe of Christ wyth excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great studie and desire. For vndoubtedly the doctrine of Christ doth passe all the doctrine of all good men that euer were: and in case a man be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued wyth the spirit of Christ, the same doth finde in his Worde a secret or hidden Manna. Howbeit, it happeneth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many doe therfore conceyue small desire by the often hearing of the Gospel preached, bicause the same are voyde of the spirite of Christ.

féele the repentance of my sinnes within my selfe, than vnderstande after what sorte repentaunce is defined. If thou haue al the scriptures by hart, yea, and all the witty sayings of the Philosophers to, what good do all these without Charitie &amp; the grace of God? Vanitie is vaine, &amp; all things are but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, besides the loue of God and hys only seruice. That (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all is done) is highest wisdome, to go on vnto the Kingdome of Heauen by contemning of the Worlde. It is vanitie for a man to séeke tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitorie riches, and to put his hope in the same: It is vanitie for a man to séeke for honour &amp; promotion, to aduance himself: Vanitie it is to folow the lusts of the flesh, &amp; to couet those things which shall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes cause one grieuously to be punished: Vanitie it is to wishe for long life, &amp; all that whyle to make small accompt of a good life: Vanitie it is to looke vpon the life present onely, &amp; neuer to cast what will come after: Vanitie it is to loue those things which do passe away with in credible swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp; yet not to make haste to that place where ioy doth endure euerlastingly.

All the godly that euer were, haue passed ouer their lyfe in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities and temptacions, and by them haue growen vp vnto vertuous life: and such as haue not béene able well to brooke them, the same haue become Reprobats, and reuolted. There is no calling eyther so holy, or place so solitary, but therein are temptacions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities. To be short, as long as a man ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, he is neuer safe wholy fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> temptacions, bycause the same is in our selues, of which we are tempted, seing we are borne in concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence and lust. Temptacions come vpon temptacions, miseries vpon miseries, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies haue we somwhat that we must be are or suffer. For we haue lost the state of our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie Now, whilst many men do shun temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacions,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18953:21"/>
they fall into more gréeuous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacions. We shall not conquere by running away onely, but by pacience and true mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie shall we be made more strong then our enimies. He which outwardelye declining temptacions onely, doth not pull them vp by the rootes: the same is so farre from profiting and comming forward, that temptacions, do so much the sooner assaile him agayne, and he is by so much in the woorse case againe. By enduring a lyttle and a little, (and that with pacience) thou shalt sooner by Gods helpe get the maystrie, then with sturdinesse and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie. Vse counsell oftentimes in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion. And if another man be tempted, shew <note place="margin">Comfort thafflicted as thou wouldest be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note> not thy selfe rough and rygorous vnto hym, but rather minister him comfort, like as thou thy selfe wouldest haue comfort ministred vnto thée. The originall of all euill tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, is vnconstancie of minde and slender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of fayth or trust in God. For lyke as a shyp without sterne is tossed too and fro with winds, euen so a lose fellow, and one that can but euill kéepe himselfe vnto that which he once determined, is diuersly tempted. <hi>As the fyre maketh triall of yron, so doth temptacion make triall of a man.</hi> We many tymes know not what we are able to doe: but what we
<pb facs="tcp:18953:22"/>
are, temptacion doth make manifest vnto vs. Most of all we must be vigilant or watchfull at the beginning of temptacion. For then is the enimie more easily conquered, if he be not suffered to enter into the doore of the mynde, but be met without the Thresholde by the way, as soone as euer he had knocked.

which wayeth the maners and deserts of men, and dispenseth all thinges before, to the saluation of his elect.

For the lacke of due consideration, and by meanes of our dulnesse we doe not féele the sorowes of our minde in our offences: but many times doe laugh with lightnesse, when rather we had good cause to wéepe, if we did looke well vnto it. There is no true libertie or substantiall ioye in anye thing, sauing in the feare of God ioyned with

Haue chiefely thine eyes alwayes bent vpon thy selfe, and admonishe or warne thy selfe more than all other of thy deare friendes besides are woont. If thou be boyde of the fauour and good will of men, doe not admonishe thy selfe wyth an euill wyll, but rather take it grieuously that thou doest not so wel and circumspectly behaue thy selfe as it becommeth the seruant of God and the person vertuous in déede. It is both more profytable and more safe for a man manye times to haue few comforts in this life, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially worldely: for in that wée eyther haue not, or doe seldome féele such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forts as God doth minister: we our selues are therefore to blame, which neither séeke after the prickes

of conscience, nor yet wholy cast away vaine and outward comforts. Wéete thou wel that thou art not onely vnworthy of diuine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but also worthie of great myserie. If a man be at any time pricked with the true so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of heart, it commeth to passe thereby that the whole worlde is bitter and yrkesome vnto him. The good man findeth sufficient causes to bée sorye and to wéepe or mourne: For whether he consider himself, or else looke vpon an other man, he séeth that no body ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth wythout calamitie in this worlde: and the more déepely be considereth hymselfe, so much the more grieuouslye hoth hée sorrowe. Now, the causes of due sorrow and pricke of conscience are our owne sinnes and vices, in the which we doe so lie weltred and wrapped, that we are seldome times able to behold the heauenly things. If thou wouldest more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes muse vpon thy death, than thinke vpon longnesse of lyfe, there is no doubt but that thou wouldest worke the amendement of thy selfe the more earnestlye. Agayne, if thou wouldest throughly waye in thy minde the tormentes that shall be in hell, gladly I thinke thou wouldest sustaine labour and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, and wouldest not be afearde of any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie and streightnesse applied to thy selfe.

But bicause those things are not suffered to sincke déepely into our mindes, and for that we are yet in loue with flattering shewes of the worlde, it hapneth that we continue styll to remaine colde and slow, many times poore and néedie of the spirite of God, whereby our wretched bodie taketh occasion quickly to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For to lyue bent vnto the earth, is very miserie indéede. The more diuine or heauenlye that euerye man doth couet himselfe to be, so much doth this life become the more vnpleasant vnto him: to wéete, the more he both féeleth and clearly seeth the offences of mans corruption. For to eate, to drinke, to watch, to sléepe, to rest, to traueyle, and to be subiect to all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessities of nature, is vnfainedly great miserie and calamitie to the godlye person,
<pb facs="tcp:18953:35"/>
who coueteth to be set frée and at libertie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all maner of sinne. For grieuously is a man pressed downe with the necessities of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in this lyfe: and therefore doth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet make humble prayer in these wordes to be deliuered from them: <hi>O Lorde, drawe me out of my necessities.</hi> But wretched are they that knowe not their owne miseries: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne more wretched, which do loue this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie and mortall lyfe, which some doe so far embrace (wheras neuerthelesse through their traueyle and carefulnesse they can scant yet get themselues but necessarie thinges) that if they might liue here euermore, they would passe nothing at all on the kingdome of God. O mad braynes and faithlesse persons, who <note place="margin">The ende of carnall things.</note> lie drowned so déepely in the earth, that (lyke wretches) they haue naught else in their mindes but carnall things, and shall once at the length féele, not without torment, howe vile and nothing it is that they haue loued so much. But those good men of God and all the vertuous sort, as many as euer were christs friendes, did not looke vpon those things that did please the fleshe, or that did make a goodly shew for this present tyme, but with all hope and gréedinesse did breath to euerlasting good things, and with their whole heart were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

As yet thou hast tyme and space: why then dost thou put of thy purpose <note place="margin">No time to late, to repent &amp; amende thy life.</note> from day to day? Arise and begin out of hand, and reason thus with thy selfe: nowe is the time to be dooing: now is the time to be figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: now is the time to repent and amende thy life.

Learne now to die to the worlde, that then thou mayst liue with Christ: Learne nowe to contemne all things, that then thou mayst fréely passe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde vnto Christ: Subdue thy body nowe with repentance and amendment of life, that thou mayst haue assured confidence and trust in Christ. Ah foole, wherfore doest thou think that thou shalt liue long, séeing thou hast no warrant for one day here? How many haue béene deceyued, and taken out of the worlde sodainly?

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all things haue an eye to the ende, and after what sort thou shalt stande before that seuere Iudge, from whom nothing is hid who neither is pacified with bribes, nor alloweth vnreasonable excuses, but doth iudge according to vprightnesse and truth. O wretched &amp; foolish art thou, O thou sinfull man: what aunswere wilt thou make vnto almightie God, which knoweth all thy sinnes, who sometimes fearest the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of an angrie man? why doest thou not looke vnto thy self against the day of that iudgement, wherin no body can be excused or defended by his Attorney? For euery man shall haue ynough to aunswere for himselfe. Nowe is thy labor profitable if thou list, now is thy mourning accepted, now may thy sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be harde, and thy repentance pacifie God, and purge thy selfe. And wholy is the pacient man purged after a healthful sort, who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing iniury, is more sory for the wickednesse of an other man, than for the wrong that is
<pb facs="tcp:18953:39"/>
done vnto himselfe, and gladly craueth pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his enimies, and forgyueth them with his hart, and doth not slacke or foreslow the time himselfe to aske forgiuenesse of them: and soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pittieth than is angrie, and oftentymes doth vse violence and compulsion to his owne selfe, and endeuoreth to make his fleshe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye subiect vnto the spirite. Now these things are not to bée dryuen off from time to time, but must be practised in this life, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so quickely. Howbeit, we surely doe deceyue our selues through the inordynate loue of our flesh. I pray you what else shall that fire burne than sinnes? The more thou shalte now fauourably yéelde vnto thy selfe, &amp; shalt obey thy fleshe, so much the more gryeuous punishement shalt thou suffer afterwarde, and so much the more plentifull matter shalt thou heape vp to thy selfe to be burned. For looke in what things euery man hath sinned, in the same shal he be punished againe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the greatnesse of the sinne. There shall the slouthfull be pricked wyth hote bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prickes. There shall the Gluttons be tormented wyth bytter hunger and thyrst. There shall the lecherous and louers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures be bathed in burning Pitch and stinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Brymstone. There shall the enuious
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18953:39"/>
howle out like mad Dogges, and euery vice shall bée punished wyth hys owne torment. There shall the prowd be ouerwhelmed with all reproche and rebuke, &amp; the couetous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons shall be vexed with most my serable née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse. To be shorte: there one houre of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment shall be more tedyous and payne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, than was a long time here in the bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng of our manners. There the wretches haue no rest, no comfort: but here yet is somewhat a pawse of sorrowe, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting of our friendes doth quiet our hearts. Wherefore be carefull now, and be sorie for thy sinnes, that in the day of that iudgement thou mayest safely reioyce wyth the blessed. For then shall the iust stand with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie agaynst those of whome they haue béene vexed and oppressed: Then shall he sit as Iudge, which nowe humblye submyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth hymselfe to the iudgement of menne: Then shall the poore and modest person bée of great fayth and trust, whilest the prowde bée in feare altogyther: Then shall he séeme to haue béene wise in this lyfe, which learned to be a foole and an abiect for Christ his sake. Then shall the remembraunce of miserie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently suffered, be pleasant, when as all the vnrighteous in the meane time shal be mute
<pb facs="tcp:18953:40"/>
and silent: Then shall all the godly reioyce, &amp; all the vngodly shall mourne and sorrowe: Then shall the man that before was vexed, more triumph &amp; reioyce, then if he had béene brought vp in continuall dainties: then shall course apparell glister, and fine garments be dimmed and disgraced: Then shall the poore cottage be more praysed, then is now the gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Pallace: Then shall constant pacience helpe more, then all the power of the world: Then shall simple obedience be more extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, then all the subteltie of men: Then shal a cleane and good conscience more reioyce a man, then learned philosophie: Then shal the contempt of riches be of greater price, then the whole treasure of all the worlde: Then shall godly prayer cause greater comfort vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thée, then the eating of dayntie meates: Then shalt thou more reioyce for kéeping of silence, than for long bablyng: Then thy Godly déedes shall be of more power, than aboundant eloquence: Then shall straight lyfe and austeritie in correctyng of maners be more pleasaunt, than all earthly delectaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore, learne nowe to suffer small trifles, that then thou mayst be able to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the heauier burthens. Examine before in this lyfe, what afterwardes thou
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18953:40"/>
canst well abyde. And in case thou canst not nowe beare so small things, howe shalt thou bée able then to suffer euerlasting torments? And if nowe so little a payne doe make thée impacient, what will Hell fyre then make thee? For surely thou mayest not bée twyse happye or blessed, both to enioye pleasures in thys lyfe, and afterwarde to reygne also wyth Christ in Heauen. And nowe, put case thou hast hytherto lyued in continuall honour and pleasures: what good shoulde all these things haue done thée, if it had chaunced thée to dye out of hande? Doest thou not sée that all thinges are but vaine, beside the loue and the seruice of God onely? For he that loueth God wyth all hys heart, the same feareth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death nor punishment, nor iudgement, nor Hell: bicause perfite loue doth make safe accesse to almightie God. But it is no woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if he feare death and iudgement, which yet taketh delyte in sinne. Notwythstanding it is expedient, if loue doe not yet reclayme thée from euill, that the feare of Hell fyre doe at least wyse brydle thée. But he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth the feare of GOD, the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can not long continue in goodnesse, but runneth quickly into the trappes and snares of the Deuill.</p>

Therfore be feruent to come forward: For thou shalt shortly receiue the rewarde of thy traueyles, neyther shall there be any feare or sorrow afterward with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thy boundes or limits. A little whiles shalt thou now labour and so shalt finde great rest nay rather continuall ioy.

Nourishe inwardly a good hope to obtaine the victorie: but retch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessenesse must be auoided, least thou be blunt and dull, or else doe waxe prowd. There was sometime a certaine man, which carefullye tossed betwéene feare and hope, dyd humbly say thus, whilst he was in praying: <hi>O that I knew certainely that I should perseuere:</hi> And

forthwith he hard this aunswere from <hi>GOD</hi> within himselfe in his owne soule: <hi>And what then if thou diddest know it? Wouldest thou willingly doe it?

Surely they doe most of all other come forward in vertues, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour with their powers to conquere most grieuous things, and such as are most of all contrarye vnto themselues. For euery man doth come forwarde so much the better, and obtaine the more ample grace of god, as that the more he ouercommeth and subdueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb facs="tcp:18953:42"/>
by Gods helpe. But a like power is not in all men to ouercome and mortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: howbeit, the same that shal the more diligently ytch forward this worke, it is euen he that shall be sturdyer or stronger to mooue foorth effectuallye, (though he must beare the mo things paciently) tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other, otherwise well ynough fashioned of nature, &amp; yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what sluggish to vertue. Nowe, two thinges there are chiefly that make much for men to the amendement of themselues: that is, to withdrawe themselues violently from those thinges, vnto which our corrupt nature is prone: and againe, to apply our selues with tooth &amp; nayle vnto that good thing whereof we haue néede. Againe, thou must especially take héede of those thinges, &amp; maister them which doe most of all, and most often mislyke thée in other men. Fynde the meanes that thou mayest take commoditye and aduantage of all things: that in case thou sée before thyne eyes, or heare of any examples of wel dooing, that be kindled and prouoked to doe the lyke. But if thou perceyue any thing worthye dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayse, <note place="margin">we ought to correct our selues and not other?</note> take héede that thy selfe doe not the lyke: or if at anye tyme thou hast so done, quickely endeuor to amende thy selfe. Lyke as thou hast thine eies bent vpon other men,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18953:42"/>
euen so haue other men likewise their eyes bent vppon thée. Howe pleasaunt and swéete a thing is it to beholde zealous and Godlye Christians well nurtured, and obedyent to the dyscipline of Christ? And agayne, howe <note place="margin">we ought to followe our voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> sorrowfull and grieuous a thyng is it to sée men lyuing inordinately, and not exercising those things where vnto they are called? how greatly hurtefull is it to forsake the purpose of thy calling, and to bende thy selfe to those things which are no poynt of thy charge? Be myndfull of thy purpose or profession, and set the remembraunce of Christ crucified before thine eies: &amp; when thou beholdest his lyfe, be ashamed of thy selfe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hast not all thys while shewed thy selfe more diligent in following of Christ his steppes, whereas neuerthelesse thou hast a long time professed a Christian lyfe. Surely, if the Godly person doe practise himselfe attentiuelye and wyth bent studye vppon that most holy lyfe of Iesus, and the torments of his passion, the same shall there plentifully finde all thyngs profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for him: Neyther is it néedefull for him to séeke for anye better thyng beside Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. If Iesus crucified might enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hart, how soone and sufficiently should wée become learned? A feruent and zealous
<pb facs="tcp:18953:43"/>
Christian man doth, and beareth wyth facy, litie that which hée is commaunded: but if the same partly be negligent and but warm, he then is pressed downe with calamities vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon calamities, and is vexed rounde aboute wyth anguishe and sorrowes: bycause hée is both voyde of inwarde comfort, and also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to séeke after the outwarde comfort. And whosoeuer at all doth go out of the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the discipline of Christ, the same is subiect to a gryeuous fall: and hée that sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for a more loose and siacke lyfe, the same is alwayes vexed and tormented, bycause there is euermore somewhat that maye mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke him. Set before thée rather that streight life and full of Godlinesse of those holy Apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Disciples of Christ, and make thy reckening to follow their steps: and as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the good will of God towarde thee, put no doubts but he wll readily graunt strength vnto thee for those thinges. By thys meanes thou shalt become full of strength and hope: By this meanes thou shalt with an heauenly gate so traueyle thyther, that thou mayest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise all worldely things. And would to God we had nothyng else at all to doe and to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vs, but to prayse God wyth our whole heart and mouth, and to doe his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18953:43"/>
Would to God we being frée from all worldly affaires, would care only for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things: for after that man is once come to that point, that he séeketh for comfort of no worldly thing: then at the length it commeth to passe, that GOD doth begin in déede to smatter and sauour vnto him: and that hée taketh all things in good woorth, howsoeuer they fall out: and neyther in prosperitie is puffed vp with gladnesse, nor yet in afflicty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is disgraced with heauinesse, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth himselfe altogither wyth confidence vnto God, which is all in all, vnto whome nothing perisheth or dyeth, but all things doe liue and are obedient at his beck or call, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delay. Looke euer to thine ende, and <note place="margin">Careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and diligence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way to vertue.</note> remember well that lost time shall neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe: thou shalt neuer attaine vnto vertue surely wythout carefulnesse and dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. And if it shall chaunce thée to waxe warme, thou shalt styll be in case woorse and woorse: but if thou wilte applie thy worke wyth a zealous Soule, thou shalt finde perfit peace, and shalt féele thy labour to bée more slight, both for the fauor of God towards thée &amp; also for thyne own loue of vertue. A feruent and diligent man is readye to all thinges. It is greater labor to resist vices &amp; trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

For if thou shalt relygiouslye flye to those healthsome wounds and stripes of Christ, thou shalt féele a great strengthning in thy aduersitie, and shalt not much passe vppon the contempt of men, but shalt with facilitie beare their false and craftie accusations.

the same doth neyther requyre places, nor yet looke after tymes, to practyse hys religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or Godly exercyses.

Why then doubtest thou to take vp

thy Crosse, by the which thou goest to a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Saluacion is in the Crosse: In the Crosse is life: In the Crosse is ayde against thyne enymies: there is infusion of superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall pleasure in the crosse: there is strength of mynde in the Crosse: there is ioye of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite in the Crosse: in the Crosse there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding vertue: in the Crosse there is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Godlinesse.

Whither soeuer thou tourne thy selfe, on which side soeuer thou cast thine eyes thou shalt find no way any where aboue or beneath, neither more high or more safe,

then is the way of the Crosse. Although thou order and fashion al things according to thine owne wyll and iudgement, yet shall it not bée possible but that thou must euermore suffer somethyng eyther willinglye or against thy will, and alwayes incurre the Crosse. For eyther thou shalt féele paine of bodye, or bée tormented wyth griefe of minde. Sometime thou shalt be forsaken of GOD: sometyme thou shalt be exercised of an other man: and (which is more gryeuous) thou shalt be tedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and yrkesome vnto thine owne selfe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times: and that so farre, that thou mayest be deliuered by no remedie or comfort, but that thou must pacientlye beare the same so long as it is Gods will and pleasure that it shall so be. For God will haue thée learne to suffer miserie without comfort, and to submit thy selfe wholy vnto him, that thou mayest become the more modest in calamitie. No man féeleth the passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ so much in his hart, as he vnto whome it chaunceth to suffer the like thinges. Therefore the Crosse is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ready, &amp; tarieth for thée euery where, neyther canst thou escape it whether soeuer thou runne. For whether soeuer thou go, thou caryest thy selfe with thée, and shalt alwayes finde thy selfe. Turne thy selfe vpward, turne
<pb facs="tcp:18953:61"/>
thy selfe downeward, turne thy self outward, turne thy selfe inwarde, thou shalt finde the Crosse any maner of way: and necessary it is that at all times thou keepe pacience, if thou wilt enioy peace of minde, and obtaine a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall Crowne. If thou wilt wyllinglye beare the Crosse, the same shall likewyse beare and stay thée, and shal bryng thée to the desired ende: namely, whereas there shall be an ende of suffering, which ende vndoubtedly shall not be in this life. If thou shalt beare it against thy wyll, thou shalte cause a burthen vnto thy selfe, and shalte agréeue and waye down thy selfe the more, and yet must néedes beare it for all that. If thou shalt cast awaye one Crosse, thou shalt surely incurre another and the same perhaps more heauy. Dost thou hope that thou shalt escape that, which no man liuing could euer decline or turne from? Which of the Godly men in the worlde hath there euer béene without his Crosse and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? Our Lorde Iesus Christ was not an houre voyde of sorrowe and torment, so long as he lyued in this worlde.

The whole life of Christ was a crosse

Thou wandrest out of the way, thou wandrest out of the way, I say, if thou séeke any other meane then the pacient suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of calamities: bicause thys mortall lyfe of ours is altogither full of miseries, and hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged round about with Crosses: and the more euery man hath profited in godlinesse, into so much the more gréeuous Crosses doth he fal, namely when the paine of calamity doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the more through loue. And yet doth not this man of whome I talke, being pressed with so manifolde calamities, lacke the ease of comfort, for asmuch as he also féeleth that hée taketh plentifull commoditie and friut by thys Crosse. For whilst that he submitteth himselfe of hys owne accorde vnto the crosse, it happeneth that the whole burthen of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie is tourned into the trust of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: and the more the fleshe is ouertourned with calamitie, so much the more is the spirit strengthened wyth the comfort of the soule. And so much is he sometime confirmed in the féele of calamitie and aduersitie (to great is the loue of the similitude of Christ his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,) that he wisheth not to be voide of sorrow and misery, bicause he beléeueth that he shall be so much the more accepted of God, the mo

and the more grieuous things that he can pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently beare for his sake. Neyther doth that thing chaunce by mans vertue and power, but through the benefit of Christ, which can doe so much, and bringeth so much to passe in our fraile flesh, that the thing which man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallye doth alwayes abhorre and flye, the same yet he attempteth and loueth through the feruentcy of the spirite. It is not in mans reach to beare the Crosse, to loue the Crosse, to tame and subdue the body, to flye from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, willyngly to take reproches and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spites, to despise himselfe, and to wishe to bée despised, paciently to suffer al aduersities and losses, and to desire no maner of prosperitie in this worlde. None of all these things canst thou doe of thy selfe, if thou shalt depende vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thy selfe: but if thou shalt put thy trust in the Lorde, strength shall bée giuen thée from Heauen: and the worlde, and the fleshe shall be subdued vnto thy rule and dominion. Nay, thou shalt not feare the enimitie of the Deuill neyther, if thou be armed with fayth, and marked with the Crosse of Iesus.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, though few be willing to suffer. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is great cause why thou shouldest be willing to suffer a litle for Christ his sake, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou sufferest much more paineful things to compasse the worlde. And wote thou well this, that thou must liue by dying vnto thy self, and the more that euery man doth dye vnto himself, so much the more doth the same waxe aliue vnto God. No man is apt or fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende heauenly things, but he which shall submit himselfe to beare aduersitie for Christ his sake. Finally, nothing is either more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18953:63"/>
vnto God, or more healthfull vnto thy selfe in this life tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> willingly to suffer for Christ: in so much that if thou be put to thy choyse, thou oughtest to desire rather to suffer aduersitie for Christ, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be refreshed with many comfortes.

It looketh not vppon hys gyftes, but turneth it selfe vnto the gyuer aboue all good gyftes. Loue canne not tell howe to kéepe measure, but is feruente beyonde all measure. Loue féeleth no burthen, passeth nothing vpon paines, endeuoreth aboue hir strength, nothyng at all waying whether the same bee possible to bée done or not, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as it thinketh nothyng to harde for it selfe, nothing vnlawefull.

doth not slumber: laboring is not wearyed: pressed downe, is not oppressed: made afeard, is not troubled: but (like as the liuely flame and burning torch) doth couet out vpwarde, and doth pierce thorowe safely. If any man doe loue, he knoweth what this saying mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. The very ardent affection of the soule is a great cry in the eares of the Lord, whilst it sayth thus: O my God, O my loue, thou art wholy mine, and I am thyne altogyther. Bring forth in mée a plentifull loue, that I maye learne with the inwarde mouth of my hcart to taste howe swéete and pleasaunt a thing it is to loue, and as it were being mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to swim in loue.

Loue is swift, sincere, godly, delectable and pleasant,
<pb facs="tcp:18953:71"/>
strong, pacient, faithful, wise, long suffering, manlike, and neuer applying it selfe to hyr owne commoditie. For when a man is giuen to himselfe, then doth loue fall away.

For many if it be not so well with them as they woulde haue it, doe become forthwith impacient or sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. It is not alwaies in the power of man to rule and gouerne his owne matters: but it belongeth to God, both to giue &amp; to comfort, both when he will, and howe much he wyll, and whome he will, and that alwaies as it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him best.

Therefore it is better to haue little wit with modesty, and slender vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of things, then for his abundant knowledge to stand to much in his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyt.

Now, if thou wilt plead, that thou art not able to beare or suffer so manye things, how then shalt thou be able to abyde the euerlasting torment of Hell fire?

<pb facs="tcp:18953:80"/>
none? Thou shalt well finde, that euen those that are most delicate and fine, are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their incommodities. Thou wilt say per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture: but these worldlings are incyted with many pleasures, and obeye their owne will or sensualitie: and therefore make little account of their miseries. Put case al things happen vnto them as their heart would haue it: how long will that indure and abide, trow yée? Forsooth, those shall perishe like dung, which in this life haue such wealth and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce, in such wise, as no maner of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of ioyes passed shall remaine. Nay, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen while they be aliue to, they doe not enioy them without bitternesse and griefe, &amp; feare. For looke of what things they doe take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, of the very same manye times they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue sorrow: and reason good they shoulde so doe: that they which intemperately hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleasures, shoulde likewise attaine vnto the same not without tartnesse and trouble.

Wherfore, sonne,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18953:80"/>
doe not thou follow the sensuall desires, but turne thy wil away from them. Be delighted in the Lorde, and so shall he graunt thée the requestes of thy soule. For if thou wilt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in déede, and haue large and plentifull comfort of me: Wéete thou that felicitie and the ample rewarde of comfort doth consist in thy renouncing of all worldly things, and of these féeble and weake pleasures: and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou shalt pull thy selfe from all solace of humaine thinges, so much the more sweete, and the greater comfort shalt thou finde in mée. But in déede thou shalte not attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those comforts without sorowfulnesse and labour of fighting. For rooted custome doth stande against it: howbeit shée shall be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and maystred, with better custome. The fleshe will mutter against it: Howbeit shée shall be bridled with the feruentsye of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.

(Wherin surely thou diddest most of al do the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of thy father) méete &amp; reason it is, that I wretch and sinful man should shew my self pacient according vnto thy will, and shoulde beare the burthen of this mortall lyfe for my soule health sake, so long as thou wilt haue it so. For though this present life be left burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, yet hath it béene made alreadye more

light by thy benefite, and both by thy example more tollerable and famous vnto the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and also by the footesteps of thy saints: yea much more full of comfort also, then it was once in the olde Law, when both heauen gate did continue shut, and the way did séeme somewhat hard to finde, &amp; so fewe did passe to séeke for the kingdome of heauen: Nay, also euen those which then were iustified and in the state of saluation, could not enter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdom of Heauen before thy passion and the merite of thy precious death: How great thanks am I bound to render vnto thée, in that thou hast vouchsafed to shew the straight and good way to thy euerlasting kingdome, both to me, and to all them that put their trust in thée? For thy way is our way, and through godly paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doe we earnestly traueyle to come vnto thée our crowne and rewarder, who vnlesse thou hadst gone before vs, and haddest taught vs, what man woulde haue passed to follow? How many woulde not only haue bidden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, but also a great way off, except they had behelde and looked vpon these thy notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. Lo, if when we haue heard so many of thy miracles and commaundements, &amp; yet are but warme, howe woulde it be then if wee had not so great light to followe thée?</p>

For the better that thou shalt setle thy selfe to be pacient, both by so much shalt thou deale the more wisly in the matter, and shalt deserue the greter things, and shalt more easily beare thy case, as one not slouthfully framed readie in minde &amp; vse

therevnto. Neither shalt thou thus say to thy self: I neither am able, nor ought to bere this thing at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mans hands. For he hath both done me a great displeasure or hurt, &amp; slaundereth me with other things that I neuer thought. In déede I can be content to beare that at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans hands, that I shal sée good to be borne. This is the thought of foolishnesse, it neyther considereth the vertue of pacience, nor yet of whome it must be crowned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, but rather wayeth the persons, &amp; the wrongs done vnto it. He is not truly pacient, <note place="margin">He is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that suffereth al thinges of all men.</note> that will suffer but as much as he list, and of whome he listeth: but the man that is pacient in déede, maketh no account of whome hée is vexed and troubled, whether he be his better, his equall, or his inferior: whether he be good and godly, or else peruerse and wicked: Nay, whatsoeuer aduersity is done vnto him of any man liuing, looke how much, and how often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times soeuer the same be done, he receyueth the same thankfully as it were from Gods hands, &amp; reckneth it for gaine: bicause nothing is so great or so smal, if a man suffer the same for Gods sake, but that it deserueth reward. Wherfore be thou in a readinesse to battaile, if thou wilt obtaine the victory. Surely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fighting, thou shalt neuer get the crowne

of pacience. Now, if thou wilt not suffer, thou refusest to be crowned, but if thou desire to be crowned, striue like a man, &amp; beare the fight paciently.

thée, till that thou espie me to be the same that doe deliuer those men out of troubles, which haue put their trust in me, out of whom, there is no helpe neither substantiall, nor counsell profitable, nor remedy durable. But now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king courage vnto thée againe after the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, be whole &amp; strong in the light of my mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. For I am at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (saith the Lord) to restore all thinges, not onely to as good case as they were at the first, but also to renue them plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully with the better. Is there any thing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer harde for me to doe? Or am I like vnto them, which do not performe theyr promises? Where is thy faith? Stande stedfastly &amp; with perseuerance, shew thy selfe a man parient &amp; valiant. Comfort will be with thée in his due time: Looke after, looke after me, I say: I wil come &amp; I will cure thée. It is temptacion that doth vexe thée, and vaine carefulnesse which doth make thée afeard: What good doth care of the chaunces to come, but that thou mayest heape sorrowe vpon sorrow? <hi>The euill of the day present is sufficient for it selfe:</hi> vaine and vnprofitable it is, either to be troubled or to reioyce about things to come: which percha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce shall neuer happen. But it is mans fashion to be deluded with such imaginations, and it is the token as yet of a base courage, so soone to
<pb facs="tcp:18953:101"/>
be drowned with the intisment of the enimy. Hee forceth nothing at al whether hée delude and deceiue with true things or false things, &amp; whether he giue a man a foile with the loue of present things, or with the feare of things to come. Wherefore, be not troubled in thy minde, or faint harted: beléeue me, &amp; put thy <note place="margin">Wée must stande sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastlye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptacions of the deuil wyth a strong faith in God.</note> trust and affiance in my mercy. I am many times harde by thée, when thou thinkest that I am a great way off: &amp; when thou supposest that thou hast lost altogither, euen then many times is greater gaine so much the more néere at hand. All things are not therfore lost though the matter fall quite contrary to thy desire. Thou oughtest not to iudge of the féele of present miseries, nor when calamitie doth arise from some place, so to be mooued &amp; nyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the heade withall, as though al hope of escape were taken away. Doe not think thy selfe altogither forsaken, if at any time I ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue sent thée calamitie for a season, or yet haue withdrawne my desired comfort fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thée. For thus doe men go on to the kingdom of heauen: &amp; surely, this is more for thy profit, &amp; for the profite of al other of my serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: that ye should be excited and quickned with aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, than if all things shoulde happen vnto you according to your hearts desire. I am so
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18953:101"/>
well acquainted with the secret thoughts of the heart, that I know it to make very much for thy saluation, that sometime thou he left in <note place="margin">God the highest phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sition sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no kinde of troubles, but such as bringeth saluation.</note> heauinesse, least perhaps, being prowde with prosperous successe, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> shouldest therby thinke thy selfe that which thou art not. I am able to take away that which I haue giuen: &amp; I can restore the same againe when me listeth. If I haue giuen it, it is mine owne. If I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it away, I haue not taken away thine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euery good &amp; perfite gift is my gift. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if at any time I sende thée some euil and aduersitie, grutch not therat, nor dispaire: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen I the same am able to ease thée quickly, &amp; to turne all thy heauinesse into ioy. But in that I deale so with thée, I am iust, and much to be commended. And if thou be wise, and do rightly consider this my deede, thou shalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with such faintnesse be sorie for aduersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but rather reioyce, and giue me thanks: Nay, thou shalt iudge that this aboue al other thinges is to be reioyced at, that I afflicting thée with sorrowes, doe nothing at all spare thée. As the father loued me euen so loue I you, sayde I to my most deare Disciples, whom I sent not: I tell thée, to perishing and transitory ioyes, but to great fights: Not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to honours, but vnto infamie &amp; slaunder: Not

thée, and instructed of thée wythin my minde, I am made altogither warme and dissolute.

But I being more prone to reuolting then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forward, doe neuer continue still in one state, bicause I am subiect to the alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of time.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if while I either desire the godlynesse of minde, or am mooued vpon some necessity to séeke for thée (when there is no body to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me) I could skill to cast al humaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, surely I might rightly hope well of thy fauor, &amp; looke for a new gift of comfort with ioy and gladnesse. Finally, it is thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite whatsoeuer doth happen well vnto me at any time. I am vaine &amp; a wretched man, of no regarde in thy sight, vnconstant &amp; weake.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18953:111"/>
shall boast but of nothing, and as for that, it is most vane. Ambition is in déede a most pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and most vaine thing, which draweth a man away from true glory, &amp; spoyleth him of heauenly fauor. For whilst a man standeth in <note place="margin">Ambition is a most pernicious thing to mans sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> his owne conceit, he displeaseth thée: whilst he gapeth after mans praises, he is depriued of true vertues. But true glory &amp; holy reioyce is to boast of thée, and not of himself, &amp; to reioice in thy name, and not for his owne vertue, or to be delighted with any thing sauing onelye for thy sake. Therefore, let thy name, and not mine be praysed: Let thy work, and not mine be extolled. Let that holy name of thine be so praised, that I may haue no prayse of men at all. Of thée will I boast gladly for euermore. Of my selfe will I boast nothing, sauing of mine owne infirmities. Let the Iewes desire mutuall glory betwéene themselues: I will study for that which doth only make for God.

Desire not so much, as to search or dispute about the merits of the saints and Godly, who shall bée more holy or greater then other in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. For these things doe manye times cause vnprofitable debates &amp; contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: doe also mainetaine pride and ambicion, whereof aryseth enuyinges and dissentions, whilest one stryueth prowdly that an other is holier than the rest. The desire to learne these things, &amp; the searching of them out are fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse: Nay rather doe displease the godly sort. For I am not God of dissension, but of peace, which peace consisteth in true modestty, and lowlinesse, not in arrogancy and pryd. Some for the affection of loue doe cast more fauour vnto these, then to those: but they do it rather vpon their carnall affection, then that God is so affected. I am he that haue created all the saints, that haue endued the same wyth gifts, &amp; haue giuen them honor: I know the merites of euery man: I prouoked them with moste pleasant gifts and benefits: I knew that they were to be loued, before the beginning of the worlde: I did choose them out of the worlde, &amp;

For they are al but one in the bonde of loue, thinking all one thing, willing all one thing, &amp; also louing al one another w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mutuall loue, Nay rather (which is a much more high matter) they more loue me than themselues, &amp; their owne merits.

Therfore, let the carnall &amp; sensuall men leaue of to reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> about the state of the saints, which knowe not to do ought else but to loue their priuat ioies. Many as yet by their naturall affection and worldly loue, are bent to these or to those: and euen as their iudgement is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inferior things, so doe they likewise imagine of the heauenly things. Without doubt it cannot be vttered in words in how great vnlikelynesse in those things do differ the one from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, which the vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit men do think with themselues, &amp; which the men that by God are lightned, doe behold as made open vnto them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue.

Besides this, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle doth much lesse speak of that gladnesse which the Couetous world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hath of his ryches and hourdyng vp of money: the Ambicious man of honours: the Prowde and hawtie person of his Nobilitie: his power and sway, his wealth &amp; puissaunce the Souldier of his praye and bootie: the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous man of his swéete delyghtes and sensuall pleasures: the Lecher of his lustes: the Vserer of his bonds or billes of debt: the Kiotour and one plunged in all kind of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluitie and excesse in his delectacions of all sortes, in his tables garnished and set forth with diuers dishes, his gorgious and verye great furniture: the Surfettour in hys gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in of Wyne: the Glutton and one borne to bellycheare, in gourmandise: the Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard or lazie lubber in ydlenesse and sléepe:
<pb facs="tcp:18953:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Enuious or spitefull repiner in an other mans misery: the Testie and wrathfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in reuenge. These are ioyes indéede, I deny not: <hi>but they are the lewde ioyes of the minde,</hi> as a ryght excellent Poet sayth: and they are not true but deceytefull, not pure and cleare, but mingled with vnpleasantnesse among: not permanent, but such as last for <note n="†" place="margin">The time of our life compared to eternitie is not a moment: <hi>quia infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti &amp; infiniti nulla est porportio.</hi>
                     </note> a moment. For I will not meddle now to shew that they are the cause of infinite mischiefes, and most an ende alwayes drawe with them as their companions, anguishes of bodie and minde, disquietnesse, restlesse businesse, cares, heauinesse, mourninges, and doe both excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly annoy the body, and also without ende pricke the soule, &amp; suffer it not to pause &amp; take rest or comfort fréely: so farre they are from bringing about any maner of way, eyther to diminishe heauinesse that by chaunce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of other causes, or to rid them quite, and dryue them away: or else to worke, that men shall haue no féele and payne at all of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils that do betide them. Beside this also, the ende of such ioyes is euerlasting damnation. For vnto this point belongeth the saying of our sauiour in <hi>Luke</hi> the Euangelist: <hi>Wo bee to you riche men, which haue your comfort. Wo be vnto you that are ful bicause ye shal be
<pb facs="tcp:18953:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hungry. Wo be to you that laugh nowe, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ye shall mourne &amp; weepe.</hi> And likewile, which that rich man in the Gospell, determy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng in hys heart to liue a deintie and happy life henceforth, &amp; being minded nowe to take his case, to eate, drinke and to be merye, doth heare at the worde and will of God: <hi>Thou foole, this night shal they fetch thy soule from thee.</hi> To conclude, that example of the Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in <hi>Luke,</hi> clad in purple, doth make to this purpose, who vsing euery day to féede gorgy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, is afterwarde, when he departeth the worlde, tormented in the flames of Hell fire. Therfore <hi>Paule</hi> doth not entreat of such ioyes as the welthy, the mighty, the loftie &amp; prowd, and such other as lyue dainetily in this lyfe, and are wanton, and doe styll, as a man woulde say, kéepe it holydaye, as S. Iames speaketh it, haue. Of what kinde of ioy then speaketh hée? Euen of that ioye, no doubt, which of the same <hi>Paule</hi> is rehearsed vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the fruites of the spirite in the Epistle to the <hi>Galathians:</hi> and such agayne as that is, wherevnto the Apostle exhorteth the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> when he biddeth them to reioyce in the Lorde alwayes: or such likewise as that is whereof Dauid in the Psalmist hath so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes made mention, as when he sayth:
<pb facs="tcp:18953:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Thou hast giuen ioy in my heart.</hi> And, <hi>Let all men reioyce that put their hope in thee, let them triumph or reioyce exceedinglye euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, bicause thou doest defende them. Let all men be glad in thee, which loue thy name, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou blessest the iust man, O Lord.</hi> And likewise, <hi>I will be glad and reioyce exceding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in thee, I will sing vnto thy name, O thou most high.</hi> And: <hi>I doe put my confidence and hope in thy mercy, my heart leapeth for ioy in thy sauing health: I will sing vnto the Lorde, who giueth good things vnto me.</hi> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer: <hi>Reioyce in the Lorde, &amp; triumph ye iust, and glory all yee that be right of heart.</hi> And againe: <hi>Triumph ye iust in the Lorde, prayse becommeth the right.</hi> And furthermore: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce ye iust in the Lorde, and confesse to the memorie of his holynesse.</hi> What maner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce this is, in the Lorde, it is a verye harde matter to declare, and a thing that will busie a man to doe it. Howbeit through the helpe of God we will proue what we can say therein.</p>
                  <p>Therefore whosoeuer being regenerate or borne a newe in Christ, doth put the whole hope and affiaunce of attaining saluation in the promised mercy of God, onely for Christ the mediatour, and already is fully and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswaded, that God the father is mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:18953:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and pacyfied wyth him, his sinnes being remitted and forgiuen for Christ, and with a certaine and sure hope of immortalitie after this life and of euerlasting blesse, doth walke on in his vocation to the ende honestly, holily and godlily, the selfesame man vndoubtedlye resting vpon this same fatherly good wil and and loue of God towarde him for Christ, doth <note place="margin">who it is that alway reioiceth in the Lorde.</note> alway reioyce in the Lord, neither can there any thing of so great importance at any time happen among, that can vexe that man, and cause him to take thought. So excéeding great is that spirituall ioye or gladnesse of the godly person in the Lorde, whether it bée in prosperitie, or whether it be in aduersitie. For whatsoeuer it be that hath happened, he in all things perceyueth and acknowledgeth the fatherly minde of God toward him, and no lesse is glad in the Lorde in times of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, than in prosperous times. For he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth wel inough, that what euil so euer there be, the same is sent from God, and that wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods prouidence there hapneth nothing at all. Therefore will he haue his owne wyll to agrée and be conformable vnto the wyll of God: and he refuseth not to beare pacientlye &amp; suffer whatsoeuer it pleaseth God he shall: and he taketh in very good part what so euer
<pb facs="tcp:18953:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath happened. He knoweth that all thynges doe turne vnto good, to such as be Godly and feare the Lord. He knoweth that those are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued, corrected, and chastised, whome the Lorde loueth. He knoweth that euery sonne is scourged of the Lord whome he receyueth. He knoweth that he is touched with such vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, to the ende he shoulde repent &amp; amend, that he shoulde make his inuocation &amp; prayer vnto God the more feruentlie, that he should despise wordly things vtterly, and trauaile to the heauenly things with the greater desires and sighes. He knoweth that the Godly are tried with aduersitie, as gold is with the fire: and that the same is giuen of God, as it were for a matter to kéepe his obedience in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise. He knoweth that the affliction that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth but a moment, and is but light, doth worke in vs a glory that is euerlasting, and more heauy than al poise or weight, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith: &amp; that the troubles of this present worlde are not worthy to be compared with that glory that shall be reuealed towarde vs. Therefore he reioyceth, euen in the middest of his calamities and afflictions, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the goodnesse of God, being mery and chearefull, he giueth the Lorde thanks for all things. Euen thus forsooth <hi>Paule,</hi> the blessed
<pb facs="tcp:18953:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Apostle of God reioiceth alwaies in the Lord in so many vexations, trauailes, aduersities, so many miseries, so huge euilles, as he paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently beareth for the Gospels sake. <hi>Euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this time (sayth he) we are both a hungry &amp; a thirst, and are naked, and are beaten or buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with fistes, and doe go vp and down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any certaine dwelling place, &amp; doe labour working with our owne hands: being reuiled, yet we blesse: being euill spoken of, yet wee praye: wee are become as one woulde saye, the excrements of the worlde, being the refuse of all things, euen vnto this daye.</hi> The same <hi>Paule</hi> saith: <hi>Now I reioyce ouer my afflictions for you, and I supply that which was wanting of Christes afflictions in mine owne fleshe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostle also in another place doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this same ioy of his: <hi>Blessed</hi> (saith he) <hi>be God and the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, who is the father of mercies, and God of al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forting vs in al our affliction, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that we may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort them that are in any kind of affliction, through the comfort wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God doth comfort vs &amp;c.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose maketh that place: <hi>As it were sorrowing &amp; yet alwayes reioycing: as it were poore, and yet making many rich: as hauing nothing, and yet possessing all thinges:</hi> And againe, <hi>I was
<pb facs="tcp:18953:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
filled with comfort, I am full and abound ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedingly with ioy in al our afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> The same <hi>Paule</hi> writing to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> sayth: <hi>You also haue become followers of vs, and of the Lorde, receyuing the worde with much afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with ioy of the holy ghost, in so much as ye haue beene an example to all the beleeuers in Macedonia &amp; Achaia.</hi> Séest thou here how with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affliction of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> he knit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the spirituall gladnesse of the same. And to this belongeth that which is in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrues:</hi> whereas it doth testifie that the beléeuers at Hierusalem did heare tell of the spoyle of their goods with ioy or gladnes, And now how great cherefulnesse, how great gladnesse, how great boasting in the Lord do we take at <hi>Paules</hi> wordes: whilest he recke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vp his trauailes, stripes, prisonments, stonings, shipwrackes, watchinges, hunger, thirst, colde, nakednesse, finallye infinite perilles, often deathes. And whiles at the ende he addeth. <hi>Wherefore I please my selfe</hi> (sayth he) <hi>in infirmities, in reprochful words, in necessities, in persecutions, in anxieties for Christ. For when I am weake, then am I strong.</hi> Likewise our Sauiour Christ himselfe also biddeth them to reioyce and excéedingly to be gladde, whosoeuer for the Gospels sake, and
<pb facs="tcp:18953:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for the confessing of his name are afflicted. And why so, I praye you. <hi>Bicause (sayth hee) your rewarde is plenteous in heauen.</hi> Herevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on also Apostles being beaten y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> (as it is in s. <hi>Luke</hi> in the Actes) what doe they. <hi>They went (quoth he) reioycing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sight of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle, for that they were accounted worthy to suffer Contumelie for the name of Iesu.</hi> Hence commeth that excéeding great triumph of the Martyrs in their extréeme passions and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which was not a token of any despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate fiercenesse in the minde, or lacke of féele in the bodye, but of the vertue and power of Christ dwelling wythin them, as <hi>Paule</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it. Howbeit, some man will saye, it is a swéete thing, and full of comfort to suffer for Christ his sake, so that a man may well haue cause to reioice at such a tyme. But what? Is it possible for any man to reioyce in these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities and miseries, which doe happen to vs for some other cause? To answere the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter briefly and in few words: The very true christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man in the common &amp; vsual troubles of this life, in sorowe, sickenesse, weakenesse of the bodye, in banishment, néede, pouerty, mourning, losse of children, losse of dignity, in the perils &amp; trauailes of all sortes, mens wronges, infortunate successe in counsales,
<pb facs="tcp:18953:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
losses and detriments of thyngs, if wée wyll iudge thereof aright, doth alwaye reioyce in the Lorde, and that sincerely without doubt, and euen from the very bottome of his heart. For when he knoweth for certayntie by thé doctrine of the Gospell, that God is fauoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; well pleased with him for Christes sake, when he knoweth that his sinnes be forgiuen him through Christ, when he knoweth that he is reconciled vnto God, adopted or chosen to be the sonne of God, and that the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of life euerlasting is promised him: with this same onely thing he is in such wise deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghted, and hereof taketh so much most true pleasantnesse, so much ioy and gladnesse, that whatsoeuer calamitie doth happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this life, it is quickly ouerwhelmed with the excéeding greatnesse of this same ioy, and doth scarslye séeme to be any thing at all, in so much that if the worlde being dissolued, might fall vpon him, as a certayne Poet writeth, yet shoulde the weight of it slaye him being no whit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fearde therof. For so far it is from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten or godly man to feare, to quake or trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and abhorre euen death it selfe, or not to reioyce thereat as oft as it comes to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, that rather he wisheth for it with all his hart: which onely he is perswaded not to
<pb facs="tcp:18953:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bée the end of lyfe, but the beginning of euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting blisse, not continuall destruction, but a short passage out of this worlde vnto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore he desireth both to be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the Apostle, and with <hi>Simeon</hi> to bée dimissed in peace. So excéeding great is the ioy in the heart of the godly man, through the knowledge of God, and of hys sonne Iesu Christ. Hath he by some mishap lost his goods or children? He cryeth with <hi>Iob: The Lorde hath giuen, and the Lorde hath taken awaye: blessed be the name of the Lorde.</hi> Is he kept vnder with pouertie and néede? He aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himselfe out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostle: <hi>Hauing foode and wherewith to be couered, let vs content our selues with the same.</hi> Is he taunted or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp without his desert? He remembreth Christ, who being rayled at, did not reply e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill for euill agayne, as saint <hi>Peter</hi> sayeth. Doth he receyue some grieuous &amp; notorious iniurie? He remembreth that saying of <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Romaines. Not reuenging your owne quarrels, beloued.</hi> And agayne: <hi>Leaue reuenge vnto mee, and I will requite, sayth the Lorde.</hi> Is he afflicted with intollerable tormentes of some disease or sickenesse, or with some other euilles? He cryeth with <hi>Dauid: Thou art iust, O Lord, and thy iudgement is right.</hi> Is he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
<pb facs="tcp:18953:149"/>
of his acquaintance or friends? He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to remembraunce that saying out of the Psalmes. <hi>My father and my mother haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken mee: but yet the Lorde hath receyued me.</hi> Briefly in all troubles, miseries and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, the godly man hath verye great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortes set before him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> frée goodnesse, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and clemencie of God, and from hence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way hath vnspeakable ioy, doth aske in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, looke for the mitigation or asswaging of them, or if it shall so please God, full deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce from those euils wherwith he is laden and kept downe. He knoweth that God both hath commaunded himselfe to be prayed vnto in the tyme of trouble and calamitie, and that he hath promysed his aide and helpe, and that also he looketh for a thankefull hart of such as are deliuered. Trusting vnto these things, he cryeth with Abacuch: <hi>O Lorde in thy wrath remember thy mercy.</hi> And with Hieremye: <hi>Correct vs, O Lorde, but in thy iudgement, &amp; not in thy furie.</hi> And thus in very good hope of the goodnesse of God, he reioyceth woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and doth not onely betake himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods mercy, but also yéeldeth himself vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods will, as one ready both to doe, &amp; also to suffer whatsoeuer God will haue him.</p>
                  <p>But as the trust of Gods mercy for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
<pb facs="tcp:18953:149"/>
sake cannot stand or ioyne togither with a naughtie and corrupt conscience: so cannot that ioy neither, wherof the Apostle speaketh, be at any tyme remayning in a minde guilty of fault or sinne. Therfore wheresoeuer there is a bent determination or purpose to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte sinne, there is there no maner of ioy at all in the Lorde. And truely is that sayde of <hi>Plautus</hi> the Comicall Poet: <hi>There is</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>nothing more wretched and miserable, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is an euill conscience.</hi> Hereby it is plaine, that the Apostles admonition or warning, euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to reioyce in the Lorde, doth belong on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to the godly sorte, which with feare and trembling doe trauayle to their saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For these men, bycause they put all their trust in Gods mercy, &amp; are fully perswaded that God is fauorable and pleased with them for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes sake, and that not onelye their sinnes are forgiuen and remitted them of the: heauenly father, but that they also are receiued into the fauour and friendship of God, and that more is, into kinred and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sanguinitie, &amp; are made the sonnes of God by adoption, the heyres, I saye of God, and the bretherne and fellowe heires with Christ: bycause the godlye, I say, doe stedfastly beléeue, they doe alway re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the Lorde, euen in the midst of their
<pb facs="tcp:18953:150"/>
troubles and calamities, what euer they be that chance, eyther common or priuate, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially séeing they are not ignorant, that God hath a care ouer them, as Saint Peter doth witnesse. This reioyce in the Lorde séemeth to be the chiefest portion of felicitie and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynesse in this lyfe, &amp; the very chiefe or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall goodnesse which the godly sort alone do <note place="margin">

For of what sort that is, the onely Christians, being taught by Gods worde, doe know: and those especially which are ordayned (as <hi>Luke</hi> saith) to euerlasting life, &amp; whose names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the booke of lyfe of the Lambe, which was slayne from the beginning of the world, as it is sayd in the <hi>Apocalips.</hi> For whyle these doe alway reioyce in the Lorde, they haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in this mortall lyfe also a certayne taste, féeling &amp; smacke of the blessed state that shall be in the life to come, whereby it happeneth, that they being rauished as it were besides themselues, do séeme in a maner to the world through euermuch ioye, to be pieuish or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike: to wéete, whyle they be mute at
<pb facs="tcp:18953:150"/>
the reprochfull checkes and taunts of other men, doe pray for them that curse them, doe <note place="margin">Here is not ment such fonde paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as. S. Fraunces vsed.</note> loue and beare good will to their enymies, whyles they doe good to them that hate them, pray for them that hurt and persecute them: to such as strike one side, offer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other: whiles to one taking away the cloake they leaue him their coate also: and giue to euerye one that asketh: and lende to one another, hoping for no commoditie therby: whyles many times they refrayne from wine, doe fast, sigh, are sory, wéepe, continue all night in prayer, by lying on the grounde, by watch, by studie and by other meanes doe tame their flesh, and doe kepe their body occupyed after, a seruile sort, as the Apostle sayeth: and who can well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse or recken vp all the other tokens of a certayne foolishnesse, as it were, or brayne sickenesse in them? For the worlde can not iudge otherwyse of such men, but that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither are besides themselues, and out of their right wittes that thus demeane them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. And surely it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be denyed, but that such men they are most commonly, that doe alwaye reioyce in the Lorde. The same doe neither desire riches, nor séeke for honors and promotions, nor folow pleasures. They neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their owne commodities, they procure
<pb facs="tcp:18953:151"/>
the commodities of other men: being in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner lesse carefull for themselues, than for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. They embrace modestie for stoutnesse: basenesse or ignobilitie for glorie: austeritie of life for dainties. They despise those things that the worlde setteth great store by: and set great store by that which it despiseth, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no accompt off. They in maner giue all that euer they haue to the poore, &amp; that which is giuen to the poore, they thinke it giuen to Christ himselfe. Such are they therfore, that reioyce alway in the Lorde. And in déede, by the iudgement of the worlde, as I haue sayd, they séeme almost foolish, whyles they so doe: but if thou behold the iudgement of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his worde, thou shalt finde that they alone are the wysest of all other men. The thoughts of such me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are alway, not on earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but heauenly things: not vpon temporall things, but on things euerlasting: not vpon humaine affaires, but about Gods hestes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements. For out of these doth arise that continuall ioye in the Lorde. Therefore whyle other men are tormented with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cares of this lyfe, they doe swéetely solace themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues with most pleasant thoughts, and thinke themselues present among the companies of angels, farre otherwyse than the world thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

of them. Their cogitacions are alwayes busied in the misterie of mans redemption, in that Lambe which was slayne from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forgiuenesse of sins reuealed and promised by almightie God for the deliuerer to come: in that séede of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man dreading downe the head of the serpent, in the séed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which is Christ, as the apostle saith: in that Prophet, of whom <hi>Moses</hi> maketh mention in <hi>Deuteron.</hi> briefly, in our Lord &amp; Sauiour Iesu Christ: promised vnto the fathers, &amp; alreadie giuen vnto vs: that is, in him onely to whome all the Prophetes doe beare witnes, that who so euer doth put trust of his saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in him shal obtain forgiuenesse of sins by his name: who came into the world to saue sinners, to séeke out &amp; saue that which was lost, to giue his life for the redemption of many: who was sent to bring the glad &amp; wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed message or Gospel vnto the poore &amp; afflicted: to heale the contrite of hart, to preach deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce to the captiue, to comfort them that mourne, to deliuer the oppressed: who, in fine, is our aduocate with the father, our enterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and pacifier betwéene God and men, the throne of grace, the high bishop &amp; the greatest priest to make intercession co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually for vs: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> propitiacion for the sinnes of the world: our
<pb facs="tcp:18953:152"/>
hope, lyfe, righteousnesse, sanctification and redemption. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration of these things abandoneth heauynesse out of the mindes of the Godly, and maketh them to reioyce at all tymes more than one woulde beléeue. And now howe great gladnesse doe they at large enioy, whiles they set before theyr eyes the holy Catholyke, apostolyke, right beléeuing, true Christian Church or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>greation? whiles they remember that communion or felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of saints, which being euen from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning of the worlde after the promise giuen touching the Messias or Sauiour to come, doth continue on still euen to this daye: spreade first abroade in the fathers and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, afterwards in the Apostles and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, then by and dyuers degrées &amp; orders of Christians, professing all one faith, display<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed throughout the whole worlde? Whyles they waye and consider that Christ the sonne of God, our Lorde and Redéemer, doth rule this same spouse or congregation of his with his worde and Gospell, doth helpe it with the holy Ghost, &amp; defende and maintaine it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually against the Deuill? whiles they ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly and swéetely remember, that they are adioyned vnto this fellowship of the Godly &amp; true Christian congregation by fayth, wyll,
<pb facs="tcp:18953:152"/>
meaning, inuocation, prayer, and by confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: which hath the sonne of God for heade &amp; principall, Aungels for defenders, the holye Ghost for a sanctifier, the godly and chosen of all ages for companions? I say, whiles they remember that they are the members of the people of God and mysticall bodye, whose chiefe captaine is Christ? Whiles they occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie their heades about thinking vppon that most blessed familiarity in time to come, with all the Saintes in the kingdome of Heauen, vnto the which they trauaile and labour tooth and nayle with excéeding great desire? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore howe great ioye thinkest thou that they haue large fruition of, whiles they are fixed vpon these and such other cogitacions? And surely it behooued Christians alwayes to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie their mindes about such things, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were astonied with the consider atio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them, to brast out into the prayses of God into Psalmes and Hymmes, into spirituall songs, singing and making melodie in theyr harts vnto the Lord, giuing thanks alwayes for all things vnto God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, in the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, as the Apostle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth. And bycause the Godly doe this conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, what woonder is it if they alwaye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the Lorde? And what then is there
<pb facs="tcp:18953:153"/>
that can euer make heauy and sad, can trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or faare one that in such wise reioyceth? Is it the breache of the lawe? But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth comfort vs: <hi>Christ</hi> (sayth he) <hi>hath he redeemed vs from the curse of the lawe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming himselfe a curse for vs.</hi> Is it sinne? But S. Iohn doth comfort vs: <hi>If anye man haue sinned, we haue an Aduocate wyth the Father, Iesus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiacion for our sinnes.</hi> Is it death? The Godly wote full well that it is the gate of life euerlasting, &amp; a certaine passage out to thys worlde vnto the Father. Is it the wrath and the iudgement of God? But we are reconcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto God through Christ, as <hi>Paule</hi> sayth. Is it Satan? Christ hath conquered him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and hath triumphed ouer him being conquered, as sayth the same <hi>Paule?</hi> Is it hell fire, and the tormentos of hell? Nay, Christ when he had ouercome hell, dyd open a waye vnto Heauen to the Godly. And in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Osea</hi> the Lorde sayth: <hi>I wil be thy death, O death, I wil be thy destruction, O hell.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Dauid</hi> also in his Psalmes doth testifie, <hi>that Christ did leade Captiuitie captiue, when he ascended into heauen:</hi> that is as much to say, did as a man woulde saye, leade the eny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of mankinde prisoners in hys shewe of
<pb facs="tcp:18953:153"/>
Triumph: the deuill, I meane, sinne, death, hell. Briefly in all terrours and temptacions of Sathan, in all heauinesse, in the most sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull cogitacions many tymes of death, of the last iudgement, of the iudgement seate of the Lorde, among the other comfortes of the holy Ghost, the godly doe chiefely stay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with the wordes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles Créede: <hi>I beleeue</hi> (say they) <hi>the Communion or fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of Saints, the remission of sinnes, the resurrection of this fleshe, and the life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.</hi> They leaning vpon this fayth, chasing all feare and heauinesse from them, if that the deuill doe minister any, doe reioyce alwayes in the Lorde. Howbeit, some man will here obiect, that considering they are men, it can not be otherwyse chosen but that they should be troubled with passions, mourne and be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull oftentimes. For they can not lay the nature of mankinde from them, &amp; renounce as it were the féele of flesh and bloude, which all men haue in them. I graunt that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are distressed with heauinesse many a time and oft, and that their minds, are sometimes troubled and mazed? and that it can not bée o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise in these tumults of worldly affaires: Howbeit, the same doe foorthwith come to themselues againe, and disquietnesse of mind
<pb facs="tcp:18953:154"/>
being setled or appeased, they so facion them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in Gods regard and prouident care to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, that with ioy they take all things very quietly and reioyce in their afflictions, &amp; reposing themselues in thapprooued loue of God towarde them, doe conceyue such glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and pleasure in their minds therof, that the same sorrow of theirs is soone ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med withall, if happily these outwarde things (as commonly it comes to passe) haue caused any in them. For like as a very little sparkle falling into a great riuer, is forthwith quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and come to nothing: euen so, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer euill there is, falling into the huge and vnmeasurable sea, as it were, of ioyes, wyth which the Godly doe flow and are alway re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished, all that is by and by quenched, and vanisheth to naught. For there is neuer any place left open for heauinesse there, where Christ the fountaine of true gladnesse is. To make short, howsoeuer the worlde goeth with them, the godly doe alway either simply and without stop reioyce in the Lorde, or else doe take things to hart, but for a tyme, for other mens sakes, or in fine: if they conceyue anye sorrowe in their mind, for God and his glory, which it gréeueth them to see defaced, yet they forth with féele al that same to be exchaunged
<pb facs="tcp:18953:154"/>
for incredible gladnesse, and to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way cleane with spiritual comfort. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto maketh that saying of <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians: I wrote to you (quoth he) this same thing, least if I had come vnto you, I shoulde take sorow by those things, of which it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued mee to take pleasure, hauing this trust to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you all, that my ioy is all your ioyes. For I haue written vnto you out of much afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and anguish of hart, by many teares, not that you should be cast into heauinesse, but that ye might know the loue which I haue somewhat abundantly towarde you.</hi> And agayne: <hi>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we were come into Macedonia, our fleshe had no reliefe, but we were afflicted in all thinges. Outwardly we had fights or contentions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly terrours. Howbeit the God that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth the humble, hath comforted vs by the comming of Titus. &amp;c.</hi> The same <hi>Paule</hi> writeth also to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> touching his sorow: <hi>And surely he was weake (sayth he) so that he was at deaths doore: But God tooke pittie vpon him, and not on him onelye, but also on mee, least I shoulde haue one sorowe vpon an other. Therefore haue I sent him the more deligently, that when ye sawe him, yee might agayne reioyce, &amp; I might be the more voyd of sorow.</hi> And to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse:
<pb facs="tcp:18953:155"/>
                     <hi>Therefore haue we receyued comfort, bretherne, by you, in each of our afflictions &amp; necessities, thorow your fayth, by cause we do now liue, if you stande in the Lord. For what thankesgiuing can we repayre vnto God for you, in all our ioy which we reioyce for you, in the sight of our God, praying both day and night incessantly, that we may see your face, &amp; may supply those things which are lacking vnto your faith.</hi> Here hast thou nowe, howe the godly are woont both to be sory ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times and yet for all that, to reioyce in the Lorde. Such is that saying of <hi>Paule</hi> also vnto the <hi>Romaynes: I say the truth in Christ, I lye not, mine owne conscience bearing mee witnesse withall, by the holy ghost, that I haue excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great sorow, and continuall torment in mine heart. For I my selfe woulde wish to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an excommunicated or cursed thing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ for my brethren, my kinsfolke, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning to the flesh.</hi> This in déede is the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of loue towarde our neyghbour or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and may stand very well togither with the reioyce of fayth towarde God, so that he which thus mourneth, doth neuerthelesse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes reioyce in the Lord, euen touching the ciuill or outwarde forme and conuersation of lyfe also. For the godly, by the Apostles say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:18953:155"/>
doe liue alway without carke and care, &amp; rest still content with their state or calling: take in good woorth thinges present, doe not greatly torment themselues with the lacke of thinges to come, doe reioyce and cheare vp their owne soule in their owne trauaile, as sayeth the Preacher: doe take their meate with thankesgiuing, doe vse or occupye such commodities as they haue at hande, for their necessitie, and that reuerently as the gifts of God: being ioyfull, doe leade an honest and quiet life, neuer carefull for the morrow with thought and pensiuenesse, bycause Christ tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that euery dayes affliction is sufficient for it selfe: doe not wilfully worke their owne sorow or harme, or procure themselues vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and troubles: doe not reiect and refuse such goods as God hath giuen them: doe not créepe into some solitarie corner, to liue the more at their ease and quiet. Neuerthelesse, the same doe take the troubles that God hath sent them, paciently, and are nothing agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the losse of their goods, and doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes giue thankes vnto God for all weale and wo, whatsoeuer shall hap. To be short, they depende wholy vpon God, they haue all their dainties, and all that they count good, setled in God onely, they euery where looke
<pb facs="tcp:18953:156"/>
vpon the minde or will of God alone, they frame &amp; apply themselues altogither to gods pleasure and commaundement, doe ioyfully rest in the loue and good will of God towarde them with all their heart, enioye things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, gape not gréedily after things to come. Thus doe they alwaye reioyce in the Lorde. To this belong those sayings out of Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons booke, entituled, <hi>the Preacher, I knowe (quoth he) that there is nothing better for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man than to be glad and to delight hys owne lyfe, and to eate and to drinke, and to be made mery or frolicke with his owne labour. This is Gods gift. Salomon</hi> doth not here, like some Epicure, exhort and encourage to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, gluttonie, surfeite, nor to a voluptuous and Sybariticall life, as they call it: but to vse and enioy Gods present benefits and good <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sybaritae,</hi> people of a citie called <hi>Sybaris,</hi> in all kinde of sensual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciousnesse passing all other: and thereof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a pro uerbe, <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baritica</hi> mensa, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to feastes and bankettes, excéeding in delicate feare.</note> gifts with chearfulnesse and thankesgiuing, who abundauntly giueth all things to enioy, as the Apostle sayth, and filleth euery liuing thing with his blessing, as the Psalmist <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> sayth. The same Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus teacheth: <hi>When God hath giuen wealth and riches vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a man,</hi> sayth he, <hi>this is the gift to God, that he may eate and drincke of them for his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and may haue delight in his owne labor. For such a man is not carefullye mindefull of
<pb facs="tcp:18953:156"/>
the dayes of his life, bycause God doth fill his heart with gladnesse.</hi> Yea many tymes else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where also the same <hi>Salomon</hi> biddeth vs to let vnprofitable cares and vayne thought of mynde go, &amp; to be of good cheare, to be quiet and pacient, in what case so euer we stande. Her vnto maketh that saying of the same <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> wherein he exhorteth lyke as he dyd before, the faythfull and the louers of God: <hi>Go,</hi> sayth he, <hi>and eate thy breade in gladnes, and drincke thy wine with a chearefull hart, bycause thy workes doe now please God Let thy garments be whyte at all tymes, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt thy head with oyle. &amp;c.</hi> In so manye troubles and infinite cares and miseries of this lyfe, <hi>Salomon</hi> will yet haue the godly to be of good chéere and courage, and not to bée carefull and take thought: to reioyce alway in the Lord, not to fret and vexe themselues. That thing can come to no man but through the blessing of God, like as he also doth many tymes testifie, as when he sayth: <hi>God giueth wisedome and knowledge and gladnesse to the man that pleaseth him. But to the sinner he giueth carefulnesse, that he may encrease &amp; gather togither, and so it may be giuen to him that pleaseth God.</hi> But if perhaps ought fall out, as the fashion of worldly affayres is,
<pb facs="tcp:18953:157"/>
that galleth him, and stayneth his gladnesse with some griefe of minde, by &amp; by the godly and faithfull Christians doe resort or flie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their heauenly father, and hauing, as it were, familiar communication with him doe lay open their cares &amp; troubles before him, and whatsoeuer it be that grieueth them, do earnestly desire ayde, helpe, comfort, wyth most earnest inuocation and prayer, &amp; with humble méekenesse call for mercy: &amp; in fine, whatsoeuer aduersities they suffer, doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle the same, as it were, in the bosome of their most excellent and most tender louing father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they craue for to haue the same either lestened and asswaged, or else cleane taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and that with a most sure fayth and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiaunce, and yet in such sort, that they wholy doe resigne themselues vnto Gods will, and committe themselues vnto his goodnesse: as men readye to beare paciently whatsoeuer God will haue them. And if in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane tyme they shall féele their affiance or trust toward God to quayle or be ouerthrowne of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, if they shall perceyue any scruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to arise within them, if in any point they shal through mischaunce and vnaduised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, by the meanes of mannes infirmitie, swarue and forget themselues, then doe they
<pb facs="tcp:18953:157"/>
repayre to their Curate or Minister: &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is a griefe or trouble vnto them, doe there open and disclose it without shamefast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or feare, and doe heare with gladnesse the sentence of the Gospell pronounced vnto them by the Minister of the Church, and doe lay it vp déepely in their hearts and mindes, as if it were pronounced by Christ himselfe, who is in déede our high Bishop and Priest, yea, and doe rest therevpon with full intent and meaning most hartily, and most willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Besides they doe many tymes also resort to the Lords Table, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende that their faith may be the more kindled, &amp; strengthned, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the mercifull loue and heauenly fauour of God towarde them, and that the same ioy in the Lorde may be by this meanes repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe, as it were, which our ghostly eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie the deuill did go about to quench or darc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Hervnto may be added a continuall and diligent reading of holy Scripture: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Children of God wyth vnspeakeable pleasure doe harde by heare God talking wyth them familiarly, comforting the heauy hearted, raysing vp the afflicted, strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the weake and doubtfull, calling men from dispaire. Ioyne to this, Sermons and godlye Exhortacions, which the Preachers
<pb facs="tcp:18953:158"/>
of the <hi>Worde of Saluacion</hi> doe make: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with also y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mindes, of the godly are maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously refreshed, &amp; that Reioyce of the Lorde, here treated of, is so oftentymes renewed. For God here doth worke ioye and gladnesse to the hearers in déed, and the bones that are brought lowe, doe triumphantly reioyce, as the Prophet sayth. Of like effect are the pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate communications of the godly one wyth an other also, touching God, and Christ the Sauiour: whiles that, according to <hi>Paules</hi> doctrine, they teach &amp; admonish one another wyth Psalmes, Hymmes, and Spirituall songs, with ioye singing in their hearts vnto the Lorde: whiles, I say, the worde of Christ is among them plentifully, with al wisdome, as <hi>Paule</hi> sayeth to the <hi>Collossians.</hi> Besides thys, the very times and holy daies doe often renew the Reioyce of the Godly, &amp; that more is, doe rather augment it, &amp; make it greater than it was. For they stirre vs vp vnto the remembrance of Gods woonderfull actes &amp; miracles wrought for the saluation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and by that occasion doe fill the harts of the godly with spiritual ioyes in the Lord. Such are our Easter Holydayes, which are kept to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue the remembrance of Christs Resurrection: of Pentecost or Whitsontyde,
<pb facs="tcp:18953:158"/>
to call the sending downe of the holy ghost vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apostles: to minde the feastfull daies of Christs birth, when the worde being made fleshe, is celebrated. Likewise the feast of the Circumcision, of the Epiphanie, of the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Palmes, Annunciation, Visitacion, Ascension, &amp; such other like. At which times that spirituall ioye in the Lorde, which the Godly haue, is marueylously much increased with a certaine heape, as a man woulde saye: I meane, in the remembring and recounting of things done by almightie God, as I sayde afore. Hereof commeth that saying in the Psalmes, touching Christes Resurrection: <hi>This is the daye which the Lorde hath made, Let vs triumph and be glad therin.</hi> And in the Apostle also: <hi>Christ our passeouer was offered vp for vs.</hi> Hereof is that saying in the Gospel read in the Church for Christmasse day: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, I declare vnto you exceeding great ioy which shall be vnto al the people, that a Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our this day is borne vnto you, which is Christ the Lorde.</hi> And also that in <hi>Esay: A childe is borne vnto vs, and a sonne is giuen vnto vs.</hi> These and such other like sayings, which are song in the congregation vpon feastful and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne dayes, howe excéedingly thinke you, doe they reioyce and cheare vp the heartes of
<pb facs="tcp:18953:159"/>
the faithull Christians? This, euen thys, I abide by, is to reioyce in the Lord, and not (as others at such times are woont to do) to make feasts and bankettes, one with an other, and séeke after pleasures and belly chéere: but to spend the holy dayes in godly and deuout me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditacions, and to giue thankes to God for his benefites, to sing Psalmes and Hymmes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to almightie God. What? doth not that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent or populous resort and assembly of the congregation &amp; Christian men in the Church, at all seasons, to heare the worde of God, to make inuocation and prayer, to giue thanks, cause a large encrease of gladnesse in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? What is he that can say nay to it? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the faithful do most willingly come forth to be present with other at that most holy and alwayes to God most pleasaunt and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sacrifice of praise, inuocation, worship, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thanks, Hymmes, prayers: which at the comming togither of the whole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is vsed ordinarily to be made, with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great ceremonie or reuerence. And it is not the least ioy of al, that they here tell how any of their brethren haue happily and in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured and strong fayth towarde God depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of this transitorie life. Wherevpon they being also glad, doe yéelde thanks to the
<pb facs="tcp:18953:159"/>
goodnesse of God, and praye that they maye haue the like departure, and doe followe the corse with a good wil. And in thus doing, they are not onely brought in minde of their owne mortality, but also their most swéete and ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant desire touching the heauenly dwelling, is renewed, and the memory to liue there in the fellowship of Aungels, and to enioye that most blessed familiaritie in time to come, with all the Saintes, in the life eternall, is with singular pleasure stirred vp. Likewyse at the baptisme of an Infant newly borne, the ioy of the Godly is also amplified and made more than it was, whiles they thinke and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, not onelye of the number of Christians herby increased, but also of the goodnesse, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and woonderfull determination &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of Almightie God, regenerating or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing vs by water &amp; the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> They are therefore with marueylous much glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and chearefulnesse of minde present at this ceremonie, ordeyned by Christ: yea, euen of their owne forwardnesse and accord much more than when they being desired, are vsed as witnesses at the childes Baptisme. They are, I saye againe, present at it, most hartily to commit the childe vnto Gods tuition, and to ioyne with others there present in prayer,
<pb facs="tcp:18953:160"/>
and to heare the most holy wordes of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister that baptiseth, and to take inwardely a close and hid pleasure touching the Kite and fashion of the heauenlye mysterie, and of the water of Regeneration, and to triumph ouer the deuill, as ye woulde say, and to reioyce on the childes behalfe, béeing made partaker of all the sacraments, and to render due thanks vnto GOD, and to allure other men by their good example vnto like dutie.</p>
                  <p>That which I now entende to speake, may perhaps, séeme to most men absurd and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason: and yet wil I speake it for al that, séeing it is as true as the Gospell. The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are glad more than a man will beléeue, as often as they haue anye occasion gyuen to doe almes, and the déedes of mercy and pity. For they are fully resolued, and out of doubt, that whatsoeuer bounty and humanity is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon their néedie neighbour, the same is bestowed vppon Christ himselfe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they sée a poore man and beggar to resort vnto them for succour, they think that they sée euen Christ in his owne person: and they recken themselues happy whome Christ vouchsafeth to that honour, to craue almes of them. That saying in the Gospell is alwayes before theyr eyes: <hi>In as much as ye haue done
<pb facs="tcp:18953:160"/>
it to one of these my poore wretched brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ye haue done it vnto me.</hi> Yea &amp; farther, they thinke that they are many times tempted or prooued, and they thinke that it may be Christ hymself, comming vnto them in the likenesse of a beggar. And they woonder at those mens lacke of fayth, which, if Christ were here cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally among vs, as once he was, saye, they woulde denie him nothing, though it were a great matter, and yet with a deafe eare doe passe by, refuse, and despise Christ walking here and there about like a poore beggar, and crauyng his almes. They therfore, as I haue sayde, are not a little glad when they doe an almes déede, &amp; shew liberalitie to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors. For beléeuing the words of the Gospell, they beholde and looke vpon Christ in theyr neyghbour, which will haue al that layde out for him, that in his name is bestowed vppon wretched men, and such as be altogither suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corlesse. Therefore they féede Christ béeing a hungry, in their neighbour, they gyue hym drinke being a thirst, they receyue him into their house being a straunger they cloath him being naked, they visite him being weak, they comfort him being captiue or prisoner: and if they be able, they raunsome him also.</p>

and how excéeding great doe we thinke that ioy of the Godly to bée, as often as (and in a maner they daily do it, and without ceassing) they talke alone with their heauenly Father, &amp; open their desires vnto him, with so great delight and pleasure many times, that being as it were rauished beside themselues they pray the whole daye togither, without hauing any minde of their meate, yea, and continue al night in prayer also. And surely, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly do euer of any thing receiue a certaine smak or taste in this same life of the blessed lyfe to come, they chieflye receyue the same by thys their talking togither and communing with almightie God, that I speake of: whereby it commeth that they are neuer without cause tired with praying. And yet in such talke they are not onely busied and occupyed for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or for thinges properly pertaining to their owne behoofe, but euen for the whole ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, for the christian common wealth, for the spreading abroade of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and for the sanctifiyng of the name of god also. In this exercise they do both craue all good things, aswell for the soule as for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, at Gods hands: as are peace, quietnesse, tranquilitie, concorde of Princes, plentye of things necessary to life, and such other like:
<pb facs="tcp:18953:161"/>
and also make prayer to be frée from calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both publique and priuate, from warre, famine, &amp; pestilence: and besides, giue thanks to the goodnesse of God for the benefits recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at his hande. Now such talking togyther with God is so swéete and pleasant vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that in maner hauing forgotten themselues, and neglecting the care of their bodies, they doe constantly perseuere &amp; continue in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as men raysed vpwarde with a certayne godly zeale and affection, and neyther take their naturall rest, nor long for meate: but after a sort thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues already among the blessed companye of Aungels, as if they were become nowe immortall, and not here conuersant in the world among men. O hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pye creatures, who thus being delighted, doe at large enioy in their mindes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, vnspeakeable pleasure, and the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse reioyce of Gods holy spirite. The world cannot so much as imagine what maner of things these shoulde be, nor beholde them (as they saye) but in a dreame: the children of God doe onely know them.</p>
                  <p>We haue, I thinke sufficiently declared and opened, that which we tooke in hand, that the faithfull and true louers of God doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye reioyce in the Lorde, howseeuer the

worlde go: to wéete, aswell in sadnesse as in gladnesse. We will yet say thus much more. The right and true Christians doe take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible delectacion especially among other men, at his woonderfull ornature and beauty of the worlde, at the varietie, grace and order of heauenly bodies, at the most pleasant sight of the Sunne, at the starres shining by night, at the amiablenesse of the earth, and the most faire, and as it were, sprinking countenance of naturall things: I meane so often as they doe sée, as the Poet sayth:</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>The skie to shine, the trees to budde,</l>

                     <l>With braunches, &amp; the boughes to bende</l>
                     <l>With full Grapes that they bring.</l>
                     <l>The standing cornes to yeelde their fruits</l>
                     <l>Each thing to florish out.</l>

                     <l>The medowes clad throughout.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>How reioyce they, euen from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of their harts as oft as they do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Gods goodnesse, which woulde haue all the other Creatures to serue for mans neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities: Woods, Groues, Hils, large Medo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes and Pastures, Fields, Gardens of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, fountaines &amp; springes of water, brookes or foords, ryuers, and whatsoeuer things else
<pb facs="tcp:18953:162"/>
are ministred out of these, for the vse, delyght &amp; foode of men, woods, trées, herbes, floures or blossomes, beryes, Pulse, all kynde of corne or graine, all sorts of things that haue life, wilde beasts for hunting, foules for hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or fouling, fishes for angling, wéeles, and for nets, to let passe the store, plenty and varietie of other things beside, almost wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number. Ioyne vnto these also the hyd ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the bowels of the earth, the secrete veynes of gold &amp; siluer, the metals of brasse, iron and lead, precious stones and pearles of price, woonderfull to beholde, fortheir great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for their beautie, and for a certaine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret vertue and operation hid in them. They knowe well that all these thinges are gyuen them of their most louing father, not onelye for necessitie, but also for honest delectacyon &amp; pleasure. This now doth delight woonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; maketh the godly to reioyce more than a man canne beléeue: As often as they sée the corne in the fieldes, the fruits vpon the trées, the grapes on the vine, the herbs and swéete smelling floures, as the Violet, the Rose and the Lillie in the gardens, so many tymes doe they take the fruition &amp; vse of the same things with a singular pleasure: &amp; besides yéeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the goodnesse of their most gracious &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:18953:163"/>
louing father excéeding great thanks, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol &amp; praise his goodnesse, haue his wisdome in due admiration, &amp; in fine, doe testifie the ioy of their mynd, &amp; their thankful wil toward god, by singing of Himmes or praises. And how do the same persons reioyce, as often as they by occasion sée their cattel come from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pasturs, their Goates, Ewes, Kine, drawing home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace with strouting vdders: as oft as they sée the labors and trauailes of the little Bées, in which God hath left so great miracles of hys wisdom? in fine, as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they sée their poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try bringing vp their little Chickens with so great charinesse, defending them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Kite and other Vermine, &amp; huckling them vnder their wings? why, will some man say, that thing doth also delight the wicked &amp; Godlesse men. I graunt in deede that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked do take some kinde of pleasure by the same: but yet not <hi>in the Lord.</hi> For they doe not acknowledg Gods goodnesse towarde vs, that is the giuer of al those things, nor render thanks to Gods bountifulnesse, nor offer vppe the sacrifice of praise, nor triumphing with spiritual ioy, doe sing &amp; make melodie in their harts to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, like as the Godly are vsed to do: who are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that all these aforesayde thinges doe serue for mans vses, that these things are the
<pb facs="tcp:18953:163"/>
gifts of God, who euermore hath a care ouer vs &amp; for vs a prouidence after a fatherly sort, according to that saying in the Booke of the Psalmes: <hi>Thou hast put all things vnder hys feete, all sheep and oxen, &amp; beside the beasts of the field, the foules of the aire, and the fishes of the sea.</hi> For that power &amp; right which we lost in our first father <hi>Adam,</hi> the same haue we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered again by Christ: so that we haue rule &amp; dominion ouer the creatures, &amp; al things be in subiection vnto vs, flockes or herds of smal cattell, droaues of Neate and other great beasts, wilde beasts and all foules that flie in the aire, all fish and liuing things swimming in the sea. The Godly doe therfore know that all these things doe serue their turnes and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyings, as vnto whom the father hath gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen all things togither with his sonne Christ Iesus. Wherefore they are not troubled in their minds, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> casting how to liue, what to eate, and what to drinke, when they sée so great care of their heauenly father for them. Neyther doe they make scruple to vse those meats fréely which God hath created, for the faithfull to take with thankesgyuing, and for them that know aright, that whatsoeuer god hath made, the same is good, and in no wise to be reiected, if it be taken with giuing of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks,
<pb facs="tcp:18953:164"/>
as <hi>Paule</hi> saith to <hi>Tymothe.</hi> Besides this, that gladnesse or Reioyce of the godly (to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to our purpose) is wholy cléere &amp; sincere &amp; in euery respect sound, true and vnfeyned. But the pleasure of the Godlesse by such things, if they doe take any, is not pure and perfite or substantiall: but marueylously pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted or defiled: bicause infinite scruples doe remaine in their consciences, that vexe and trouble them, and continually prick and sting them. Those reioyce euen from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of their harts, &amp; take incredible fruit of most true delight. But these do cast of a vaine trifling delight, I know not what my selfe, &amp; dreamingly imagine a gladnesse with the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall part of their heartes onelye, after a sleight maner, and as it were with a dulled féeling. Howbeit I wade further in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I had thought to doe at the first: and therefore nowe at the length let vs make an ende. It is faith, therefore, Fayth, I saye, in Christ, whereby we are fully and wholy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that God the father moued with loue incredible towarde men, hath preferred our saluation before the deare loue of his onelye sonne, &amp; for all our sakes hath deliuered hym into the hands of the enimy, that through him we might recouer that which wée had lost in
<pb facs="tcp:18953:164"/>
the first parent of mankinde, <hi>Adam,</hi> I meane, innocency, righteousnesse, holynesse: &amp; might be deliuered from sinne, death, the deuyll, and euerlasting damnation, and being adopted to the sonnes of God, might be made heires of the immortall good things &amp; of the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This same faith in Christ, doth both lift vp and comfort the afflicted and terrified minds, and also maketh a man alway to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce incredibly. This faith enforceth a man to cry out with the Apostle: <hi>If God be with vs who can be against vs? He that hath not spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his own sonne but hath deliuered him for vs all, how can it be, that with the same sonne he shoulde not giue vs all things? who shal lay crimes against the elect of God? it is God that iustifieth: who is it that can condemne? It is Christ that dyed, nay that was also raysed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which is also at the right hand of God, which also maketh intercession for vs: who shall separate vs from the loue of God toward vs. &amp;c.</hi> This Faith being instructed by the worde of God, confirmed by his sacraments, settled in vs with the holy Ghost, resting and reposing it selfe in the onely good wil and loue of God towarde vs for Christs sake, putting the hope of attayning saluation in the frée goodnesse, clemency, benignity, mercy &amp; grace
<pb facs="tcp:18953:165"/>
of God for Christ, depending wholly vppon God alone, hauing his onely respect vnto god, and casting all his care &amp; thought vpon God, both asking and looking for all good things at Gods onely hande, as of a most louing &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der father, flying to the onely ayde and helpe of God in aduersity, studying from the verye heart to please God onely, fearyng to offende through a certaine honest &amp; frée bashfulnesse: finally, occupyed in a continuall &amp; daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of heauenly thinges with all hys minde, thought, care, and desire, despising worldly things, beholding the celestial things: this same Faith, I say, maketh vs to reioyce alway in the Lorde, and with gladnesse &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry chéere to giue thanks to the Lorde for all things. <hi>I beseech thee, the euerlasting father of our Lorde and Sauiour Iesus Christ, for thy sonnes sake, our Mediator, high priest and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate, that pouring forth plentifully into vs thy holy spirite, thou wouldest stirre vppe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease and keepe this same faith in our heartes. For it is not in mans power to beleeue &amp; trust, but commeth from aboue from almighty god, neither haue we the same of our selues, but we haue it as a gift from thee, O most mercyfull father: and we ought at all times to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our faith to come from thee, to render
<pb facs="tcp:18953:165"/>
hartie thanks vnto thee for the same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much had I, in maner, to declare touching the continuall Reioyce of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, being mooued vppon occasion therevnto through that place of the Apostle to the <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonians,</hi> where he sayth: <hi>Be gladde alwayes, pray without cessing, giue thanks in al things.</hi> And with that likewise to the <hi>Philippians: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the Lorde alwayes, and againe I say, reioyce.</hi> By which words the Apostle biddeth the godly sort, and them that doe cleane fast to him with full trust and affiance, to be of good chéere &amp; spiritually iocund at all times in the memory and recounting of Gods good wil to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, and in the sure hope of atteyning saluation, through our Lorde &amp; sauiour Iesus Christ, howsoeuer that the worlde go. Nowe happy is that man, and happy in déede what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he be, that reposing himself onely at al times in God, who taketh care for the Godly being mooued therevnto thorowe a certayne woonderfull and true fatherly loue and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection towarde vs, as is the naturall father to his children: whosoeuer I saye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeuing the sonne of God to be our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, sanctification, and redemption, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswaded with him selfe, that there in no condemnation at all to be feared, of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
<pb facs="tcp:18953:166"/>
are ingraffed in Christ Iesu, doth passe ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole time of his life in spiritual ioy, taking things present in good woorth, &amp; nothing care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with thought and pensiuenesse for things to come, seruing alwayes in feare, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly reioysing with trembling, as that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> the Psalmograph doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish.</p>
                  <p>This therefore that we may doe in déede, and without counterfeyting, from the very bottome of our harts, howsoeuer things go, both in prosperitie and aduersity, I praye the same our Lorde and God to graunt, without whome there is neuer any syncere ioye, and in whom onely the scripture biddeth vs to reioyce and bee excéeding glad alwayes: to whom be prayse honor, and glory, for euer and euer.</p>
