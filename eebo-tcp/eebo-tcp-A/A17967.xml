         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:7912:58"/>Summa, from the ſecond yere of Longimanus vntill, the baptiſme of Chriſte are foure hundreth, foure ſcore and fyue yeare.</p>
                  <p>And therfore thre ſcore and nyne yearly wekes make euen foure hundreth and foure ſcore and two wekes. Whereby it is manifeſt, that when Chriſte was baptyſed, were fulfylled three ſcore and nyne yearly wekes, and in the weke folowynge taught Chriſt, &amp; in the ſame half weke was he put to death: For Chriſte was put to death the fourth yeare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he was baptiſed. Wherfore when this we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke that foloweth is added to the thre ſcore and nine, there ſhalbe ſeuenty wekes: and this is the maner to count the tyme appoynted by Daniel. For after Chriſtes death are the Iewes nomore Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and their temple was afterward an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, the whiche Daniel witneſſed playnly.</p>
                  <p>Beſyde this are other notable doctrines, and conſolacions of troubled co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences in this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, of Chriſtes office and kyngdome, that he came to preache forgeueneſſe of ſynnes: but to expounde all this maketh to no purpoſe here, nother is it here taken in hande.</p>

                  <p>So perfectly do the hyſtories of the Grekes agre with the tyme that is founde in Ioſephus and Philo, that ye maye openly perceaue, the tyme of Chriſtes commynge to be moſte fyttly appoynted by Daniel.

                  <p>It is not my mynde here to deſcribe this whole warre: for Theucidides, Xenophon, and afterward other haue written therof whole bokes. But I wil reherſe one thyng among all other, namely what fall the citie of Athens hath had in this warre, and what miſery ſhe hath ſuffered, when ſhe was taken in. And agayne how ſhe was at the laſt reſtored againe by the vertues, moderation and pacience of ſome good men. For as hautneſſe, hardineſſe &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption brought the ſtate of the citie in decay, euen ſo dyd pacience and mekeneſſe of maners reſtore the ſame agayne.</p>

The Lacedemonians did ioyne them ſelfs with the Perſes, of whome they were aſſiſted with

But how great a thinge this is, maye be gathered ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that in ciuill commotions wee ſe iudgementes, lawes and all modeſtie of maners go to wrack and to nought.

Moreouer it is reported that he ſhould haue ſayde: That he feared not for for his lyfe, but that his death ſhould be miſcheue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deadly to the commone welth &amp; empyre.</p>
               <p>But all this refrained not them from the curſed enterpryſe, of whom by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iuracion he was ſlaine. The firſt beginner of this wicked dede, was Caſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,<note place="margin">Caſſius.</note> and that only by enuy, becauſe for Ceſars ſake he could not obtayne thoſe prouinces, which he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueted.<note place="margin">Brutus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Item, that Ceſar alſo was a tyraunt, and that it was law<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully permitted to ſlaye tyrauntes. With ſuch lyke inconuenient argumentes, whiche are oft wont to begyle yong and vnlearned men in lyke caſes, was Brutus inflamed: for without his helpe had Caſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us brought nothynge to paſſe.

               <p>Ceſar was olde ſyxe and fyftye yeare whan he was ſlayne, and ruled fyue yeares: and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge

of rulynge was in the conſulſhyppe, in the which he beganne the warre agaynſt Pompeius. This is the begynnynge of the Romane monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chye, the whych God hath paynted very horribly in the prophet Daniell: and wytneſſeth, that the world ſhalbe much more heauely oppreſſed by the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame, than euer it was before. Item that Chriſt ſhall come in the ſame monarchye, and therfore ſhal it be the laſt. For all theſe thynges are propheſyed before by God, to ſtablyſhe the fayth of the godly, concerninge the certayntie of Chriſtes comming.

I ſuppoſe verely that the prophecy of the Heythen prophetes, and ſayenges of the Sybilles of the durableneſſe of the Romane empyre, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynynge to thys, as is the ſayenge of Virgil: I haue geuen an endleſſe empyre, the whych ſeme to be taken of this, whiche the ſcrypture ſayeth, that<note place="margin">The Roman monarchy is the laſte on earth.</note> the empyre of Rome ſhalbe the laſte monarchye on earth.

               <p>Theſe thynges are to be knowen, that wee maye be aſſured that thys empyre can not be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen, whyche the examples of hiſtories wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe alſo.

               <p>For it had nowe Emperours of ſmall power, than very puyſſaunt Emperours. To conſydre theſe thynges in hiſtoryes maketh greate matter, chefely to knowe the wyll of God aryghte in ſuche chaunces.</p>

               <p>A boke of Chronicles ought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehende moſte greateſt thynges in a feate order, ſo that the reke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the yeares, and the chefe alteracions, that befall into the religion and other greate thynges may be ryght obſerued and knowen. For it can not be that all thynges that are done in one realme, can be written in one boke, though it were great, by rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon of the ſundry circumſtaunces and occaſions of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> buſineſſes, the whiche muſt chefely be conſydered. Of this wyſe truely wrote Herodotus, Theucydi des, Xenophon &amp; Titꝰ Liuius hiſtories. The other<note place="margin">Writers of Hiſtories. Cronicles.</note> are onely to be called Cronicle writers, whiche alſo ought not to take vpon them the name of Hiſtory wryters: For they do brefely ſhewe thynges done, and ſettyng the order of the tyme before, ſeme onely to aduertyſe the wyſe reader, to marke ſome of the notableſt thynges. Whiche thinge we haue done al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſo in this Cronicle: we haue only drawen thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges as it were in a pathwaye, whiche ſemed moſte beſt, and haue other whyles ſhewed their occaſions, to the intent we maye learne to marke and forſe ſo much thenarower ſuche lyke thynges, in like chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Howbeit what profites otherwiſe beſides this do Cronicles bryng, that ſame haue we declared be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore in the preface.</p>
               <p>Truely I muſte before the ende of this wryting put the reader agayne in remembraunce of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeng of Elias, the whiche we haue ſet in the begyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyng of this treatyſe, that he may ſo much the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re eaſyer marke both the order of the tyme, and alſo the dedes of the hiſtories. Item that he thinke that

alſo, that the ende of mens affaires is at hande, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordynge to the ſayeng of Elias, that the worldes age conteyneth .vi. M. yeares, and that the ſame ſpace ſhall not he fully expyred: for God ſhall preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it becauſe of the worldes corrupte maners. Now ſeyeng there are expyred .v. M. and .v. C. yeares ſence the worlde beganne, as may clerely be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the table folowing: it is no doute but that the worldes age is nerehand come to the ende, that Chriſte our lorde do rayſe vp the death by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng, and iudge the whole worlde, and that more is alſo appoynt the deuels and wicked men euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtynge fyre, but take the very godly out of al ſorow, and ſet them into the euerlaſting fruition of God &amp; bleſſe. Beſydes this do the wonderfull mutacions and chaunges of all kyngdomes nearehande wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that the worlds ende is not farre of. For with<note place="margin">What the mutacions of kyngdomes de ſignifye.</note> in fewe yeares euen by our remembraunce we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue perceaued the hyghneſſe of the Romiſh byſhop, Fraunce, Hungary and Dennemarckes kingdoms to haue greucouſly fallen, and lyke chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce are ſhort<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to be loked for in other kyngdomes alſo. Daniel witneſſeth that ſhortely after that the Turkes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers be minyſhed, ſhall the ende of all thynges of the worlde be at hande. But the Turkyſh kyngdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s decaye ſhall doutleſſe be ſene wythin few yeares (if Goddes wyll be ſo,) and after that our Emperoure Charles ſhalbe deceaſſed, it can not be, but that the empire alſo ſhalbe miſerably toren of the Germans themſelues. For I feare me two wyll then greatly ſtryue for the monarchye. Almighty God of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie mercy, ſwage ſo horrible commotions &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the

               <p>The toren tranquillitie and ſpoiled peace in the churche, maye alſo be a ſigne and token, and it is to be feared, leſt the ſame do alſo growe and ſprede far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by warres and negligence of Romiſh by ſhops.</p>
               <p>But ſeyeng Chriſte hymſelfe aduertiſeth vs in the Goſpel of the perils, that ſhalbe at hande in the latter dayes, not only in thoſe thinges that pertayn to the body, but alſo thoſe that belong to the ſprete, yea the heauen itſelfe alſo threateneth with horry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble darkeninges and coniunctions: I wil paſſe ouer to ſpeake of thoſe toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that be reherſed in the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng the latter dayes, ſo that at the laſt we maye learne to beware &amp; take hede to our ſelues and doute not to demaunde and loke for ayde and comfort of God onely in ſo greate miſere of al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Wherefore I willed the reader to be admony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in this place, to call to remembraunce, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe tymes full of peryls &amp; wretchedneſſe, are at hand, and that the ſame peryls ought not to be deſpiſed with a recheleſſe mynde. For it is no lyght thynge, and ſuche one as all maner of men do proue wyth their harme and damage, that realmes are chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, empires pulled out of their frames, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde of religion is ſpoyled. The buyldynge or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brike of the worlde ſemeth to repreſente a greate and moſte olde buyldynge, whyche oftentymes is more and more ready to fall, when nowe doth one wall fall downe, then the other. Likewiſe doth the world ſeme to be ready to fal at this time, &amp; doth by litle and litle bryng a more greuous fal with it, one and other kyngdomes falling down and decayeng.
<pb facs="tcp:7912:201"/>
Nether let any man thynke that ſo greate a buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng ſhall fall without a moſte excedynge commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. God lyghten oure myndes, that we beyng ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyſhed with the earneſt threatenynges of the Goſpell, maye ſeke at onely Chriſte conſolation and refreſhynge: and that greate princes maye vſe no leſſe wyſedome in the feare of God, then mekeneſſe, to aſſuage the occaſions of all euels. For thereto are they ordeined of God, that with their care and wiſedom, they maye gouerne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende mankynd that is weake &amp; wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.

               <p>Nether doth the nomber of the yeares that is in the Bible greately diſagre from the order of the Monarchies that is in the chefe aucthors of the Greke hiſtories.

                  <p>This man ſo highly endued with knowledge

from God, was apointed and ordeined of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father to be a miniſter and teacher of his chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che and a preacher of his Goſpell, euen as in al ages he hath raiſed and ordeined ſome to be Prophetes, ſome to be Apoſtles, and ſome to be teachers of hys congregacion. For he opened and declared vnto the worlde (by Gods grace) the neceſſary and holſome doctrine of the Goſpell, and taught the true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce and comfort of the harte, whiche is feared with the knowledge of Goddes wrath. He hath godly ſet furth the doctrine of Paule, whiche ſaith: That a man is iuſtified and made ryghteous by the faith in Chriſte. He hath alſo declared the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce betwene the Lawe and the Goſpel, betwene the rightouſnes of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſpirite, &amp; of the outward workes. He brought to light agayne the true worſhypping of God, whiche had bene vnknowen to the mooſt parte of the worlde by the ſpace of a thouſand ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. And brought the vniuerſall Church from that fonde opinion, whiche imagineth, that God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhypped although y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> minde of man being ſuppreſſed with perpetual doubting, abhorreth to come to god</p>
                  <p>He taught alſo howe we ought to pray in faith &amp; with a good concience, and ledevs to the only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour Chriſt the ſonne of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whiche ſytteth at the right hand of the father euerlaſtyng, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth interceſſion for vs: And not to the ſoules of dead men as the vngodly Papiſtes haue taught with fyre and fagot. He declared alſo what good workes were acceptable to God. He hath ſo garniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and eſtablyſhed the temporal lawes and gouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that ſence the Apoſtles tyme it was neuer ſo confirmed by Scriptures.

chyldyſh cuſtome and ceremonies of mans tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, whiche hyndered true prayer, and ſeperated them from the neceſſary workes. To thyntent alſo that the heauenly doctrine ſhould extende to hys poſteritie, and that the people whiche ſhall come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myght haue knowledge, he tranſlated the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall and Apoſtolicall Scriptures into Dutch with ſuche lyght and clarite, that the reder maye haue more knowledge thereby, then by ſome mens expoſitions.</p>
                  <p>He made alſo many expoſitions, whiche do far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re excell many other, as Eraſmus of Roterdame witneſſeth in his writynges.

                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſayll. And whyleſt a greate parte of his doctrine is aboue mans reaſon, (as the doctrine of remiſſion of ſynnes, and of faith) it muſt nedes be graunted that he was taught of God. In prayer for the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Churche of Chriſte was he very earneſt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygent. He dyd alſo eueryday choſe a certaine hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to recite certayne Pſalmes, wherin alſo he mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his prayer with great deuotion. He taught alſo that it is not ynough to praye only with the minde and with ſighing, but that the maner &amp; fourme of prayeng is preſcribed vnto vs by the Counſaill of God, that the hartes by the reding may be ſtirred, and moued, yea that the voyce alſo may knowledge

and confeſſe what God we worſhyppe.</p>
                  <p>He was alſo in the aſſault and reſiſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of Gods truthe of a conſtant mynde and of a bolde courage, neyther was he abaſſhed for their threatenynges.

                  <p>For aſmuche therefore as this man was garny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſuche a great witte and other godly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and was ſpecially ordeyned of God to repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re his temple agayn, wherin he hath not bene negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, we ought not to ſuffre his vertues and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites to peryſhe among vs, and whyleſt he was an inſtrument of God, we ought gladly to folowe hys Doctrine, and therein to learne the vertues neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for vs, as the feare of God, fayth and feruentnes in prayer, diligence in the office of the worde, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtite, abſtinence and abhorryng from ſedition or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multe, diligence and deſyrous to ſtudy. &amp;c. whiche God graunt vnto vs all.
