            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Then it is honourable for the <note place="margin">Mariage the first or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God.</note> time, for it was the first ordinance which GOD instituted, euen the


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4337:9"/>
first thing which he did after man and woman were created, &amp; that in the state of innocencie before either had sinned, like the finest flower which will not thriue but in a cleane ground. Before man had any other calling he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be a Husband: therefore it hath the honour of antiquitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other ordinances, because it was ordained first, and is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientest calling of men.</p>
                  <p>Then it is honourable for the place; for whereas all other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances <note place="margin">3.</note> were instituted out of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,</hi> Marriage was instituted in <hi>Paradise</hi> in the happiest place, to signifie howe happie they are which marrie in the Lord, they doo not only marrie one another, but Christ is maried vnto them, &amp; so Mariage hath the honor of the place aboue all other ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces to,

                  </p>
                  <p>As Christ honoured Mariage with his birth, so he honoured it <note place="margin">Christs first my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle at a Mariage. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2. 8.</note> with his miracles: for the first miracle which Christe did, hee wrought at a Mariage in <hi>Chanaan,</hi> where he turned their water into

wine: so, if Christ be at your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that is, if you marie in christ, your water shall bee turned into wine, that is, your peace, and your rest, and your ioy, and your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes shal begin with your Mariage; but if you marrie not in Christ, then your wine shall be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to water, that is, you shall liue worse hereafter than you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. As he honoured it with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, so he honored it with prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: for hee compareth the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 2.</note> of God to a Wedding, and he compareth holines to a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">Verse. 11.</note> garment.

                  </p>
                  <p>We reade in Scripture of three <note place="margin">Three Mariages of Christ.</note> Mariages of Christ. The first was when Christ and our nature met together.

                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:4337:10"/>
Christ and his Church. These are Christs 3. wiues. As Christ hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Mariage; so doo Christs Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: for <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction <note place="margin">Reuel. 19 7.</note> of Christ and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>a Mariage.</hi> And in <hi>Reuel.</hi> 21. 9. <note place="margin">Reuel. 21. 9.</note> the Church hath the name of a Bride, whereas Heresie is called a Harlot. Further, for the honour of <note place="margin">Reue. 17. 1.</note> Mariage, <hi>Paule</hi> sheweth how by it <note place="margin">By Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the womans cursse tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to two blessings. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16.</note> the curse of the woman was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a blessing; for the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans curse was the paines which she should suffer in her trauaile. Now by Mariage this curse is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a blessing; for children are the first blessing in al the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28.</note> And therefore Christ saieth, that so soone as the mother seeth a man child borne into the world, <note place="margin">Iohn. 16. 21.</note> she forgetteth all her sorrowes, as though her curse were turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a blessing. And further, <hi>Paule</hi>


                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:4337:11"/>
saith, that by bearing of children, <note place="margin">1. Timo. 2. 15.</note> if she continue <note n="*" place="margin">For those paines will try her saith</note> in faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, she shall bee saued, as though one curse were turned into two blessings. For first she shall haue children, and after she shall haue saluation. What a mercifull God <note place="margin">Note.</note> haue wee, whose curses are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings? Who would haue thought that God had hid a blessing in his curse? So hee loued our parents when hee punished them, that hee could scarse punish them for loue, and therefore a comfort was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his iudgement.</p>
                  <p>To honour Mariage more, it is said, that God tooke a rib out of <hi>Adams</hi> side, and thereof built the <note place="margin">Gen 2. 22.</note> woman. He is not saide to make man a wife, but to build him a wife, signifying, that man &amp; wife make as it were one house toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; that the building was not


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4337:11"/>
perfect, vntil the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was made aswell as the man: therefore if the building bee not perfect now, it must be destroyed againe.</p>
                  <p>Before God made the woman, <note place="margin">A note of Adams sleepe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 21.</note> it is sayd, that he cast the man into a sleepe, and in his sleepe he tooke a rib out of his side, and as he made the man of earth, so he made the woman of bone, while <hi>Adam</hi> was a sleepe. This doth teach vs two thinges: As the first <hi>Adam</hi> was a figure of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 22. &amp; 45.</note> so the first <hi>Adams</hi> sleepe was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the second <hi>Adams</hi> sleepe, &amp; the first <hi>Adams</hi> spouse was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the second <hi>Adams</hi> spouse. That is, as in the sleepe of <hi>Adam, Eue</hi> was borne; so in the sleepe of Christ the Church was borne: as a bone came out of the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> side, so bloud came out of the second <hi>Adams</hi> side. As <hi>Adams</hi>


                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:4337:12"/>
spouse receiued life in his sleepe; so Christs spouse receiued life in his sleepe: that is, the death of Christ is the life of the Church; for the Apostle calleth Death a sleepe, but Christ which dyed is called Life, shewing that in his <note place="margin">Ephes. 5 14. Iohn. 14. 6.</note> death we liue. Secondly, this sleep which the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was cast into, while his wife was created, dooth teach <note place="margin">A note of Adams sleepe.</note> vs that our affections, our lusts, &amp; our concupicenses, should sleepe while wee goe about this action. As the man slept while his wife was making, so our flesh should sleepe while our wife is choosing, least as the loue of Venison wan <hi>Isaak</hi> to blesse one for another, so <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 3.</note> the loue of gentrie, or riches, or beautie make vs take one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>To honour Mariage more yet, or rather to teach the maried how


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4337:12"/>
to honour one another, it is saide, <note place="margin">A note of Adams ribbe. <hi>Gen. 2. 22. Ephe.</hi> 5. 23.</note> that the wife was made of the husbands rib: not of his head, for <hi>Paule</hi> calleth the husbande the wiues head: nor of the foote, for <note place="margin">The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation.</note> he must not set her at his foote: the seruant is appoynted to serue, and the wife to helpe. If she must not match with the head, nor stoope at the foote, where shall he set her then? He must set her at his heart, and therefore she which should lie in his bosome, was made in his bosome, and should bee as close to him as his ribb of which she was fashioned. Lastly, in all Nations the day of Mariage was reputed the ioyfullest day in all their life, and is reputed still of all, as though the Sunne of happines began that day to shine vpon vs, when a good wife is brought vnto vs. Therfore one saith, that Mariage doth signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie

                  <p>
                     <hi>Salomon</hi> considering al these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, as though wee were more indebted to God for this tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other temporall gifts, saith: <hi>House and riches are the inheritance of the fathers: but a prudent wife commeth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pro. 14. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Lord.</hi> House and riches are giuen of God, and all things els, &amp; yet hee saith, house and riches are giuen of parents, but a good wife is giuen of God: as though a good wife were such a gift, as we should account from God alone, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as if hee should send vs a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from heauen, with this name <note place="margin">Thus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam doth. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.</note> written vpon it, <hi>The gift of God.</hi>

troubles, &amp; there is no peace com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable vnto her, but the peace of conscience.</p>
                  <p>Now it must needes be, that Mariage, which was ordeined of such an excellent Author, and in such a happie place, and of such an auncient time, and after such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table order, must likewise haue speciall causes for the ordenance of it. Therefore the holie Ghost doth shewe vs three causes of this Vnion. One is, the propagation <note place="margin">Three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 27.</note> of children, signified in that when <hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>He created them male and female,</hi> not both male, nor both female, but one male, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther female, as if he created them fit to propagate other. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he had created them so, to shewe that propagation of children is one ende of Mariage, he saide vnto them, <hi>Increase and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28.</note>


                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:4337:14"/>
                     <hi>multiplie,</hi> that is, bring forth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as other creatures bring forth their kinde. For this cause Marriage is called <hi>Matrimonie,</hi> which signifieth Mothers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Why Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.</hi>
                     </note> it makes them Mothers, which were Virgins before: and is the seminarie of the worlde, without which, all things should <note place="margin">Without Mariage, all things should be vaine.</note> be in vaine, for want of men to vse them, for God reserueth the great Citie to himselfe, and this suburbs he hath set out to vs, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents by sea and by lande. If chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be such a chiefe end of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, then it seemes, that where there can be no hope of children, for age or other causes, there Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage <note place="margin">This is signified in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 1.</note> is not so lawfull, because it is maimed of one of his ends, and seemes rather to be sought for wealth, or for lust, than for this blessing of children. It is not good

                  <p>The second cause is to auoide <note place="margin">The second cause.</note> fornication: this <hi>Paule</hi> signifieth, when he saith, <hi>For the auoiding of</hi>

But foure <note place="margin">1.

If any might haue a dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation heerein, it seemes the King might be priuiledged before any other, because of succession to the

Crowne, if his wife should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be barren. And yet the King is forbidden to take many wiues in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 17. as well as <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 17. 1.

And another saith, that the name of his second wife doth signifie a shadowe, because she was not a wife, but the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of a wife: for this cause the Scripture neuer biddeth man to loue his wiues, but to loue his Wife, and sayeth, <hi>They shall be two in one fleshe,</hi> not three, nor <note place="margin">Math. 9. 5.</note> foure, but onely two.

we reade not in all the Scripture <note place="margin">Bastards.</note> of one Bastard that came to any good, but onely <hi>Iphtah,</hi> and to <note place="margin">Iud. 11. 1.</note> shewe that no inheritance did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <note place="margin">They might be saued, but they had the marke of a cursse.</note> to them in heauen, they had no inheritance in earth, neyther were counted of the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as other were. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 2.</p>
                  <p>Now, because Marriage was appointed for a remedie against fornication, therefore the lawe of God inflicted a sorer punishment <note place="margin">Leuit. 20. 10.

are married together, before they marrie themselues? For none of these Martiall, and clowdie, and whining Marriages can saye that Godlinesse was inuited to their Bridall; and therfore the blessings which are promised to godlinesse doo flie from them.</p>
                  <p>Now in this choice, are two questions. First, whether children may marrie without their parents <note place="margin">Parents consent in marriage.</note> consent: and the second, whether they may marrie with Papists or Atheists, &amp;c.

consent, then our heauenly Father gaue his consent: God supplied the place of the Father, &amp; brought <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 22.</note> his Daughter vnto her Husband, and euer since, the Father after the same manner, hath offred hys Daughter vnto the Husband.</p>
                  <p>Beside, there is a Lawe, that if a man deflowre a Virgin, he shall <note place="margin">Exod. 22. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                     </note> marrie her: but if the Father of the Virgin do not like of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, then he shall pay vnto her the dowrie of Virgins, that is, so much as her Virginitie is estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, so that the Father might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Mariage, or forbid it.</p>
                  <p>Againe, there is a Law, that if <note place="margin">Num. 30. 6.</note> any free man, or free woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make a vow, it must be kept. But if a Virgin make a vow, it should not be kept, vnlesse her Father ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue it, because she is not free: therefore if she did vow to marry,


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4337:29"/>
yet the Father hath power by this Lawe to breake it. Therefore the Lawe speaketh vnto the Father saying, <hi>Thou shale not take a Wife for</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Deut 7. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>thy sonne of straungers.</hi> Therefore <hi>Paule</hi> speaketh to the Father, <hi>If</hi>

                     <hi>thou giue thy daughter to mariage, thou doest well:</hi> therefore <hi>Iobs</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">Iob. 1. 3. &amp; 10.</note> are counted part of <hi>Iobs</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, shewing, that as a man hath the disposition of his owne sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, so he hath the disposition of his owne children. Therefore in <hi>Math.</hi> 22. 30. the Wife is sayd to be bestowed in mariage, which signifieth, that some did giue her beside her selfe: Therefore it is said, that <hi>Iacob</hi> serued <hi>Laban,</hi> that <note place="margin">Gen. 29. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Laban</hi> might giue him his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to wife. Therefore <hi>Saule</hi> saith <note place="margin">1.

to <hi>Er</hi> his sonne. Therefore <hi>Sichem</hi> saith to his Father, Get me this <note place="margin">Gen. 34. 9.</note> maide to Wife. Therefore in the mariage of <hi>Isaak,</hi> we see <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> seruant in the place of <hi>Isaak,</hi> and <hi>Rebeccah</hi> the maid and her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <note place="margin">Gen. 24. 51. 52. 53.</note> sitting in parliament toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: therefore <hi>Sampson,</hi> though he had found a maid to his liking, <note place="margin">Iud. 14. 2.</note> yet he would not take her to wife, before he had tould his parents, and craued their assent. It is a sweete wedding, when the Father and the Mother bring a blessing to the feast, and a heauie vnion which is cursed the first day that it is knit. The parents commit their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Tutors, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are more than Tutors. If children may not make other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts without their good will, shall they contract mariage which haue nothing to maintain it after,


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4337:30"/>
vnlesse they returne to begge of them whome they skorned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Will you take your fathers money, and will you not take his instruction? Marriage hath neede of many counsellers, and doest thou count thy Father too many? which is like the foreman of thy instructers. If you mark what kind of youths they be, which haue such haste, that they dare not stay for their parents aduice, they are such as hunt for nothing but beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and for punishment hereof, they marrie to beggerie, and lose their Father and Mother for their Wife: therefore honour thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in this, as thou wouldest that thy children should honour thee.</p>
                  <p>The second question is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of <hi>Paule,</hi> when he saith, <hi>Be not</hi>

so we should not be yoked with Papists, and so we should not be yoked with Atheists, for that also is to be vnequally yoked, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we be Atheists too.

may liue being married. If adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie may separate marriage, shal not idolatry hinder marriage, which is worse than it? Christ saith, <hi>Let</hi>

Shall I say, <hi>Be my Wife,</hi> to whome I may not saye <hi>Be my Companion?</hi> Or, <hi>Come to my bed,</hi> to whome I may not say, <hi>Come to my table?</hi> How should my marriage speede well, when I marrie one to whome I <note place="margin">2.

For Tempter is his name, and <note place="margin">Math. 4. 3.</note> to tempt is his nature. When a

our Spouse must bee like Christs Spouse, but Christs Spouse is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Harlot nor Heretick, nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist. If she bee poore, the Lord reprooueth not for that: if she bee weake, the Lord reprooueth not for that: if she bee hard fauoured, the Lord reprooueth not for that: but none giueth any dispensation <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 4.</note> for godlines but the diuell.

In the 2. of <hi>Iob,</hi> it is <note place="margin">Iob. 2. 9. &amp; 3. 1.</note> obserued of the patient man, that hee did not curse the day of his birth, vntill his wife brake foorth into blasphemie: shewing, that

wicked wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are able to change the stedfastest man, more than all temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s beside. <hi>Sampson</hi> would take a <hi>Philistian</hi> to wife, but he lost <note place="margin">Iud. 14.</note> his honour, his strength, and his life by her, least any should doo the like. But what a notable warning is that in 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 21. 6. where the holy Ghost saith, <hi>Iehoram</hi> walked <note place="margin">2.

Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is that man which is fettered with a woman that liketh not his religion, for she will be nibling at his prayer, and at his studie, and at his meditations, till she haue tyred his deuotions, and turned the edge of his soule, as <hi>Michol</hi> tried <hi>Dauid,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Sam. 6. 16.</note> she mocked him for his zeale, and liked her self in her folly. Therfore

as Christ saieth, <hi>Remember Loths</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet the chiefest point is behind, <note place="margin">The due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</note> that is your dueties. The dueties of Mariage may be reduced to the dueties of Man and Wife one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another, and their dueties towarde their children, and their dueties toward their seruants. For themselues, saieth one, they must think that they are like two birds, the one is the Cock, and the other <note place="margin">The man and wife like cock and dam.</note> is the Dam: the Cocke flieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4337:34"/>
to bring in, the Dam sitteth vpon the nest to keepe al at home. So God hath made the man to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile abroade, and the woman to keepe home: and so their nature, and their wit, and their strength are fitted accordingly; for the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s pleasure is most abroade, and the womans within.</p>
                  <p>In euery state there is some one vertue which belongeth to that calling more than other; as Iustice to Magistrates, and Knowledge to Preachers, and Fortitude to Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: so loue is the Marriage ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which sings Musicke to their whole life. Wedlocke is made of two loues, which I may call the <note place="margin">Mariage compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of two loues.</note> first loue, and the after loue. As e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man is taught to loue GOD before he be bid to loue his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; so they must loue God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can loue one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:4337:35"/>
To shew the loue which should bee betweene man and wife, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is called <hi>Coniugium,</hi> which signifieth a knitting or ioining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: shewing, that vnlesse there be a ioyning of harts, and knitting of affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s together, it is not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage indeed, but in shew &amp; name, and they shall dwell in a house like two poysons in a stomack, &amp; one shall euer be sicke of the other.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, first that they may loue, and keepe loue one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, it is necessarie that they both loue God, and as their loue increaseth toward him, so it shall increase each to other.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:4337:38"/>
and the toong, and the eare, are in the head to direct the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, so the man should be stored with wisedome, and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and knowledge, and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to direct his whole familie, for it is not right that the worse should rule the better, but that the better should rule the worse, as the best rules all. The husband saith, that his wife must obay him because he is her better, therefore if he let her be better than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he seemes to free her from her obedience, and binde himselfe to obey her.</p>
                  <p>His first duty is called <hi>Harting,</hi> that is, hartie affection. As they <note place="margin">The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands first dutie.</note> are handfasted, so they must be hartfasted, for the eye, and the toong, and the hand, will be her enemies, if the hart be not her friend. As Christ draweth all the


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4337:38"/>
Commandements to Loue, so I may draw all their duties to loue, which is the hearts gift to the Bride. First, hee must choose his loue, and then he must loue hys choice, this is the oyle which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all things casie. In <hi>Salomons Song,</hi> which is nothing else but a description of Christ the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, and the Church hys Spouse, one calleth the other <hi>Loue,</hi> to shewe, that though both doe not honour alike, yet both should loue alike, which the man may do without subiection.</p>
                  <p>The man is to his wife, in the <note place="margin">Vnderstand in his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage only.</note> place of Christ to his Church: therefore the Apostle requireth such an affection of him toward his Spouse, as Christ beareth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his Spouse: for he sayeth, <hi>Husbands loue your Wiues as Christ</hi>

                     <hi>loued the congregation,</hi> that is, with


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4337:39"/>
a holie loue, with a hartie loue, and with a constant loue, as the Church wold be loued of Christ. Will not a man loue his glorie? Why <hi>Paule</hi> calleth the woman <hi>the glorie of the man,</hi> for her reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 7.</note> makes him to be reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and her praise, makes him to be praised. Therefore he which loueth not his Wife, loueth his shame, because she is his glorie. In <hi>Ephes. 5. 28. Paule</hi> saith, <hi>He which loueth his Wife, loueth himselfe,</hi> for <note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 28.</note> thereby he inioyeth peace and comfort, and helpe to himselfe in all his affaires: therefore in the same verse <hi>Paule</hi> counselleth hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to loue their wiues as their bodies. And after, in the 33. verse, as though it were too little to loue them as their bodies, he sayth, <hi>Let euerie one loue his Wife as himselfe,</hi> that is, body and soule too. For if


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4337:39"/>
God commaunded men to loue their neighbours as themselues, <note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 18.</note> much more are they bound to loue their wiues as themselues, which are their next neighbours. As <hi>Elkanah</hi> did not loue his wife <note place="margin">1. Sam. 1. 8.</note> lesse for her barrennes, but sayd, <hi>Am not I better vnto thee than tenne sonnes?</hi> as though he fauoured her more, for that which she thought her selfe despised. So a good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band will not take occasion to loue his wife lesse for her infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but comfort her more for them, as this man did, that she may beare with his infirmities too. When Christ sayth, <hi>that a man</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mar. 10. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>should leaue Father and Mother, to cleaue to his Wife,</hi> hee signifieth, how Christ left his Father for his Spouse, and that man doth not loue his wife so much as he should vntill he affect her more than euer


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4337:40"/>
he did his father or mother. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when GOD bad <hi>Abraham</hi> forsake all his kindred: yet he bad him not forsake his Wife. As <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 1.</note> though the other somtime might be forsaken for God, but the wife must bee kept for GOD, like a charge which bindeth for tearme of life.</p>
                  <p>His next duetie to loue, is a fruit <note place="margin">The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond duty.</note> of his loue, that is, to let all things be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon betweene them, which were priuate before. The man &amp; wife are partners like two owers <note place="margin">Man and Wise are two part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> in a boate, therefore hee must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide offices, and affaires, &amp; goods with her, causing her to bee feared and reuerenced, and obeied of her children &amp; seruants like himselfe; for she is as an vnder officer in his Common weale, and therefore she must be assisted &amp; borne out, like his deputie, as the Prince standeth


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4337:40"/>
with his Magistrates for his owne quiet, because they are the legges which beare him vp. To shew this communitie betweene husband and wife, he is to maintaine her as he dooth himselfe, because Christ saith, <hi>They are no more two but one.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mar. 10. 8.</note> Therefore when hee maintaineth her, hee must thinke it but one charge, because he maintaineth no moe but himself, for they two are one. He may not say as Husbands are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to say, that which is thine is mine, and that which is mine is my owne: but that which is mine is thine, and my selfe too. For as it is sayd, <hi>He which hath giuen vs his</hi>

                     <hi>Sonne, can he denie vs any thing?</hi> So she may say, he which hath giuen me himselfe, can he denie me any thing? The bodie is better than the goodes; therefore if the bodie be mine, the goods are mine too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:4337:41"/>
Lastly, hee must tender her as much as all her friends, because he <note place="margin">The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands last duety.</note> hath taken her from her friends, and couenanted to tender her for them all. To shew how he should tender her, <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Honour the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>woman as the weaker vessell.</hi> As we doo not handle glasses like pots, because they are weaker vessels, but touch the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nicely and softly for feare of cracks; so a man must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate his wife with gentlenes and softnes; not expecting that wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, nor that faith, nor that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, nor that strength in the weaker vessell, which should be in the stronger; but thinke when he takes a wife he takes a Vineyard, not grapes, but a vineyard to beare him grapes: therfore he must sow it, and dresse it, and water it, and fence it, and thinke it a good vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard if at last it bring forth grapes.


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4337:41"/>
So hee must not looke to finde a wife without a fault, but thinke that she is committed to him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime her from her faults; for all are defectiues: and if he finde the Prouerbe true, that in space com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth grace, hee must reioyce as much at his wife when she men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, as the Husbandman reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth when his Vineyard begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to fructifie.</p>
                  <p>This is farre from ciuill warres <note place="margin">Husbands must hold their hands and Wiues their tungs.</note> betweene man and wife; in all his offices is found no office to fight.

and bitter a thing it is for man and wife to liue together in emnitie. For the first yeare after Marriage, God would not haue the husband <note place="margin">Deut. 24. 5.</note> goe to warre with his enemies, but no yeare would he haue him warre with his wife, and therfore God gaue him that yeare to stay at home and settle his loue, that hee might not warre, nor iarre after: for the God of peace dwelleth not in the house of warre. As a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note place="margin">Math. 12. 25.</note> cannot stand if it bee diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, so a house cannot stand if it bee diuided: for strife is like fire which leaues nothing but dust, &amp; smoake, and ashes behind it. We reade in the Scripture of Masters that stroke their seruants, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of any that stroke his Wife, but rebuked her. <hi>Lot</hi> was drunke <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 33.</note> when hee lay with his daughters in stead of a wife; and is he sober

After the care of their soules, they must care for their bodies; for if the labourer is worthie of his <note place="margin">Luc. 107.</note> hire which laboureth but a day, what is the seruant worth which laboureth euerie day?

It is not a base nor a vile thing to be called a seruant, for our Lord <note place="margin">Esai. 42. 1.

Beside, the name of a seruant doth not signifie suffering, but dooing:


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4337:54"/>
therefore masters must not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their hands vppon them, but set their hands to worke: and yet as God laieth no more vppon his <note place="margin">1.

For a good man (saith <hi>Salomon)</hi> is mercifull to <note place="margin">Pro. 12. 10.</note> his beast, and therefore he will be more mercifull to his brother. That man is not worthie to bee serued which cannot affoord that his seruants should serue God as well as himselfe. Giue vnto God that which is Gods, and then thou maiest take that which is thine. <hi>He which careth not for his familie,</hi> (saith <hi>Paule) is worse than an Infidel:</hi>

their care should not be too much nor too little, but conuenient, or els they are worse than Infidells too, because Couetousnes is called <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> which is worse than In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie: for it is lesse rebellion <note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 5.</note> not to honour the King, than to set vp another King against him, as the Idolaters doo against the King of heauen,</p>

                     <note place="margin">Ephe. 6. 4:</note> 
                     <hi>wrath:</hi> So I may say, Masters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke not your seruants to wrath, that is, vse such reproofes, &amp; such corrections, that you do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke them, but mooue them, that you doo not exasperate them, but win them; for reuiling words and vnreasonable fiercenes, doth more hurt than good. And therefore the


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4337:55"/>
law of God did charge the Master that hee should not inflict aboue fourtie stripes vppon his seruant, <note place="margin">Deut. 25. 2.</note> least hee should seeme despised in his eyes. For while a childe, or scholler, or seruant dooth thinke that hee is reprooued for loue, or beaten with reason, it makes him think of his fault and be ashamed: but when he seeth that he is rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with curses and beaten with staues, as though hee were hated like a dogge, his heart is hardened against the man which correcteth him, and the fault for which he is corrected, &amp; after he becommeth desperate, like a horse which tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vppon the striker: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thinke that GOD euen then chides you, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer you chide in such rage. For though there be a fault, yet some things must bee winkt at, &amp; some things forgiuen,


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4337:55"/>
and some things punished with a looke; for he which takes the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit of euery offence shall neuer rest, but vexe himselfe more than his seruant.</p>
                  <p>Further, I haue heard Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">The master must cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris her maides.</note> say, that in these punishments it is most meete and acceptable to the offender, that the man should correct his men, and the woman her maides: for a mans nature skorneth to bee beaten of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and a maides nature is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with the stripes of a man. Therefore wee reade, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 16. 6.</note> would not meddle with his maide, but committed her to his wife, and saide, <hi>Doo with her as it pleaseth thee.</hi> As if he should say, it belongeth not to me but to thee.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, we put the duetie toward <note place="margin">Their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties toward their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> children, because they come last to their hands. In Latin children


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4337:56"/>
are called <hi>Pignora,</hi> that is pledges, as if I should say, a pledge of the husbands loue to the wife, and a pledge of the wiues loue toward the husband: for there is nothing which doth so knit loue between the man and the wife, as the fruite of the wombe. Therefore when <hi>Leah</hi> began to conceaue, she sayd, <note place="margin">Gen. 28. 31.</note> now my husband will loue me, as though the husband did loue for children. If a woman haue many defects (as <hi>Leah</hi> had) yet this is the mends which she makes her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to bring him childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is the right Wedding Ring that sealeth and maketh vp as it were the Marriage. When their father and mother fall out, they pert vp betweene them like little media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and with many pretie sportes make truce when other dare not speake to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therefore now let


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4337:56"/>
vs consider what these little ones may challenge of their parents, which sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in sted of Lawiers.</p>
                  <p>The first duetie is the mothers, <note place="margin">Mothers should nurse their children. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 7.</note> that is, to nurse her childe at her owne breasts, as <hi>Sara</hi> did <hi>Isaak:</hi> &amp; therefore <hi>Esaiah</hi> ioyneth the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces name and the mothers name both in one, and calleth them <hi>nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing mothers:</hi> shewing that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should bee the nurces. So whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God chose a nurce for <hi>Moses,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Exo. 2. 8.</note> he led the handmaid of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter to his mother, as though GOD would haue none to nurse him but his mother. After, when the Sonne of God was borne, his father thought none fit to bee his <note place="margin">Math. 2. 14</note> nurse but the Virgin his mother. The fountaines of the earth are made to giue water, &amp; the breasts of women are made to giue suck. Euery beast, and euery foule, is


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4337:57"/>
bred of the same that did beare it, onely women loue to be mothers, but not nurces. Therefore if their children prooue vnnaturall, they may say thou followest thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for she was vnnaturall first in locking vp her breasts from thee, and committing thee foorth like a Cuckowe to bee hatched in the Sparowes nest. Hereof it comes that wee say, he suckt euill from the dugge, that is, as the Nurse is affected in her bodie or in her minde, commonly the childe dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the like infirmitie from her, as the egges of a Henne are altered vnder a Hawke: yet they which haue no milke can giue no milke; but whose breasts haue this perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall drought? Forsooth it is like the Gowte, no beggers may haue it, but Citizens or Gentlewomen. In the 9. of <hi>Hosee,</hi> drie breasts are


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4337:57"/>
named for a curse; what lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table hap haue Gentlewomen to light vpon this curse more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Sure if their breasts bee drie as they say, they should fast &amp; pray together that this curse might bee remooued from them.</p>
                  <p>The next duetie is, <hi>Catechize</hi>

                     <hi>child in his youth, and he will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it when he is olde.</hi> This is the right blessing which fathers and mothers giue to their children, when they cause GOD to blesse them too.

As


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4337:58"/>
the Midwife frameth the bodie when it is yong and tender, so the pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts must frame the mind while it is greene and flexible, for youth is the seede time of vertue. They which are called fathers, are called <note place="margin">Luk. 11. 2.</note> by the name of God, to warne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they are in stead of GOD to their children, which teacheth all his sonnes. What example haue children but their parents? And sure the prouidence of God doth ease their charge more than they are aware; for a childe will learne better of his father, than of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therfore we reade of no Schoolemasters in the Scripture <note place="margin">Except of Kings sons.</note> but the parents: for when Christ saith to the <hi>Iewes, If ye be the sonnes of Abraham, ye will doo the workes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iohn. 8. 30.</note> 
                     <hi>of your father Abraham.</hi> He shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that sonnes vse to walke in their fathers steps whether they


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4337:58"/>
be good or bad. It is a merueilous delight to father &amp; mother when people say that their children are like them: but if they be like them in goodnes, it is as great a delight to other as to the parents: or els wee say that they are so like, that they are worse for it. Well doth <hi>Dauid</hi> call children arrowes, for if <note place="margin">Psal. 127. 4.</note> they bee well bred they shoote at their parents enemies, &amp; if they be euill bred they shoote at their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Therfore many fathers want a staffe to stay them in their age, because they prepared none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; like olde <hi>Eli</hi> which was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected himselfe for not correcting <note place="margin">1.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Psal. 132. 11.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4337:59"/>
children which are their fruite. For this cause the <hi>Iewes</hi> were <note place="margin">1. Sam. 1. 20 2. Sam 12. 24.</note> wont to name their children so when they were borne, that euer after if they did but thinke vppon their names, they would put them in minde of that religion which they should professe, for they did signifie somthing that they should learne. An admonition to such as call their children at al aduentures, sometimes by the names of doggs euen as they prooue after. In the 1. <hi>King.</hi> 2. 2. wee haue <hi>Dauid</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing his sonnes: In <hi>Gen. 39. Iaacob</hi> correcting his sonnes: and in <hi>Iob. 1. Iob</hi> praying for his sonnes: These three put together, Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Correcting, and Praying, make good children and happie parents.</p>
                  <p>Once Christ tooke a child and set him in the middest of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4337:59"/>
and sayd, <hi>He which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luc. 18. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>the kingdome of heauen, must receiue it as a little child.</hi> Shewing that our children should bee so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, so humble, and voide of euill, that they may bee taken for examples of the children of God. Therefore in <hi>Psal.</hi> 127. 4. children are called the heritage of the Lord, to shewe that they should bee trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as though they were not mens children but Gods, that they may haue Gods heritage after. Thus if you doo, your seruants shall bee Gods seruants, and your children shall bee Gods children, and your <note place="margin">Col. 4. 15. Phil. 1. 2.</note> house shall be Gods house, like a little Church when others are like a den of theeues.</p>
                  <p>Now I speake to one which is <note place="margin">The name of Stepmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and their duetie.</note> a mother so soone as she is maried: therefore peraduenture you looke that I should shewe the duetie of


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:4337:60"/>
stepmothers. Their name dooth shewe them their duetie too; for a stepmother dooth signifie a sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, that is, one mother dyeth, &amp; another commeth in her stead; therfore that your loue may settle to those little ones as it ought, you must remember that you are their stedmother, that is, in sted of their mother, &amp; therfore to loue them, and tender them, and cherish them as their mother did. Further, these children are Orphanes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you must not onely regarde them as children, but as Orphane children. Now, God requireth a greater care ouer Widdowes and <note place="margin">Ier. 22. 2. Deut. 14. 17. &amp; 24. 17. &amp; 26. 12.</note> Orphanes, than ouer any other women or children. Lastly, you must remember that saying, <hi>As you measure vnto other, so it shall be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat 7. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>measured to you againe.</hi> That is, as you intreate these children, so an


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4337:60"/>
other may come after and intreate your children; for he which hath taken away the first mother, and sent you, can take away the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond mother and send a third, which shall not bee like a stedmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to yours, vnlesse you be like a stedmother to these.</p>
                  <p>If these dueties bee performed in Marriage, then I need not speak <note place="margin">Diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the phisicke of Marriage.</note> of Diuorcement, which is the rod of Marriage, and diuideth them which were one flesh, as if the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and soule were parted a sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But because all performe not their Wedlocke vowes, therfore hee which appoynted Marriage, hath appoynted Diuorcement, as <note place="margin">Math. 18. 9.</note> it were taking our priuiledge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs when we abuse it. As God hath ordained remedies for euery dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, so he hath ordained a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for the disease of Marriage.


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4337:61"/>
The disease of Marriage is Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, and the medicine hereof is Diuorcement. <hi>Moses</hi> licenced the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to depart for hardnes of heart, but <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 8</note> Christ licenseth them to depart for no cause but Adulterie. If they might bee separated for discorde, some would make a commoditie of strife; but now they are not best to bee contentious, for this lawe will hold their noses together, till wearines make them leaue strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, like two spaniels which are coupled in a chaine, at last they learne to goe together, because they may not goe a sunder. As no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might part friends, <hi>But if thine eye offend thee pull it cut,</hi> that <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 32.</note> is, if thy friend bee a tempter: so <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 9.</note> nothing may dissolue Marriage but Fornication, which is the breach of Marriage: for Marriage is ordained to auoid Fornication, <note place="margin">1<hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10.</note>


                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:4337:61"/>
and therefore if the condition bee broken, the obligation is voide. And beside, so long as all her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are his children, she must needes be his wife, because the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother are man &amp; wife: but when her children are not his children, she seemes no more to be his wife but the others, whose children she beares, and therefore to be diuorsed from him. In all the old Testament we reade of no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce betweene any, which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they liued chaster tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we: yet no doubt this lawe was better executed amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst vs. Such a care God hath had in al ages &amp; callings to prouide for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which liue honestly: for Diuorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not instituted for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, but for the chast, least they should bee tied to a plague while they liue. As for the Adulterer


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4337:62"/>
and Adulteresse he hath assigned <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Leu.</hi> 20. 10.</note> death to cut them off, least their breath should infect others. Thus he which made Marriage, did not make it vnseparable, for then Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage were a seruitude. But as Christ saith of the Sabaoth, <hi>The Sabaoth was made for man,</hi> that is, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. 27.</note> for the benefite of man, and not for the hinderance of man: so Marriage was made for man, that is, for the honour of man, and not for the dishonour of man: but if Marriage should turne to Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Louît.</hi> 20. 10.</note> and when it is turned to Fornication, there might be no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, then Marriage were not for the honour of man, but for the trouble and griefe and dishonour of man. Therefore now ye haue heard how Diuorcement is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for a remedie of Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, if any bee ashamed of this


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4337:62"/>

In my opinion there is one saying of <hi>Paule,</hi> which is the profitablest sentence in all the <note place="margin">A sentence for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to think vpon.</note> Scripture, for Man and Wife to meditate often, and examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they finde it in themselues as they doo in other, least their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage turne to sinne, which should further them in godlinesse.

Therefore it followeth in the next <note place="margin">

As the corps of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael</hi> made the passengers to stand, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 23.</note> so I haue placed this sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the doore of thy passage, to make thee stande and consider what thou doest before thou marriest. For this is the scope and operation of it, to call the minde to a solemne meditation, and warne him to liue in Marriage as in a temptation, which is like to make him worse than he was, as the Marriage of <hi>Iehoram</hi> did, if he vse not <hi>Iobs</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatiue <note place="margin">2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 21. 6. <hi>Iob.</hi> 9. 28.</note> to bee ielous ouer all his life. The allureme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of beautie, the troubles about riches, the charges of children, the losses by seruants, the vnquietnes of neighbours crie vnto him that hee is entered into the hardest vocation of all other:


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4337:64"/>
and therefore they which haue but nine yeares prentiship to make them good Mercers or Drapers, haue nineteene yeares before Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to learne to bee good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Wiues, as though it were a trade of nothing but My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, and had neede of double time ouer all the rest. Therefore so often as you thinke vppon this saying, thinke whether you bee examples of it, and it will waken you, and chide you, and leade you a straight path, like the Angell which led the seruant of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>

receiue; I thought it the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest doctrine to preach of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; which is a witnesse of Gods promises, a remembrance of Christs death, and a seale of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption: therefore Christ hath not instituted this Sacrament for a fashion in his Church to touch, and feele, and see, as we gaze vpon pictures in the windowes, but as the woman which had the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 20.</note> issue, touching the hemme of Christs garment, drewe vertue from Christ himselfe because she beleeued: So Christ would that wee touching these signes, should drawe vertue from himselfe, that is, al the graces which these signes represent. Therefore as the <hi>Leuits</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Chro. 35. 6.</note> vnder the Lawe, were bound to prepare their brethren before they came to the Passeouer; so Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Gospell should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare


<pb facs="tcp:4337:67"/>
their brethren before they come to the Supper of the Lord. For which purpose I haue chosen this place to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which is the cleerest and fullest declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament in all the Scripture.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Touching the author, he which <note place="margin">The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note> is signified by it, was the author of it. <hi>The Lord Iesus</hi> hath bid vs to

Supper, <hi>I am not worthie</hi> (sayeth <hi>Iohn) to loose his shoe;</hi> so wee are not worthie to waite at his tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, <note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 27.</note> and yet he will haue vs sit at his table.

When Christ came the Passeouer ceased, because he is our Passeouer, that is, the Lambe by whose blood we <note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 29.</note> are saued. When Christ came, Circumcision ceased, because he is our Circumcision, that is, the purifier and clenser of our sinnes. <note place="margin">Reuel. 7. 14.</note> Now these two Sacraments are fulfilled, he hath appoynted two other Sacraments for them in sted of the paschal Lambe, which the <hi>Iewes</hi> did eate, he hath giuen vs an other Lambe to eate, which <hi>Iohn</hi> calleth <hi>the Lambe of God,</hi> that is <note place="margin">Iohn. 1. 29.</note> himselfe, vppon whome all doo


<pb facs="tcp:4337:68"/>
feede, whosoeuer doo receiue this Sacrament with an assured faith that Christ died to possesse them of life. The breaking of the bread, doth signifie the wounding of his bodie: the powring of the Wine dooth signifie the shedding of his bloud. The eating of the bread, and drinking of the Wine, dooth signifie that his flesh and bloud do nourish in vs life eternall, as the bread and Wine doo nourish the life present.</p>
                     <p>Instead of Circumcision, which began at <hi>Abraham,</hi> he hath ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Gen. 17. 10.</note> Baptisme, which began at <hi>Iohn,</hi> a more liuely representation <note place="margin">Who was therefore called Iohn the Baptist. <hi>Math. 3. 1.

                     <p>Touching the time: <hi>In the night</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The time.</note>


                        <pb facs="tcp:4337:69"/>
(saith <hi>Paule)</hi> therefore this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is called <hi>The Lords Supper,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Vers. 23.</note> because it was instituted at night when they vsed to suppe. But what night? <hi>euen that night</hi> (sayth <hi>Paule) when he was betrayed:</hi> that night which he should haue cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as <hi>Iob</hi> did the day of his birth, <note place="margin">Iob. 3. 3.</note> if he had suffred against his will: that night when he should haue thought to destroy men, as men conspired to destroy him, <hi>that night</hi> (saith <hi>Paule)</hi> this Sacrament of grace, and peace, and life began. <hi>Euen that night when we betrayed him.</hi> Many nights did he spend in watching, and praying for vs, and is there a night now for vs to kill and betray him? That was a dark night, when men went about to put out the Sunne which brought them light. Who can but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to see how Christ, and they


<pb facs="tcp:4337:69"/>
for whome Christ came, were occupied at one time? when they deuised mischiefe against him, and sought all meanes to destroy him, then he consulted how to saue them, and instituted the same night this blessed Sacrament, to conuay al his graces and blessings vnto them, <hi>Euen that night when they betrayed him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reason why this action was <note place="margin">Why this Sacrament was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted at night.</note> deferred vntill night, is, because that was the time appointed by the Lawe to eate the Passeouer, which was like a predecessor of this Sacrament. The reason why <note place="margin">Why it was defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red till his last night.</note> he deferred vntill his last night, was, because the Passeouer could not be ended, before the fulnesse of time, and the true Paschall Lamb were come to be slaine in stead of the other. Therefore how fitly did Christ end the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:70"/>
which was a signe of his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering so presently before his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering? And beside, how sweetly did hee confirme his Disciples faith, when as they should see that the next day performed before their eyes, which ouernight both in the Passeouer, and in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was so liuely resembled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. If any from this do ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we ought to eate the Lords Supper at night as Christ <note place="margin">Why we receiue not the Lords Supper at night.</note> did, he must vnderstand that we haue not the same cause to doe so which Christ had, because of the Passeouer. And therefore the Church which hath discretion of times and places, hath altered both the time, and the place, vsing the temples in stead of the chamber, and the morning in stead of the euening: for indifferent things are ruled by order and decencie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:4337:70"/>
Touching the manner, <hi>He tooke</hi>

                        <hi>bread, and when he had giuen thankes, he brake it, and gaue it vnto them.</hi> He would not eate it, nor breake it, before he had giuen thanks to God. What neede he which was God, giue thanks to God, but to shew vs what we should do, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we eate our selues? <hi>In all things giue thanks</hi> (saith <hi>Paule)</hi> whereby <note place="margin">1. Thess. 5. 18.</note> we declare, that all things come from God: but the wicked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue <note place="margin">Note.</note> easier that God doth take, than that he doth giue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they neuer pray hartely vnto him for any thing, nor feelingly thanke him for it. For which the Lord complaineth, saying: <hi>I haue</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mala. 1. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>loued you, yet yee say, wherein hast thou loued vs?</hi> shewing, that wee are worse than the Oxe, which <note place="margin">Esai. 1 3.</note> knoweth his feeder. And if wee acknowledge all things fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:71"/>
yet we do like <hi>Lot,</hi> Is it not a little <note place="margin">Gen. 19. 20.</note> one (saith he) when hee craued to goe vnto <hi>Zoar,</hi> as though it were not much which he asked: so we mince and extenuate the gifts of God, before we receiue them and after; like them which haue a grace for dinner, and none for breakefast, as though they had their dinners from God, and breakefasts of their owne. Our example did not so: Although it was but bread which he receiued, yet he was more thankefull for bread, than many which burie the fowles, and fishes, and beasts, in their belly: for if a count of all were kept, for one that prayeth <hi>Giue vs this day our dayly bread,</hi> a hundreth take their bread, and <note place="margin">Luk. 11. 3.</note> meate, and sleepe too, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer pray for it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>After he had giuen thankes, hee


<pb facs="tcp:4337:71"/>
brake it, and gaue vnto them, and sayd, Take, eate:</hi> for when he had giuen thanks to God, then it was sanctified, and blessed, and lawfull to eate. So, when thou seruest <note place="margin">Note.</note> God, then it is lawfull for thee to vse Gods blessings, then thou mayest eate and drinke as Christ did, but not before, for these things were created to serue them which serue God; if thou doest not serue him for them, thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crochest vppon Gods blessings, and stealest his creatures, which are no more thine, than thou art his, for the good God created all things for good men, as the diuels possessions are reserued for euill men. Therefore as Christ would not breake the bread, before he had giuen thanks to the founder, so know, that there is some thing to be done, before thou receyue


<pb facs="tcp:4337:72"/>
any benefite of God, and presume not to vse his creatures with more libertie than his Sonne did, which did not eate without giuing tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks nor rise againe without singing of a Psalme. <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 30.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>It followeth, <hi>This is my bodie.</hi> Here is the fruite of his thankes before, he praied that the bread &amp; wine might bee blessed, and they were blessed. As <hi>Isaacs</hi> blessing shewed it self vpon <hi>Iaacob</hi> whom <note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> he blessed; so Christs blessing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared straight vpon these myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: for it could not bee sayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>this is my bodie,</hi> because it was meere bread; but now it may bee called his bodie, because his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing hath infused that vertue into it, that it doth not onely represent his bodie, but conuey his bodie, and himselfe vnto vs. The effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of this blessing is in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb facs="tcp:4337:72"/>
euer since, sanctifying it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs as well as it did to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, euen as Christs prayer staied <note place="margin">Luk 22. 32.</note> 
                        <hi>Peters</hi> faith after Christ was dead.</p>
                     <p>Because vpon these words the Papists ground their Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanciation, that is, that the bread is chaunged into Christs flesh, and the Wine is turned into Christs blood, whereby we eate the same bodie which died vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Crosse, and drinke the same blood which issued out of his side, that you may see the blindnesse of this Popish dreame, I would haue you but marke euerie word of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture how they make against Tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substanciation, that you may see them slaine like <hi>Goliah</hi> with their <note place="margin">1. Sam 17. 51.</note> owne sword. Euen as GOD made <hi>Caiphas</hi> speake against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; <note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 14.</note> so the Scriptures which he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes alleage, doo make against


<pb facs="tcp:4337:73"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, like the <hi>Baalites</hi> which <note place="margin">1. King. 18. 28.</note> wounded their owne flesh. I may liken their allegations to Sathans, when hee tempted Christ in the Wildernesse, he alleaged but one <note place="margin">Math. 4. 4.</note> sentence of Scripture for himself, and that Psalme out of which he <note place="margin">Psal. 91. 11.</note> borrowed it, makes so plaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, that hee was faine to picke here a worde, and there a worde, and leaue out that which went before, and skip in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, and omit that which came after, or els hee had marred his cause. The Scripture is so holie, and pure, and true, that no word, nor sillable thereof can make for the diuell, or for sinners, or for he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks: yet as the diuell alleaged Scripture, though it made not for him, but against him; so doo the Libertines, and Epicures, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes, as though they had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned


<pb facs="tcp:4337:73"/>
at his schoole. Now there is no sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the scripture, which the wiser Papists aledge bouldly for their Transubstantiation, but this, that Christ sayd, <hi>This is my</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Math. 26. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>body,</hi> by which they may proue as well that Christ is a dore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he sayth, <hi>I am the dore:</hi> or a <note place="margin">Ioh. 107 9.</note> Vine, because he sayth, <hi>I am a Vine,</hi> for his sayings are like. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue <note place="margin">Ioh. 15 1.</note> speeches, must not bee construed literally, but this is He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes fashion. If you marke, you shall see thorough out, that all the testimonies which the Papists a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for their heresies, are eyther tropes, or figures, or allegories, or parables, or allusions, or darke speeches; which when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to expound allegorically, or literally, without conference of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scriptures, then they wander, and stray from the marke, or else


<pb facs="tcp:4337:74"/>
it is impossible, that the trueth should mainteyne error, that is, that the scripture should speake for heresie, if it were not peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: therefore we see that <hi>Eue</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 3.</note> erred, vntill she corrupted the text.</p>
                     <p>Now we will enter the lists with our aduersaries, and see whether these words doo proue that the bread and wine are tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Arguments against Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> into Christes bodye. <hi>Paule</hi> sayth, <hi>Iesus tooke bread:</hi> well then, yet it is bread: when he had taken it, then he blessed it, what did he blesse? the bread which he tooke, <note place="margin">1</note> well then, yet it is bread: when he had blessed it, then he brake it, what did he breake? the bread which he blessed, well then, yet it is bread: when he had broken it, then he gaue it, what did he giue? the bread which he brake,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:74"/>
well then, yet it is bread: when he had giuen it, then they did eate it, what did they eate? the bread which he gaue them, well then, yet it is bread: when they did eate it, then he sayd, <hi>this is my body:</hi> what did he call his body? the bread which they did eate, well then, yet it is bread. If it be bread all this while, when he did take it, and blesse it, and breake it, &amp; giue it, and they did eate it, when is it turned into his body? heere they stande like the Sadduces, as mute <note place="margin">Math. 22. 34.</note> as fisshes.</p>
                     <p>Now that ye may see that not we only say it is bread and wine after the consecration, in the 27. verse Christ himselfe doth call it bread and wine after he had giuen it, as he did before. And in <hi>Marke</hi> hee sayeth, <hi>I will drinke no more</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mar. 14. 25</note> 
                        <hi>of the fruit of the Vine.</hi> Here Christ


<pb facs="tcp:4337:75"/>
saith, that it was the fruite of the Vine which he dranke, but his bloud is not the fruite of Vines, but Wine, therefore Wine was his drinke, and not bloud.</p>
                     <p>Beside, if you would heare <hi>Paule</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2</note> expound Christ, he sheweth, that all our Fathers had the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 4.</note> of Christ in their Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that we haue in ours, for he sayth, <hi>They all did eate the same</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Vers. 3. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>spirituall meate, and all drinke the same spirituall drinke.</hi> Straight he sayth, <hi>that this meate and this drinke</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Vers. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>was Christ.</hi> Marke that he sayeth not onely, <hi>They did eate the same meate</hi> that we eate, but he sayth, <hi>that this meate was Christ:</hi> and not onely so, but to shew that Christ is not a corporall meate, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists say: he sayth, he is a spirituall meate, as we say; therefore you see that we doo not eate him corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:75"/>
no more than our Fathers, but that as they did eate him spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, so doo we; for spirituall meate must be eaten spiritually, as corporall meate is eaten corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
                     <p>Againe, for the signes to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">3</note> into the thing signified by them, is vtterly against the nature of a Sacrament, and makes it no Sacrament, because there is no signe: for euery Sacrament dooth consist of a signe, and a thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the signe is euer an earthly thing, and that which it signifieth is a heauenly thing. This shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in all examples, as in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi> there was a very Tree for the <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 9.</note> signe, and Christ the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it.

betweene the Passeouer &amp; the Lords Supper, because this was figured by the other.

                     <p>Againe, if Christs verie bodie <note place="margin">5</note> were offered in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, then it were not a Sacrament, but a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; which two differ as much as giuing, and taking: for in a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice we giue, &amp; in a Sacrament we receiue, &amp; therfore we say our Sacrifice, and Christs Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Againe, euery Sacrifice was <note place="margin">6 Exo. 27.</note> offered vppon an Altar. Now, marke the wisedome of the Holy Ghost, least wee should take this for a Sacrifice, he neuer names Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar


<pb facs="tcp:4337:77"/>
when he speakes of it, but, <hi>the table of the Lord.</hi> Therefore it is no doubt but the diuell hath kept the name of Altar, that wee might thinke it a Sacrifice. Againe, if the bread were Christs flesh, and the wine his bloud, as these two are separate one from the other; so Christs flesh should bee separate from his bloud, but his bodie is not diuided, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it were a dead bodie. Againe, that which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth doth nourish the bodie, and relish in the mouth as it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which could not be, but that it is the same foode which it was before. Againe, I would aske, whose are this whitenesse, and hardnes, and roundnes, and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? None of them say that it is the whitenesse, and hardnesse, and roundnes, and coldnes of Christs bodie: therefore it must needes


<pb facs="tcp:4337:77"/>
bee the whitenesse, and hardnesse, and roundnes, and coldnes of the bread, or els qualities should stand without substances, which is, as if one should tell you of a house without a foundation. Againe, as Christ dwelleth in vs, so he is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of vs, but he dwelleth in vs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by saith, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3. 17. Therefore he is eaten only by faith. Againe, none can bee saued, without the communion of the bodie: but if all should communicate with it corporally, then neither infants nor any of our fathers, the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes or the Prophets should bee saued, because they receiued it not so.</p>
                     <p>Againe, Christ saith not, <hi>this wine,</hi> but <hi>this cup,</hi> and therefore by their conclusion, not onely the wine should be turned into bloud, but the cup too.</p>

is a myracle, they must shewe vs a signe, for euery myracle may bee seene, like all the myracles of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and Christ, and the Apostles: and therefore a myracle is called a signe, because it may be seene like <note place="margin">Exo. 4. 8. &amp; 21.</note> a signe, and the word signifieth a wonder, as though wee did see something to wonder. And the <hi>Iewes</hi> crauing a myracle, said, <hi>Shew vs a myracle:</hi> as though they were <note place="margin">Exo. 6.</note> taught to iudge of myracles by sight.

                     <p>Againe, a myracle (especially in the time of the Gospell) is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie thing, but they make this an ordinarie thing: for if the bread &amp; wine turned into flesh &amp; bloud, then myracles are as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as Sacraments, &amp; so because they haue Masse euerie day, they


<pb facs="tcp:4337:81"/>
should work myracles euery day. Lastly, this seemeth straunge, that <hi>Augustine,</hi> whom they so much honour, gathered all the myracles which are written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet amongst all, speakes not of this; therefore then it was counted no myracle: but <hi>Paule</hi> speakes of <hi>lying myracles,</hi> and this <note place="margin">2.

                     <p>If they say that Christ can turne <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> Bread and Wine into his bodie, and therefore he doth. First they <note place="margin">Answ.</note> must prooue that he will: for they can doo many things themselues which they doo not, because they will not: therefore it is an old an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that from <hi>Can to Will,</hi> no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument followeth.

                     <p>But the question which they thinke cannot bee answered, like


<pb facs="tcp:4337:82"/>
their inuincible Nauies, is this. If the Bread bee not his bodie, why <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> doth he call it his bodie? Resolue this knot and all is cleere.

                        <hi>for you.</hi> Why? his bodie was not broken before hee suffered, how did he say then, <hi>which is broken,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was broken? There is no sense of it but this, the Bread was broken, and signified that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die should be broken. Now, as the breaking of the Bread did signifie the breaking of his bodie, so the Bread must needes signifie his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: but as his bodie was not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken indeede when the Bread was broken, so the Bread could not bee his bodie indeed: for then his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die should haue been broken whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Bread was broken: yet let

them obiect what they can.</p>
                     <p>If (say they) the Bread &amp; Wine <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> be not changed into his bodie and bloud, why dooth hee speake so darklie? he might haue spoken pla<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:4337:83"/>
by similitudes, shewing one thing by another, which is the plainest manner of teaching, and most v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in holy Scripture, especiallie in the types and shadowes of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. For example, Christ cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Lambe the Passeouer, in <note place="margin">Math. 26. 17.</note> place wherof this Sacrament suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and therefore presentlie after they had eaten the Passeouer, Christ instituted this Sacrament to be vsed for it.

                        <hi>Israelites,</hi> and strooke the <hi>Egipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> this was not a Lambe, and yet because the Lamb was a signe of this Passeouer, as the bread and wine is of Christs body, therefore Christ called the Lambe the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>souer, as he calleth the bread and wine his body.</p>

If euery Sacrament was called by the thing which it signified, and yet neuer any Sacrament was taken for the thing it selfe, what reason haue they to take this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament for the thing it self, more than all the rest? It is the consent of all Writers that a Sacrament is a signe, therefore not the thing signified: no more than the bush at the dore, is the Wine in the seller. If I call the Prince a Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix, the Vniuersitie a Fountaine, the Court a Pecocke, the Citie a Sea, the Countrey an Eremite, why can the Papists vnderstande me, and not vnderstande Christ? What a darke, and strange, and intricat, and incredible speech had this bin for them, to vnderstande grosly, and literally? would they thinke, that they did eate Christs body, when his body stoode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb facs="tcp:4337:85"/>
them, and he had tould them before, that hys body was lyke their body? Nay, this would haue required moe words, and made them come againe, with <hi>Mayster, what is the meaning?</hi> for they were <note place="margin">Luk. 8. 9.</note> not so instructed yet before the resurrection, to beleeue euery thing without questioning, if it were contrarie to sense and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: but as they asked, who had <note place="margin">Iohn. 4. 33.</note> giuen him any meate, when he sayd that he had meate, and they could see none: so they woulde haue asked, what meate is this which wee see not? how can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of vs eate his body, and yet he hath but one body, and that body is whole when we eate it? loe, hee standeth before vs and sayth, that his body is like vnto ours, and yet he takes bread and breakes it, and giues it vnto vs to


<pb facs="tcp:4337:86"/>
eate, and when we eate it, he saith <hi>This is my body:</hi> and yet his body standeth before vs still. If his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">Luk 24. 39.</note> be like ours (as he saith) how can it be eaten and be there, for ours can not? Thus they would haue questioned, if they had not bin vsed to such phrases: but as they could vnderstand him when he called himselfe a stone, and a rocke, and a dore, and a window, and a Vine, so they could pick out his meaning, when he sayde that bread was his body: for hee had tould them before, that hee was <hi>the bread of eternall life.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iohn. 16. 5.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now the bread of eternall life is not eaten with teeth, for the body cannot eate spiritually, no more than the soule can eate corporally, and therefore hee is such a bread as is eaten with faith, and so him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe faith in the Gospell of <hi>Iohn.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 35.</note>

Marke this eating by faith, and all the strife is ended. Flesh and bloud indeede neede not faith to chewe them, for the teeth can chew them well enough. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the Bread and Wine were the body of Christ, then we need not faith to eate it, but all which haue teeth might eate Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yea, the Mice might eate it aswell as men, for they eate the same bread that we doe, aswell af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is consecrated, as before.</p>
                     <p>If this be not enough to batter the ruines of this vpstart heresie, I will come to interrogatories, and see whether they haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it by rote, or by reason. If they ground their Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these words of Christ <note place="margin">Math. 26. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>This is my body,</hi> which he spake to his Disciples, I aske them, whether they receyue that body


<pb facs="tcp:4337:87"/>
which was mortall, or that body which is glorified, because one of <note place="margin">Neyther Christs mortall body, nor his immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall body, can be in the same.</note> these bodyes they must needes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue, eyther his mortall body, or his glorified body. If they say, that it is his mortall body, the mortall body wil not profit them: for you see that mortall foode is but for this mortall life, neyther hath Christ a mortall body now to communicate vnto them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is chaunged to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall body, therefore they can not receyue the mortall bodie, because Christ hath not a mortall body to giue them. If they say that they receyue his glorified body, then they must flie from this text, for at that time Christ had no glorified body.</p>
                     <p>When this Sacrament was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, and Christ sayd <hi>This is my body,</hi> his body was not glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:87"/>
because the Sacrament was instituted before his death, and his body was glorified after his resurrection. Therefore if they receyue the same body which the Apostles receyued, as they saye they doo, they cannot receyue a glorifyed bodye, because then Christ had not a glorified body to communicate vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus the rocks and sands are of both sides them, they receyue a body ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mortall, nor immortall: if Christ hath any such body, iudge you. Here they stand like a foole, which cannot tell on his tale. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar</hi> dreamed a dreame <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 15.</note> and knew not what it meant.</p>
                     <p>Beside, I aske them to whome Christ spake when he sayd, <hi>This</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mar. 14. 24</note> 
                        <hi>is my body. Marke</hi> sayth, hee <hi>spake them,</hi> that is, to his Disciples: well then, if these wordes, <hi>This is


<pb facs="tcp:4337:88"/>
my body,</hi> were not spoken to the signes, but to the persons, not to the bread &amp; wine, but to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: as the words which follow, <hi>Do this in remembrance of mee:</hi> if <note place="margin">Christ spake not to the bred, and wine, but to his Disciples.</note> these words were not spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the bread and wine, then it is playne that they doo not change the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the bread and wine. If the nature of them be not altered, then the substance remaineth, and then wee receyue no other substance with them, because two substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cannot be in one place.</p>
                     <p>What then, is there nothing in <note place="margin">More in the Lords Supper tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bread and wine.</note> the Sacrament but bread &amp; wine, like a hungrey nunscion? Nay we say not that the Sacrament is nothing but a bare signe, or that you receyue no more than you see: for Christ sayth, that it is his body, and <hi>Paule</hi> sayth, that it is <hi>the communion of Christs body &amp; bloud.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 16.</note>


                        <pb facs="tcp:4337:88"/>
Therefore there is more in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall bread, than in common bread: though the nature be not changed, yet the vse is changed; it doth not only nourish the body as it did before, but it bringeth a bread with it which nourisheth the soule: for as sure as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue bread, so sure we receyue Christ: not only the benefits of Christ, but Christ, although not in a Popish manner: yet we are so ioyned vnto him, as though we were but one body. As the spouse <note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> doth not marry with the lands and goods, but with the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and being partaker of him, is made partaker of them: so the faithfull do not only marry with Christes benefits, but with Christ himselfe; and being partakers of him, they are made partakers of his benefits: for Christ may not


<pb facs="tcp:4337:89"/>
be deuided from his benefites, no more than the Sunne from his light. It is sayd, <hi>the Father gaue vs</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> 
                        <hi>his Sonne,</hi> and so the Sonne ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs himselfe. As the bread is a signe of his body: so the geuing of the bread is a signe of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of his bodie: like a Pellican which letteth her yong ones suck her bloud: so that we may say, the Lord enuited vs to Supper, and he himselfe was our meate. But if you aske how this is? I must aunswer, it is a mysterie: but if I could tell it, it were no myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Yet as it is sayd, when three men walked in the middest of the fornace, <hi>one like the Sonne of GOD</hi>

                        <hi>walked amongst them.</hi> So, when the faithfull receyue the Bread and Wine, one like the Sonne of God seemeth to come vnto them, which fils them with peace


<pb facs="tcp:4337:89"/>
and ioy, and grace, that they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell what it was which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, besides bread and wine. For example, thou makest a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine <note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> with thy neighbour for house or land, and receyuest in earnest a peece of goulde, that which thou receyuest is but a peece of goulde, but now it is a signe of thy bargaine, and if thou keepe not touch with him, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely it will claspe thee for all that thou art woorth, so that which thou receyuest is bread, but this bread is a signe of an other matter, which passeth bread.</p>
                     <p>Againe, thou hast an Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Another similitude.</note> in thy hand, and I aske thee, what hast thou there, and thou sayest, I haue heere an hundreth pounds: why (say I) there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but paper, inke, and waxe: oh but by this sayst thou, I will


<pb facs="tcp:4337:90"/>
recouer an hundreth pounds, that is as good. So beloued, this is as good, that vnder these signes, you receyue the virtue of Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and bloud by faith, as if you did eate his body, and drinke his bloud indeede, which is horrible to thinke that any should deuoure their God, thinking thereby to worship him, neuer any Heretike nor Idolater conceyued so grosly of their God, before the Papist. We reade of a people which did eate men, but neuer of any people which did eate their God. All the Apostles say, that it was needfull that Christ should take our flesh, but no Apostle sayth, that it is needefull that wee shoulde take Christes flesh; for all the blessings of Christ are apprehended by faith, and nothing is fit to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him whome we see not but


<pb facs="tcp:4337:90"/>
faith: and therefore one of their owne pillars said, <hi>Beleeue, and thou</hi>

                        <hi>are the breasts which gaue thee sucke,</hi> and so none should be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed but <hi>Mary:</hi> but <hi>Mary</hi> was not blessed, because Christ was in her body, but because Christ was in her hart, and least this should seme incredible vnto you, because <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is called blessed among Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. When Christ hard the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man say, <hi>Blessed are the brests which gaue thee sucke,</hi> he replied vnto her, <hi>Blessed are they which heare the word of God, and keepe it, these are my Brethren, and Sisters, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 8. 21.</note> (saith Christ) as though the rest were no kin to him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, though they were kin in earth. Thus if Christ were in thy


<pb facs="tcp:4337:91"/>
body, and thou shouldest say as this woman, <hi>Blessed is the body which hath thee in it,</hi> nay would Christ say, <hi>Blessed is the hart which hath me in it.</hi> If <hi>Mary</hi> were no whit better for hauing Christ in her armes, nor for hauing him in her body, how much better art thou, for hauing him in thy belly where thou canst not see him? must the sunne needes come to vs, or else cannot his heate and light profit vs, nay, it doth vs more good, because it is so farre off: so this sunne is gone from vs, that he might giue more light vnto vs, which made him say, <hi>It is good for you that I goe from you;</hi> therefore <note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 7.</note> away with this carnall eating of spirituall things. <hi>Many daughters haue done virtuously, but thou</hi> (saith <hi>Salomon) surpassest them all.</hi> So, <note place="margin">Pro. 31. 29.</note> many Heretikes haue spoken ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:91"/>
but this surpasseth them all, that Christ must be applied like phisicke, as though his bloud could not profit vs, vnlesse we did drinke it, and swallowe it as a potion. Is this the Papists vnion with Christ? is this the manner whereby we are made one flesh with Christ, to eate his flesh? Nay, when he tooke our flesh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and was made man, then we were vnited to him in the flesh and not now. Christ tooke our flesh, we take not his flesh, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he tooke ours, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you would knowe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christes body be in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, I say vnto you as Christ sayde vnto <hi>Thomas,</hi> touch, feele, <note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 27.</note> and see. In visible things, God hath appoynted our eyes to bee iudges, for as the spirit discerneth spirituall obiects, so sense discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth


<pb facs="tcp:4337:92"/>
of sensible obiects. As Christ taught <hi>Thomas</hi> to iudge of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, so may wee, and so shoulde they: therefore if you cannot see his bodie, nor feele his bodie, you may gather by Christes saying to <hi>Thomas,</hi> that he would not haue you beleeue that it is his bodie, for my bodie (saith Christ) may be seene, and felt. And thus Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substanciation is found a lyar.</p>
                     <p>Now if you aske mee, why Christ calleth the signe by the <note place="margin">Why christ calleth the bread his bodie.</note> name of the thing it selfe, I aske thee againe, Mayest thou saye when thou seest the picture of the Queene, this is the Queene, and when thou seest the picture of a Lion, this is a Lion: and may not Christ say when he seeth a thing like his bodie, <hi>This is my body?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shewed you before, that euery Sacrament is called by the name


<pb facs="tcp:4337:92"/>
of the thing which it doth signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and therefore why should we stumble at this, more than the rest? The reason why the signes haue the name of the things, is to strike a deeper reuerence in vs to receiue this Sacrament of Christ reuerently, sincerely, and holyly, as if Christ were there present in body and bloud himselfe. And surely, as he which defaceth the Queenes Seale, is conuicted of contempt &amp; treason to her owne person, so hee which profaneth these seales of Christ, doth not worship Christ, but despise him, and that contempt shall be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him, as if he had contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Christ himselfe. This is the reason, why Christ calleth the signes of his body, his body, to make vs take this Sacrament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:4337:93"/>
It followeth, <hi>Doo this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi> That is, these signes <note place="margin">Vers. 24.</note> shall bee a remembrance of my death: when you breake the bread you shall remember the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of my bodie; and when you drinke the wine, you shall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the shedding of my bloud. If we must do this in remembrance of Christs body, which was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken like the bread, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that his bodie is not there, because remembrance is not of things present, but of things ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, we remember not, but we see that which is before vs. This might put the Papists in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that Christ is not sacrificed now, when wee doo but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his sacrifice: this is not Christs sacrifice, but a remembrance of his sacrifice; he was sacrificed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and now he is applied, least


<pb facs="tcp:4337:93"/>
his sacrifice should bee in vaine. This was done once really, when hee offered himselfe vppon the Crosse, therfore that offering was called a sacrifice, because he was <note place="margin">If Christs body were in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, it were not a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> sacrificed indeede; but this offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is called a Sacrament, because it is but a signe of his sacrifice. If Christ in this Sacrament were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered indeed, then it should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a sacrifice as his once offering was; but because it is but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his sacrifice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called a Sacrament. This is not a sacrifice of Christ, but a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of our selues. Least wee should take it to bee a sacrifice of Christ, Christ himselfe calleth it a remembrance of his sacrifice, <hi>Doo this in my remembrance.</hi> Here is our worke as Christ hath done, so must we doo, so we minister, and so you receiue: wee can giue you


<pb facs="tcp:4337:94"/>
nothing but that which wee haue receiued from him, as <hi>Paule</hi> saith. Therefore if Christ did not giue his mortall body which stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and could not profite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor his glorified body, which was not glorified then, and when it was glorified ascended vp vnto heauen, &amp; there abideth, how can these iugling Priests make their God againe which made them? They can no more turne wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bloud, and bread into flesh, than they can commaund a Gnat to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Cammell: for it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worke to make GOD, than to make the worlde. Therefore as Christ saith, <hi>When they tell you, here</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Math. 24. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>is Christ, and there is Christ, beleeue them not:</hi> So, when they tell you that Christ is in heauen, and that Christ is in earth, in this place and that place, beleeue them not: for


<pb facs="tcp:4337:94"/>
                        <hi>Elias</hi> ascention was a figure of Christs ascention: when <hi>Elias</hi> was ascended, yet some sought for his <note place="margin">2. King. 2. 17.</note> body vpon earth: so though christ bee ascended, yet many seeke his body vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth: but as they could not finde <hi>Elias</hi> bodie, so these can not finde Christs bodie, although they haue sought 300. yeares. But if his bodie were vppon earth, as they say, should wee handle it and touch it, now it is glorified? After his resurrection he sayd to <hi>Mary,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>Touch me not,</hi> because his bodie was glorified, that is, not to bee touched with fingers any more, but with faith. Therefore wee reade of none which touched his bodie after it was risen, but onely <hi>Thomas</hi> to setle his faith. Thus you see we need to suborn no wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses; for euerie worde in this text which they alleage for Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substanciation, doth make against


<pb facs="tcp:4337:95"/>
Transubstanciation, whereby if Antichrist doth signifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are against Christ, you see who may be called Antichrist. There is no question in Poperie (except Purgatorie the Popes publican &amp; tasker) about which the Papists are at such ciuill warres among themselues, as about this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substanciation. They cannot tell when the chaunge beginneth, nor what manner of chaunge it is, nor how long the change continueth, some hang one way, and some an other, like the <hi>Midianites</hi> which <note place="margin">Iudg. 7. 22.</note> fought one against another. And no meruaile though their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences stagger about it: for to shewe you the right father of it, it was one of the dreames of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> the 3. in the yeare of our Lord 1215. so many yeares passed <note place="margin">A Monster of his age.</note> before Transubstanciatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and then a Pope set it first on


<pb facs="tcp:4337:95"/>
foote: so it came out of <hi>Rome</hi> the grandame of all heresies, and for want of Scriptures, hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with fire and sword, and swallowed more Martirs, than all the gulfes of the Papall sea beside.</p>
                     <p>Now when the doctrines of men goe for scripture, you shall <note place="margin">Eight ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note> see how many errours rush into the Church: for graunt but this to <hi>Innocentius,</hi> as the Papists doe, that the bread and wine are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into Christes bodie. First, it <note place="margin">1</note> will follow, that Christes bodie is not ascended vp to heauen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it remaineth vppon earth, and so one of the articles of our faith shall be falsified, which saith, <hi>He is ascended into heauen,</hi> or if he <note place="margin">Act. 1. 9. 11</note> be ascended, and descended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, an other article will be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified, which saith, <hi>that he sitteth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 34.</note> 
                        <hi>at the right hand of his father,</hi> that is as <hi>Peter</hi> saith, he abideth in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. <note place="margin">Act. 3. 21.</note>


                        <pb facs="tcp:4337:96"/>
Secondly it will follow, that <note place="margin">2</note> Christ hath not a true body, but a fantasticall body, because it may be in many places at one time; for if his body be in the Sacrament, he must needes haue so many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as there be Sacraments; nay, he must haue so many bodies as there be bits in euery sacrament. Thirdly it will followe, that his body is diuided from his soule, <note place="margin">3</note> and consequently is a dead body, because the bread is only changed into his body, and not into his soule. Fourthly it wil follow, that <note place="margin">4</note> the wicked and prophane, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probat, may receiue Christ as well as the godly, because they haue a mouth to eate as well as the best. Fiftly it will follow that Christes <note place="margin">5 Hebr. 9. 28. &amp;. 10. 12.</note> sacrifice once for all was not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, because we must sacrifice him againe, and breake his body and shead his bloud, as the <hi>Iewes</hi>


                        <pb facs="tcp:4337:96"/>
crucified him vppon the Crosse. Sixtly it wil follow that the bread <note place="margin">6</note> being turned into the body of our redeemer, hath a part in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption as well as Christ. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly it will follow, that Christ <note place="margin">7</note> did eate his owne body: for all the Fathers say that he did eate the same bread which he gaue to his Disciples. Lastly it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <note place="margin">8</note> that a Massing Priest shall be the creator of his creator, because he makes him which made him, all these absurdities are hatched of Transubstantiation.</p>
                     <p>Thus when men deuise articles of their owne, while they strike vpon the handuill the sparkes flie in their face; and they are like the man which began to builde and could not finish it. When I see the Papists in so many absurdities for intertaining one error, mee thinkes he seemeth like a Collier


<pb facs="tcp:4337:97"/>
which is grimed with his owne coales. Therfore as in manners we should thinke of <hi>Peters</hi> saying, <hi>Whether is it meete to obey GOD or men?</hi> So in doctrines wee should thinke, whether it be meete to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue <note place="margin">Act. 5. 29.</note> God or me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Thus you haue heard the author of this Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>the Lord Iesus,</hi> the time when it was instituted, <hi>in the night that he</hi>

                        <hi>was betraied,</hi> the manner how it was instituted, <hi>after thankes giuing,</hi> the ende why it was instituted, <hi>for a remembrance of his death,</hi> and the discouerie of Transubstanciation, one of the last heresies which <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> hatched. Now, they which haue been Patrons of it before, should do like the father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of an Idolater, that is, lay the <note place="margin">Deut. 13. 6. &amp; 9.</note> first hand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to end his life.

These words are diuersly repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Euangelists. Heere it is sayd, <hi>This cup is the new testament in my bloud.</hi> In <hi>Mathew</hi> and in <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 28</note> 
                        <hi>Marke,</hi> it is sayd, <hi>This cup is my bloud of the new testament.</hi> This <note place="margin">Mar. 14. 25</note> is the first mention which Christ makes of a Testament, as though now his promises deserued the name of a Testament, because the seale is set vnto them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Sacrament was not sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:98"/>
but like a bare wrighting, without a signet. This word <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,</hi> doth imply a promise, and therefore teacheth vs, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament doth confirme &amp; streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and nourish our faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it sealeth the promise which wee should beleeue.</p>
                     <p>Heere is to be noted, that Christ doth not only speake of a Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but he calleth it a <hi>new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which words neuer met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether before, as though the Law were for the old man to mortifie him, and the Gospell for the new man to comfort him againe: or, as if the old Testament had so washt her face, and changed her apparell at Christes comming, that one would not thinke it the same, but a new Testament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause euen now she was shado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed with a thousand Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:99"/>
and now they are gone from her, like a mist at the sunne rising. As Christe calleth loue a <hi>newe Commandement,</hi> because hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed <note place="margin">Ioh. 13 34.</note> it like a law worne out of memorie, so he calleth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of saluation a new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Euery testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is confirmed with bloud; the ould Testament was confirmed by the bloud of Goats, and Bullocks, and Rammes, but <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 18.</note> the new Testament is confirmed by the bloud of Christ, <hi>My bloud</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>is the bloud of the new</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 28</note> 
                        <hi>Testament:</hi> nay <hi>this Cup</hi> (sayth Christ) <hi>is the new Testament.</hi> You <note place="margin">Luk 22. 20.</note> may see then that they may gather as well out of Christs words, that the Cup is the new Testament, as that the Wine is his bloud. For Christ sayth, <hi>This Cup is the new Testament,</hi> as well as hee sayth, <hi>This Wine is my bloud,</hi> or <hi>This bread


<pb facs="tcp:4337:99"/>
is my body.</hi> Beside, when Christ speakes of a new Testament, he implieth, that the ould Testament <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 13.</note> is fulfilled, the Sacrifices, and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Law, did signifie Christ before he came, therefore they are fulfilled in his comming, no mo Sacrifices, no mo Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <note place="margin">For types and figures</note> for the truth is come. Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Ceremonies are hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, buried with the Priesthod of <hi>Aaron,</hi> let them rest, it is not lawfull to violate the Sepulchers of the dead, and take their bodies out of the earth, as the Witch would rayse <hi>Samuel</hi> out of hys <note place="margin">1. Sam. 28. 14.</note> graue. Therefore they which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Ceremonies, which should be abrogated, reliques of Iudaism, or reliques of Papisme, may be sayd to violate the Sepulchers of the dead, &amp; disturb the deceased, like the Witch, which presumed


<pb facs="tcp:4337:100"/>
to raise <hi>Samuel</hi> out of his graue.</p>
                     <p>This testament is called a testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in bloud, because the testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and will of a man is confirmed, when the man is dead; so Christ confirmed his Testament by his death. <hi>Moses</hi> saith, that <hi>life is in the bloud,</hi> so the bloud of Christ is the <note place="margin">Leuit. 17. 11.</note> life of this Testament. If Christs bloud had not been shed, this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament made vnto vs had been vnprofitable, as the Testament of a Father is to his Sonne, if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should not die but liue. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle saith, without <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22.</note> shedding of bloud there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes. Therefore the Testament or couenant of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of our sinnes, is called the Testament in bloud; the bloud of Christ is the seale of the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which we haue to shew vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD for the remission of our


<pb facs="tcp:4337:100"/>
sinnes, and the two Sacraments are a seale of that bloud to witnes that it was shed.</p>
                     <p>Againe, this is a matter regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Testaments and Willes; to the Testament of him that is dead, no man addeth or detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, but as the Testator made it, so it standeth without alteration: so <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 2. Reuel. 22. 18.</note> should this Testament of Christ, and this Sacrament of Christ no man should alter it now he is dead: for he which addeth or detracteth hath a curse in Gods book. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he instituted this Sacrament, commanded, <hi>doo this,</hi> that is, do as I do, least they should swarue one whit from his owne manner: yet how many gaudes haue the Papists added to it, that he which had heard Christ say, <hi>Doo this in remembrance of me,</hi> and should see how they handle the


<pb facs="tcp:4337:101"/>
matter in their Masse, could see nothing to remember Christ by, but a vaile to hide Christ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. Therefore this Commandement was repeated again when he gaue <note place="margin">The popish receyuing vnder one kinde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> the wine, <hi>Doo this, &amp;c.</hi> as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to eate the bread in remembrance of him, so he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them to drinke the wine in remembrance of him: nay, he speaks more precisely of the wine than of the bread; for he saith of the Wine, <hi>Drinke you all of this,</hi> which he saith not of the bread. <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 27</note> Surelie Christ did foresee that some proud Hereticks would do otherwise after him, euen as it is come to passe: for the Papist doth breake this commaundement of Christ, as flatly as <hi>Saul</hi> brake the commaundement of <hi>Samuel. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> commanded him to kill the <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 9.</note> fat and the leane: <hi>Saul</hi> killed the


<pb facs="tcp:4337:101"/>
leane, but not the fat; so Christ commandeth to receiue bread and wine, they teach to receiue bread, but not wine: Christ saith, <hi>Drink you all of this,</hi> they say drinke not all of this: Christ gaue the bread &amp; wine to all, they giue the bread to all, and the wine to some: their Priests receiue all, but the people must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent themselues with half: the Priest eates and drinks, but the people must not drinke for spil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on their cloathes. Is this the Church which cannot erre? Doo they thinke to hemme Christ in their Masse, and shut his ordinance out of their Masse? The Soldiours <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 35</note> diuided Christs coate, but these diuide his body, and separate the bread &amp; wine which Christ hath ioyned. <hi>Paule</hi> speaketh of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks which taught, <hi>Touch not, tast</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Colos. 2. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>not, handle not:</hi> so these say, touch


<pb facs="tcp:4337:102"/>
not, tast not, handle not, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they should say, Touch, and tast, and handle. Of all Heresies either old or new, there is none so iniurious <note place="margin">How the Popish Priests do iniure the people.</note> to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people, as the pasture of shauelings <hi>Poperie,</hi> for they may not reade the Scriptures; they may <note place="margin">1 2 3</note> not come to Councells; they may not examine that which is taught them; they may not bee bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ied <note place="margin">4</note> without a mortuarie; they may <note place="margin">5</note> not drinke at the Communion, as though their Priests were their Lords. Therefore we may say as a Heathen did, <hi>There is no charitie in the Papists Sacrament,</hi> because like <hi>Ananias,</hi> the Priests keepe backe <note place="margin">Act. 5. 2.</note> that which they should distribute, &amp; mangle the Sacrifice as though <hi>Ely</hi> his sonns had left their hooke <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 13</note> to the Massing Friers. Thus that ye may knowe who succeed the Pharisies, they haue fulfilled that


<pb facs="tcp:4337:102"/>
which the Pharisies did, that is, <hi>By their owne Commaundements they haue made the Commaundement of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mar. 7. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>God of no effect.</hi> For whereas the purpose of Christ was to tye our faith wholy to himselfe, that wee shoulde not seeke for any thing without him, knowing that the maintenance of this life hath need both of meate and drinke, to teach vs that all sufficiencie is in himself, by bread and wine he sheweth, that he is in stead both of meate &amp; drink, that is, in stead of all: which signification is taken away where the wine is not giuen as well as the bread. Therefore as it is sayd of a horrible and odious crime, <hi>Consider the matter, &amp; giue sentence:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iud. 19. 30.</note> so I wish all to consider this Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, &amp; giue sentence of it. Can there be any cleerer contradiction to the Word, or bolder checke to


<pb facs="tcp:4337:103"/>
Christ, than when he saith, <hi>Drinke you all of this,</hi> to say, drinke not all of this? As when God sayd, <hi>Ye shall die:</hi> the diuell sayd, <hi>ye shall not</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17. Gen. 3. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>die,</hi> shall wee goe now to a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, or a Father, or a Doctor to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether this doctrine bee like Christs doctrine? I doo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely thinke that none heere is so simple but that he seeth, that if any thing can bee contrarie to Christs speech, this is contrarie to it. But this is onely their detraction from the Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Now you shall heare their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to the Sacrament, looke vpon their vestures, and their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, and their Altars, and their pix, and their incense, and their becks, and their nods, and their turnings, all this is more than Christ did, and therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet may say againe, <hi>Who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Esai. 1. 12.</note>

                        <hi>this of you?</hi> Did Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund you to doe more than he did, and not doe as he did? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them which haue eyes to see, be thanckfull for their light, when they heare how blind they were, whome God gaue ouer to be seduced.</p>
                     <p>The fruite of this Sacrament is <note place="margin">Vers. 24.</note> noted in these words, <hi>which is</hi>

number, &amp; certaine order of men. All are not saued by Christes death, but all which are saued, are saued by Christes death: his death is sufficient to saue all, as the sunne is sufficient to lighten all: but if any man wincke, the sunne will not giue him light: so, if any man contemne, and will not receyue, Christ will not thrust him into heauen, but euery man shall haue that which he chooseth (as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith) <hi>Blessing to him that loueth</hi>

                     <p>He had no goods, nor lands, nor money, to giue by his testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

are giltie which receiue this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament vnworthely, as <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Caiphas</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> were.

As the word is the sauour of death to <note place="margin">2.

the golden Ring sitteth highest at our Table, but the wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Iames. 2. 2.</note> sitteth highest at this Table. It is safer eating with vnwashen hands, then with an vnwashen heart. The <hi>Iewes</hi> were taught to choose the Lambe of the Passeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer on the tenth day of the first moneth, in which moneth they came out of <hi>Egipt:</hi> and on the 14. <note place="margin">Exo. 12. 3. &amp; 6.</note> day after, they were taught to eate him, so they had foure dayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spit betweene the chosing, and the killing, to prepare and sanctifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues for the Passeouer, which was a signe of the Lords Supper. This admonished them, that the matter now to be performed, was very waightie, and therefore they were deepely to consider it, for now was the action, and somme of all saluation in handling: if they did prepare themselues so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb facs="tcp:4337:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they did receyue the figure of this Sacrament, how should we be prepared before we receiue the Sacrament it selfe? Therefore as <hi>Iosiah</hi> commaunded the <hi>Leuites</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Chro. 35. 6.</note> to prepare the people; so <hi>Paule</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiseth the people to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that is, to examine whether they haue faith, and loue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, before they come to this feast. By this all may see, first that <hi>Paule</hi> would haue euery lay <note place="margin">All are bound to know the Scriptures.</note> man so skilfull in the Scripture, that he bee able to examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by it; for this admonition is not to them which minister the Sacrament, but to all which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Sacrament. And the rule by which wee must examine our selues, is the law which we should obey: therefore if the rule be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, the examination must be vndone. Our doctrine must be


<pb facs="tcp:4337:111"/>
examined by the doctrine of the <note place="margin">Act. 17. 11.</note> Prophets and Apostles; our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers must bee examined by the sixe <note place="margin">Note.</note> petitions of Christs prayer; our beleefe must bee examined by the twelue articles of faith; our life must bee examined by the tenne Commaundements of the Lawe. <note place="margin">Exo. 20. 1. &amp;c.</note> Now, he which hath his Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone may trie gold from copper, but he which hath it not, takes one for the other.

Secondly, an examination of our <note place="margin">The diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> selues. Thirdly, an examination before we come to the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Touching the first, here <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>Examin your selues,</hi> but in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. he doubleth his charge, <hi>Proue your selues,</hi> and againe at next word <hi>Examine your selues,</hi> as if he should saye, this worke must be done when it is done, because it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thoroughly done, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must double our exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as <hi>Paul</hi> doubleth his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell. If a man suspect his enemy, he will try him with a question, if that will not search him, he will put forth another, if that be spied, he will moue another, like one which putteth diuers keyes into a locke vntill it open. So he which examineth, must try &amp; try, proue and proue, search and search, for the angell of darknesse is like an

angell of light, and we haue no way to discouer him, but that of <note place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Iohn, Try the spirites.</hi> God exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">1.

If any man skill not what <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining</hi> meaneth, the very word Examine, is so pregnant, that it prompteth vs how we should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, for it signifieth to put our selues vnto the Touchstone, as if we would try Golde from Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

If they fade and decay, that she feeleth a consumption, then she ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth preseruatiues, and restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of prayer, and councell, and repentance, before the sicknesse growe: thus euery day she letteth downe a bucket into her heart, to see what water it bringeth vp, least she should corrupt within, and perish sodeinly.</p>
                     <p>To heare, and reade, pray, and fast, and communicate, is a worke of many, but to examine these works, is the fashion of few, and therefore <hi>Ieremy</hi> complayneth,

                     </p>
                     <p>The last article is, whether thou canst finde in thy hart to dye for <note place="margin">5</note> Christ, as Christ dyed for thee, for we are bid not only to follow him, but to beare his crosse: and therefore we are called seruants, <note place="margin">Luk 12. 38 2.

One sayth, that he would neuer speake to Vsurers, and Bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, but when they be vpon their death beds: for he which liueth by sin, resolueth to sin, that he may liue. But when he goeth to hanging, <hi>Iudas</hi> will <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 4.</note> say, <hi>I haue sinned.</hi> If I speake not to Vsurers vppon their death-bed, yet I speake to Vsurers which shall lye vppon their death-bed. Three things do giue me hope. One is, that all harts are in the hands of God, to call them at what houre <note place="margin">Act. 9. 15.</note> he list, and therefore <hi>Saul</hi> may become an Apostle. The next is, that the third crow doth waken moe then the former,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:133"/>
and therefore after the crowing of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this crow may happily be heard. The last is, that there is no sinne, but some men haue bin reclaimed from it, and so may Vsurers from their sinne.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4337:134"/>
shall not come thether: as if hee should say, They shall goe to hell. Therefore as <hi>Paule</hi> taught <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> to warne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are rich, <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 17.</note> as though they had more neede to be warned than other: so this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence seemeth to bee penned for a warning to the rich, because it strikes vpon the rich mans vice.</p>
                     <p>I haue spoken of Briberie and Simonie, and now I must speake of their sister Vsurie. Manie times haue I thought to speake of this Theame, but the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which are alleaged for it, haue made mee doubtfull what to say in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath gone as it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a protection. At last you see it falleth into my text, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now I cannot bauke it any longer. Therefore if any heere haue fauoured this occupation before, let him now submit his


<pb facs="tcp:4337:134"/>
thoughts vnto Gods thoughts; for I will alleage nothing against it, but that which is built vppon the rocke.</p>
                     <p>Vsurie is the sin which God wil trie now whether you loue better than his worde: that is, whether you will leaue it if he forbid it: for if hee flatly forbid it, and yet you wilfully retaine it, then you loue Vsurie better than Gods worde. Therefore one saith well that our Vsurers are Hereticks, because af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Vsurers he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</note> manie admonitions, yet they maintaine their errour, and persist in it obstinatly as Papists doo in Poperie. For this cause I am glad that I haue any occasion to griple with this sin, where it hath made so many spoyles, &amp; where it hath so many patrons: for it is said that there be moe of this profession in this Citie, than there bee in all the


<pb facs="tcp:4337:135"/>
land beside. There be certaine sins which are like an vnreasonable enemie which will not be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to death, and this is one of those euerlasting sins which liue and die with a man. For when he hath resigned his pride and his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and his lust, yet Vsurie remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with him, &amp; he saith as <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> said, <hi>Let the Lord bee mercifull</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Kings. 5. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>vnto me in this:</hi> let me haue a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation for this, as though this were a necessarie sinne, and hee could not liue without it. There be three sinnes which are counted <note place="margin">Three sins counted no sinnes.</note> no sinnes, and yet they doo more hurt than all their fellows, &amp; those are Briberie, Nonresidencie, and Vsurie: these three because they are gainful are turned from sinnes to occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. How many of this Citie for all that they are Vsurers, yet would be counted honest me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:135"/>
and would faine haue Vsurie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed as a trade: whereas if it were not so gainfull, it would bee counted as great a sinne as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so it is counted of all but them which liue by it. This is the nature of pleasure and profite to make sinnes seeme no sinnes, if we gaine any thing by them, but the more gainfull a sinne is, the more daungerous it is, and the more gainfull Vsurie is, the more daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous it is. I will speake the more of it, because happely you shall not heare of this matter againe.</p>
                     <p>First I will define what Vsurie <note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes of this treatise.</note> is, then I wil shew you what Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie doth signifie: then I will shewe the vnlawfulnes of it: then I will shewe the arguments which are alleaged for it: then I will shewe the punishment of it: then I will


<pb facs="tcp:4337:136"/>
shewe you what opinion wee should holde of them which doo not lend vpon Vsurie, but borrow vpon Vsurie. Lastly, I will shewe you what they should doo which haue got their riches by Vsurie.</p>
                     <p>Touching the first, Vsurie is <note place="margin">The defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie.</note> that gaine which is gotten by len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for the vse of the thing which a man lendeth, couenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before with the borrower to receaue more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was borrowed: and therefore one calls the Vsurer a legall theefe, because before hee <note place="margin">Vsurers steale by law.</note> steale, he tels the partie how much hee will steale, as though hee stole by law. This word <hi>more,</hi> comes in like a sixt finger, which makes a monster, because it is more than should be. Another defining Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, calleth it the <hi>Contrarie to Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:</hi> for <hi>Paule</hi> saith, <hi>Loue seeketh not her owne,</hi> but Vsurie seeketh an

                     <p>Now, al the Commandements of God are fulfilled by loue, which Christ noteth when hee draweth all the Commandements to one Commandement, which is, <hi>Loue</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 22. 37.</note> 
                        <hi>God aboue all things, and thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy selfe:</hi> as if hee should say, hee which loueth GOD, will keepe all the Commaundements which respect God, and he which loueth his neighbour will keepe all the Commaundements which respect his neighbour: therefore to maintaine loue, GOD forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all things which hinder this loue: and among the rest here hee forbiddeth Vsurie, as one of her deadliest enemies: for a man can not loue and be an Vsurer, because


<pb facs="tcp:4337:137"/>
Vsurie is a kinde of crueltie, and a kinde of extortion, and a kinde of persecution, and therfore the want of loue doth make Vsurers: for if there were loue there would bee no Vsurie, no deceit, no extortion, no slaundering, no reuenging, no oppression, but wee should liue in peace and ioye and contentment like the Angels; whereby you see that all our sinnes are against our selues: for if there were no deceit, then we should not bee deceiued: if there were no slander, then wee should not bee slandered: if there were no enuie, then wee should not bee enuied: if there were no extortion, then we should not bee iniuried: if there were no Vsurie, then we should not bee oppressed. Therfore Gods law had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for vs than our owne lawe: for if his law did stand, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we should


<pb facs="tcp:4337:137"/>
not be deceiued, nor slandered, nor enuied, nor iniured, nor oppressed. God hath commanded euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to lend freely, &amp; who would not <note place="margin">Luke. 6. 35.</note> borrowe freely? Therefore they which brought in vsurie, brought in a lawe against themselues.</p>
                     <p>The first Vsurers which wee reade of, were the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which were forbidden to be Vsurers, yet for want of faith and loue, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 22. Nehe. 25.</note> &amp; <hi>Nehemiah</hi> doth shewe how the <hi>Iewes,</hi> euen the <hi>Iewes</hi> which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this lawe from God himselfe, did swarue from it as they did from the rest. First, they did lend vppon Vsurie to straungers; after they began to lend vppon Vsurie to their brethren, and now there be no such Vsurers vppon earth as the <hi>Iewes</hi> which were forbidden to be Vsurers. Wherby you may see how the malice of man hath


<pb facs="tcp:4337:138"/>
turned mercie into crueltie. For whereas lending was commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">Deut. 15. 10.</note> for the benefite of men, Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hath turned it to the vndoing of men: for they take when they seeme to giue; they hurt when they seeme to helpe; they damage when they seeme to vauntage: therefore it is well noted that V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie hath her name of byting, and <note place="margin">2.</note> she may well signifie byting; for many haue not onely been bitten by it, but deuoured by it, that is, consumed all that they haue: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Apostle saith, <hi>If you bite</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Galat. 5. 15</note> 
                        <hi>one another, take heede you be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured one of another:</hi> so I may say if you be Vsurers one to another, take heede you bee not deuoured one of another, for Vsurers are bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. As the name of the Diuell doth declare what an enemie he is; <note place="margin">Because it signifieth</note> so the name of Vsurie dooth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare


<pb facs="tcp:4337:138"/>
what an enemie she is. That <note place="margin">an aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie.</note> you may knowe Vsurie for a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, her name doth signifie byting. <note place="margin">Neschec.</note> If there were one byting Vsurie, and another healing Vsurie, then Vsurie should haue two names; one of byting, and another of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: but all Vsurie signifieth by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to shewe that al Vsurie is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. Now, you haue heard what Vsurie is, and of what it is deriued, you shall heare the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnes of it.</p>
                     <p>First, it is against the law of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <note place="margin">1. The vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of Vsurie.</note> because charitie biddeth vs to giue euery man his owne, and to require no more than our own; but Vsurie requireth more than her owne, and giues not to other their owne. Charitie reioyceth to communicate her goods to other, and Vsurie reioyceth to gather o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens goods to her selfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:4337:139"/>
Secondly, it is against the lawe <note place="margin">2.</note> of Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; for euerie Nation hath some lawe against Vsurie, and some restraint against Vsurers, as you shall heare when wee speake of the punishment.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, as it is against the law of Nations, so it is against the law <note place="margin">3.</note> of Nature, that is, the naturall compassion which should bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. You see a riuer when it goeth by an emptie place, it will <note place="margin">A Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> not passe vntill it hath filled that emptie place, &amp; then it goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to another emptie place and filleth it, and so to another emptie place and filleth it, alwaies filling the places which are emptie: so should wee, the rich should fill the poore, the ful should fill the hung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, they which abound should fill them which want, for the rich are but Gods Amners, and their riches


<pb facs="tcp:4337:139"/>
are committed to them of God to distribute and doo good as GOD dooth himselfe: As the water is charitable after a sorte, so is the ayre, for it goeth to emptie places too, and filleth them as the water doth. Nature cannot abide that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place should bee emptie, and therefore the ayre though it bee a light bodie, and so naturally ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpward: yet rather than any place in the earth shuld be emptie, the ayre wil descend as it were fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his throne, and goe into caues, into dens, and into dungeons, to fill them. If the rich were so good to their emptie brethren, as the ayre and water are to other emptie things; as there is no emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie place in the worlde, so there should be no emptie person in the world: that is, the rich in <hi>Israel</hi> would fill the poore in <hi>Israel,</hi> but


<pb facs="tcp:4337:140"/>
the riche make the poore to fill them, for Vsurers feede vpon the poore, euen as great fishes deuoure the small. Therfore he which sayd <hi>Let there not be a begger in Israel,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 15. 4.</note> sayd too, let there not be an Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in <hi>Israel,</hi> for if there be Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in <hi>Israel,</hi> there wil be beggers in <hi>Israel,</hi> for Vsurers make beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, euen as Lawyers make quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellers.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it is against the law of God. First, it is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Exo.</hi> 22. <note place="margin">4.</note> where it is sayd, <hi>If thou lend money vnto my people, that is, to the poore withthee, thou shalt not oppresse them with Vsurie:</hi> heere Vsurie is called oppression, therefore if oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be a sinne, Vsury is a sinne too. Secondly, it is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Leu.</hi> 25. 36. where it is sayd, <hi>Thou shalt not giue thy money to Vsurie, nor lend thy vittailes for increase.</hi> Heere you


<pb facs="tcp:4337:140"/>
may see, that men may be Vsurers of vittailes and other thinges, as well as of money. Thirdly, it is forbidden in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. where it is sayde, <hi>Thou shalt not lende vnto thy brother vpon Vsurie.</hi> And least you shoulde saye, that he meaneth but one kinde of Vsurie, he sheweth, that he meaneth all kinds of Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: for after he sayth, <hi>as vsurie of money, vsurie of vittailes, vsurie of corne, or vsurie of any thing which is giuen to Vsurie:</hi> because some are not Vsurers of money, but some are Vsurers of vittailes, some are Vsurers of Cloth, some are Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of Corne, some are Vsurers of Wine, some are Vsurers of Oyle, and some of one thing, and some of an other, and none would bee counted Vsurers, but they which lend money vpon Vsurie; therefore God forbiddeth so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciselie


<pb facs="tcp:4337:141"/>
Vsurie of any thing, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that all Vsurie is vnlawfull. It is a miserable occupation to liue by sinne, and a great comfort to a man when he looketh vpon his Golde and Siluer, and his heart telleth him, all this is well gotten, and when he lieth vpon his death-bed, and must leaue all to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he can say vnto them, I leaue you mine owne; but the Vsurer can not saye, I leaue you mine own, but I leaue you other mens, therefore the Vsurer can neuer dye in peace, because if he dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he make restitution, he dyeth in his sinne. When Christ raysed <hi>Lazarus</hi> from death, after he had <note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 37.</note> layne foure dayes in the graue, he wept so ouer his Sepulcher, that the standers about sayd one to an other, <hi>See how he loued him,</hi> As it may be sayde of Christ, See how


<pb facs="tcp:4337:141"/>
he loueth vs, so it should be sayd of vs, See how they loue their breethren. For Christ sayd to his Disciples, <hi>Loue one an other, as I</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 34.</note> 
                        <hi>haue loued you.</hi> But it may be sayde of the Vsurer, See how hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth hys breethren, and heare how he loueth them: for hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them in wordes, and hateth them in deedes. He sayth that he loueth them, and that he lendeth for compassion, but it is for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of himselfe, that he may gaine by his lending. The Vsurer loueth the borrower, as the Iuye loueth the Oke: The Iuye loueth the Oke to growe vp by it, so the Vsurer loueth the borrower to grow rich by him. The Iuye clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the Oke like a louer, but it claspeth out all the iuice and sap, that the Oke can not thriue after: So the Vsurer lendeth like a frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:142"/>
but hee couenanteth like an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye, for he claspeth the borrower with such bands, that euer after he diminisheth, as fast as the other encreaseth.</p>
                     <p>Christe expounding the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement <note place="margin">Vnderstand that his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vpon the mount, is an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, or else the text will not seeme to implie this. <hi>Luc.</hi> 19. 8.</note> which forbiddeth to steale, sayth, <hi>lende freely,</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Vsurie, because she len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not freely, is a kinde of theft, and the Vsurers a kind of theeues, for else this exposition were not right. Therfore <hi>Zacheus,</hi> as though he had stolne other mens goods, when he began to repent, he resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them againe foure foulde, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as theeues are inioyned to restore four fould for that which <note place="margin">Exod. 22.</note> they haue stolne, so <hi>Zacheus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored foure foulde, as though he had stolne. It seemeth that <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> was no greate theefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee restored foure foulde


<pb facs="tcp:4337:142"/>
for all that he had gotten wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, for hee got but the fourth part of his goods wrongfully at the most, or else he could not haue restored foure fould againe. But now, if some should restore foure fould, for all that they haue gotten wrongfully, they shoulde restore more than they haue, because all which Vsurers get, they get wrongfully: for their occupation is a sinne, and therefore one sayth, Because they cannot restore foure fould heere, they shall suffer an hundreth fould heereafter. <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah</hi> is forbidden to strengthen <note place="margin">2.

When God set <hi>Adam</hi> his work, he sayd, <hi>In the sweate of thy browes</hi>

                        <hi>shalt thou liue:</hi> not in the sweate of his browes, but in the sweate of thy browes: but the Vsurer liueth in the sweate of his browes, and her browes: that is, by the paines and cares, and labours of an other, for he taketh no paines himselfe, but only expecteth the time when his interest will come in, like the belly which doeth no worke, and yet eateth all the meate. When God had finished his creation, he sayd vnto man, and vnto beastes, and vnto foules, and vnto fishes, <hi>increase and multiplie,</hi> but he neuer <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> saide vnto money, increase and multiplie, because it is a dead thing which hath no seede, and therefore is not fit to ingender.

begetteth a monstrous birth, like <hi>Anah,</hi> which deuised a creature <note place="margin">Gen 36. 24.</note> which God had not created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Christ saith to his Disciples, <hi>If you loue but them which loue you,</hi>

                     <p>Now you haue heard the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulnes of Vsurie, you shall heare how many kindes there be of it. As other Crafts are called Mysteries, so I may fitly call it, the mysterie of Vsurie, for they haue deuised moe sorts of Vsurie, than there be tricks at Cardes, I cannot recken halfe, and I am afraide to shewe you all, least I should teach you to be Vsurers, while I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you from Vsurie, yet I will shew you some, and the same reasons which are aledged against these, shall condemne all the rest.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:4337:145"/>
Some will not take Vsurie, but they will haue the vse of your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, <note place="margin">1.

                     <p>Some will not take Vsurie, but <note place="margin">2.</note> they will take plate, and vessell, and tapistree, and bedding, and other houshold stuffe, to vse and weare, vntill their money come home, which will lose more in the wearing, than the interest of the money would come to. This Vsurie is forbidden in the 2. of <hi>Amos,</hi> where God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineth say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>They lye downe vpon the clothes which are layd to pledge:</hi> shewing,

that wee shoulde not lye downe vppon such clothes, that is, wee should not vse or weare the thing which is layd to pledge.</p>
                     <p>Some will take no Vsurie, but <note place="margin">3.</note> they will take a pawne which is better than the money which they lende, and then they will coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that if he bring not the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney againe by such a day, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitteth his pawne: which day the Vsurer knoweth, that the poore man is not able to keepe, and so kepeth the pawne for his money, which is worth twise his money. This Vsurie is forbidden in <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit.</hi> 25. where it is said, <hi>Thou shalt not take Vsurie or vauntage:</hi> as if he should say, thou shalt not take the forfeiture; for then thou takest vauntage, when thou takest more than thou lendest.</p>

Therefore one saith of these, <hi>When he selleth the day he selleth the light, and when hee selleth

the night hee selleth rest: therefore when he would haue the light of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and the rest of Paradise, it shall be said vnto him that he hath solde both alreadie.

                     <p>There be other Vsurers which <note place="margin">8.</note> will not lend themselues, but giue leaue to their wiues, and they play like hucksters, that is, euerie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a penny for a shilling, which is one hundred for another in the yeare.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:4337:147"/>
wares worth three score pounde, and you shal answer them an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound for it. These are the Vsurers generall which lurke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Citie like Rats, and We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and Fulmers, of whom may bee said the same which is said of the diuels, <hi>they seeke whom they may deuoure.</hi>

                     <p>Now you haue heard the kinds of Vsurie, you shall heare the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments <note place="margin">Obiections made by Vsurers.</note> which are deuised for Vsurie.</p>
                     <p>Sinne is neuer complet vntill it bee excused: this is the vauntage which the diuell getteth by euery sinne, whensoeuer he can fasten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temptation vppon vs, wee giue him a sinne for it, and an excuse to boote, as <hi>Adam</hi> our father did. First he sinned, and then he excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> so first we sinne, and then we excuse: first an Vsurer, &amp; then an excuser. Therefore euerie Vsurer will defend Vsurie with his tung, though hee condemne it with his conscience. If the Image makers of <hi>Ephesus</hi> had not liued by Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they would haue spoken for <note place="margin">All. 19. 25.</note> Images no more than the rest: for none stood for Images but the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage


<pb facs="tcp:4337:148"/>
makers: so if the Vsurers did not liue by Vsurie, they woulde speak for Vsurie no more than the rest: for none stand for Vsurie but Vsurers.</p>
                     <p>It is an easie matter, if a man be disposed, to speake something for euerie vice; as some defende the Stewes: some defende Nonresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie: some defende swearing by my faith: some defend bowling vppon the Saboath: and some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Vsurie. But, <hi>will you pleade for</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iud. 6. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>Baal?</hi> (saith <hi>Ioash)</hi> that is, will you pleade for sinne which will pleade against you? A sin is a sin when it is defended: nay, a sinne is two sins when it is defended: for <hi>he which breaketh one of the least Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> (saith Christ) and teacheth <note place="margin">Math. 5. 19.</note> others to doo so, <hi>is the least in the kingdom of heauen.</hi> A Squire of low degree is a Squire of no degree: so


<pb facs="tcp:4337:149"/>
the least in the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is none of the kingdome of heauen. Who then is the least in the kingdome of heauen? not he which breaketh the least of the Commandements, but he which teacheth others to doo so: that is, he which by defending, and excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and minsing, and extenuating his sinne, incourageth others to sinne too.</p>
                     <p>To defend Vsurie, they distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish vppon it, as they distinguish of lying: as they say, there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious lye, and an officious lye, and a merrie lye, and a godly lye: so they say, there is the Merchants Vsurie, and the Strangers Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and the Widdowes Vsurie, and the Orphanes Vsurie, and the pooremans Vsurie, and the biting Vsurie, and the charitable Vsurie, and the necessarie Vsurie.


<pb facs="tcp:4337:149"/>
As God said, <hi>ye shall die,</hi> &amp; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> sayd, <hi>peraduenture ye shall dye,</hi> and the Serpent said, <hi>ye shall not dye;</hi> so there be three opinions of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie: <note place="margin">Three opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Vsurie.</note> some say like God, <hi>thou shalt dye,</hi> they thinke that Vsurie is vtterly vnlawfull, because God hath vtterly forbid it: some say like the woman, <hi>peraduenture thou shalt dye,</hi> they doubt whether Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie be vtterly vnlawfull or no, because it is so much tollerated: some say like the Serpent, <hi>thou</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen 3.</note> 
                        <hi>shalt not dye,</hi> they thinke that Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is lawfull, because it is gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as <hi>Saule</hi> thought that the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 9.</note> beastes should not be killed because they were fat. But as he was commaunded to kill the fat beastes, as well as the leane, so we are commanded to kill fat sinnes as well as leane sinnes; gainefull sinnes as well as prodigall sinnes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:4337:150"/>
They which pleade for Vsurie, obiect these arguments. First they <note place="margin">1. Obiections for Vsurie.</note> say, God doeth alow some kinde of Vsurie, for in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. it is said <hi>of a stranger thou mayest take Vsurie.</hi> I perceiue no scripture speaketh for Vsurers. <hi>Of a stranger</hi> (sayth God) <hi>thou mayest take Vsurie:</hi> but thou takest Vsurie of thy brother, therefore this condemneth thee, because thou vsest thy brother like a stranger. Here <hi>stranger</hi> doth signifie the <hi>Iewes</hi> enemies, whome they were commaunded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy: therefore marke how much this maketh against Vsurie, which they obiect for Vsurie. God doeth not license the <hi>Iewes</hi> to take V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie of any, but their enemies whome they might kill: They might not be Vsurers vnto any, but to them of whom they might be destroyers, whome they might


<pb facs="tcp:4337:150"/>
slay, of them only they might take Vsurie: shewing that Vsurie is a kind of punishment, and such a kind of punishment, as if we are to kill a man, it were a very fit pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for him, and therefore the <hi>Iewes</hi> might take Vsurie of none, but them whom they might kill.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they say that they lend for compassion, and so make Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <note place="margin">2.</note> a worke of charitie. This were charitie not to be partakers in our gaines, but to be partakers in our losses, but Vsurers will be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in our gaines, but not in our losses; nay, though we lose, yet they will gaine: is this charitie? it is colde charitie to partake in our gaines, and not in our losses.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they say, if he gaine <note place="margin">3.</note> and I gaine too, is not this well, may he not consider my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship


<pb facs="tcp:4337:151"/>
and be thankefull? yes, hee may be thankfull, but no man is bound to be thankfull, but when he hath receiued a good turne, then he is tried whether he wil be thankfull or no: and if he requite thy curtesie, then he is thankefull, but if thou bind him to requite it, then thou art couetous.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly they say, Vsurie is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for Orphanes and Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, <note place="margin">4.</note> and Straungers, which haue no other way to get their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and therefore some Vsurie must be tolerated. If Vsurie be necessarie for vs, how did the <hi>Iewes</hi> without it? Did God thinke it good for the state of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale to be without Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; and is it good for the state of our common weale to haue Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers? this is wisdome against God.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly they say: If I may not <note place="margin">5.</note>


                        <pb facs="tcp:4337:151"/>
gaine by the money which I lend, I will lend no more, but keepe my money to my selfe: nay, that is as bad to keepe thy money from them which neede, as to lend thy money for Vsurie. For Christ saith, <hi>from him which borroweth,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 42.</note> 
                        <hi>turne not away thy face.</hi> Therefore thou art bound to lende. As he hath a cursse in <hi>Prou.</hi> 11. which keepeth his Corne when hee should fell it to them which hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; so he hath a cursse in <hi>Eze.</hi> 18. which keepeth his money when he should lende it to them which want.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly they say, because Vsurie <note place="margin">6.</note> comes of biting, the biting Vsurie is onely forbidden, and none but the biting Vsurie: why then all Vsurie is forbidden, for all Vsurie commeth of biting, to shewe that all Vsurie is vnlawfull.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:4337:152"/>
Lastly, they aleadge the Law of the land for it, and say, the Queens <note place="margin">7.</note> Statute doeth allowe vs to take vppon Vsurie tenne in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth. These are like the <hi>Iewes</hi> which sayd, <hi>We haue a lawe, and by our lawe he shall dye:</hi> when they <note place="margin">Iohn. 19. 7.</note> coulde not saye by Gods lawe he shall die, then they said <hi>by our lawe he shall dye:</hi> so when they cannot say by Gods lawe we may take Vsurie, they say by mans law we may take Vsurie, this is the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest defence of all the rest: for if Gods lawe forbid thee, can any lawe of man excuse thee? As it would not serue <hi>Adam</hi> to say, <hi>the woman bad me,</hi> so it will not serue <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> the Vsurer to say, the Lawe doth licence me. But he cannot say, the Law doth license me: for though peraduenture our law do tollerate more than should be tollerated, yet


<pb facs="tcp:4337:152"/>
I would haue you know, that our lawe doeth not allow tenne in the hundreth, nor fiue in the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth, nor one in the hundreth, nor any Vsurie at all: but there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint in our law, that no Vsurer take aboue tenne in the hundreth, it doeth not allow tenne in the hundreth, but punisheth that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant which exacteth aboue tenne in the hundreth. It is much like that tolleration which we reade of diuorces. For the hardnesse of mens hearts, Christ saith, that <note place="margin">Mat. 19. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Moses</hi> did suffer the man and wife to part asunder: So for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of mens hearts, our <hi>Moses</hi> our Prince is fame to suffer as it were a kinde of Vsurie, because otherwise no men would lende.</p>
                     <p>These are the best excuses which our Vsurers haue to pleade for themselues, against they come


<pb facs="tcp:4337:153"/>
before the tribunall of GOD; and if their reasons will not stande before men nor their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, how will they stande be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lorde?</p>
                     <p>Now, you long to heare what <note place="margin">What the Vsurer is like.</note> the Vsurer is like. To what shall I liken this generation? They are like a Butlers boxe: for as all the counters at last come to the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; so all the money at last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the Vsurer, ten after ten, and ten after ten, and ten to ten, till at last he receiue not onely ten for an hundreth, but an hundreth for ten. This is the onely difference, that the Butler ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receiue no more than he deliuered: but the Vsurer receiueth more than hee deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. They are like a Moth; euen as a Moth eateth a hole in cloath, so Vsurie eateth a hole in siluer: If you haue a peece of siluer which


<pb facs="tcp:4337:153"/>
is as much as an hundreth pounds, in one yere Vsurie will eate a hole in it as big as ten pounds: in two yeares she will eate a hole as big as twentie pounds: in three yeares she will eate a hole as big as thirtie pounds.

                     <p>Now marke whether this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie


<pb facs="tcp:4337:157"/>
of <hi>Salomon</hi> be true, I know not how many in this Citie doo increase by Vsurie; but this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie seemeth to bee verified of many: For it is noted, that the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and lands of Aldermen and Merchants, and other in <hi>London,</hi> do not last so long, nor indure so wel, as the riches and lands of others in the Countrey, and that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doo not prooue so well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor come to that place in the Common weale, which for their wealth their parents looked that they should come to. I can giue no reason for it but the reason of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, He which increaseth by Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, gathereth for them which will bee mercifull to the poore.</hi> That is, their riches shall goe from their heires to Gods heires, according to that, <hi>The riches of the sinner is laid vp for</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:4337:157"/>
shall inioy that which the wicked gathereth. All riches are vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, but the riches which are euill gotten, are most vncertaine: They may bee called mooueable goodes, for they are very mooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, like the clowdes which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer rest til they fall as they climed. God saith, that he will smite the <note place="margin">Izek. 22. 13.</note> Vsurer with his fist, not with the palme of his hande, but with his fist, which giueth a greater blow. As his hands were shut against the poore, so Gods hands shall be shut against him, that his punishment may be like his sinne. But if you will heare their finall sentence, <hi>Dauid</hi> saith heere, <hi>That they shall not dwell in Gods temple, nor rest in his holie mountaine.</hi> Then we will seeke no more punishments, for this punishment is all punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, If they shall not come to heauen,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:158"/>
whose then shall those riches be? nay, whose then shall the owner be when that day commeth? If he shall not rest in heauen, then he shall rest in Hell where no rest is. Then saith one, the Vsurer shall <note place="margin">Note.</note> crie vnto his children, Cursed be you my children, because you were the cause of these torments, for least you should be poore, I was an Vsurer, and robbed other, to leaue riches vnto you. To whome, the children shall replie againe, nay, Cursed be you father, for you were the cause of our tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for if you had not left vs other mens goodes, we had not kept other mens goodes. Thus when they are cursed of God, they shall curse one another, curse the Lord for condemning them, curse their sinnes for accusing them, curse their parents for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting


<pb facs="tcp:4337:158"/>
them, and curse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, because they cannot helpe themselues. As they which are blessed doe nothing but blesse, so they which are cursed do nothing but curse. This is the second V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie which the Vsurer shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of God, after he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Vsurie of men, then the name of Vsurie shall be fulfilled, as it signifieth biting, so when it hath bitten other, it shall bite the Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer too, and neuer rest biting; then they shall wish that they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store againe as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, and <note place="margin">Luk. 19.</note> shall not restore because their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is gone. Therefore if Christ be come to your hearts, as he came to <hi>Zacheus</hi> house, restore now as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, and escape this iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is the end of the Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and his money, if they stay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether till death, yet at last there


<pb facs="tcp:4337:159"/>
shall bee a diuision. The Deuill <note place="margin">Note.</note> shall take his soule, the earth shall take his body, the strangers shall take his goods, and the mourners shall reioyce vnder their blackes, and say, Wickednes is come to the graue. Therefore, if thou wouldest not be counted an Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then, refraine to be an Vsurer now, for they which are Vsurers now, shall be counted Vsurers then. Thus you haue heard the Vsurers payment.</p>
                     <p>Now if you will know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Whether it be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to giue Vsurie.</note> it be vnlawfull to giue Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as it is vnlawfull to take Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, I wish that you could resolue your selues, that I mighte not speake of it: for I haue hearde some Preachers say, that there be some truthes which they would be loth to preach, and so there be some truthes which I would be


<pb facs="tcp:4337:159"/>
loth to preache, because many heare by halues, and some for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or ignorance will take things otherwise than they are spoken, yet because I haue promised, I will speake some thing of it.</p>
                     <p>Well then, may we neither take Vsurie, nor giue Vsurie? I knowe that <hi>Ieremy</hi> saith, <hi>I haue</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iere. 15. 10.</note>

                        <note place="margin">1. Ob.</note> 
                        <hi>me;</hi> as though both were vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, not only to take Vsurie, but to giue Vsurie. But thereby <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> doeth signifie, that he was <note place="margin">Answer.</note> no medler in the world, whereby they should enuie him like other men, and therefore hee cleareth himselfe chiefely from Vsurie, because Vsurers were most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyed. And to shewe that he was not an Vsurer, he saith, that he was not a borrower, which is


<pb facs="tcp:4337:160"/>
more lawfull than to be an Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, like a man which saith I doe neither hate him, nor knowe him. Why it was lawfull to knowe him, but to proue that he did not hate him, he sayth, he doth not knowe him: So <hi>Ieremy,</hi> to proue that he had not lent vppon Vsurie, doth say, that hee neuer borrowed vppon Vsurie, which many will doe that will not lende. The best Expositors giue this sense of it. I knowe beside, that <note place="margin">2. Ob.</note> Christ did cast forth the buyers out of his temple, as well as the sellers, but that was not for buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Answer.</note> but for buying in the temple, where they should not buy, but pray: or else it was as lawfull to buy any thing, as it is lawfull to vse it.</p>
                     <p>I know beside, that it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">3. Ob.</note> saying, if there were no buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:160"/>
there would be no sellers, if there were no bribe giuers, there would be no bribe takers. But in this case it may be rather sayd, if <note place="margin">Answer.</note> there were no takers, there would be no giuers, for the giuer doeth not make the receiuer to take, but the receiuer doth make the giuer to giue, because he will not lende vnlesse the other will giue him for the lone: therefore as we say, the receiuer makes a theese: so I may say, the receiuer of Vsurie makes the giuer of Vsurie. Therefore I would be loth to compare them which are constrained to borrow vppon Vsurie, vnto them which did buy in the temple, and were not constrayned more than they which solde in the temple. Much lesse may I compare them which giue Vsurie, vnto them which take Vsurie: for there is as great


<pb facs="tcp:4337:161"/>
oddes betweene them, as there is betweene giuing and taking, or betweene couetousnesse and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie, for one is couetousnesse, and the other is necessitie. Hee which lendeth for Vsurie, lendeth for couetousnesse, but he which borroweth vpon Vsurie, borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for necessitie.</p>
                     <p>Now, for necessitie God hath allowed many things; as for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie it was lawfull for <hi>Adams</hi> sonnes to marrie with <hi>Adams</hi> daughters, because there were no other women. For necessitie it was lawfull for <hi>Dauid</hi> to eate the Shew bread, because he had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foode. For necessitie it was <note place="margin">1. Sam. 21. 6.</note> lawfull to worke, and heale, and fight vppon the Saboath, which <note place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>k. 13 10.</note> was not lawfull, but for necessitie. Therefore for necessitie why may not a man pay more than he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:161"/>
seeing no Scripture doth forbid vs to pay more than wee borrow, but to require more than wee lend. Some doo thinke that as GOD did vse the ambition of <hi>Absalom,</hi> and the malice of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> &amp; the trecherie of <hi>Iudas</hi> vnto good; so men may vse the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes of vsurers vnto good: that is, to helpe at a neede, when a man is like to bee vndone, and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren cast away, and his Lease for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, and many inconueniences beside like to insue (which you knowe better than I) vnlesse hee haue present money at some time to preuent a mischiefe. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hereof, I may alleage how <hi>Iaacob</hi> did vse the sinne of <hi>Laban:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 53.</note> 
                        <hi>Laban</hi> did euill in swearing by I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls, but <hi>Iaacob</hi> did not euill in receiuing such an oath of him, though it was an vnlawfull oath.


<pb facs="tcp:4337:162"/>
So, though the Vsurer doo euill in taking Vsurie, yet a man doth not euill in giuing Vsurie. Beside, I may alleage the example of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Abimelech: Abraham</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 32.</note> made a couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with <hi>Abimelech;</hi> to confirme this couenant, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> sware, and <hi>Abimelech</hi> sware, <hi>Abraham</hi> sware by the true God, but <hi>Abimelech</hi> sware by his false Gods, and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> did receiue this oath and sinned not. So, if her Maiestie and the Turke should make a couenant, the Turk would not sweare as the Queene would sweare; for the Queene would sweare by the Lorde, but the Turke would sweare by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet: if it be lawfull then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue such an oath, though it bee an vnlawfull oath, why may it not bee lawfull for mee, to giue more than I borrowed, though it bee


<pb facs="tcp:4337:162"/>
vnlawfull for the Vsurer to take more than hee lended? Beside, a Prince may not pardon a wilfull murderer, yet I think that no man wil say in hast, that he which hath committed murder may not take a pardon. As this vnlawfull giuing doth not make the taking vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; so the other vnlawfull taking doth not make the giuing vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Beside, it is lawfull to suffer iniurie, though it be vnlawfull to offer iniurie: It is lawfull to suffer iniurie, as Christ paide tribute, <note place="margin">Mat. 17. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>9</note> which was iniurie; but it is not lawfull to offer iniurie, because there are sixe Commandements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</p>
                     <p>Now, to take Vsurie, is as it were to offer iniurie; but to giue Vsurie, is as it were to suffer iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: therefore though I may not take more than I borrowed, yet I


<pb facs="tcp:4337:163"/>
may giue more than I borrowed.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, I may compate gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Vsurie to swearing; if a man sweare without cause he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; but if he sweare as the word teacheth him to sweare, he sinneth not: so, if a man borrow vpon V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie and borrow without cause, he sinneth, because he feedeth the Vsurer: but els, as a man maye sweare in some case, so in some case a man may borrowe vpon V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, that is, in case of necessitie, when a man must needes borrow, and can borrowe of none but of Vsurers.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, I may alleage that Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and Vsurer are neuer read in the scripture, but they signifie him which takes Vsurie, not him which giues Vsurie: and therfore the Scripture seemeth to forbid taking, but not giuing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:4337:163"/>
Many reasons moe are alleaged which I cannot refute, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not contradict them: yet I meane not to decide the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, because I will not be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but if some should come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in that necessitie and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie which I can imagine, and aske; may I borrowe money of these Vsurers to saue my life, or my credite, or my liuing, seeing no man will lend mee freelie? I would answere him as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet answered <hi>Naaman,</hi> neither doo nor doo not, but <hi>goe in peace.</hi> I will not forbid thee nor I will not condemne thee, but if thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence condemne thee not, I thinke thy sinne one of the least sinnes; &amp; as <hi>Naaman</hi> praied, <hi>Lord be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. King. 5. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>vnto me in this:</hi> so I think the Lord will bee mercifull vnto thee in this: but if thy conscience goe


<pb facs="tcp:4337:164"/>
against it: then doo it not, for it is sinne to thee though it bee free for another, because whatsoeuer is not done of faith is sinne. I charge <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 23.</note> you in the feare of GOD that you do not mistake that which is said, for I knowe no learned preacher, nor learned writer of other mind. Yet least you should mistake the matter, as I distinguished of len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, so I will distinguish of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers.</p>
                     <p>If some may borrow vpon V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, it dooth not followe that all <note place="margin">Diuers kindes of borrowers.</note> may borrowe vppon Vsurie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all haue not the like cause: therefore doo not say that I teach you to borrowe vpon Vsurie, for I think that the most in this citie which borrowe vppon Vsurie, should not borrowe as they doo, because they rather maintaine V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, than supplie their necessitie.


<pb facs="tcp:4337:164"/>
Some I know borrow for meere necessitie; if any may be allowed, those are they: but there is a kind of borrowers in this Citie which feede Vsurers as the bellowes kindle the fire; for they haue no neede to borrow, but because they would bee rich, and richer, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest of all: therfore they will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy al the money which they can borrowe, thinking to get more by the vse of it, than the Vsurie of it doth come too. This maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sell their wares so deare, because they must not only gaine the price but the interest beside, and more than the interest too, or els they gaine nothing. These borrowers are in another predicament than those which borrowe for neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie: and therefore if they bee not olde enough to answere for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, I am too young to answere


<pb facs="tcp:4337:165"/>
for them. There are other bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers as I haue heard, which for some secrete cause would seeme barer and needier than they are, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because they would not bee charged deeplie with Subsidies, or els because they would compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with their Creditors for a little: therefore they will haue alwaies some thing for Vsurie, that their Creditors may thinke them bare of money, or that other may pitie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their charges. These are like those Foxes which haue wealth enough to pay their debts, and yet lie in prison because they would defraud their Creditors. I doubt not but there bee moe sorts than I knowe, I cannot hunt euerie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner because I want experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: but this is my conclusion, I would <note place="margin">Note.</note> haue no man pay interest vnto V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers but for necessitie, euen as a

trauailer giueth his pursse to a theefe, because he cannot choose. Thus you haue heard what I can say of them which take Vsurie, and them which giue Vsurie.</p>
                     <p>Now you would vnderstand the last question. If you haue bin Vsurers alreadie, what you should <note place="margin">What Vsurers should doe with their gaines.</note> doe with that money which you haue gained by Vsurie, surely euen as <hi>Zacheus</hi> did, restore it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. If you cannot say as <hi>Samuel</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Sam. 12. 3.</note> said, <hi>whose goods haue I taken?</hi> then you must saye as <hi>Zacheus</hi> sayde, <note place="margin">Luk. 19. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>whose goodes haue I kept?</hi> The best thing is, to doe no man wrong, but the next to that is, to make him amends. This God signifieth when he saith, <hi>put away the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Iosh. 6. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>thing from you,</hi> that is, let no vnlawfull thing staye in youre hands, like the wedge of <hi>Achan</hi> which he had got by sinne. The


<pb facs="tcp:4337:166"/>
same lawe serueth for all which is got wrongfully, which was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted against theeues, <hi>Restore it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 22.</note> the reason of this lawe is, because the sinne is not remitted, vntill the debt be restored, for as humilitie is the repentaunce of pride, and abstinence is the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce of surfet, and almes is the repentaunce of couetousnes, and forgiuenes is the repentaunce of malice, so restitution is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce of Vsurie; as he which is not humble doeth not repent his pride, he which doeth not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine doth not repent his glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, he which doeth not forgiue, doeth not repent his malice, so he which doeth not restore, doeth not repent his Vsurie. For how can he be said to repent for his V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, which liueth by Vsurie still. Therefore <hi>Daniel</hi> saith to <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 24.</note>


                        <pb facs="tcp:4337:166"/>
                        <hi>Breake off thy sinnes by righteousnes,</hi> shewing, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but righteousnes can breake vnrighteousnes. As diseases are healed by the contrarie, so pride is healed by humilitie, gluttonie by abstinence, malice by forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, couetousnes by almes, and V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie by restoring. This <hi>Paule</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, <hi>The reuenge of a Christian,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 11.</note> when he takes reuenge vpon his sinnes, and punisheth his lustes, so that he maketh them doe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to that which they would do. Therefore you must restore that which you haue got by Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or else you doe not repent of your Vsurie. As a Camell whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he comes home, casteth off his burthen at the dore, that he may enter into his Stable, so they which are laden with other mens goodes, when they goe to heauen,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:167"/>
must leaue their burthen where they had it, least they be too grose to get in at the narrow gate. But as the Disciples of Christ said, <hi>this is a hard speech,</hi> so to them which <note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 60.</note> haue got most that they haue by vnlawfull meanes, this is a hard speech, to bid them restore it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: there be two great rubs in the way.</p>
                     <p>First, the losse which they shall sustaine, if they restore againe all <note place="margin">Two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections.</note> which they haue got vniustlie. Then the difficultie to restore it vnto the right parties. If you aske mee, as <hi>Amaziah</hi> asked the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>How shall we doo for those hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Chro. 25. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>tallents?</hi> How shall I liue when al is gone which I haue got wrongfully? I can say no more than the Prophet said to him, <hi>The Lord is able to giue thee more than this. Zacheus</hi> did not feare how he <note place="margin">Luk. 19.</note>


                        <pb facs="tcp:4337:167"/>
should liue, but <hi>Zacheus</hi> did feare to offende: so thou shouldest not feare to restore other mens goods, but thou shouldest feare to keepe other mens goods: and as <hi>Zacheus</hi> liued when hee had restored, so thou shalt liue when thou hast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored. He which saith, <hi>Trie me if</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Mala. 3. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>I will not powre downe a blessing,</hi> trie him whether he will not powre downe a blessing; for he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to blesse the lender aswell <note place="margin">Deut. 15. 10.</note> as the sacrificer. He which is the Lorde of all, can giue thee more than thou needest: but if you can not restore to the owner, nor to his heires, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue it to the poore, for they are the next heires, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that thou hast kept it so long: but in no wise thou maiest keepe it to thy selfe, because it is none of thine.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was like to


<pb facs="tcp:4337:168"/>
die, <hi>Esaiah</hi> sayd vnto him, <hi>Set thy</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Esai. 38. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>things in order before thou die.</hi> That which hee aduised him, hee adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth all; set your things in order before you die. What is this to set things in order, but to restore vnto euerie one his owne? When thou bequeathest thy bodie to the earth, then thy bodie is set in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: when thou bequeathest thy soule to God, then thy soule is set in order: when thou bequeathest thy goods to the owners, then thy goods are set in order: therefore if thou die with other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s goods in thy hand, then thou diest before thou haue set things in order, and then thou diest in thy sinnes, and then no promise in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture appertaineth vnto thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing is promised vnto sinners but vnto penitent sinners. Therefore that you may not die in


<pb facs="tcp:4337:168"/>
your sinnes, it is necessary to make restitution before you die, or els you die in your sinne, and are cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out of all the ioyes of heauen. Therefore as <hi>Abner</hi> saide to <hi>Ioah,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2. Sam. 2. 26.</note> 
                        <hi>Knowest thou not that it will be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes in the latter end?</hi> So remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whether this course will bee sweete or bitter in the end.</p>
                     <p>Thus you haue heard the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Vsurie, and the deriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and the vnlawfulnes of it, and the kindes of it, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of it, and the arguments which are alleaged for it, &amp; what may bee thought of them which doo not take Vsurie but giue V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, and what they should doo which haue got their liuing by V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie.</p>
                     <p>Now, seeing you may not bee Vsurers to men, let euerie man hereafter bee an Vsurer to GOD,


<pb facs="tcp:4337:169"/>
which promiseth; If thou leaue father, or mother, or wife, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <note place="margin">Math. 19. 29.</note> or house, or land for him, not ten in the hundreth, but an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth for ten; nay an hundreth for one, and in the world to come life euerlasting: that is, a thousand for one. That we may receiue this V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, let vs pray that the wordes which wee haue heard out of this Psalme, may dwell with vs till we dwell in heauen.</p>
