            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>GOD hath a Controverſie with our Land,</l>
            <l>And In an evil plight Affairs do ſtand:</l>
            <l>Already we do ſmart for doing ill,</l>
            <l>Yet us the hand of God afflicteth ſtill,</l>
            <l>And many ſee it not; as many be</l>
            <l>So wilful, that his hand they will not ſee.</l>
            <l>Some plainly view the ſame, but nothing care;</l>
            <l>Some at the ſight thereof amazed are</l>
            <l>Like <hi>Belthazar,</hi> and have a trembling heart,</l>
            <l>Yet will not from their vanities depart.</l>
            <l>Some dream that all things do by chance ſucceed,</l>

            <l>Thoſe Tyrants who by cruelty and force,</l>

            <l>Then wo to them that have corrupted been,</l>
            <l>To juſtifie the wicked in his ſin;</l>
            <l>Or, for a bribe the righteous to condemn:</l>
            <l>For flames (as on the chaff) ſhall ſeize on them:</l>
            <l>Their bodies to the Dunghil ſhall be caſt;</l>
            <l>Their flower ſhall turn to duſt their flock ſhall waſte,</l>
            <l>And all the glorious titles they have worn,</l>
            <l>Shall but increaſe their infamy and ſcorn.</l>
            <l>Then wo to them that have been raiſ'd aloft</l>
            <l>By good mens ruins; and by laying ſoft</l>
            <l>And eaſie pillows under great mens Arms.</l>
            <l>To make them pleas'd in their alluring charms.</l>
            <l>We gather Armies, and we Fleets prepare;</l>
            <l>And then; both ſtrong and ſafe we think we are.</l>
            <l>But when we look for Victories and glory,</l>
            <l>What follows, but events that make us ſorry?</l>
            <l>And 'tis Gods mercy that we turn our faces</l>
            <l>With ſo few loſſes, and no more diſgraces.</l>
            <l>For what are moſt of thoſe whom we commend</l>
            <l>Such actions to; and whom we forth do ſend</l>
            <l>To fight thoſe Battles which the Lords we call,</l>
            <l>But ſuch as neither fight for him at all?</l>
            <l>Whom doſt thou make thy Captains, and diſpoſe</l>
            <l>Such offices unto, but unto thoſe</l>
            <l>(Some few excepted) who procure by friends</l>
            <l>Command, and pay to ſerve their private ends,</l>
            <l>Theſe by their unrepented ſins, betray</l>
            <l>Thy <hi>Cauſe</hi>; by theſe, the honour, and the day</l>
            <l>Is loſt: and when thou hopeſt that thy trouble</l>
            <l>Shall have an end, thy danger waxeth double.</l>
            <l>We fain would be at peace, but few men go</l>
            <l>That way, as yet, whereby it may be ſo.</l>
            <l>We have not that humility which muſt</l>
            <l>Effect it: we are falſe and cannot truſt</l>
            <l>Each other, no nor God with true confeſſions;</l>
            <l>Which ſhews that we abhor not our tranſgreſſions.</l>
            <l>It proves, that of our errors we in heart</l>
            <l>Repent not, neither purpoſe to depart</l>
            <l>From any folly. For all they that are</l>
            <l>Sincerely penitent, do nothing fear</l>
            <l>So much as their own guilt, nor ſeek to gain</l>
            <l>Ought, more than to be reconcil'd again.</l>
            <l>And they that are thus minded, never can</l>
            <l>Be long unreconcil'd to God or man.</l>
            <l>Believe me <hi>England,</hi> howſoever ſome</l>
            <l>Who ſhould foreſee thy plagues before they come,</l>
            <l>Endeavour to perſwade thee that thou haſt</l>
            <l>A hopeful time, and that the worſt is paſt</l>
            <l>Yet I dare boldly tell thee, thou haſt nigh</l>
            <l>Worn out Gods patience by impiety.</l>
            <l>And that unleſs the ſame we do renew</l>
            <l>By patience, our folly we ſhall rue.</l>
            <l>And, if we do not more Gods will regard,</l>
            <l>That miſchief is but for a time defer'd.</l>
            <l>Be mindful therefore while it is to <hi>day</hi>;</l>
            <l>And let no good occaſion ſlip away.</l>
            <l>Now rend your hearts, ye <hi>Britains,</hi> waſh and rinse them</l>
            <l>From all corruption, from all evil cleanſe them,</l>
            <l>Go offer up the pleaſing Sacrifice</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Righteouſneſs:</hi> from folly turn your eyes.</l>
            <l>Seek peace, and follow it with ſtrict purſute:</l>
            <l>Relieve the needy; Judgment execute;</l>
            <l>Refreſh the weary, right the fatherleſs:</l>
            <l>The ſtrangers and the widows wants redreſs:</l>
            <l>Give praiſe to God, depend with lowly faith</l>
            <l>On him, and what his holy <hi>Spirit</hi> ſaith:</l>
            <l>Remember what a price thy ranſom coſt,</l>
            <l>And now redeem the time that thou haſt loſt.</l>
            <l>Return, return thou (oh back-ſliding Nation)</l>
            <l>And, let thy tears prevent thy deſolation:</l>
            <l>As yet thou maiſt return: For Gods embrace</l>
            <l>Is open for thee, if thou haſt the grace</l>
            <l>To give it meeting. Yet, Repentance may</l>
            <l>Prevent the miſchiefs of that evil day</l>
            <l>Which here is mention'd: yet, thou maiſt have peace,</l>
            <l>And by diſcreet endeavouring, encreaſe</l>
            <l>Each outward grace, and ev'ry inward thing,</l>
            <l>Which will additions to thy comfort bring.</l>
            <l>Now grant us peace, O Lord! for perilous</l>
            <l>The times are grown, and no man fights for us</l>
            <l>But thou, O God! Nor do we ſeek or crave,</l>
            <l>That any other <hi>Champion</hi> we have.</l>
            <l>Thy Church in theſe Dominions, Lord preſerve</l>
            <l>In purity, and teach us thee to ſerve</l>
            <l>In holineſs and righteouſneſs, until</l>
            <l>We ſhall the number of our days fulfil.</l>
            <l>Defend this Kingdom from all overthrows,</l>
            <l>By forraign Enemies, or home-bred foes.</l>
            <l>Our King with ev'ry grace and vertue bleſs,</l>
            <l>With thine honour, and his own encreaſe.</l>
            <l>Inflame our Nobles with more love and zeal,</l>
            <l>To thy true Spouſe, and to this Common-weal.</l>
            <l>Inſpire our Clergy in their ſeveral places,</l>
            <l>With knowledge, and all ſanctifying Graces;</l>
            <l>That by their Lives and Doctrines they may rear</l>
            <l>Thoſe parts of <hi>Zion</hi> which decayed are.</l>
            <l>Awake theſe <hi>People,</hi> give them ſouls that may</l>
