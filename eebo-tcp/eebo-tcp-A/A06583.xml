            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>My case were light <hi>Hephestion,</hi> and notwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called loue, if reason were a remedie, or sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses could salue, that sense cannot conceaue, Litle do you know, and therefore sleightly doe you regard the dead embers in a priuate perso, or liue coles in a great prince, whose passions and thoughts do as farre exceede others in extremitie, as their callinges doe in Maiestie. An E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse in the Sunne is more then the fallinge of a starre, none can conceiue the tormentes of a king, vnlesse hee be a king; whose desires are not inferiour to their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<pb facs="tcp:23181:12"/>
And then iudge <hi>Hephestion</hi> if the agonies of loue be dangerous in a subiect, whether they be not more then deadly vnto <hi>Alexander,</hi> whose deep and not to be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiued sighes, cleaue the heart in shiuers, whose woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thoughtes can neither be expressed nor endured. Cease then <hi>Hephestion</hi> with argumentes to seeke to refel that, which with their deitie the Gods cannot resist, and let this suffice to aunswere thee, that it is a king that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and <hi>Alexander,</hi> whose affections are not to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by reason, being immortall, nor I feare me to bee borne being intollerable.</p>

Yes, yes <hi>Apelles,</hi> thou maist smimme against the streame with the Crab, and feede againste the winde with the deere, and pecke against the steele with the Cockatrice: starres are to be looked at, not reached at. Princes to be yelded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, not contended with, <hi>Campaspe</hi> to bee honoured, not obteined, to be painted, not possessed of thee: O fair face, O vnhappy hand, &amp; why didst thou draw it so faire a face?

Blush <hi>Venus,</hi> for I am ashamed to end thee. Now must I paint things vnpossible for mine arte, but agreeable with my affections: deepe and hollowe sighes, sadde and melancholye thoughtes, woundes and slaughters of conceites, a life posting to death, a death galloping from life, a wauering constancie, an vnsetled resolution, and what not, <hi>Apelles?</hi> And what but <hi>Apelles?</hi> But as they that are shaken with a feuer are to bee war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with clothes, not groanes, and as he that melteth in

a consumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to be recured by Colices, not conceits: so the feeding canker of my care, the neuer dying worm of my heart, is to be killed by counsel, not cries, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of remedies, not by replying of reasons. And sith in cases desperat there must be vsed medicines y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, I will hazard that litle life that is left, to restore the greater part that is lost, and this shalbe my first pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise: for wit must worke, where authoritie is not. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as <hi>Alexander</hi> hath viewed this portraiture, I will by deuise giue it a blemishe, that by that meanes shee maye come againe to my shop, and then as good it were to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my loue, and die with deniall, as conceale it and liue in despaire.</p>

What do you els in Athens but sleepe in the daye, and surfeite in the night: back Gods in the morning with pride, in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening belly Gods with gluttony. You flatter kings, &amp; call them Gods, speak trueth of your selues, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse you are deuils. From the Bee you haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but the wax to make your religion, framing it to the time, not to the trueth. Your filthy lust you colour vnder a courtly colour of loue, iniuries abroad vnder the title of pollicies at home, &amp; secrete malice creepeth vnder the name of publike iustice. You haue caused <hi>Alexander</hi> to dry vp springs and plant vines, to sow roket and weede endisse, to sheare sheepe, and shrine foxes. All conscience is sealed at Athens. Swearing commeth of a hot mettle: lying of a quick wit: flattery of a flowing tong, vndecent talk of a mery disposition. Al things are lawful at Athe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Either you think there are no Gods, or I must think yee are no men. You build as though you shoulde liue for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and surfeit as though you should die tomorow.

thy loue commeth from the hearte, but <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> from the mouth. The loue of Kynges is lyke the blowinge of windes, whiche whistle sometimes gently amonge the leaues, and straight waies turne the trees vp by the rootes, or fire which warmeth a farre off, and burneth neere hand, or the sea, which maketh men hoyse their sayles in a flattering calme, and to cut their mastes in a rough storme. They place affection by times, by pollicie, by appointment, if they frowne, who dares call them vnconstant, if bewray secretes, who wil tearme them vntrue, if fall to other loues, who trembles not, if he call them vnfaithfull. In kinges there can be no loue, but to Queenes: for as neere must they meete in maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, as they doe in affection. It is requisite to stande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loofe from kings loue, <hi>loue,</hi> and lightening.</p>

If hee espy or but suspect, thou must needes twise perishe with his hate, and thine owne loue. Thy pale lookes, when he blushed, thy sadde countenaunce, when hee smyled, thy sighes, when he questioned, may breede in him a ielosie, perchaunce a frenzey. O loue, I neuer beefore knewe what thou wert, and nowe haste thou made mee that I know not what my self am? Onely this I knowe, that I must endure intollerable passions, for vnknowne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. Dispute not the cause wretch, but yeelde to it: for better it is to melt with desire, then wrastle with loue. Cast thy selfe on thy carefull bedde, be content to lyue vnknown, and die vnfounde.
