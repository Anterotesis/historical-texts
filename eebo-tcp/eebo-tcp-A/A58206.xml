            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for writing something in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

some stingy expressions, but also such a

not unjustly to cry, <hi>Mors est in ollâ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King 4. 39, 40</note> It
was truly reported by some judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
who had perused the same, that there
are many dangerous stumbling-blocks
to weak Christians, and subtil arguments
for defence and animation of the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi>
being cloathed with so much wit,
sophistry and learning, as indeed make the

that <hi>Cuman-beast,</hi> which going up and

more ridiculous then dangerous. Being
therefore exhorted by sundry of my reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend

herein laid down by way of <hi>Plea</hi> (I hope
rather tentatively, then dogmatically) and
being perswaded, that in so doing I might
in a great part satisfie my engagement, the
learned Author having said much more, or
in more plausible terms, then ever the
<hi>Anabaptists,</hi> for ought that I have ever
seen or heard have yet alledged for their

although I hope he let fall these
things, as <hi>Boaz Reapers,</hi> on purpose that
some might for good advantage to the
truth of Christ glean after him; yet seeing
he hath so sharply and strenuously pleaded
against the same; that Religion may say of
her hurts on some less armed parts,<note place="margin">Zach. 13. 6</note>

And we may say in these giddy times, as

(saith he) <hi>that's wise, will therefore presume

What he did in his Retractations, many

of untruth, by acknowledging the truth,
and disavowing a known errour. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth
Christ, who is silent for fear or favor
of men, when and where he ought to speak
in defence of his truth; how much more
he that doth <hi>omnes nerves intendere,</hi> in the

had some better intention and aim then

Let the good Reader take notice, that in
the conclusion of this Plea, the advocate
saith, <hi>That men have disputed against them</hi>
(the Anabaptists) <hi>with so much weakness
and confidence, that they have been encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
in their errour more by the accidental
advantages we have given them by our weak
arguings, then by any truth of their cause, or
excellency of their wit:</hi> And I conceive that
he will think with me, that it should be a
motive to him, to whom God hath given
more excellency of art and nature to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the truth which he hath opposed, lest
<pb facs="tcp:118641:8"/>
otherwise he sacrilegiously eclipse Gods
honour, by a kinde of Interposition of that
body which shineth by no other light then
that which God lent. If he that hid his
Masters talent, so that it did neither good
nor harm, yet heard his<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, what
(except in case of timely repentance) may
they expect, who with those many talents
which their Master entrusted to them, have
assisted and furnished the known enemy
with arms against their Master? Consider
what I say, and the Lord give you a right
understanding in all things. Lastly, I have
to entreat the well-affected Reader, not to
misdeem some repetitions of the same
things (in cases of such conflicts unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able)
wherein the adversaries often stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
at the same parts, requires the same
or the like wards for defence of the truth:
<hi>And now the God of all grace, who hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
us into his eternal glory by Christ Jesus—
make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle
you: To him be glory and dominion for ever

            <p>WE say, That denying Baptism to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,

of Spirit, but that it is subject to some errors: and therefore
though we disclaim all blind obedience to man in acts of

this plea must be, except you are in earnest for the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists)

thereby to endanger (as much as you can) the Cause and
Truth of Christ. And how it can be either pleasing to any
good Christian, which displeaseth God, or profitable which
causeth any to erre from the truth in pleading for that which
you acknowledge to be a Doctrine justly condemned—
I confesse I understand not. Possibly <hi>Joash</hi> would here have

your Proposition is not true, nor owned by us: but if you

            <p>What acts of understanding elect Infants dying have, I

will abominate and loath this bold and uncharitable censure.
Who admitted you into the secret of Gods councel, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thestate of Infants, whom either he preserveth to age, or
taketh away before they could be baptized? It is better resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
to a worse end, by your self, p. 231. <hi>Num. 16. Many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
ways there are by which God can bring any reasonable soul
unto himself.</hi>—And here in the very next place you affirm,
That <hi>God hath made a promise of the holy Ghost to Infants
as well as to men.</hi>—Reconcile these two, and your self to
your self, if you can. First, you say,—<hi>Grace hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
or efficacy upon their faculties, who can do no naturall
acts of understanding:</hi> And next you affirm, that God hath
made a <hi>promise of the holy Ghost to Infants as well as to men.</hi>
I demand, Doth God perform every one of his promises?
Do you mean by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the gifts and graces of
Gods holy Spirit regenerating the elect to the Kingdome of
Heaven? Can any be saved without such grace? can the holy
Ghost be inactive, and without effectuall influence in any
soul? Doth God give in his good time, and measure, his grace
of Regeneration to all the elect, that is, a powerful influence
on them to regenerate, sanctifie, and finally save them? Doth
God save any Infants? These things being concluded on, I
would fain learn how it can be true, that children have no
internall means of salvation: or that Gods Spirit hath <hi>no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon their faculties?</hi> Doth the reasonable soul of an
Infant express an admirable influence on the bodily faculties,
by a naturall instinct for its preservation; and shall not the
Creator, the Spirit of Almighty God, have much more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118641:13"/>
active influence on the soul of the elect to save it, though
there appear none, or very slender acts of understanding to
the judgement and sense of man.</p>
            <p>This your Proposition will appear false, if we consider
infants circumcision; those could do as few acts of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
as infants now can: neither can any man without
high impiety affirm, that Gods grace had no <hi>influence</hi> or <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy</hi>
on them whom he did not in vain command to be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into his covenant. It is well observed by our party, that
the Sacraments are not bare resemblances, or memorials of
things past, neither naked signes or testimonies of grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
but also <hi>Canales gratiae,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ursin Catech. part. 2. de Bap. Conclus. 9.</note> whereby God ordinarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveth

so that these holy signes are not empty, void of, or
without the things signified, although the things are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
after one manner, and the signes after another; one is
given by God alone, without the observation and knowledge
of man, and the other onely by the ministry of man, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
men: As at first <hi>John Baptist</hi> baptized with water, and
Christ baptized with the holy Ghost, though he baptized
not with water, but his Disciples and substitutes; neither
did <hi>John</hi> baptize with the holy Ghost, but Christ: So is it
now, Christ baptizeth elect infants by the secret influence of
his holy Spirit, the fruits whereof appear in their season, and
his Ministers, according to his appointment, baptize with
water.</p>

to seal up the admitted to faith, repentance, mortification,

10. How much more rationally may he make covenant with
infants, though yet without the actuall use of reason? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
sometimes such covenants are made between men, as
that the parent or parents covenant for, or in stead of their
children, because they are not yet of age to understand the
words and purport of the covenant, and it standeth good.
How much rather may God covenant with an infant, whose
mouth and Advocate, Christ Jesus, said expressly, <hi>Suffer little
children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such
is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mark 10. 14. Luke 18. 16. I
demand, <hi>quojure,</hi> by what right is the Kingdom of Heaven

<hi>that which is born of the flesh, is flesh,</hi> John 3. 6. And <hi>flesh and

therefore be by the free covenant of God with them, out of
which it can belong to none by right of any infant-inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,

agreeing in substance, did yet differ in many circumstances.
First, in the Rite or Ceremony. Secondly, in the manner of
signifying: For Circumcision held out grace in the

make good the promise: for then God promised, not onely
a covenant with his Church, but a peculiar place for the
same, the land of <hi>Cauaan,</hi> untill the coming of the promised
Seed: but baptism hath no particular promise of this, or that
fixed place. Fourthly, in the manner of binding; Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
did oblige the circumcised to the observation of the
whole Law, Morall, Ceremoniall,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 3.</note> and Judiciall: but baptism

them twice regenerate or born: If you mean <hi>Believers</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(for in reason you cannot call an unbeliever or wicked
person a spirituall infant) then I would fain learn by what
discerning spirit you can know when, and whom to baptize,
and whom to put by; or which infant, according to the
flesh, is not a spiritual infant, by the spirit of regeneration: If
you say that those who are of years, profess faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and therefore are to be baptized, it is easily rejoined;
what ere they professe they may be hypocrites; and then no
more spirituall Infants then <hi>Judas</hi> or <hi>Simon Magus</hi> were: If
you say that in charity you take them for spirituall. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That an opinion that may be so easily false, and in
which any man without speciall revelation may be deceived,
is a very unproportionable ground of so sharp a controversie,
as causeth your Clients to forsake the Church of Christ.
Next, I say, had you but as much charity towards infants,
whom no actuall sins have yet stained, you would as freely
judge them spirituall infants, and so, by your own Principle,
to be baptized, as those of years, of whom possibly you may
know much evill, without all controversie they have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sins to be repented of; and why should you not afford
harmless Infants who cannot dissemble, as much cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

from Gods abundant mercy in the remission of their sins,

for your confirmation. Thirdly from the extent of Gods

that promise is recorded <hi>Gen. 17. 7. I will establish my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

unto thee and thy seed after thee,</hi> &amp;c. these words <hi>S. Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth
to, when he perswaded them to receive baptisme the

1. That the great disposition which you talk of, was not so
much the gift of miracles, as the persons inward baptism by
the spirit of regeneration and sanctification: for the gift of
miracles is not of it self, any certain argument of salvation:

a certain manner, the Sacrament of Christs body is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:118641:40"/>
the body of Christ; the Sacrament of Christs blood, is the
blood of Christ; so the Sacrament of faith, is faith: Now
to believe, is nothing else but to have faith; and so when
'tis answered that the infant believeth, who hath not yet
the affection of faith; we answer, that he hath faith in
respect of the sacrament of faith; and that he conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to God, in respect of the sacrament of conversion;
because even that very answer appertaineth unto the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of the Sacrament; as the Apostle speaketh of
baptism it self; We are, saith he, <hi>Buried with him by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism

saith, <hi>We are buried</hi>—therefore he called the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of so great a matter, by no other name then of
the thing it self: So that faith, though it be not yet such
as consisteth in the will of believers, yet the very Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of that faith, makes a (baptized) infant faithfull,
or a believer: For as 'tis answered that he believeth, so
is he called a believer; not signifying that thing in the

of that very thing; to wit, of believing, and giving his

True, infants have neither ability nor will to come to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;

nor his Apostles (that appears) did, <hi>is against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Analogie of Christs Doctrine; but Christ never gave
any precept to baptize them, &amp;c.</hi> ergo.—I answer, This
foundred Argument, lame on both feet, doth poorly
charge. 1. 'Tis not true that all is against the perpetual
Analogie of Christs Doctrine for which no express pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of Christ, or practice of himself or his Apostles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
for there are many things circumstantial and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
neither commanded nor forbidden, which yet on
second thoughts you will not say are <hi>against the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Analogie of Christs Doctrine</hi>: I might instance the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
or numbers, or sexes, or places where, in the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Lords Supper: Where do you read of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Christ, or practice of himself or Apostles, that
the Communicants should stand, or sit, or kneel, or lie
down; one of these (or if you can think of any other)
must needs be; shew us either precept or practice obliging
to either; where is any precept of Christ obliging to a set
or determined number of Communicants: where are we
commanded to administer to women? where is any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
obliging to a place? who knows not that these and
the like things are left under the general rule, <hi>Let all
things be done decently, and in order</hi>? which observed they
are not against the <hi>Analogie of Christs Doctrine.</hi> Again,
what think you of the Sabath, is that which we now doe
therein against the <hi>Analogie of Christs Doctrine,</hi> because
we find no express precept or practice of Christ or his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples
for the translation of it? That it is and ought to
be the Christian Sabbath, is grounded on necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
but no express precept. 2. It is also notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
false, that Christ never gave any express precept to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
all Nations, without any exception to infants within
the Covenant; and who knoweth not that infants ever
were and are a great part of every Nation; what then?
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118641:44"/>
though he never said in so many syllables, or by naming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
go and baptize them also, is it not sufficient to name
all Nations without enumeration of particulars? Indeed
he needed not give such an express command concerning
children, seeing that he sent them to administer this seal
of the new Covenant and Sacrament of initiation, who
were in the old, their selves sealed in their infancy by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
and so used to that Doctrine of childrens being
within the Covenant with believing parents, and the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
practice of their initiation and reception into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of a visible Church, that it might have seemed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
superfluous to say any more then <hi>Go baptize all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
There is also much difference, <hi>Inter ecclesiam consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuendam,
&amp; constitutam</hi>; the Apostles business was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to baptize Heathens and converted unbelievers;
but we have to deal with a Church constituted; therefore
faith and repentance, were so often mentioned in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Apostles practice; but we living in a setled
Church, have to deal with baptizing infants who cannot
yet actually believe or repent: But in that no particulars
are mentioned in Christs universal command to baptize,
it sheweth that all within the Church-priviledg and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of God are included. Again, whereas you require
a command <hi>in terminis</hi> for baptizing infants, I demand,
Where doth he <hi>in terminis</hi> say, Baptize men of years, or
Kings, peasants, rich, poor, high, low, men, women, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
Countrey-men, Fishers, Husbandmen, Threshers,
Shooemakers, Taylors, Shop-keepers, or Mechanicks?<note place="margin">Ursin. par. 2.</note>
He commandeth that all be baptized, of what sex, age, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

with a general precept including childrens baptism,
seeing no exception of the Covenant-maker can appear to
the contrary? Lastly we say again, that the reason why
Christ gave his Disciples no express or peculiar command
concerning baptizing infants, but included them in the
general, was because the Apostles were so well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with childrens reception into the Church-priviledges,
and sealing into the same, that they could not reasonably
make any question of baptizing infants, having a general
command to baptize all Nations, infants being under the

Adde hereto, that children under the Gospel, are thus ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the seal of faith, as children were under the Law,
although they cannot actually repent or believe, which
were and are no less previous dispositions, if we speak of

answer all that you say herein by rejecting your conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
but for the prudent Readers further satisfaction,
I say, 3. <hi>Aprevious disposition</hi> necessary to the capacity
of a thing, is considerable, either as it is <hi>in</hi> or <hi>of</hi> the
subject.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A previous disposition in the subject,</hi> we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
either as a self-disposing by some intrinsecal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
faculty, or as a being extrinsecally disposed and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by some other power, to a capacity or receptibility of
something which yet it hath not, neither was capable
thereof before such a disposition: Now this in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
instance presupposeth, or speaks some change of the
mind by illumination, faith, remorse of conscience, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of leading a new life, and desire to be implanted into
Christ and the communion of Saints by baptism; and so
it is internal; or professing of that endeavour of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the mysteries of the Gospel, faith and repentance testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
before men; and so these dispositions are external,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118641:46"/>
or expressed to men whom it may concern; these are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
in persons of years coming to baptism.</p>
               <p n="2">2. there is a previous disposition of the subject without
any present change of the mind, which springeth from his
relation to some other, or some others act: So some ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles

without any present change of the childs mind; so

were to receive the seal of the Covenant, he must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily

of Gods Law and Covenant, faith, repentance, or
at least the profession thereof, and those other rites
which the Law required on that behalf. The infants
previous disposition to circumcision, was no other then
his fathers and his own priviledg, and being within Gods

is meet that he, which being in full-grown age is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into fellowship of the Covenant, from which he
had hitherto been a stranger, should first learn the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
thereof: but an infant begotten of him, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not so, which by right of inheritance, according
to the form of the promise, is even from his mothers
womb contained in the Covenant.</q> And certainly in
this respect God calleth the infants of covenanted parents,
sons and daughters born unto him,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 20. &amp; 23.

those parents to whom God made the promise to be <hi>a God
unto them and their seed after them</hi>; which promise as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerns us and our children, as it concerned <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and his. 2. If the argument be good from that place,
<hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized</hi>; faith is
first named, and then baptism: ergo, faith must precede
baptism: Why shall not the Argument from other
places be good to the contrary? as <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Except a
man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into
the Kingdom of God</hi>: Baptism is first named, and then
regeneration; therefore baptism must precede regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
So again <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 26. <hi>Washing with water,</hi> that is,
baptism is mentioned before the word, <hi>ergo,</hi> we must first
be baptized, and afterward receive the word. 3. If this
argument were good, how many men and women of age,
must by the same reason be denyed baptism? For all have
not saith; but the truth is, that to be born in the Church,
is unto, or in infants instead of profession of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
as to the outward seal, for which we contend;
and profession of faith and repentance, is to and for the
<hi>adult</hi> instead of the same, for their right to the desired seal
(so was it to <hi>Ismael,</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> whom God hated) because
they were born of covenanted parents. 4. Sure it is that
Christ in the forementioned place, speaketh of men and
women of years: For you confess that infants as such,
cannot believe; and what then must follow if your cruel
principles were true? Christ saith, <hi>But he that believeth
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118641:47"/>
not, shall be damned</hi>: If this were as you would have it, spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
concerning infants also, what should become of all
those that die in their infancy? what are they damn'd?
Here appears an inexcusable perversness of these men, who
when children are proposed to their interest in general
terms granted them, there they would exclude them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they shew a particular warrant; and baptize all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
without a baptize infants, shall not advantage them
for the seal of their admission into Christs visible Church:
But where a general rule is mentioned, from whence they
are in reason and all charitable construction to be exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
there it must include them for their disadvantage, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to damnation, without any particular warrant for
such inteterpretation. Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> observeth well, That
the Covenant-priviledges of grace,<note place="margin">—Of child. baptismal right, cap. 8. conclus. 7. pag. 143.</note> are ever to be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

unless any exception be made of persons or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges

this, you must either acknowledg that the place you cite,

seal and ministration of man can nothing profit where God
giveth not the inward Baptism by his holy Spirit; though
the inward may save without the outward, as hath been
noted: but your supposition being rightly laid concerning
an elect infant baptized, and so carried away, you must
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:118641:50"/>
grant, that God, whose election can by no means be defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or made voyd, will give and make effectuall the means
to the end, that is, salvation, whether by acquainting the
party baptized with his will declared in his word preached
to him, or by his secret work within him, if he will take
him away in infancy: in the adult, coming to the knowledg
of Gods covenant in Christ, and of his own sealing in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
it must make him more confident of his implantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into Christ, then if he knew that he never had been
baptized. What then? Must this be by vertue of baptism
by water onely, or the externall ministration thereof? No,
but by the power of Gods Spirit working on his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and accomplishing his own decrees, do we follow
your supposition, dividing preaching of the word to such
when they come to years, from the precedent seal? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such a strange invention were absolutely without Art,
without Scripture, reason or authority, I would say, as is
your argument here alledged against insant-baptism, but
that you call it <hi>Demonstrative</hi> and <hi>Unanswerable</hi>: but
consider how to overcome before you cry victory. To an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
your supposition; suppose that an infant were not
by any habituall faith so much as disposed to any actuall
belief without a new master; what could this conclude
more then that it is necessary to the actuall faith of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
come to fit years, that he be taught the doctrine of
faith, repentance, &amp;c. which we constantly affirm: what
makes this against infant-baptism? We unanimously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
and solemnly profess, that the infant, so soon as it
shal be able to learn, ought to be, and shall be taught the
mysteries of eternall life and salvation by Christ: so your
demonstration proves but a poor fallacie: you utterly
mistaking or willingly dissembling the question. We af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
not that the Word ought to be divided from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
whereof new-born infants are capable, but that
the word is to be preached to them, &amp; they are to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in all the Rudiments of Christian Religion, so soon as
they shall be able to learn: I only add hereto, what have you
said in this your so much applauded argument against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118641:50"/>
which might not as reasonably and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
have been urged against infant-circumcision? Could
they if sent into Painim-Countreys with all the terms of
your supposition, have been more disposed to an actual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
without a new Master? yet they had, and we have
right to the seal of the righteousnesse of Faith, not for
any excellency or ability to produce any good and saving
effect in our selves, but through the merits of our Saviour,
the free mercy of God, and the right of our Fathers, with
whom God made his Covenant for their persons and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.

               <p>I answer, 1. You vainly dispute <hi>è non concessis</hi>; 'tis not

and why shall man exclude them from the external Seal
of Gods Covenaut with them (as being born within the
Church) of which they have as evident (and a more easie)
capacity then children had of circumcision? God gives
Infants the incomparably greater and more excellent part,
sanctity and sealing to salvation; and shall man presume to
deny the less and subordinate part, the external Seal of
Christs visible Church, whereof Reprobates, born within
the Church, have a capacity? 4. Faith, good conscience,
repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in the elect those fruits, whose seeds
were sowen in baptism; and (as hath been said) were it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to say, we may not sow untill the fruits thereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear?
Nay, but we therefore sow in hope, that we may in

say that the answer of a good conscience towards God, is
the <hi>only baptism that saveth us</hi>; I answer, 1. It is not the
answer of a good conscience that saveth any man, though
a good conscience be an excellent signe of our salvation

be true, if understood concerning persons of years, and as
good conscience, an undoubted effect of regeneration, is
opposed to the bare seal thereof, without any inward ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of the spirit. I say if it be understood of Infants, as in

               <p>To which we answer, 1. though all be not valid in such case,
it is enough that some are: 2. Your assertion, if granted, that

against our duty of Infant-baptism? the case being much
different between stipulations of men, and the covenant
between God &amp; man, as hath been shewed, &amp; as appeared
in circumcision which was with Infants eight days old.

repent, and amend their lives to salvation by Christ, or
not, we cannot foresee, nor have we any exception to

of the Covenant of grace, even they who are not partakers

desire to be admitted into the same: Adde hereto that

circumcision into the same faith: Gods Covenant with

them as heirs and patterns designed for the Kingdome of

in the external sign: whole Families and Nations baptized,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 39.</note>
of which children are, and ever were a great part; Christs
absolute command to baptize all Nations, without any tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of exception to Infants; Infants federal and ecclesiastical
holiness by their parents, and their own right: But that I
would not be irksom to the prudent and pious Reader, to

those Gentiles, who possibly had not so much as heard of
Christ, much less of faith in him, and baptism into his
Church: it was necessary therefore that the Apostles
should first instruct them what they were to do in baptism,
and why: but when the parents were baptized and instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

(as hath been often noted) we must distinguish between
a Church to be constituted and setled,<note place="margin">Inter Ecclesiam constituendam &amp; constitutam.</note> and a constituted

Infants presented to baptism. In a Church to be constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and converted from <hi>Judaism</hi> or <hi>Paganism,</hi> those that
are of years must necessarily first be taught, and afterward
baptized; but in a constituted or setled Church, Infants are
first to be baptized, and then to be taught when they are
able to learn: no otherwise was it in circumcision which
was the former Seal of the same Covenant and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Faith, into which we are now, under the Gospel,
baptized.<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> When <hi>Abraham</hi> according to Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

can neither examine themselves, nor discern the Lords body,

it unto them until they can be instructed therein. No
such limitation can be shewed concerning Baptism; for
though Faith and Repentance be mentioned as conditions
of Baptism and Remission of sins, and Salvation to persons
of years; yet the case is far otherwise with Infants, who
though they cannot (as such) actually believe and repent, yet
we doubt not of their Remission of sins and salvation: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of the Question; which is not, Whether that teaching ought
to be divided from Baptism, which we affirm not: but the
contrary; persons of years ought first to be taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and repent, and then to be baptized: But our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion

again the question is mistaken, and therefore such disputes
are fallacious. It is true, the water without the Word can
make no Sacrament, nor give any sacramental effect; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neither young nor old may be baptized; where the
Gospel is not first preached and received: For Baptism is
a seal of the Gospel; but believing Parents have been taught,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:118641:70"/>
received the Gospel, and been sealed into Gods Covenant;
therefore they ought to present their children to Baptism,
who are joynt Covenanters with them. Again, Baptism
is administred with the words of institution by Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;
take away the Word, and what is the Water but
ordinary water? The Word is added to the element, and
makes the Sacrament—
of the Water, that it but toucheth the body, and cleanseth
the heart, but by the Word; not because it is spoken; but
because it is believed. Moreover, though God taught <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
concerning the Sacrament of Circumcision, and so he
was circumcised and all his Males, yet he circumcised <hi>Isaac</hi> at
eight days old; &amp; so long before that word of faith could be

of the same Righteousness of faith in Christ, in whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
we also are saved. Men of ripe years were first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
concerning the institution, end and use of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and then received the Seal; but Infants (as such, not
capable of instruction) first received the Seal of Faith; and
if they lived to years, then they were taught, yet the Word
and the Seal were not parted in either: So is it in Infant-Baptism now.</p>

were first and generally such persons as were first to be
instructed in the faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> and then to be baptized; it
concerned not Infants.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which immediately follows, <hi>But he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not shall be damned</hi>—manifesteth that it concerned not
Infants, who though they cannot actually believe, yet shall
not all be damned, though dying Infants.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If those words were to be presidential to all Churches
and times as a rule, what persons we are to baptize, and
what not; that is, that we ought to baptize none but such
and so qualified as are there described; then it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that you must baptize none, but those who appear
to have a justifying faith; for such there Christ speaks of,
and only such, relating to their salvation: And how few
have this? and how can you who baptize discern this? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
They must be such as can cast out Devils, speak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>studied
Languages, take up Serpents, and if they drink any
deadly thing, it shall not hurt them, such as can cure the
sick: For Christ there thus marked out Believers of those
times.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He saith not, He that believeth not shall not be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed;
for that indeed might have concerned Infants Baptism:
But he saith, <hi>He that believeth not shall be damned;</hi> which
cannot concern Infants, except you will say they have faith
(and so you must grant them a capacity of Baptism) or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that they all are damned who dye in Infancy, which is
a damnable fancy.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, We must distinguish between an interest in, and
the effects of Baptism. Many thousands born within the
Covenant, have therefore a just interest in the Covenant of

And it is here to be noted, That children of

both Testaments: See <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. <hi>John</hi> 9. 28. <hi>We are

therefore is Baptism a sign that the baptised professeth

could civil legitimacie give them any priviledge in Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,

as if it bar'd them from salvation, or any means there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the Apostle gathereth that matrimonial conjunction
between a believer and an unbeliever, is holy, because the
denomination and estimate being from the better part, their
children are within the covenant of God, by an argument

                  <p n="3">3 The Apostle discoursed not there of civil Policie, but of
conscience; and how could it satisfie any Christians consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to take an argument from the civil laws of any of the
Nations? it is notorious that among those, many things were
established by their laws, which a Christians conscience
would, and must abhor: yea, even such divorces without

                  <p n="4">4 When the Apostle saith <hi>the unbelieving husband is
sanctified in the wife;</hi> if any ask, what wife? we cannot say
in a wife as she is only civilly legitimate; for so far that
husband hath as good and evident a ground of sanctification
on his part and in himself without any accession of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
from his wife; for he must needs be as lawfully her
husband as she is his wife; we can therefore no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
rationally answer, then, a <hi>believing wife:</hi> and so on
the other side. Now seeing the Apostle puts it on a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
priviledge, which is sometimes in the man when he is a
believer, and his wife is not; and sometimes in the wife, if
she be a believer, and her husband is not so; it appears that
the foundation of comfort here intended by the Apostle, is
laid in faith, peculiar but to one of the two, and not in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial
legitimacie common and equal to both.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Faith which rendreth us acceptable to God in Christ,
purifieth us, and all estates and possessions to us: that san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth
marriage, not marriage it; that uniteth us by one
Spirit to Christ, and is therefore far more excellent then
marriage, which uniteth man and woman only in one flesh:<note place="margin">Tit. 1. 15.</note>
faith therefore gives our children a denomination and right
to the seals of the covenant as they are holy, not marriage,
which though civilly lawful, may yet be impious before God;
as where one puts away his wife for less then adultery and
marrieth another, or another man marrieth her so put
away:<note place="margin">Mat. 13. 9.</note> it is therefore the faith and Church-priviledge of
parents which thus denominateth children holy.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The Apostle could not here mean legitimacie of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
for that can neither sanctifie them, nor entitle them
to the seal of Gods covenant; neither is sanctification here
or in any other place of Scripture taken otherwise then for
separating some way from some thing prophane or impious.

taken two ways:<note place="margin">Rom, 10. 20.</note> first for such as do in heart <hi>believe unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:</hi>
this God alone can judge of; and therefore man is
not to expect his rule and direction for his ministration from
hence. Secondly, for such as profess faith or shew good and
probable signs and symptoms thereof, as those hearers of, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
did: for they received the word gladly and were baptized:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:118641:86"/>
and before that there appeared an excellent sign of faith in
them, in that the word which they heard, profited them to
compunction of heart and repentance, with desiring reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die:
but where the Word of God is not <hi>mixed with faith</hi> in
the hearers, <hi>it profiteth not,</hi> as appeareth, <hi>Heb. 4. 2.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that assumption is irrational where you say, they to
whom the Apostle spake were not believers. 2 There may be
an <hi>amphibologie</hi> in the <hi>major, believers</hi> being either such only in
profession and bearing the external seal of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

as being the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> within that covenant; although
many of them through unbelief obtained not remission of
sins and eternal life held out to them in the same:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 5. Heb. 4. 2.</note> which
made not the promise of nose effect to them who believed;
and many unbelieving parents had and have believing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
but a covenanted Parents unbelief barreth not his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
born within the Church from the external seal of the

their Parents had secretly been unbelievers and impious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
much more, seeing they so expressed and professed their

(except you will say that Gods promise was to some

indeed the whole mystical body of Christ, is the spiritual seed

covenanted Parents to be a part, who acknowledge Christ to
be their Saviour. See <hi>Eph. 5. 28.</hi> and that out of him and
his body the Church, is no salvation. So that by the way we
may note, that to exclude Christian Infants from being a
part of Christs visible Church in general, is to exclude them
from the ordinary state and way to salvation: and so to
deny them to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed, is to exclude them
from the same, and to leave them to an extraordinary means
thereto; in which some <hi>Pagans, Turks,</hi> and obstinate <hi>Jews</hi>
&amp;c. by the mercie of God, (illuminating &amp; converting them
to the faith of Christ by extraordinary means) may be saved:
and this is to suppose Infants of Christian Parents as bad as

without hope</hi> for their deceased Infants, they cannot have
sound hope without faith, nor faith without a promise or
word of faith, that is, Scripture-promise to confirm &amp; ground
it on: and that not in general, but such as properly concerns
their children, as that <hi>Gen. 17. 7. Act. 2. 39. Luk. 18. 16, 17:</hi> &amp;c.
Now to deny childrens interest herein, or that they are the
<hi>spiritual seed of Abraham,</hi> is to leave afflicted Parents hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of their childrens salvation, in that by such an an unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
&amp; impious tenet, Parents must not believ those comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

not so much as by an external seal, assure them that he is by

ever any were saved ordinarily, if at all, touching whom God
never made any promise, neither in respect of internal and
saving faith, nor so much as in respect of external right to

the same name, <hi>Col.</hi> 2 11, 12. as having the same end &amp; effect
to seal up the same grace unto faith, mortification, remission
of sins, &amp; admission into the visible Church. If it be excepted
that under the Law, there was an express command for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-circumcision
on the eighth day, but there is none for
Infant-baptism; We say, 1 Because there was an express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
under the Law never repealed in the Gospel, and the
same end and use still remain; therefore there need be none
in the Gospel more then that general opening the kingdom
of heaven to all believers, in taking away the stop of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
wall by that which is said, <hi>Baptize all Nations.</hi> None
but <hi>Israelites</hi> and their <hi>proselytes</hi> were sealed under the Law,
none but male children at eight days old; but now go baptize
all nations, without exception to nation, age, sex, or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
2 There is in all the Scripture no express prohibition,
neither can any by any sound consequence imply it.</p>
               <p>The assumption is thus confirmed, Those whom Christ sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
are members of his body, (for he is the head of the
<hi>Church, and Savior of the body, Eph.</hi> 5. 23.) But Christ saveth
Infants of believing parents; therefore Infants are members
of Christs body the Church. The <hi>major</hi> is evident; for Christ
saveth none but those who are members of his body the
Church. The <hi>minor</hi> is as evident, it being granted that any
Infants are saved, which is apparent from the covenant of
God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. and the words of Christ,<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>of such is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God,</hi> as also by this argument: Those whom Christ lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and for whom he gave himself to death<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> those he will
sanctifie and cleanse with the <hi>washing of water by the Word,
Eph.</hi> 5. 26. that they may be received into the Church, and be
made partakers of the benefits of his death: but Christ not
only loved and gave himself for persons of years, but also
for Infants; therefore he will sanctifie and cleanse Infants
with the washing of water by the Word, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2 All Infants were by <hi>Adam</hi> capable of sin and the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Gods justice punishing the same by death, sickness,
&amp;c. but Infants are not less capable of the grace and mercy
of God in Christ in respect of the expressions thereof, then
they were of his justice in <hi>Adam:</hi> Therefore Infants are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the expressions of Gods grace and mercie in Christ,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:118641:88"/>
which in the ordinary dispensation thereof is baptism. The
<hi>major</hi> is evident, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. 1 Cor. 15. 22. The <hi>minor Rom. 5. 20
where sin abounded, grace did much more abound,</hi> that is, Gods
grace doth more abundantly appear in holding out the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
remedy, then his justice inflicting the denounced punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which could not be, if Infants (visibly involved in the
condemnatorie sentence and execution thereof) should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from the ordinary and visible means of recovery and
salvation by Christ, which in them can be no other external
means but baptism the laver of regeneration: &amp; it can be no
less then a sacrilegious injury to the grace &amp; mercy of God
in Christ, to suppose that the sin of man is more powerful to
hurt then the grace of God in Christ is to heal and save.</p>
               <p n="3">3 If we ought not to baptize Infants, then there must be
some apparent let and impediment thereto, either on Gods
part prohibiting, or on the Ministers part, or in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it self, or in the incapacitie of the receiver; but there is
no apparent let or impdiment on the part (or in any) of these
therefore there is none at all. 1 There is no impediment on
Gods part, for God no where expresly or by good conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
saith, Baptize not Infants, or Baptize none but those
who do first testifie their faith and repentance. 2 There is no
impediment on the Ministers part, for he can as easily bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
Infants as persons of years. 3 There is no impediment in
respect of the Sacrament it self; for all the <hi>essentials of baptism</hi>
may be placed on children: profession of faith, repentance,
&amp;c. are conditions of baptism in persons of years, and effects
of it, which may in due time appear and follow in baptized
Infants: those therefore are not of the essence of baptism,
nor so much as universal conditions thereof; for the present
sprinkling, washing, or dipping in water, in the name of the
Father, the Son, and the H. Ghost, are the essence of baptism;
so are not faith, repentance, or newness of life: for it may be a
true baptism, where these graces do neither precede nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, though without these preceding or following, baptism
cannot be effectual to salvation; which need not seem
strange to him that considereth that <hi>Judas, Simon Magus,</hi>
and many who were, and now are truly baptized, are not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
4 Neither can the let be in the Infant, who cannot by
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:118641:89"/>
any actual hardnes of heart, impenitency, or positive unbelief,
or contempt of the ordinance of God, refuse or despise the
grace of God offered in baptism. Therefore they are to be
admitted to that whereof they are apparently &amp; undeniably
capable; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the external seal at least: which is all that man
for present can administer, or we will contend for; being most
willing to leave secret things to God, and to hope the best,
where the contrary cannot appear unto us: only add hereto,
if the issue be put upon the capacitie or incapacitie of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
with relation to any condition so much insisted on, let
any of our <hi>Antagonists</hi> shew us how or wherin Infants under
the Gospel &amp; covenant of grace in Christ, have less capacity
in respect thereof then Infants under the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> had,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note>
or that baptism is not the seal of the same righteousness of
faith in Christ, wherof circumcision for the time was the seal.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> without any expressed exception to particulars
Christs commission holds forth to <hi>all nations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19. Mark 16. 16.</note> belongs to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
as well as persons of years; for Infants are alwayes a
great part of <hi>all nations:</hi> but Christs commission holds forth
baptism to <hi>all nations</hi> without any expressed exception to
particulars: therefore baptism belongs to Infants (of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Parents) as well as to persons of years.</p>
               <p n="5">5 No man may forbid water, that is, the outward administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

question, whether the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might be sealed into the

of his H. Spirit to Infants. <hi>Ier. 1. 5. Luk. 1. 15. 1 Cor. 7. 14</hi>
therefore no man may forbid water, or the outward admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
for the baptism of Infants. The reason of the <hi>major</hi> is
that all they who are partakers of the grace both signified
&amp; exhibited in baptism, have right to the sign and sacrament
thereof, and therefore may not be barred from it; for that
were to withstand God, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 17. In reason where God
hath bestowed the grace signified, man may not deny the
signifying element; and in common right, the apparent heirs
are unjustly denied the deeds and evidences whereby that
right is assured upon them: for these are a part of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
and ought by right to follow the same: moreover
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:118641:89"/>
'tis impious to divide that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> God hath join'd, the sign from
the thing signified; as they do, who allow children, grace,
remission of sins and salvation by Christ, and yet deny them
baptism into Christ; they will yeild them the Jewels, but
not the Cabinet, the Treasure, but not the Purse.</p>
               <p n="6">6 All that are capable of the initiatorie seal of future faith,
ought to be baptized: but Infants are capable thereof,
therfore they ought to be baptized. So under the law Infants
were capable of circumcision, the seal of their future faith: &amp;
our Infants have no less capacitie thereof then they had.</p>
               <p n="7">7 All they to whom Gods covenant of Grace extends, are
to receive the initiatory seal thereof (for sealing of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
respectively, is a part thereof, <hi>Gen. 17. 10, 11. Mark.</hi>
16. 16.) but Gods covenant of Grace in Christ extends to
Infants of covenanted persons: therefore Infants ought to
receive the initiatory seal of the covenant, which is baptism.
The assumption is proved from <hi>Act. 2. 38, 39. Be baptized eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of you—for the remission of sins-for the promise is unto
you, and to your children.</hi> What promise? that upon which
the Covenant was sealed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
and when, where, or how have Infants of Christians
forfeited their right to the seal, who as such, cannot forfeit?</p>
               <p n="8">8 If circumcision and baptism were for substance, both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
seals of the same covenant of God in Christ, then
those sorts of men who were capable of the one, are capable
of the other: but circumcision and baptism were for substance
both respective seals of the same covenant of God in Christ,
therefore those sorts of men (to wit, Infants as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of years) who were capable of circumcision, are capable
of baptism. The <hi>major</hi> may appear in that God never made
any covenant of grace but only in Christ, and the same Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
was preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he believed in the same
Christ, <hi>Gal. 3. 8.</hi> add hereto, there is the same efficient pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
cause, to wit, God making a covenant with his, and
appointing the respective seals thereof: the same necessity
on the receivers part, original sin in Infants, who have
therefore as much need of regeneration and admission
into the covenant of God for remedy, as they had under
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:118641:90"/>
the law, and there is the same power and efficacie of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost still remaining; otherwise Gods grace in the New
Testament, and covenant in Christ exhibited, should be
more restrained, and of less latitude, then it was in the Old,
under that severe Schoolmaster <hi>the Law;</hi> and, which were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
to affirm, then Christs coming into the world should be
so much disvantageous to believers, as that the Gospel should
take away the seal of Gods covenant of grace from our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
which the Law allowed them under the severity therof.</p>
               <p>No part or condition of the covenant by God appointed
for remission of sins and salvation, may be withheld by man
from those who have right to the covenant and promise of
God, under severe punishment: but the initiatory Sacrament,
Baptism, now is a part or condition of the covenant by God
appointed for remission of sins and salvation, whereto Infants
have right: therefore it may not be withheld from such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants

Christ saith,<note place="margin">Psal. 47. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Go Teach all nations, baptizing them</hi>
—So far was it from diminishing, or contracting the grace
of God by the coming of Christ like rain into the Fleece,
that now he sent it to all Nations, who before gave it only
to one. And the Covenant of God made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
was testified by an external Seal, to comfort Parents
in assurance that God had care for, and a Covenant with
their children also. Now they that take this away from
children under the Gospel, make the Gospel-Covenant
much worse, as being less testified then that under the
Law. Add hereto, that the coming of Christ (which set
an end to Legal ceremonies, and appointed Baptism)
diminished not the grace of his Father in the Signs and
Dispensations thereof, making it more dark, or less testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by a Seal towards those who are within the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
of Grace; but rather encreased or communicated
it more clearly, and therein it is a better Covenant,

Gods grace and truth in Christ. Now they who deny In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants

much as in them lieth, diminish the grace of God; and
make the Covenant seem worse by Christs coming, in that
they diminish the comfortable assurance of our childrens

condemned baptism with a curse: the <hi>Novatians</hi> deferred
if to the last, because they understood not the power of this

there was no mercy for him who sinned after baptism: <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>

children Baptism, as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Donatists</hi> did of old;

necessary, that without it, none are truly baptized (as hath

any like place to be doused: more probably they were
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:118641:102"/>
baptized by washing or sprinkling with water, as they had
private accommodation thereto: nor could so many in one

baptized by dipping.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If immersion were simply necessary, and of the
<hi>Essence</hi> of Baptism, then it might not be dispensed withall
in case some sick Convert should desire it before his death
for the comfort and peace of his afflicted conscience,
which were extream uncharitableness, which belongs not
to any Ordinance of God. Therefore it cannot be sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

                  <p n="7">7 That which can neither be proved by example of
Christ, <hi>John Baptist,</hi> or any of the Apostles baptizing, nor

in baptism, can neither be proved by example, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or
any precept of Christ concerning the same: therefore dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and indeed were there to be found in Scripture any
example hereof, without a precept to lay the same univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
upon the Ordinance, it were not binding, as hath been
proved from Christs administring the communion with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened
bread, after supper in an upper room to twelve
men only and no women. So that if that which you can
never prove, should be granted you, that <hi>John Baptist</hi> and
Christs disciples, did then and there baptize by dipping; yet
it would not follow that we ought to baptize in the like and
no other manner. In the infancie of the Church they had
not <hi>Baptisteries</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi> as we have; there was a kind of
necessitie for them as they met with occasions, to make use
of waters as they could find them in rivers or sources; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

our Antagonists pretended necessitie, if it were supposed.</p>

and the holy Scriptures are able to make men wise
to salvation. And let our Antagonists now seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what they do, when they rebaptize upon that fancie,
that washing or sprinkling with water (in the Name of
the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost) is not true baptism.</p>

Infant-baptism is void, and to be esteemed no bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they dream that those who are not dived under
water, are not baptized, and therefore they rebaptize them
who were baptized in Infancie; though that ground may
often fail them, because some have been baptized by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersion.

God once sealed to us in Baptism (for the free remission
of all our sins, through the inestimable and never dying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit

Saptism) is unchangably perpetual; and the condition of
our comfortable assurance of pardon, cannot be iteration
of our Baptism, but renewing of our repentance, and
amendment of our lives, which demonstrate our faith to
be lively. See Jer. 3. 12, 13. Ezek. 16. 60. Nor doth that
hinder which some object; Some hypocrites receive the seal,
therefore they have need to receive it again, that they may
obtain the fruits thereof, which believing they shall have;

It follows not, that they ought to be baptized again, but
that they ought to be sincere, and to repent of their hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,

<hi>character</hi> was secondary: on Gods part it ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
sure, to which after their forsaking his covenant,
into which they had been once sealed, he recalled them not
to a susception of a new, or the same seal iterated, but only
to repentance, as to humble them, so to shew that the fault
and failing of the fruits and effects thereof (which should
have appeared in their newness of life) was wholly on their
parts, not on Gods, who is unchangeable and the same for
ever. So hath he appointed it in our sins after baptism.
I further add, that those Christians which had apostated to

the most pernitious heresie of <hi>Arrians</hi> denying the deitie
