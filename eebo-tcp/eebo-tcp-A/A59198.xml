            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

SAD Newes from <hi>Black-wall.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is an old saying, that there is more knavery <unclear>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</unclear> by Sea and by <unclear>Land,</unclear> then in all the whole world besides; which is most true: but my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull Relation proceeds no further then the river of Thames, which is not more Tragicall to be read, then the spectacle was to be seene. In divulging of which, white paper and black inke doth not well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; for white and black, the one signifies joy, the other mourning. Wherefore with sable paper, and bloudy inke, doth this most dolefull story deserve to be written with, <hi>Reader,</hi> my intents at this time is to exhaust fountaines of brinish teares, from each <unclear>eye,</unclear> although composed of the most dry puny stone; for the Relation so bloudy is that in <hi>Democritus</hi> himself the Reader of it, he would forget presently his laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humor and learne how to weepe: but my <unclear>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulation</unclear> must not exceed my relation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, marke the story which shall now ensue. There was one Mr. <hi>Henry Vichole,</hi> a Bristow Marchant, who was not more famous for riches, than piety, but as God doth sometimes let tribulation fall upon the head of the righteous, so did it happen unto him Two years since did he make a voyage to <hi>Spain,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:94313:3"/>
loaded his ship very richly with Malligo-wines; which had they bin put to sale, would have returned unto him the full sum of forty thousand pounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neptune</hi> was mild and gentle, and permitted him a safe returne unto <hi>Black-vvall,</hi> which is about foure miles off from the City of <hi>London.</hi> To behold which place, I am not able to expresse the good Marchants joy. But alas, how soone was that joy metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into sorrow, how soon was his tryumph conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Funerall, hee missed <hi>Scilla</hi> to fall by <hi>Charib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> the unnaturall Seas did shew more love and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him, than a naturall man; for they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to enrich him comming home; but a man did undoe him, being come home: as J now shall truely declare.</p>
            <p>The Marchant and the Master of the ship being very merry together, for joy of the good ship, called the <hi>Bonaventure</hi> unto Black-wall: there was one <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Man</hi> a common Saylor, who required of the Marchant a But of wine; which the Marchant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as the Customers then had not received their due, denyed him; saying, that it was as then an unreasonable request. Bu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> notwithstanding, so soone as the Customers had their pay, he should have his desire. But the aforesaid <hi>Simon Man,</hi> the more the Marchant denyed, was the more greedy to have his desire: but at length he made this answer, propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the myracle of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as water was turned into wine: so will I turne your wines into water, and so murmuring to himself some discontented words<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he left the Marchants Cabinet, which was betweene 6 and 7 of the clock in the evening: and then did hee
<pb facs="tcp:94313:3"/>
take counsell with the Divell, how he might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on the Marchant for denying him his demand, the Divell which is alwayes ready to doe any thing which will cause a man to come unto wofull destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, furnished him with a bloudy mind without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to burne the ship, which after this most inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane manner he did.</p>
            <p>He descended down into the lowest roome of the ship, and did carry both powder, candle, and match when the deadest time of night was, and sleepe had locked up the casements of each mans body, he set fire to the powder, which could not blow up the ship at once, by reason that there was not enough powder, but notwithstanding, the hold vvas all in a flame, vv<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> seazed upon many, burning off their legs, others their armes, others had their eyes burnt out, others had the force of the fire so much upon them, that their very Entrals vvere burnt out. Great cry and lamentation there vvas, some cryed out for ayd to other ships, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers laboured to restinguish the fire, others againe leaped resolutely into the <hi>Thames,</hi> to avoid the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the fire, and so vvere drovvned in the vvater.</p>
            <p>The Marchant himselfe first seemed as one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, and then anone, the flames vvere so violent upon him, that thereby he after great Lamentation dyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:94313:4"/>The Master also striving to doe his best for the good of the ship, <unclear>was</unclear> catch'd hold on by the fire, and so was slaine.</p>
            <p>In all the time of this most unhappy and bloudy <hi>Catasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophe,</hi> not one ship d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d dare to venture unto their ayd, but sent their <unclear>long</unclear> Boates which were to very little purpose.</p>
            <p>The fatall Executioner of this most bloudy deed, esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away himselfe by swimming, and as yet, is not to bee heard off, b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus, gentle Reader, hast thou the true and full relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the woefull overthrow of that good Merchant Mr. <hi>Henry Vichole,</hi> men, ship, and goods.</p>
            <p>Five passingers, the pursers mate, a boy, and the bloudy murtherer escaped by swimming, but all the rest of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and common men of the ship, either by Fire or Water were consumed and slaine to the number of fifty eight soules: all which came to their ends by one malicious ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who wanting his will, forced them to dye unwillingly: <hi>I</hi> conclude thus, <hi>From pestilence and Famine, from Battell, and from sudden Death, Good Lord deliver us.</hi>
