            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

unto you remaining in this out-nook of the little world (where <hi>London</hi> newes is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what scant, and the Princes affaires very seldome known) I had no intelligence of your so honourable place of Embassie in this year of Christ 1578. untill two daies after your departure. The which bred some corsey of a Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceipt in me, by

reason of my foolish negligence that would no oftner direct my Letters to crave intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence from <hi>London.</hi> And by reason of the unkind forgetfulnes of my kindred &amp; friends remaining there, who would not vouchsafe so much courtesie in a matter so much desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by me, and of so small a trouble to them, as to direct their Letters to me thereof.
<pb facs="tcp:39823:6"/>
Wherefore sorrowing for that which is past, that I could not as the rest of my kindred, &amp; friends did, assume such enterprize upon me, and yet not only rejoycing at your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, of the wise Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, and of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly behaviour, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with your Lordship was received beyond the Seas; but also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous

These men when they were arrived at</hi> Bononia, <hi>the Pope (for that they were not of sufficient honour, and for that sufficiencie of industrie, sinceritie of mind and faith was not found in them) did so contemn them, that hee greatly laughed to see, that in place of worthy Senators, they had out of</hi> Florence <hi>sent Merchants, and those not of the best sort. And that which did most sound in derogation of their Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, for that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Customes in</hi> Bononia <hi>had found in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:39823:27"/>
their Coffers for Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize sake great store of gold thred to make and weave cloth-of-gold; the which they then brought to avoyd further charge of carriage for the same; which foolish subtilty in so grave a matter, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped about with the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of gain, was the more to be jested at, Because when they had delivered their Message, they had brought no further autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to confirm the Peace. Wherefore</hi> Clement, <hi>and</hi> Caesar <hi>also, scorning them, and stomacking the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse and unskill of the Merchants, did so upbraid
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:39823:28"/>
them, that their pertinacie seemed next unto mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and they with open shame rejected, were sent home,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus far <hi>Iovius</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in English. In which is to be seen, that the basenesse, foolishnesse, Covetousnesse, and want of experience, was the cause that these Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours were not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and their Petition rejected, but that the poor Florentines were stil oppressed with the said warre.

               <p>ALthough this matter may best by a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilian be discussed, for that the same is most plentifully known unto them, and is a thing that I cannot well intreat of, for that I have not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my selfe with <hi>Iustini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Writings, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees: yet so far-forth, as either in History, or other Authoritie, I have read, or collected any thing

that to Legates, and forraign Nations, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Senate, the Roman Consulls were not accustomed to give any answers, but only in Latin, who being admitted after the manner of the Fathers, the Senate gave them pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of that they would have; but the Greeks (by their Deputies appointed) did declare their minds, if any body required any thing, as the</hi> Atrebates, <hi>and</hi> Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces <hi>did assemble their Councells by the sound of Trumpets.

the Senate) were Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters given, by whom they did propound what was needfull, and receive the agreement, and answers of the Senate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although <hi>Molo</hi> the Rhetorician is first said to have declamed in Greek in the Senate; yet so much did <hi>Tiberius</hi> hate the Greek tongue, that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to speak (I well know not what in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate) in Greek, hee first craved pardon therefore.</p>

                  <hi>And</hi> Claudius Caesar <hi>did rase out of the Table of the Iudges, and sent away the Governuur of a Province in Greece, for that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:39823:32"/>
hee was ignorant in the Latin tongue. Further, this custome grew in force amongst the Romans, that in the month of</hi> February, <hi>stiled the Calends of</hi> March <hi>(by Consuls appointed therefore) the Senate did daily apply themselves to hear the requests of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, and complaints of their fellowes, lest they should be deceived in the end by long delay, and tedious expectation.</hi> Thus far he.</p>
               <p>In which is worthily to be noted, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans with great reason did use to give answers to Legates in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

tongue, which was the Latine, and that hee which spake in the Senate should have the Latine tongue. The which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation if it were at this day used, it would judge most allowable, that what Prince soever should by his Ambassadours request any thing of us, should use our tongue, they standing in need of us.

of the word (not known of the Ambassadour ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of our tongue) might great contention rise.

               <p>Ambassadours being dispatched to <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> did come to redeem certain prisoners, amongst the which Legates was <hi>Caius Fabritius,</hi> whose fame and name was had in great estimation amongst the Romans, being a vertuous man in peace, and a noble Souldiour in warre, but yet very poor, which <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> declared unto the King; Whereupon <hi>Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> did privately use him very courteously, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with him to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:39823:44"/>
of gold at his hands, not for any evill cause, but as he said, as a pledge of friendship, and good entertainment; the which <hi>Fabritius</hi> refusing, silence was made thereof for that time. The next day (to the end he might fear <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britius,</hi> who never before had seen an Elephant) <hi>Pirrhus</hi> commanded the great beast, as they were in talking, to be brought, and set behind a skreen, which was so done, then a sign being given, the skreen was removed, and the Elephant lifting up his nostrill, did hang it over the head of <hi>Fabritius,</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:39823:44"/>
sounding up a sharp, and terrible noyse, whereat <hi>Fabritius,</hi> by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle turning back, said to <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> neither thy gold yesterday, nor thy beast to day can move me. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at supper, when talk was had of the Greeks, and of the Philosophers, <hi>Cineas</hi> fell to naming of the Epicures, reciting what they thought of the Gods, and of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, how they placed their chiefest feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie in pleasure, how they avoyded the government of the State as trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and hurtfull to good life, and how the gods
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:39823:45"/>
were removed from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding, from anger, and from care, of, to, and over us, leading an idle life, flowing with all pleasure. To whom yet thus speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Fabritius</hi> cryed out; O God, be these Precepts pleasant to <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> and the Samnites, whilest they make warre with us. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the which <hi>Pirrhus</hi> marvelling at the mind, and gravitie of the man, did more earnestly studie, by breaking off the wars, to joyne friendship with the Romans, privately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting <hi>Fabritius</hi> (if the Peace were performed) to remain and live with

him, offering that he should enjoy the chiefest place amongst his friends, and Nobles. To whom <hi>Fabritius</hi> is said to have answered in his eare. It will not be for thy profit O King, for those that do now worship, and follow thee, if they had made tryall of me, would wish me king to thee. With which <hi>Pirrhus</hi> was no whit offended, nor took it with a Tyrannicall mind, but did declare to <hi>Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> friends, the noble disposition of the man. To whose only credit hee did commit the Captives, with this condition, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:39823:46"/>
if the Senate did deny Peace after their friends saluted, and the <hi>Saturnals</hi> celebrated to the Gods, they should be sent back to him again, who in like sort (the Festivals ended) according to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were returned to <hi>Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi> of whom as many as remained at home, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate put to execution. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. in Pirrho.</hi>

Then since

this was the Law called <hi>Ius Gentium,</hi> which was (as touching Legates) called <hi>Divinum,</hi> for that commonly they sought to maintain godly Peace. How much are those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Kings, or others, to be blamed, that have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered violence to such men, which of themselves doe nothing, but execute the commandement of their Superiours? to resist whom is punishable, as well before God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men; Disobedience being such a vice as God abhorreth, Man punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Reason misliketh, and Law condemneth.</p>

courteously used.

And because it is not reason, and Justice doth not permit that such cruell deeds should goe unrevenged, as partly is shewed in some of these examples (whereof I

other hatred hath been used, and exercised by open warrs to other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Nations, for inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done to their Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours: for it is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that they who will misuse any by wrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst right, should with like violence by Justice be rightly requited.

Prince, that would not make better choyce, than to the subject that of force must obey, or else runne into further inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of his King, whose displeasure (saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)</hi> is death. But because my intent is not in any of these matters fully to say my mind, and to utter what reasons I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to confirme any such thing depending on the shoulders of Legates, but only to warrantize my assertion with authoritie of examples; Therefore leaving all other ordinarie proofes, I will descend to my former course, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:39823:79"/>
only will with one exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or two for that I mean not to be tedious, and intend but to give your Lordship a taste, that many other examples might be vouched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) display sufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in that point, In which Ambassadours have been evilly rewarded at their return into their Countrie, as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amasis</hi> the Legate, being sent of King <hi>Apris,</hi> to those people that were revolted, afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came King of the Revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, upon the which there was another Legate called <hi>Paterbenus</hi> sent to <hi>Amasis</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:39823:79"/>
who returning without doing any good in the matter, was cruelly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of King <hi>Apris. Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum. Vol. 18. li.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the Son of <hi>Amyntas,</hi> King of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> was (of <hi>Mordonius</hi> whom <hi>Xerxes</hi> had left in <hi>Greece</hi> to subdue it) sent Ambassadour to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, to conclude a Peace between them, but he departed without brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging any thing to success, whereupon he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards forbidden to come to <hi>Athens,</hi> and so banished the Town. <hi>Herodot. li.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>In both which examples what cause was there, why
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:39823:80"/>
either <hi>Paterbenus</hi> of <hi>Apris,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians should bee so cruelly handled, doing what in them lay? for when the obstinacie of the other party with whom they must conferre, is so much, that neither reason can move, eloquence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade, gentle usage make willing, or threatnings fear to yield unto their Ambassie, what shall the poor Legates doe? and if they bring not their mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to effect, they shall be sharply punished at their return, as either faithlesse to their Masters, or partiall to the enemie.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:39823:80"/>
For, mee thinks, I hear some Sycophant flattering the Prince, and maligning the Ambassadour (either before his going for some private grudge, or after his departure, for his open honour, in that he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to his place of Legation) and yet set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own commoditie thereby doth say, that if the matter come not to effect, it is by the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the partie Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, who if hee carry not sufficient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to conclude, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer all things done on the adverse part, may send home for a larger Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:39823:81"/>
the which if hee doe not, if thereby hee might have brought it to conclusion, is to be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as a trayterous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to his Prince, and Countrie, and therefore at his return to be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The which thing if he doe (as I would not excuse it, where open, and not surmised negligence is found in the cause) I say he is worthy therefore of double revenge at his home comming, and to receive torment in place of liberalitie, reproach for credit, losse of life for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, and dis-inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in recompence of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:39823:81"/>
his deserved reward. And here since now I am fallen into the mention of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Ambassadours, it shall not be unfitting in this place to shew what persons, to the shame of them, and of their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, are registred in the everlasting Records of Trayterous Ambassadors towards their Prince and Province.</p>

               <p>AS all injuries which tend to the subversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Common-wealth are to bee punished, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not one Citie, but a Province, not a part of the body, but the whole body, not the King alone, but the subject is grieved thereby; so the same wrong (being injustice) is not only to be avoyded (by all good men) as chiefe enemy to vertue, but also they are to be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:39823:82"/>
hated, and sharply punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall dutie to the Prince, to equity, to his Countrie, to good disposition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himselfe, to vertue, to good men, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Justice, to all men in matter of trust (wherin all truth is to be used) do fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and injuriously betray their Children, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, their Friends, their King, their Countrie. And as in all men such treason is to be abhorred, so especially in Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, who are the doors, and gates of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, by which Peace, or Warre, quiet,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:39823:83"/>
or dissention, profit, or disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie are brought into the same. This vilde fault is most abhorred, and worthy to be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with death, a thing which in all ages, amongst all men, in all places, and in all matters hath been misliked, hated, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and revenged. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no greater injurie can any wayes be offered, than that hee who is in credit, with the life, with the commoditie, with the honour, with the state of his Prince, or Countrie, with the benefit of his friend, or familiar, should under the colour of assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:39823:83"/>
dutie, and friendship, overthrow such State, or person, as giveth such fidelity unto him. But what spend I many words to confirm a thing so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly known to be evil? I will not doe it, but by example set out such wicked persons, as have wrought against their own head, in such a villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous sort, as the blott thereof will never be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away, which exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (for he is happy that can beware by the harm of others) I have set down as condemning that evill fact in them, and as a warning for others to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,

which may fall into the like inconveniencie, if fear of God, discourse of reason, duty to the Prince, love to his Countrie, and fidelity to his friends and Allies, do not restrain the evill mind of mens natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination alwayes of it selfe by disposition bent to the worst, and ready to yield to his basest part.

               <p>NOtwithstanding that it often happeneth to be counted a point of wisdome to dissemble, and to utter great folly, yet in a Legate, in a matter of gravitie, in the benefit of a Countrie, in the cause of a King, to shew either folly in the tongue, rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

in the hand, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the gesture, clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishness in action, or want of good government in ordering himselfe, is not simply a fault in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, which yet is not to bee allowed, but also it stretcheth further, and ministreth occasion to condemn the Master, or Prince, for want of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that either hee had not people out of whom, or else had not in him to discern to whom he might have better committed such a waighty charge, a thing not to be imagined of the head, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Common-wealth,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:39823:93"/>
and kingdome; Wherefore as you have before on the one side wise Ambassadours, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and commended for their singular and quick wits in answering, for their worthy, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent dispatch of their Embassie in action. So on the other side you shall now see, That they who doe not advisedly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the place wherein, the person to whom, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof they are to use their speech, doe not only fall into many grosse errors, which hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, injurie their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and shame their
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:39823:93"/>
Princes; But that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so thereby become a note, and blot of Ignominie to be left behind them in their utter condemnation, and the heavy reproch of their posteritie, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by these persons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, vouched for that intent, whose children al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they might be condemned, as discended from Ambassadours, yet it is reprochfull to have the folly, and evill of their Ancestors to be spightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objected unto them. And so to the matter. The people of <hi>Florence</hi> sent an Orator or Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour to <hi>Iane</hi> Queen of

with some good care the effects of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, was the next day commanded to return to the Court to hear his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: (In the mean time having intelligence, that the Queen loved proper men, not disdaining such persons as were of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beauty) but when ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was returned to Court, there after many things spoken this way, and that way, about his Embassie unto the Queen, at length more impudent than wise, more glorious than seemly, brake with the Queen, and said, that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:39823:95"/>
he had farre more secret matters to impart unto her. Whereupon the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Queen desirous to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his Legation in all convenient order, and deeming the matters of great importance should be revealed unto her self, courteously called him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more secret place, where the fool, besides all order, and civilitie, much flattering himselfe in the excellencie of his beautie, demanded of her societie in the act of <hi>Venus.</hi> At which the wise Queen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing abashed, nor altered into any sudden passion, beholding the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

of the man, did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly smiling ask whether the Florentines had given him the same in commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on also, and telling him that he were best to have authority therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further anger willed him to depart home. <hi>Pog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius in facetiis.</hi>

(since this benefit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth thereby, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bee not worthy the reading of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and although it bring no great learning to others, yet to mee who travell my wit and hand, my studie and pen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, it bringeth advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage) I hope a good end, and conclusion of matter will follow; For as the beginning of this Treatise was in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the wise, learned, and worthy Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours; So with like end in praise of them, and their travell, I will
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:39823:101"/>
finish this simple Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise; And for that there is nothing can beautifie their person, increase their honour, augment their substance, win love of their Countrie, gain credit amongst strangers, favour of their Prince, and friendship amongst all men, than oftentimes to supply the place of so weightie, and honourable a charge; Therefore I will say somewhat of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers persons, who divers times, to divers Princes, and in divers matters have won singular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations therefore,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:39823:102"/>
committing all other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to silence, which I could speak of them, and their office; Since these Messengers of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Princes, had their first originall from the Angellicall Order of Archangells, who are made the Ambassadours of God, to great Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages in great matters, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Revelation of the successe of Kingdomes, as <hi>Gabriel</hi> was to <hi>Daniel,</hi> or of opening some rare, and strange thing, as hee was also to the Virgin of the Conception of the Saviour of our Souls,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:39823:102"/>
and Redeemer of us from our Sinnes; For this is certain, that there is no order, or government in this world, as well Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall as Temporall, but it is had from the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the Celestiall Hierarchie; Since God Created the world, and appointed the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof according to the Architype, chiefe pattern, or Ideall forme of the same, conceived in the divine mind, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the Celestiall Hierarchy.
