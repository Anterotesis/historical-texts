            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>The humble Petition of</hi> Francis Wicker, <hi>the wife of</hi> Robert Wicker,</head>
            <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat about two yeares ſince, one <hi>Hanna</hi> the wife of <hi>Ambroſe Tarrant</hi> being arraigned for poyſoning of <hi>Alice Tarrant</hi> her ſaid husbands mother, at the Aſſizes holden for the County of <hi>Surry</hi> was condemned for the ſame, and had judgement for death accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. And being in the Cart to be carryed to execution, <hi>Rich. Wright, Cornelius Cooke,</hi> and <hi>Tho. Hudſon,</hi> Juſtices of the Peace for the ſaid County, ſending a note to the Sheriffe to make ſtay of the party condemned, and thereby undertaking to ſave him harmleſſe, ſhe was thereupon ſtayed; and afterward a Reprieve was obtained to make ſtay of execution, by Mr. Sergeant <hi>Greene</hi> Judge in Commiſſion till the next Aſſizes: which being done, Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> (one of the Juſtices aforeſaid,) forthwith uſed all means for her enlargement, and for that purpoſe, gave unto <hi>Thomas Deveniſh</hi> the Keeper of the Gaole five pound; and having by theſe indirect meanes, not only reprieved her life, and obtained her liberty, but did likewiſe give her free acceſſe to his owne houſe, where they were very intimate together. That ſince ſhe hath often threatned the death of your Petitioner, ſhe being the daughter of the impoyſoned woman, and to that purpoſe lay in wait by a wood ſide neare <hi>Rigate</hi> with a piſtoll, thinking to have met with your Petitioner comming to <hi>London,</hi> and ſo to have executed her bloody purpoſe: but ſhe then by Gods mercy miſſing of her intent did afterward plot a new and ſecret miſchiefe to take your Petitioners life, and by the combination and confederacy of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> upon a pretended robbery ſworne againſt your Petitioner, ſhe was ſent to priſon there to remaine without Bayle or Mainpriſe, at which time there was divers in the Gaole dyed of the plague, they thinking your Petitioner could not have eſcaped. Nevertheleſſe by this means your Petitioners ſiſter and three children loſt their lives by comming to viſit her.</p>
            <p>And further in purſuance of this their covetous and wicked practice, Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> gave warrant and expreſſe command to <hi>Thomas White</hi> Conſtable of <hi>Headly,</hi> to bring your Petitioners father <hi>Andrew Tarrant</hi> up to <hi>London</hi> either dead or alive, and ſaid he would make him diſpoſe of his eſtate, and being brought up to Towne, was enforced to live with the ſaid <hi>Hanna</hi> and her husband, where within foureteen dayes he dyed. And further to make your Petitioner moſt miſerable, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more infamous: <hi>Thomas White</hi> Conſtable of <hi>Headly</hi> aforeſaid, was expreſly commanded by Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> to detaine your Petitioners key of her houſe, which he did accordingly, and forthwith brought it to Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> who ſuddenly after gave it to the ſaid <hi>Ambroſe Tarrant,</hi> who thereupon entered her houſe at <hi>Headly,</hi> and ſo tooke all ſhe had away, to the value of eighty pounds in goods of her owne, beſides three hundred pounds in bonds, which was left to your Petitioner by her ſaid father in lieu of her marriage portion.</p>
            <p>She therefore in this her ſad and deplorable condition, humbly prayeth that the ſentence of death may be executed upon the ſaid <hi>Hanna</hi> according to the Law (and for that there was no proſecution upon the aforeſaid accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Robbery) that reſtitution may be made for the goods ſo unjuſtly taken from your Petitioner, and that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> and other his confederates may be brought before this High and Honourable Court to anſwer the premiſes, and that your Petitioner may have ſuch further reliefe therein as to your grave Wiſdomes ſhall ſeem meet,</p>
            <closer>And ſhe as in all duty bound will daily pray for the happy ſucceſſe of this High and Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Court.</closer>
