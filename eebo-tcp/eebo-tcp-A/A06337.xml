         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

héere laid vpon thee, where to the number of 16000 of thy ableſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
are departed into the Countrey, as they haue béene lately
numbred in diuers of thy Pariſhes</p>
            <p>Beſides, the hourly ringing of dead mens knels, the digging vp of
graues, the ſhutting vp of doores, the blazing forth of Red Croſſes,
and the ſetting <hi>Lord haue mercy vpon vs.</hi> vpon the forefront of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

               </gap>e, and to ſay, what ſhall we doe to ſaue our liues.</p>
            <p>Some flies to their tender harted Parents to be ſuccored, ſome to
their brothers and ſiſters, ſome to their deareſt acquaintance, ſome to
their lands and liuings in the Country, to their faire builded houſes,
leauing their goods and all they haue here behind them in this City,
as it were in the kéeping of ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>What multitudes do we ſée dailie paſſing into all Countries and
ſhi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of this Kingdome, with their whole families, ſome to one place
ſome to another, not daring once to looke backe to this diſcomforted
Citie, both by Waggon, Coach-horſe and foot, euen as it were bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
packs vpon their backs to lodge vpon.</p>
            <p>Oh you men of much feare, why doe you thus doe? In not God as
ſtrong there as here, doth not his ſeruant death as ſoone ſtrike you in
the Country, as in the Citie: whereſoeuer you goe or fly he can find
you forth: deſcend into the depths of the earth, there hee will follow
you, if you a<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cend the cloudes he is there alſo, if to the ſea, he will bee
there likewiſe, and at his pleaſure with his pale Dart of vengeance
he will ſuddenly ſtrike you.</p>
            <p>There is no flying from God, for his hand, is both ſwift &amp; ſtrong,
and can in the twinkling of an eye if ſo he pleaſe deſtroy vs all, and
follow vs in any place whereſoeuer we ſeeke to hide our ſelues: goe
not away, but ſtay by it, ſet to your helping hands to reléeue the poore
which now are ſhut vp in the time of this gréeuous viſitation, &amp; then
no doubt but God in his mercy will ſtay his heauie wrath and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
here inflicted vpon vs.</p>
            <p>Yet man I ſée is miſtruſtfull, and dares not truſt God ſo much in
the City as in the Country, elſe would they not flye ſo faſt as they
doe, but rather ſtay here to comfort the inflicted, and ſoonerly at home
in their downe beds, then vpon hard flocks abroad.</p>
            <p>Great are the woes of many flying Citizens, that for want of
lodging, are forced to lie in the fields in haycocks, and pads of ſtraw:
ſome in Barnes, ſome in ſtables, ſome in ſhéepecots, ſome in hog-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
yea moſt in ſimple cottages, where the fearfull Country people
dare hardly come néere them, but euer kéepe vpon the winde ſide, leſt
this doubted infection ſhould blow vpon them.</p>
            <p>I haue heard of a yong man of this Citie that in this preſent ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
went to his father in the Country to bée receiued, who would
giue him no entertainment, till hee had waſht himſelfe ſtarke naked
in a pond of water, and ſo without raiment to come naked into his
houſe, where new cloathes were ready prouided for him, and the old
ones caſt quite away, this was the feare of a father to his ſonne.</p>
            <p>Others I haue knowne lodged in Barnes for a whole moneth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
before they were ſuffered to come in any houſe, (though their
neereſt kinsfolks) to proue if they were infected or not, and then with
much feare they were receiued in: all which is now our Citizens
vſage in many Countries, ſo great is the doubt of ſimple people.</p>
            <p>There ſcarcely can a Citizen paſſe the high-waies without a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate,
as the vſe of vagrants are, but muſt be either conuayed from
towne with bills and clubs, or kept out at the townes end as Gypſies
haue béene in times paſt.</p>
            <p>Oh miſery, vpon miſery, that one Engliſh man ſhould thus vſe
another and to b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſo eſtranged, that they will hardly let a Traueller
haue a péece of bread, or a cup of ſmall drinke for his money, vnleſſe
he will eate and drinke it by the high-way, and after receiuing mony
they wil waſh it in a bowle of clean water, for feare the ſiluer ſhould
haue the Infection.</p>
            <p>Many haue dyed trauelling by the way for want of ſuccour and
warmé lodging, and being dead they haue béen buried cloathes &amp; all,
without praier or Church rights belonging to Chriſtian buriall, moſt
like vnto Infidels, or as beaſts without ſoules.</p>
            <p>The vſage of the Country is ſo hard that at this preſent time that
a fathers houſe haue béen ſhut vp for giuing his ſonne but one nights
lod<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing, and not ſuffered to come abroad for a whole months ſpace,
though neuer ſo cleare from infection.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like are the terrors of the Plague, which makes the
Country-man ſhun a Londoner as from a Bazaliske or Cockatrice,
whoſe very ſight and eies ſéemeth to cary infection: ſome of them at a

then if they ſhould furniſh our Markets with the ſame, and being
come hither, ſhe is in danger of ſhuting vp at her returne backe, for
the very mony ſhe takes for her commodities is thought to bring the
Plague downe with it into the Country.</p>
            <p>Not a Carier is ſcarce ſuffered to bring vp prouiſion for the Citie,
nor beare the like downe againe, but is kept out of the Towne from
whence he came and dwelleth, and himſelfe and his cattle compelled

either yong or old, though their owne ſons, ſiſters, brothers or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſuch are the ſorrowes of theſe times, God amend them when
his good will and pleaſure is.</p>
            <p>It is reported that in <hi>Greenwich</hi> a Noblemans footman comming
by very ſicke, died in a Barne, for which the owner thereof, had both
his Barne, and his houſe ſhut vp for a whole month after, and none of
his houſhold ſuffered to come abroad, which is a more cruelty &amp; ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
then is here now in <hi>London,</hi> where the hand of God now hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily
ſtriketh.</p>
            <p>For here the care of our Magiſtrats is ſuch, that ſéeing the diſtreſſe
of the poore growing great by reaſon of rich mens leauing the Citie,
that ſhould ſupply them with reliefe, and the deadneſſe of the time,
when poore men would worke if they had it, and hauing wrought
they cannot get money when they haue earn'd it, all this conſidered
the care of our King hath beene graciouſly caſt vpon vs, in comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the poore, and ſuch as be ſhut vp to bée mercifully lookt vnto, and
moſt fauourably comforted by our Magiſtrats.</p>
            <p>The prouidence of the Lord Maior is greatly to be commended in
requeſting the Companies of the City to extend their beneuolence to
the poore &amp; infected houſes, by whoſe appointment the ſame is weekly
moſt charitably giuen: likewiſe his care deſerueth the like commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
in perſwading the people of ability to giue their weekely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefes
to the poore that are not able to helpe themſelues: alſo the zeale
of our Preachers, that morning euening, and at all times humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth
God to be mercifull to this diſtreſſed City now in the hand of
God, euen ready to be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude, it is not your flying from the City, the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
your houſes, almoſt empty in euery ſtreet, your going into freſh
ayres &amp; pleaſant fields, nor your abiding in Country houſes can keep
you from this terrible ſtroke of death, for you there are viſited as wel
as here, and dye as ſuddenly in the Country, as we in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many could I name at this preſent time, that no ſooner ſetled in
the Country, as they thinke in ſafety, but haue dyed preſently, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is prayer and true contrition of ſins that muſt allay Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie

can find you euery where he goes before you, he followes after, hee
beares you company, he ſpares none, neither Prince nor Peaſant,
