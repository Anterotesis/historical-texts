            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Take the best and leaue the worst, and you shall reape in fewe lines the trauels of my olde yeares. Reade me this shorte aduice, whiche here I giue you and with that retched me a small Booke of his owne hand writing, the copie whereof, I sende you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. All this some will thinke needelesse, as things not according to our vsuall aduises. I so confesse, but bycause I meane to leaue the occurrents dayly looked for, as newes, and to write to you of a case happened of late here, whiche tho it be of no great importance, beyng the action of meane and pryuate persons, yet twoo causes moues mée thereto, whiche are these: The first for that men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly heare matters of those, with whome familiaritie and acquayntance hath bene: Nexte, bycause I haue hearde it often spoken, that it is euill to belye the Deuill, and that I see and heare suche vntrueths spredde abroade, and also I muste needes say, of some, who know their woordes are wrongfully wrested, to the great preiudice of the credite of Master <hi>Arthur Hall,</hi> whose companie at <hi>Padoa,</hi> the yeere 1568 you once were gladde of, and thought it a contented meeting, whiche happened in that towne betweene you two, I in companie, at <hi>Antenors</hi> tombe, where firste you had sight one of an other, is the seconde occasion, that I write of this matter, at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente vnto you. First assure your selfe, that what I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto you, is most directly tolde, without leanyng ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the one side or to the other, for I haue taken great obseruation in my collections, tho some perhappe will thinke, the matter deserues no suche trauayle. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the man vnto you, I thinke I neede not, your knowledge of him in <hi>Italie,</hi> can sufficiently iudge what
<pb facs="tcp:19577:4"/>
he was: then you may remembre, God hath done his parte on him, (as wee say in English) his capacitie, hys sensible tongue at will to vtter his mynde, no wante of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacitie, of sufficient courage, well disposed to liberalitie, louyng and sure to his friende, secrete where he is trusted, and I haue founde hym to haue greate care of his worde, not wholly vnlearned, with a smacke of the knowledge of diuerse tongues: the inclination of the good partes whiche do budde in hym, I may not omitte, and so lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise not forget the taches of his mother <hi>Eue,</hi> which I find in him, whiche are these: Ouerweenyng of himselfe, whiche brings many infirmities to the persone whiche is infected with that canker, furious when he is contraried<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without pacience to take tyme to iudge or doubte the daunger of the sequele, as your selfe is witnesse of his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> in the way betweene that and <hi>Bollonia,</hi> and at <hi>Bollonia</hi> it selfe, the yeere aboue named, so implacable if he conceyue an iniurie, as <hi>Sylla</hi> will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be pleased with <hi>Marius,</hi> than he with his equals, in a maner for offences growne of tryfles. But herein I haue tolde hym my opinion, whiche is, that sithe he will leane so muche to his owne inclination, that God will sende a shrewde Cowe shorte hornes, whiche hetherto he hath done to hym. Also spending more tyme in sportes, and following the same, than is any way commendable, and the lesse, bycause, I warrant you, <hi>Non friget ludus,</hi> for it is, <hi>

<pb facs="tcp:19577:5"/>
was disposed to this needelesse, for the causes before reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as I haue partly sayd before. Some wise me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle, if this come to their handes, that I spende my time, to wryte to you so long a treatise of so small a matter, as of the vnkindnesse or quarel of two so meane Gentlemen, &amp; therefore thinke I haue litle to do, or lesse witte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I haue meruayled oft what the wryters meant, to put to our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings the <hi>Rounde table</hi> knights, <hi>Beuis of Hampton,</hi> the <hi>Knight of the Swanne,</hi> the foure sonnes of <hi>Amon, Amadis, Orlando furioso, Espandion il Caualleire del sole, Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orson</hi> the Greekes, <hi>Olgarden</hi> the Dane, &amp; a thousand more such tryfling Fables, yet do I see many men of iudgement read them, some for the tongue, and some for the matter, reape benefite of both: likewise I may not so wholly condemne this my trauell, wherein onely truth is reported, &amp; (<hi>Durus est sermo,</hi> some will thinke) assuredly no falsifying of any matter of substance, neither is my conscience <hi>in minimis,</hi> but as casually men may fault: but that a man may profite himselfe in one of the two partes, that is, for the matter, whiche if he well consider, he shall finde more than perhap is looked for in so simple a Title: there is not so euill a floure but the Bee may gather hony of it.

Here <hi>Etna</hi> smoked, daggers were a drawing, one rose from his place, the other walked vp and downe, they woulde haue gone together, but as god would they went not, the goodman lamented the case, for the slaunder, that a quarel should be in his house, the rest of the company wished quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and for my parte, I found the parties themselues rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably wel disposed to friendshippe. The matter was ended for this fitte, with commemoration, how well one loued an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as many times of euil beginnings comes worsse ends: so now againe on the other side, honest and friendly dealings wel ment, settes the Towe on fire, for in Februarye follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Master Rich.

from the meanest, into credite at the courte with the greatest. <hi>Hal,</hi> toke his friendship in good parte, as he had good cause, &amp; craued withal to shewe, whom he mistrusted, who as one not making tales on his fingers endes, named <hi>Melchisedech Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,</hi> as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be doubted off.

but be you wyth indifferent eares iudge, what vnkinde dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this is. As for the first part, wherein he charges mee to be a knaue, for reporting him vntruly to maister Drake, and then denying the same: I haue witnesse enough how Drake himselfe did in al pointes discharge me to his face, of all sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster dealings therein. For that I am a foole, for matters paste in Parliament, I meane no disputations, you haue hearde enough thereof.

Not finding Master Farmer, he went into Wormes, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous either to méete with him or <hi>M. Mallerye,</hi> the one for small good will, the other for friendship.

the weste dore, and so did a pretie while after him into the Churchyarde M. Townesende, and M Woodhouse, who both entred a bookesellers shoppe, to looke on Bookes. M. <hi>Mallerie</hi> with his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after him, went out at the same dore.

Also after Smalley came one Iames Chamber, a seruaunt of M. <hi>Hals,</hi> who likewise drew his sworde, and his Maister charging hym therewith, he did proteste he did it to saue M. <hi>Mallerie</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more hurte, and to part the busines.

withall he told M. Scotte much of M. <hi>Malleries</hi> dealings to him warde, with offer to proue them by men of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and credite, so that M. Scotte seemed satisfied, &amp; very friendly aduised M. <hi>Hal</hi> to take heede to himself, whom he greatly thanked for his good warning, tho he answered he mistrusted no harme. The first of Dece<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber M. <hi>Mallerie</hi> for his hurt, had the aduise of M. <hi>Silua</hi> a <hi>Piemontois,</hi> a practiser in Physicke &amp; Surgerie, to whom he vttered such tho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dering spéeches against M. <hi>Hal,</hi> &amp; such heauie threates, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> M. <hi>Silua</hi> mistrusted some great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequent would folow, &amp; being very often w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the L.

The iij. of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember M. <hi>Hal</hi> late in the euenyng being at M.

The next day after M.

of whose death so many determinations were giuen out, yet surely I found M. <hi>Hal</hi> made vertue of necessitie, what soeuer he thought, he shewed he bare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mater light.</p>
            <p>The xviij. of December the Courte being at Hampton, maister <hi>Hal</hi> supt at maister Comptrollers, Sir Iames Croftes, then and now holding the office, where was my L.

After supper the Comptroller and the Lordes going to the presence, M. Corwallis in the court where the Conduyte standes, called M. <hi>Hal,</hi> and desired to speake with him. I remember the time well, for I walked by, attending M. <hi>Hal</hi> with whome I had then somewhat to do: M. Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis tolde him how <hi>Frauncis Mallerie</hi> a brother of M. <hi>Malleries,</hi> had bene at the Court, and there with open mouth so exclamed of the misusing of his brother, as M. Cornwallis himselfe seemed to mislike M. <hi>Hal</hi> for some wantes layed to him, as that he durst not go into the fielde with <hi>Mallerie</hi> his contrarie, how he set his men to hurt him, and durst not do it him selfe, how shamefully he was ouermatched and striken behinde: and this did not onely M. Cornwallis conceiue against M. <hi>Hal,</hi> but many of the best stoode now in suspe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (by this meanes) of theyr iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, of whom heretofore they neuer made doubt. M. <hi>Hal</hi> openeth the matter to M.

The next day after, Sir Ierome Bowes hearing al places ring how M. <hi>Hal</hi> should die the death, gaue him warning care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to looke to himselfe. The xxviij. day M. Iohn Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton gaue M. <hi>Hal</hi> notice that <hi>Francis Mallerie</hi> and his brother had it in talke, with secrete fire in his lodging to be reuenged on him. The xxiij. of the same moneth M. <hi>Hal</hi> went out of London, and safely came to Grantham to his house. The xxij. of Ianuarie he returned to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,

The iudges appoynted that a warrant shoulde be made out, for the attaching of Smalley, it retornable xv. dayes after, during whiche time if he coulde not be mette with, Huyt should haue out execution against the suerties, who were as you haue heard M.

were not indifferent, neither agreed on by him, and being demaunded who they were, he tooke such excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to: he named Sir William Winter, M. Wilson, M. Popham, M.

M.

But for asmuch as in priuate talke betwene them, he was so much agaynst the dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the prysoner, he woulde not haue admitted him a iudge in the cause. Well the matter was grieuouslye taken, and thereof complaynte (some sayde) they woulde make to the house: by the aduise of Sir Henry Kneuet, and M.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Malleries</hi> saw that <hi>Hal</hi> was entreated, they sued also to be at libertie, and that they should leaue all things as they found them, the <hi>Malleries</hi> pleased as I think, tho they made face otherwise, <hi>Hal</hi> almost mad for anger, diuers of the Committees disquieted, some to the Parliament, others to theyr owne busines departed.

Alforde and others directly impugned Wilson &amp; Snagges allegacions: it was ordered, that <hi>Hal, Mallerie</hi> with his Councell, &amp; Smalley the next day in the afternone should come to the house: as it was appointed, the parties appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Hal</hi> being within, and the others attending without, after a bill or two redde, M Snagge called on the matter, <hi>Hal</hi> desired that the house might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As the request was reasonable, so to my thinking it was not refellde, for they turned to other billes: shortly after came in M Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptroller, M. Mildmay, M.

The speaker stoode vp, saying it was very conuenient to know, whether <hi>Hall</hi> and the <hi>Malleries</hi> would stande to the awarde or no? Andrew and Fraunces were called to the barre, Andrew besought the house he might be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, yet rather then that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany should conceyue amisse of him, he and his brother condescended. <hi>Hal</hi> being also demaunded of his determination, required first to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in two poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

no further procéeding: the more to perswade: he brought foorth the dealings of considerate Princes, who hauing what is conuenient to be obtayned, be not to scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of needelesse consequences: he had no sooner done, but with the reste of the Councell Master Hatton and others of the house, hee departed to White hall to the Lordes aboute a Commitee. At whiche tyme M.

The Speaker woulde needes put a question, whether <hi>Hall</hi> shoulde auoyde the house or no, away hee muste, lette hym hereafter take heede of speakyng agaynst Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don minstrelles.

M.

M. Bell answered, the prysoner had wrong to be close kept, sith the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was not according. The xix. of the same moneth <hi>Hal</hi> sent Iames Chambers his seruaunt to the Leuetenaunt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare he maruayled his man should be so straightly impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, his answeare was, his vsage to be very good. His Master could not speake with him, but if he would write, after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tents were séene the letter should be deliuered.
<pb facs="tcp:19577:27"/>
The xxvj. he went himself to the Tower, Sir Owen Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton not being there, the prisoner could not be spoken with. The xxviij. M. <hi>Hal</hi> seekes out M. Recorder, who aduised to pay the money presently or to put in sureties for the same, for I tel you the Shreues of Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who now seeme to haue interest in the matter, bicause <hi>Malleries</hi> admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strator had no stake to sticke to if <hi>Hal</hi> had denied payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But they would not I deeme, take a Gentlemans single bonde, neither would M. Recorder but vse them to theyr best liking. The next morning comes M. Mofley to <hi>Hal</hi> &amp; he perswades the like, but more than couenaunt wil not be performed. Wherfore in the morning Squyre &amp; <hi>Hal</hi> goes to Doctor Clerke in Pater noster Rowe, where he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges a recognizaunce of 200. markes to the administrator for the payment of one hundred poundes the first of the Terme following: the same day for the good seruice the Scholemaster Kertleton had done, he was discharged his seruice, wherat Cecill Hall his masters sonne was no whit disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. M. <hi>Hal</hi> also in the afternone rides towards his Country home at Grantham, leaues the recognizaunce in his seruaunts Iames Chambers handes to be deliuered to Huyts vse, &amp; to receyue the Releases accordingly, loking for the deliuery of Smalley at the day preffred: vntill the viij. of Aprill he was posted ouer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one to another, to M. Recorder, to M. Mosley, &amp;c. And bicause <hi>Andrew Mallerie</hi> the agent of all these causes will not be founde, tho <hi>Hall</hi> haue performed the decree, yet for his pleasure his man is like to lie longer than his time by the heeles: other of the <hi>Malleries</hi> were spoken withall, who directly answered, that if the case were theirs, they would make no releases, <hi>Hals</hi> insufficiency considered, without a good suerty to performe the money. Speeches not so much to the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite of him as to the whole Parliament, whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration did inhable him for the same. Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers repayred streight to M. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptroller, declaring to him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vsage of this matter. The ix. day of April the Recorder came to M. Comptroler, who willed him to frame a letter in the names of himself,

M. Treasurer, sir Walter Mildmay, &amp; M.

M. Comptroller also he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded that the recognizance should be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to M.

Chambers sent with spéede for his Masters pleasure touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deliuery of the recognizance to the Recorder, which he gaue him war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to do, and offering the same, it would not be receiued, til the releases from the <hi>Malleries</hi> were performed: nether yet wil any certificate for thenlargement of the prisoner be had, so must M. <hi>Hal</hi> be vnkindely ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled, pay well, his man against iustice lie fast, beside being laught at by his enemies in theyr sléeues, the iudgement of that high Court of Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempned. Chambers retornes to M.

M. Comptroller allowed of his mocion, &amp; willed him to repayre to M.

When thus much was brought to M. <hi>Hal,</hi> I heard hym say: that at M.

Also in the same Folkmote, which ofte times is named the Common councel, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes of this Land did their fealty, and were sworne as here before diuers times.

Upon his complaint to the thrée estates, the Act was made for his discharge, in the end wherof an enquiry is appointed touching the digging of tinne: and the letter is thus: <hi>Be it enquired for our soueraigne Lorde the king, that whereas at the Parliament hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at Crokerentor before Thomas Denys deputye too sir Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Marney knight warden of the Steynery &amp;c.</hi> Here you haue your word otherwise applyed than we accustomably do.

In the twenty seuenth yere of <hi>Edward</hi> the thirde, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Parliament he sayes thus: <hi>Wheras good delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had with the Prelates, Dukes, Erles, Barons, and greate men of the Countries, that is to say, of euery country one, for all the counties, and of the commons of Cities and Burgesses of our Realm &amp;c.</hi> The fifte yeare of <hi>Richard</hi> the seconde there is a sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, <hi>That if any knight of the shire, Citizen of Cittie, or Burges of Borow, did not vppon sommons come to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not hauing lawful excuse, should be amerced.

In <hi>Henrie</hi> the sixts time and after, there are sundry Acts concerning the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If you consider the late enacting of these things, you shall finde later vse of our newe Parliament, than of some is thought: for I thinke Knightes and Burgesses neuer coulde nor might appeare in Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel before they were au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torised, and the maner of their apperance knowne. It may be that you and some other who shall mete with thys my procéedings in this matter, will maruell why I make so long a preamble, and that in such forme, to so shorte an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise which I sende you.

The cause of this my long recitall of one thing and other, grew of three parts. One, to shewe how happily we obtained that rare interest in the common wealth, where the monarchial gouernement strikes the stroke, therby to thanke God, wythout whom far lesse matters cannot stande. Secondly, that we should not be forgetful of the great, gracious, liberall, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fauour of the Princes of this land, who haue not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly consented freely to the confirmation of this third estate, but more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that, neuer vndoubtedly repented the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce thereof, as well may be proued, for that they neuer cauilled therin.

Thyrdly, to shew what a Iewel you haue of this most free, general, and vniuersal consultative kind of Lawmaking, therby to be careful, not only to kepe and preserue that odde grace granted to no nation, but to our selues, in such like regiments, but also in al respectes duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to put to our indeuor to be worthy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of so gret a councell, I will but remember you of a fewe lynes of <hi>Plato,</hi> who neuer knewe England, and muche lesse the

English Parliament in his booke of his common welthe he makes mention of three kindes of rule, viz. <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, Aristocratia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Democratia.</hi> Where the Prince doeth al (sayes he) lawes shal be made as best shall like him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarde to others: where nobility, and a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the greatest holde the helme, the ship wil be directed to what hauen they please. If decrées and ordinaunces lye in the multituds heads, they wil be popular. Sée you these imperfections for the want of combyning these three kinds togither, whiche done, and no lawe passe without all their consents, who shal haue cause to complaine? who is exempted out of this common wealth? who is wronged or put to the wal? who agrées not to his owne welth or wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? <hi>O Anglia ter<expan>

First is to be considered what your auctority is, and howe farre it doth reache, from whence you had the same, what trust they haue committed to you, and what they expect at your hands that elected you therto: Then by what meanes you shal best discharge, without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Prince or misliking of the nobility, that trust, to the profit of your electors. The former parts are easyer to be set downe than the latter pointes, drawen into assuréd aduices and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible precepts. But bycause (as I sayde in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) I am to write too you, who I am sure will take in good meaning my wel determined remembraunces, rather than scrupulously picke out the insufficiency therof (which I muste confesse is great) yet not wholly so fruitelesse and vnfurnished, but that you may gather some fewe Apples out of a smal Orchard. Our Parliament consisteth of three estates: First, the Prince: the second, the nobility, such as
<pb facs="tcp:19577:46"/>
are admitted by their succession, whose auncestors haue bin of the house, or the king, doth call, and the Bishoppes: all the which without speciall licence must be personally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: and if they be by any meanes absent, they giue theyr voyces to some one they best like, who is resiant. The third of the Commons, wherin is comprised the yonger sonnes of the nobility, and in a manner all the heires apparante, very few except, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It is thus furnished: there are two Knightes chosen of euery county, but in Wales where the Shires haue but one, and of euery Citty and Borrowe Corporate two Burgesses, fewe excepte, who of late time were made cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, and also the Cities and Borrowes in Wales, who follow as their counties doe. Of these knightes and Burgesses is your thirde house. Wythout the consent of these three bodies no newe inuocation hath power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue the subiectes of this lande of life laweful inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or goods. The autority therof doth stretch to them all, to take away life, inheritaunce, yea of the Crowne of this Realme, and euery mans chattels, and hath full power to make and alter lawes, and to vse the English phrase, the lawe lies in their hands: the Prince is sole of hir selfe, and enacteth nothing alone: the nobilitye and Bishoppes are vpon the pointe of eightie, and rather vnder, sometyme more or lesse, as some may be vnder age, &amp; some Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rikes voyde, who offering a lawe, doe make none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The lower or common house of Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t standeth of 442. persons, 78. Knights, and 326.

Now let vs sée by what meanes you shall discharge this trust, without the indignation of the Prince, and misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the nobility. First touching the nobility &amp; prince, <hi>Qui vadit planè vadit sanè.</hi> Take this matter in hande Uir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginlike,
<pb facs="tcp:19577:47"/>
in the simplenesse of your minde, and well mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all things. Take heede of two faces in one hoode: deale with reuerence to the prince, with duty of better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to the Lords, and with waking care with your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes. I may not deny but perchaunce some Prince may be willing to procure the passing of a law more beneficiall in particular to him selfe, than pleasaunt to those who are represented in your house. And also the nobility may do the like in their own causes: may you not duetifully repugne such demaundes? may you not argue the inconuenience is like to ensue? may you not diswade? may you not boldely yeelde your no? Yes assuredly, and incur no displeasure at al. And although you may bee frowned on by the Prince and others, yet they will knowe you well enough, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende you in secrete, gladde to win you to imploy in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, iudge you wise, honest, and one worthy to be trusted, and not a Butterfly, a sixe weekes Birde: Wheras if you follow their humors, if their turnes be serued, if you play, the hireling, they perhap wil smyle vpon you for the time, neuer trust you, but in the ende shake you off. Princes be glad of traytours of their enemies subiectes: Yet what Prince would haue any of his owne people so? or will trust the others in any action, but to serue a present turne? As <hi>Demades</hi> aunswered the <hi>Ephores</hi> very well, who mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him to commit the leading of certaine Souldiers to a traytor: you shal pardon me (quoth he) for trusting hym w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mine, who hath betrayed his owne. If you wil sooth and iuggle, you shal haue Iohn seruingmans rewarde, yea at the princes hand &amp; the nobilities. Altho possibly you haue hearde the tale of this wel shotten Iohn, yet thus it was: A gentleman not best experienced, stoode well in hys own conceyte for iudgemente (as commonly the simplest do) his chaunce was to entertayne a seruaunte wiser in deed than the maister, but too playne a dealer to profit himself, and therefore no worldely Doctor. Thys Gentleman ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his opinions conceiued, always to be infallible, wold
<pb facs="tcp:19577:48"/>
breake them with his man, not so much to conferre for his aduise, as to set out the ripenesse of his owne capacitye, who perce iuing his Maister was in a manner alwayes in a wrong Boxe, and building Castels in the ayre, or cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Hares with Tabers, coulde not sooth such vnlikely toyes, whereby he must seeke him a newe habitation: who woulde kepe such a contrarying Knaue? reporte goes this man is out of seruice, and why? forsooth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause is recited, Maister Iohn a currifauour meaning to thriue where the other coulde not, among hys Emes and kindred taken a proper nurtured hynd, sekes out this gentleman with very low cursey, gyues his wor: the time of the day, demaundes if his wor: wants a seruant, and worship and Maistership hath much adoe with him. This cleane speeched manne is entertained, the maister confers nothing wyth Iohn, but Iohn playes the Iohn, he highly commends his Maisters deuises, he prayses hys iudgements: what so he speakes be it neuer so fonde, Iohn sweres doth procede of a good wit. As <hi>Stephen</hi> the foole of Huntington was wonte so saye, time teacheth experience, far he goes that neuer returnes, and very simple he is, that dayly swalloweth flies and wil not learne to keepe hys lippes together. This gentleman began to finde that Iohn did guyle with him, whome too proue, he brought into a very fayre meadowe, and as it were out of a great study demaunded of Iohn how to most pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it he might employ y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same: Iohn musing what to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: his Maister followed, now (quoth he) can I tel how to reape greate benefit hereof, Salt is at a high price, I wil sowe the Meadowe therewith, if God sende me a good croppe, I shal be a made man. Iohn hereat clappes his handes on his thighes, Iesus, Maister (saith he) you shall drinke before mee, for I thought vppon the like matter. Here is flattering Iohn taken: by whom? by a simple man, by one who delighted in his musicke: he pluckes his Coate ouer his eares, he knaues Maister Iohn, and tournes him out of the doores like a Rascal marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. If you play Iohns

parte with Princes, whose experience and wisedome of themselues is great, and much by councel, do you thinke to auoyde Iohns rewarde? If you Iohn it with the nobility, do you deeme them children? will not nobility followe in deede the noblenesse of bloud, to abhorre and detest suche shamelesse shifting Iackeryes? yes assuredly, to your vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter infamy and ouerthrowe. But take the other course, and truth may be blamed, but it will neuer be shamed It may be loked bigge on, but it wyl not be out of countenaunce: it may bee shut out of the dore, but it wyll bee sente for in againe and set at the table with the best, when Curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maister Iohn shal be glad to take the leauing of the Pages: and hereof assuredly perswade your selfe, vnlesse your minde be so far possessed with mischiefe, too thinke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Falcons can feed of carrion, or Dolphyns delight in pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, which as by nature they do abhorre, so do Princes &amp; nobility by long succession norished and bredde in honour, reiecte and contempne all suche seruile disceyte and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable shifting.</p>

I am so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Paganisme may cast in our noses foure rare exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and we not able to afourde them one such coupple.

This frendship for such affiance &amp; trust betwene party &amp; party is rare, is commendable, is not to be found, and yet dependeth vpon particular action betwene two: it is determyned betwene them, that is, at the death or absence of either of both, and then so far as wel wishing may extend. But sée what the commons of Englande put in your handes, when you are chosen a spokesman for them.

Do not mistruste your own hability, as <hi>Thophrastus</hi> did, who taking vpon him to play the Oratour, when he came to it, coulde not vtter any one word.
