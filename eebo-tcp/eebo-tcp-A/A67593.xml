            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I have ob≈øerved your Lord≈øhips Letter of Commi≈ø≈øion, and do find ≈øeveral of my Pupils leave me for ≈øo doing.

Let the Order be, that the Chief Governours may a≈ø≈øi≈øt me in it.

               <p>To this Saying of the Archbi≈øhops, Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> replyed, No, your Grace is mi≈øtaken, for we have too many illiterate Prie≈øts among≈øt us already, who neither can pronounce the <hi>Latine,</hi> nor know what it means, no more than the Common people that hear them; but when the people hear the Liturgy in <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> they and the Prie≈øt will then under≈øtand what they pray for.</p>
               <p>Upon this Reply, <hi>George dowdall</hi> bade Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> beware of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles Cur≈øe.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> made an≈øwer, I fear no ≈øtrange Cur≈øe, ≈øo long as I have the Ble≈ø≈øing of that Church which I believe to be the true one.</p>
               <p>The Archbi≈øhop again ≈øaid, can there be a truer Church than the Church of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> the Mother Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> returned this an≈øwer, I thought we had bin all of the Church of Chri≈øt; for he calls all true believers in him his Church, and him≈øelf the Head thereof.</p>
               <p>The Archbi≈øhop replied<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and is not St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Church of Chri≈øt?</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> returned this An≈øwer, St. <hi>Peter</hi> was a Member of Chri≈øts Church, but the Church was not St. <hi>Peters,</hi> neither was St. <hi>Peter</hi> but <hi>Chri≈øe</hi> the Head thereof.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>George Dowdall</hi> the Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> ro≈øe up, and ≈øeveral of the Suftragan Bi≈øhops under his Juri≈ødiction, ≈øaving only <hi>Edward Staples</hi> then Bi≈øhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> who tarried with the re≈øt of the Clergy then a≈ø≈øembled, on the Kalends of <hi>March</hi> according to the old ≈øtile, 1551. but if we rea≈øon as from the Annunication of our Lady, which was the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> it was 1550.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> then took up the Order, and held it forth to <hi>George Browns</hi> Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who (≈øtanding up) received it, ≈øaying; this Order, good Brethren, is from our Gracious King, and from the re≈øt of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Fathers and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> who have con≈øulted herein, and

               <p>After this ≈øeveral of the meeker or mo≈øt moderate of the Bi≈øhops and Clergy of <hi>Ireland</hi> cohered with <hi>George Browne</hi> the Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> among≈øt whom <hi>Edward Staples</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> who was put out from his Bi≈øhoprick, for ≈øo doing, in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days on the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1554. <hi>John Bale,</hi> who on the ≈øecond of <hi>February</hi> 1552. was Con≈øecrated Bi≈øhop of <hi>O≈ø≈øory</hi> for his fidelity, and afterwards by Queen <hi>Mary</hi> expul≈øed.

Almighty God hath made ≈øo pure without blemi≈øh. <hi>Je≈øus came to fulfil the Law, and not to aboli≈øh the Law.</hi> But there are a new fraternity of late ≈øprung up, who call them≈øelves <hi>Je≈øuits,</hi> which will deceive many, who are much after the Scribes and Phari≈øees manner: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt the Jews they ≈øhall ≈øtrive to aboli≈øh the truth, and ≈øhall come very near to do it; for the≈øe ≈øorts will turn them≈øelves into ≈øeveral forms, with the Heathen, an Heatheni≈øt; with Athei≈øts, an Athei≈øt; with the Jews, a Jew; and with the Reformers, a Refomade, purpo≈øely to know your intenations, your minds, your hearts, and your inclintions, and thereby bring you at la≈øt to be like the fool that <hi>≈øaid in his heart there was no God.</hi> The≈øe ≈øhall ≈øpread over the whole World, ≈øhall be admitted into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Princes, and they never the wi≈øer; Charming of them, yea, making your Princes reveal their hearts, and the ≈øecrets therein unto them, and yet they not perceive it; which will happen from falling from the Law of God, by neglect of fulfilling of the Law of God, and by winking at their ≈øins; yet in the end, God to ju≈øtifie his Law, ≈øhall ≈øuddenly cut off this Society even by the hands of tho≈øe who have mo≈øt ≈øuccour'd them, and made u≈øe of them; ≈øo that at the end they ≈øhall become odious to all Nations: They ≈øhall be wor≈øe than Jews, having no re≈øting place upon the Earth, and then ≈øhall a Jew have more favour than a Je≈øuite.
