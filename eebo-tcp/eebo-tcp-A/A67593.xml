            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Prior and Dean have written to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be encouraged, and if it be not hindred before they have a Mandate from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the People will be bold, and then tugg long before his Highneſs can ſubmit them to his Graces Orders. The Country Folk here much hate your Lordſhip, and deſpitefully call you in their <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tongue the <hi>Blackſmiths Son.</hi>

                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> is by <hi>Armagh,</hi> and that Clergy, deſired to aſſiſt them, not to ſuffer his Highneſs to alter Church Rules here in <hi>Ireland:</hi> As a Friend I deſire your Lordſhip to look to your Noble Perſon; for <hi>Rome</hi> hath a great kindneſs for that Duke (for it is ſo talked here) and will reward him and his Children. <hi>Rome</hi> hath great Favours for this Nation, purpoſely to oppoſe His Highneſs; and ſo having got, ſince the Act paſſed, great Indulgences for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, therefore my hope is loſt, yet my Zeal is to do according to your Lordſhips Orders.

His Highneſs Vice Roy of this Nation is of little or no power with the old Natives, therefore your Lordſhip will expect of me no more than I am able: This Nation is poor in Wealth, and not ſufficient now at preſent to oppoſe them: It is obſerved, that ever ſince His Highneſs's Anceſtors had this Nation in poſſeſſion, the old Natives have been craving Foreign Powers to Aſſiſt and Rule them; and now both <hi>Engliſh</hi> Race and <hi>Iriſh</hi> begin to oppoſe your Lordſhips Orders, and do lay aſide their National old Quarrels, which I fear will, if any thing will, cauſe a Foreigner to invade this Nation: I pray God I may be a falſe Prophet, yet your good Lordſhip muſt pardon my opinion, for I write it to your Lordſhip as a Warning.</p>

               <p>Sir <hi>Anthony St. Leger</hi> having ſpoken to this effect, <hi>George dowdall,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>George Cromer</hi> in the Primacy of <hi>Armagh,</hi> ſtood up, who (through his <hi>Romiſh</hi> Zeal to the Pope) laboured with all his power and force to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Liturgyof the Church, that it might not be read or ſung in the Church; ſaying, then ſhall every illiterate fellow read Service (or Maſs) as he in thoſe days termed the word Service.</p>
               <p>To this Saying of the Archbiſhops, Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> replyed, No, your Grace is miſtaken, for we have too many illiterate Prieſts amongſt us already, who neither can pronounce the <hi>Latine,</hi> nor know what it means, no more than the Common people that hear them; but when the people hear the Liturgy in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they and the Prieſt will then underſtand what they pray for.</p>
               <p>Upon this Reply, <hi>George dowdall</hi> bade Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> beware of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles Curſe.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> made anſwer, I fear no ſtrange Curſe, ſo long as I have the Bleſſing of that Church which I believe to be the true one.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop again ſaid, can there be a truer Church than the Church of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> the Mother Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> returned this anſwer, I thought we had bin all of the Church of Chriſt; for he calls all true believers in him his Church, and himſelf the Head thereof.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop replied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is not St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Church of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> returned this Anſwer, St. <hi>Peter</hi> was a Member of Chriſts Church, but the Church was not St. <hi>Peters,</hi> neither was St. <hi>Peter</hi> but <hi>Chriſe</hi> the Head thereof.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>George Dowdall</hi> the Primate of <hi>Armagh</hi> roſe up, and ſeveral of the Suftragan Biſhops under his Juriſdiction, ſaving only <hi>Edward Staples</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> who tarried with the reſt of the Clergy then aſſembled, on the Kalends of <hi>March</hi> according to the old ſtile, 1551. but if we reaſon as from the Annunication of our Lady, which was the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> it was 1550.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> then took up the Order, and held it forth to <hi>George Browns</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who (ſtanding up) received it, ſaying; this Order, good Brethren, is from our Gracious King, and from the reſt of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Fathers and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> who have conſulted herein, and

                           <p>THe wonders of the Lord God have for a long time been hid from the children of Men, which hath hapned by <hi>Rome</hi>'s not permitting the common people to read the holy Scriptures; for to prevent you, that you might not know the comfort of your Salvation, but to depend wholly on the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they will not permit it to be in any tongue but in the Latin, ſaying that Latin was the <hi>Roman</hi> Tongue: But the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God inſpired the holy Apoſtles with the knowledge of all Languages, that they might teach all people in their proper Tongue and Language, which cauſed our wiſe King <hi>Henry,</hi> before his death, to have the holy Scriptures tranſcribed into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, for the good of his Subjects, that their <hi>eyes may be opened to behold the wondrous things out of the Law of the Lord.</hi> But there are falſe Prophets at this inſtant, and will be to the end of the World, that ſhall deceive you with falſe Doctrines, expounding this Text, or that, purpoſely to confound your underſtandings, and to lead you captive into a wilderneſs of Confuſion, whom you ſhall take as your friends, but they ſhall be your greateſt enemies, ſpeaking againſt the Tenents of <hi>Rome</hi> and yet be ſet on by <hi>Rome;</hi> theſe ſhall be a rigid people full of fury and envy.</p>
                           <p>But to prevent theſe things that are to come, obſerve Chriſt and his Apoſtles; <hi>Let all things be done with with decency, with mildneſs, and in order,</hi> ſervently crying

unto God, <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous things out of thy Law,</hi> then ſhould you rightly keep the Law and the Prophets. It is the part of a Prince to be wiſe, for he hath a great Charge to Rule and govern a Nation: Your late King foreſeeing <hi>Rome</hi> and her Pope's intentions, how that he intended to inſlave his Subjects, and to keep them in the ſtate of ignorance, conſulted with the Learned of his Realm, knowing that Youth might quickly be wrought on, therefore he prepared before his death a wiſe and Learned ſort of Counſellors for his Sons Overſeers, not truſting to one or two, but to ſeveral, that he might the better Rule his people, whoſe eyes the Lord God Almighty hath opened betimes, to behold his <hi>wondrous works.</hi>

                           <p>Though the words of my Text be plainly thus <hi>(Open thou mine eyes)</hi> the meaneſt of you that hear me have eyes, but the true meaning of the words is, Endue us with underſtanding; for a Fool hath eyes, and ſees men, women, beaſts, birds, and other things, but yet wants underſtanding: So when we ſay, <hi>Open thou our eyes,</hi> we deſire the Lord God to inſtruct and teach us the knowledge of his Laws.</p>
                           <p>When you were lately led in blindneſs, your eyes beheld the Images that then ſtood in ſeveral of the Monaſteries and Churches until they were removed; yet all this while were your underſtandings blinded, becauſe ye believed in them, and placed your truſt in them.</p>
                           <p>Suppoſe an Artiſt or Workman make an Image either of Man or Woman, and at laſt a Clergy man of <hi>Rome</hi> give it ſuch a name, calling it St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or St. <hi>Mary,</hi> or St. <hi>Anne;</hi> muſt not that man, though he behold his own handy work, and knows in his heart that it was his own work, blind, and void of

                           <p>The Workman carved the Eyes, but theſe Eyes ſee not; he likewiſe carved the Ears, but they hear not; the Noſe, and it ſmells not; the Mouth, and it neither breaths nor ſpeaks; the Hands, they feel not; the Feet, but they ſtand ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                           <p>How therefore can your prayers be acceptable unto this Image, that ſees you not approaching towards it, that hears you not when you pray to it, that ſmells not the ſweet ſmells, be they of <hi>Myrrhe</hi> or <hi>Frankincenſe</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before it?

                           <p>Therefore of late new Artificers, by ſprings have made artificial ones, which for a certain time ſhall move, and ye ſhall believe it to be real and certain: But beware good people, for they be but lying wonders, purpoſely that ye may break the Law of God. And thus hath the Devil deviſed a lying wonder, that ye may be deluded to break the Law of the Lord, which is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make unto thy ſelf any Graven Image.</hi> O Lord, <hi>open thou our Eyes, our Ears, and our Underſtanding, that we may behold the wondrous things that are in thy Law.

Now, to arm you all good Chriſtians againſt theſe things that are to come, leſt ye be led into temptation; Cry unto the Lord your God, and heartily pray that he would be ſo merciful unto you as to <hi>open the eyes of your underſtanding, that you may behold the wonders and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs that is in his Law.</hi> Which God of his mercy grant that you may all do.</p>
