            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>BEfore I deſcend to a Particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the <hi>Riſe, Progreſs,</hi> and
Advanta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of this <hi>Propoſal,</hi> I
think it ſeaſonable (eſpecially in this Selfiſh
Projecting Age) to Premiſe,</p>
            <p>That as Dr. <hi>Aſſheton</hi> did not Project
this <hi>Propoſal</hi> for his own Private Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
but doth ſincerely deſign a Publick
Good: In like manner, the Worthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the <hi>Mercers</hi> Company have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
to Manage this <hi>Propoſal,</hi> not from
any Proſpect of Advantage to their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Perſons, but only out of a Generous
Deſign to make the Company more capable
to anſwer the End and Reaſon of their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Which is, <hi>To Eſtabliſh and Manage
Publick Charities:</hi> And thereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
their Capacity of Doing Good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:32559:3"/>
And having often conſidered the Thing,
I preſume to Declare,</p>
            <p>That the Company of <hi>Mercers,</hi> by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
and Managing this <hi>Propoſal,</hi> will
do a greater and more Publick Good to the
whole Nation, than they could pretend to do
by founding an Hoſpital for Widows in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
County of the Kingdom. And my Reaſon
is this; Becauſe it is a much nobler Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ſo to ſupport any Perſon, as to prevent
him from being Poor, than it is to Relieve
the ſame Perſon when he is actually Poor.</p>

            <head>AN
ACCOUNT
OF
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Aſſheton's
PROPOSAL, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>TO Relieve poor <hi>Widows</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi>
is a truly Charitable Work. But to
find out ſome <hi>Expedient,</hi> whereby
the Poverty of ſuch Perſons may for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be prevented, is a more deſirable Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
            <p>In order to which good Deſign, the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
of ſuch Poverty muſt firſt be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and how it comes to paſs, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licts
of ſome Churchmen are expoſed to ſo
much Want. Which being diſtinctly known
and conſidered, we ſhall then better be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to apply the Remedy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:32559:4"/>
And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Several <hi>Church-Livings</hi> (being
Impropriate) are of ſo ſmall a value, that
the <hi>Incumbents</hi> are ſcarce able to <hi>Subſiſt,</hi> much
leſs can they expect to make Proviſion for
Poſterity.</p>
            <p>This is indeed a very ſad Truth. And
though there is a way to redreſs this Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
yet it is too big for our preſent
Thoughts. And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It muſt further be acknowledged,
That ſome <hi>Churchmen</hi> who have competent
Preferments, do not yet make over-plentiful
Proviſion for their <hi>Wives</hi> and Children. And
the cauſe ſeems to be this:</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> though otherwiſe well
Deſcended and of good Families; yet being
younger Brothers, or the Sons of ſuch, they
have ſeldom any Eſtates in <hi>Land;</hi> but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Cuſtom of our Country, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Sum of <hi>Money,</hi> or ſome yearly Annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for their Lives: The Effects of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
uſually expended in a Chargeable Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
when the neceſſity of their Affairs
doth incline them to Marry, they cannot
expect conſiderable Portions with their <hi>Wives,</hi>
becauſe for want of <hi>real Eſtates,</hi> they are not
in a Capacity to ſettle <hi>Joyntures</hi> upon them.
Hence it too often comes to paſs, That a
free and generous Way of living, a ſcanted
Portion, and a fruitful Wife (who brings a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:32559:4"/>
Charge without a Competency to maintain
it) do ſo entangle his Affairs, that our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<hi>Churchman</hi> is not only diſturbed in his
Thoughts, diverted from his <hi>Studies</hi> with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing
Cares, but alſo is ſo clogged with
the Neceſſities of a <hi>Family</hi> and other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations,
that his Widow is many times
left in a very mean, if not indigent Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>If therefore ſuch an Expedient can be
found, whereby <hi>Clergymen</hi> may, upon eaſy
Terms, ſettle competent <hi>Joyntures</hi> upon their
<hi>Wives;</hi> if, for inſtance, they may be enabled
to ſecure them <hi>Thirty per Cent.</hi> to be yearly
paid during their Natural Lives; This would
not only take off the Reproach of <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi>
Joyntures, but would alſo encourage
that <hi>Hoſpitality</hi> which is an Ornament to their
Profeſſion. They may then be obliging to
their Pariſhioners, Charitable to the Poor,
and may live without Diſtraction. And
though their Death ſhould be ſudden and
unexpected, yet their Wives are competent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provided for. The very Thoughts of
which will compoſe their Spirits, raiſe their
Parts, and make the whole Courſe of their
Lives comfortable and eaſy to them.</p>
            <p>And not only <hi>Churchmen,</hi> but alſo all other
Orders of Men may receive the Benefit of
this Propoſal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:32559:5"/>
There are ſeveral <hi>Phyſicians, Lawyers, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
Traders,</hi> &amp;c. who, during their own
Lives, are either men of competent Eſtates,
or have the Credit to be thought ſo: and
conſequently their Wives are ſuitably main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
But at their Deaths, <hi>their</hi> Wives (as
well as thoſe of the <hi>Clergy</hi>) are ſometimes
left in a mean, if not indigent Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>For as a <hi>Churchman</hi>'s Preferments are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for his Life; ſo neither can a <hi>Phyſitian</hi>
Practice, nor a <hi>Lawyer</hi> Plead in the other
World. I have therefore ſometimes won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
why the Clergy ſhould be upbraided
with <hi>Steeple-houſe</hi> Joyntures: Since the Wives
of other Profeſſions are in this reſpect as
liable to be expoſed as the Clergy.</p>
            <p>For as the Clergy (who are of a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Diſpoſition) do too often Live above
their preſent preferments; ſo <hi>Phyſitians</hi> and
<hi>Lawyers</hi> do ſometimes yearly expend to the
utmoſt of their Practice. In ſuch Caſes
(which too often happen) it muſt needs
be acknowledg'd a great Advantage to ſuch
Perſons, to have 30, or 60, or 90 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi>
or more, Setled upon their Wives, by way of
Joynture or Rent-charge, in caſe they ſurvive
them.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Propoſal leſs uſeful to <hi>Traders,</hi>
than to Men of Profeſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:32559:5"/>
For though Trade is a Gainful, yet it is
an hazardous and uncertain way of Living;
Wherein the moſt Sober, Sagacious, and
Induſtrious Perſon may without his own
fault, be ſunk and ruined by the miſcarriage
of others.</p>
            <p>The Falſeneſs of a Partner, or Treachery
of a Correſpondent, with many other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
may blaſt him in a moment.</p>
            <p>And though he may make ſome tolerable
Shift to Trade on (as we phraſe it) and
may keep his Shop open, even during his
Life; yet ſince he lives only by his Credit,
it hence unavoidably follows at his Death,
that his Wife (who was ignorant of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues)
inſtead of her <hi>Thirds</hi> (the only
Joynture ſetled for a 1000, or 1500 <hi>l.</hi>) is
ſadly entertained with the ſurprizing News,
<hi>That all is ſeized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now had this Perſon immediately after
his Marriage, when his Portion was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
or at any other time when he flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
in Money, had he, I ſay, then Paid
in <hi>Three</hi> or but <hi>Two</hi> Hundred Pounds to the
<hi>Mercers</hi> Company; what a ſeaſonable Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
would the Effects of it have been, to
his now poor diſconſolate diſtreſſed Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow?</p>
            <p>And it muſt not be omitted, that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
as now managed and improved, is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32559:6"/>
highly <hi>uſeful</hi> to <hi>Country-Gentlemen,</hi> and other
<hi>Landed</hi> Men; by enabling them to Settle Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
without clogging their Lands. As will
plainly appear in the following Inſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. B.</hi> poſſeſs'd of an Eſtate in Land of
300 <hi>l. per. Ann.</hi> propoſeth Marriage to <hi>C. D.</hi>
whoſe Portion is 3000 <hi>l.</hi> For which Portion,
according to the Cuſtom of <hi>England,</hi> ſhe
expects a Jointure of 300 <hi>l. per. Ann.</hi> Which
being the whole of <hi>A. B.</hi> his Eſtate (and
which perhaps, is not only charged with the
Payment of Debts, but alſo Portions for
younger Children) cannot conveniently be
All Settled as a Jointure, without the ruin
of the Family in the next Generation, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſhould <hi>C. D.</hi> marry to a Second Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. B.</hi> is much perplext how to behave
himſelf in this Caſe. On the one hand he is
very uneaſy to part with ſo conſiderable a
Fortune. On the other hand, he thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
obliged to conſult his Family; and muſt
not be ſo imprudent, as out of Kindneſs to
a Wife to ruin Poſterity.</p>
            <p>Now with what eaſe are all Difficulties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
by this Propoſal? For by paying 1000 <hi>l.</hi>
to the <hi>Mercers</hi> Company, his Wife is Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
in 300 <hi>l. per. Ann.</hi> He hath 2000 <hi>l.</hi> to
anſwer other Occaſions. And his Land is

cleared, to be enjoyed by his Eldeſt Son,
even during his Mother's Life.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Landed-Men,</hi> ſo likewiſe Men of
<hi>Profeſſions</hi> are hereby encouraged, to get lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Portions than otherwiſe they could expect.
As for inſtance.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Clergyman,</hi> whoſe Preferment is 200 <hi>l.
per. Ann.</hi> (or a <hi>Phyſitian</hi> or <hi>Lawyer,</hi> whoſe
Yearly Practice is of equal value) doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
a Wife with 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Portion. But hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Eſtate in Land, as we ſuppoſe, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
upon her for a Jointure, he is ſoon diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
in his Pretences. But this Propoſal
doth eaſily make the Match. For by paying
500 <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>Mercers-Hall,</hi> ſhe is Jointured in
150 <hi>l. per. Ann.</hi> and 1500 <hi>l.</hi> is left, as a
Proviſion for Children, and other Occaſions.</p>
            <p>From theſe Premiſſes it appears, That
the Advantages of this Propoſal (even to All
Orders and Profeſſions) are not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But the chief Queſtion is, <hi>How theſe
Jointures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an be ſecured?</hi> What Security ſhall
be given to the Subſcribers, That their Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
ſhall not be Defrauded, but that the
Jointures and Annuities here promiſed ſhall
be punctually paid them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:32559:7"/>
This is that which for many years did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
Dr. <hi>Aſſheton</hi>'s Thoughts.</p>
            <p>For though he was encouraged by ſeveral
knowing Judicious Perſons (whom he had
conſulted, and to whom he had communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
his Propoſal) that the Deſign was Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable;
yet where to fix it, or how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
ſuch a Fund as might ſecure the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers,
was a matter of ſome Difficulty,
not only to himſelf, but alſo to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Himſelf,</hi> He was fully convinced,
not only of the Trouble and Charge in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
ſuch a Work, but alſo of the hazard
to his Reputation if it ſhould miſcarry. For
the generality of Men are very unjuſt in
their Cenſures, and will allow nothing
to be well Deſigned, that ſhall want Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>However, he did reſolve to go on; and if
poſſible, to finiſh what he had ſo long Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Firſt</hi> Addreſs was to the <hi>Corporation</hi> of
the <hi>Clergy.</hi> Who indeed received him with
the greateſt Kindneſs and Reſpect; But
withal Declared for Reaſons not now to
be repeated, that they were not capable to
accept his Propoſal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:32559:7"/>
His next Application was to the <hi>Royal
Bank</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Where he did not doubt
of ſufficient Security for the Subſcribers. But
for ſome Reaſons, which are obvious to
Men of Buſineſs, this Royal Bank, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
is not ſo Modell'd, as to manage this
Propoſal.</p>
            <p>Though thus far diſappointed, yet
Dr. <hi>Aſſheton</hi> was not Diſcouraged. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
admoniſhed, that a <hi>City-Company</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
capable to undertake his Propoſal: And
that the <hi>Mercers</hi> was the Beſt, both for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
and Revenue, he immediately
applied himſelf to that Company. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
firſt waited upon the late <hi>Maſter, T. P.
<abbr>Eſq</abbr>
               </hi> (whoſe known Worth, and inclination
to promote Charitable Deſigns, gave him
great encouragement of Succeſs) he next at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the <hi>Wardens,</hi> and ſeveral others of the
Members.</p>
            <p>After ſome time, a General Court of the
ſaid Company was held, on <hi>Friday</hi> the 11th
of <hi>November</hi> 1698. Where Dr. <hi>Aſſheton</hi>'s
Propoſal was read to the ſaid Company.
And the Doctor being then asked, What he
had further to ſay; he Replyed to this Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<hi>viz</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:32559:8"/>
HE was very ſenſible, that Wiſe men, who
are not apt to be impoſed on, do look upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
with Caution, and at a diſtance. And
therefore he was not ſo vain as to expect, that
this Propoſal ſhould be unanimouſly received, after
one ſingle Reading, at a General Court. For the
Reaſons of ſuch an Undertaking are not always
obvious, but require ſome Thought and Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mind. He therefore humbly moved, That
a Committee might be appointed, to conſider and
examine the Reaſons of the Propoſal, together
with ſuch a Method, as ſhould be thought moſt
Expedient for the management of it.</p>
            <p>Whereupon a <hi>Committee</hi> was appointed to
conſider of the ſame, and what Security the
Company could give to the Subſcribers.</p>
            <p>The which Committee (after ſeveral
Meetings, and Diſcourſes with Dr. <hi>Aſſheton</hi>)
made their Report to another General Court
the 23<hi>d</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1698. Which Court
having read the Report of the Committee,
did ſuſpend their Reſolution of the ſame for
that time. And another General Court was
appointed to be held the 13<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi>
following, that ſo all the Members of the
ſaid Company might have time to conſider of
the ſaid Propoſal, and the Report of the
Committee thereupon; that ſo they might
the better be enabled to give their Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32559:8"/>
in the whole Affair. And at this <hi>Third</hi>
General Court, the <hi>Company</hi> did accept of the
ſaid Propoſal. And did Publiſh and Declare
their Acceptance in Manner and Form fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

                        <p>THE Reverend <hi>William Aſſheton,</hi> Doctor

the Maintenance and Relief of <hi>Widows of the

poor Condition when their Husbands dye)
imploy'd his Thoughts to conſider of a Way
for their Relief and Support; and thereupon
thought of a Propoſal, in which he includes
alſo others beſide <hi>Clergymen,</hi> viz. <hi>Phyſicians,
Lawyers, Merchants, Traders,</hi> or any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that ſhall Subſcribe the Sum of 100 <hi>l.</hi> or

ſhould be limited to 100000 <hi>l.</hi> And in caſe
the Wife dye during her Husband's Life-time,
the ſame to go to the Benefit of thoſe that did

                        <p>The ſaid Reverend Dr. <hi>Aſſheton,</hi> conſidering
where the ſaid Subſcription-Money might be
lodged ſafely, and reaſonable Security given
for the due Payment of the Widows, did
think it could not be better ſecured than in
the Hands of the Worſhipful Company of
<hi>Mercers, London;</hi> and did at a General Court
of the ſaid Company, held on <hi>Friday</hi> the 11th
of <hi>November</hi> 1698, make this Propoſal to the
ſaid Company; who thereupon appointed a
Committee to conſider of the ſame, and what
Security the Company could give; which
Committee had ſeveral Meetings thereupon;
and having had ſeveral Diſcourſes with
Dr. <hi>Aſſheton,</hi> and acquainted him what Eſtate
they had to ſettle for Security, being clear
Rents, 2888 <hi>l.</hi> 8 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d. per Ann.</hi> (beſides
the Payments by the Benefactors to be paid

would yield, when the Leaſes come
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:32559:9"/>
out, above 13500 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> clear, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid;
And the ſaid Dr. <hi>Aſſheton</hi> judging the
ſame to be reaſonable Security, the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
made their Report to a General Court
the 23d of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1698. Which Court hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
read the Report of the Committee, did

            <p>PUrſuant to this Propoſal, the Subſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Books were laid open <hi>March</hi> 1. 1698.
and Attendance was given by ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Company (appointed as Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers)
every Week, on <hi>Wedneſdays, Tueſdays,</hi>
and <hi>Fridays,</hi> between the hours of 9 and 12
in the Forenoon, and 3 and 6 in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon.
And though ſeveral <hi>Thouſand Pounds</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:32559:13"/>
were Subſcribed, yet it being obſerved, that
the Capital Stock of 100000 <hi>l.</hi> in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
would not be compleated before the 24th
of <hi>June</hi> (the time limited for Subſcriptions,)</p>
            <p>Therefore, that ſo uſeful an Undertaking
might not be laid aſide (having firſt Examined,
what might be the Reaſons why Subſcriptions
were not compleated, as at firſt was expected;
and having conceived that the Chief Reaſon
was, becauſe there was no Settlement as yet
made) at a General Court, held for the ſaid
Company, the 16<hi>th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1699. it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
as followeth.</p>
            <p>1. That the ſaid Settlement propoſed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Paper, ſhall be forthwith ſettled by able Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
in the Law, in Truſtees of undoubted Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Ability, for the Benefit of the Subſcribers,
that ſo there might never be a failure. And any
of the Perſons that have Subſcribed, may, if they
deſire it, have liberty to accompany the Members
of the Company to go with them to the Council, to
ſee the making of the ſaid Settlement.</p>
            <p>2. As ſoon as the ſaid Settlement is made, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
ſhall be made thereof; and thoſe Perſons
that have Subſcribed, are to pay in their Moneys
according to their Subſcription.</p>
            <p>3. The Company will take Subſcriptions at any
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32559:13"/>
time hereafter till ſuch time as the Sum of 100000 <hi>l.</hi>
be ſubſcribed; but will not exceed that Sum at
any one time. And in caſe of the Death of any
Perſons, whereby the Subſcriptions fall off, the
Company will admit any other Perſon or Perſons
to Subſcribe ſuch Sum or Sums as will make up
the ſaid Sum of 100000 <hi>l.</hi> but never to exceed
the ſame.</p>
            <p>4. After the ſaid Settlement ſhall be made, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Subſcriber is to pay in the Money by him Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
at the time of his Subſcription.</p>
            <p>5. The Company have thought fit alſo to enlarge
the Sums to be Subſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Married
Men of the Age of <hi>Thirty</hi> Years, or under, may
Subſcribe any Sum not exceeding 1000 <hi>l.</hi> That all
Married Men, not exceeding the Age of <hi>Forty</hi>
Years, may Subſcribe any Sum not exceeding 500 <hi>l.</hi>
And that all Married Men, not exceeding the
Age of <hi>Sixty</hi> Years, may Subſcribe any Sum, not
exceeding 300 <hi>l.</hi> And the Widows of all Perſons
Subſcribing, according to theſe Limitations, ſhall
receive the Benefit of 30 <hi>l. per Cent. per Ann.</hi>
according to the former Propoſals.</p>
            <p>6. The Company do alſo Declare, That any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
(under the Limitations before mentioned) may
Subſcribe for the Uſe and Benefit of any Perſon or
Perſons, as ſuch Subſcriber ſhall by his laſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and Teſtament direct, during the Natural Life of
his Wife, in caſe ſhe ſurvives him; Declaring in
his Subſcription, That it is ſo intended; and ſuch
Perſon or Perſons ſhall receive the Benefit of ſuch
Subſcription accordingly.</p>
            <p>7. That the Obligations to be given by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
ſhall be made ſuitable to theſe Alterations, as
well for thoſe that have already Subſcribed, as
thoſe that ſhall Subſcribe hereafter. And the Bond
to be given by the Subſcribers ſhall be only of the
Penalty of half the Sum Subſcribed by any Perſon.</p>
            <p>8. And whereas in the Company's Obligation,
the Firſt Payment to be made to any Widow or
other Perſon who ſhould be entituled to any Benefit
by virtue of any Subſcription, was, by the ſaid
Obligation in the former Propoſal, to be on the Firſt
of the Feaſt-Days therein mentioned, that ſhould
happen <hi>Six</hi> Months, or more, after the Deceaſe of
the Perſon or Perſons ſo Subſcribing; The Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have thought fit and do hereby Declare, That
ſuch Firſt Payment ſhall be made at ſuch of the
ſaid Feaſt-Days which ſhall happen <hi>Four</hi> Months,
or more, after the Deceaſe of the Perſon or Perſons
ſo Subſcribing; and the Obligation to be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>

BEſides theſe Alterations and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſeveral other Conceſſions have
been ſince made, in favour of Subſcribers.
As</p>
            <p>1. Several Perſons, who live <hi>diſtant</hi> from
<hi>London,</hi> being ſenſible of the Trouble and
Charge of long Journeys, did deſire the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Subſcribe and Pay in their Money by
Proxy. Which being Propoſed, and debated
at a Committee the 14<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> 1699, the
Reſolve of the ſaid Committee was thus.</p>
            <q>It was thought neceſſary by this Committee,
that a General Court be moved, That whereas
by the General Propoſal, All Perſons are obliged
to be preſent at the Subſcribing and Paying in of
the Money, that the Committee may have a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to take Subſcriptions by Proxy, and Certificate
of the Health of the Party, in all ſuch Caſes as
they ſhall ſee cauſe.</q>
            <p>The which Debate of the Committee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
read at a General Court, the 18<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi>
1699, and the Queſtion being put, <q>
                  <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Court would comply with the Propoſition
of the ſaid Committee, touching taking Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by Proxy;</hi> it was carried in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
But the Court Ordered and deſired
the ſaid Committee to uſe all poſſible Care
and Caution touching the ſame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Accordingly it is Ordered, That when
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32559:15"/>
any Perſon doth intend to Subſcribe by Proxy,
he ſhall <hi>Firſt</hi> make the following Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit

Theſe Teſtimonials being brought to the

            <p>2. It hath been often Objected, That the
Fifth Article, as it relates to <hi>Seamen,</hi> ought
to be explained. The words of the Article
are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. That no Perſon that goes to Sea ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Subſcribe, to have the Benefit of this
Propoſal.</p>
            <p>Now ſay the Objectors, This Article may
be great diſadvantage to ſeveral Perſons, who
are either actual Subſcribers, or intend to be
ſo. For ſuppoſe ſuch a Perſon ſhall have
ſome urgent extraordinary Occaſion to croſs
the Seas, <hi>e. g. For the Recovery of a Debt; the
making up an Account,</hi> &amp;c. muſt ſuch a Perſon
either loſe his Effects in theſe Inſtances, or
elſe muſt his Wife be deprived the Benefit of
this Propoſal?</p>
            <p>To Satisfy ſuch Perſons the Company did
take this Matter into Conſideration at a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Court, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 18. 1699. And did then
thus Declare, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>For explanation of the Fifth Article in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Propoſal, the Company do Declare; That
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32559:16"/>
they do not thereby exclude any Perſon that goes
to <hi>Holland, Ireland, France,</hi> or the Coaſts of
<hi>England,</hi> Provided they be not Seafaring Men,
who follow it as their Buſineſs or Vocation.</q>
            <p>THeſe Conceſſions being thus made, the
Company then proceeded to give Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
for the drawing up of a <hi>Deed of Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,</hi>
by the Advice of very Able and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Council. The which Deed of Settlement
was Executed by the Company and Truſtees,
at a General Court of the ſaid Company,
held on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the Fourth of <hi>October</hi> 1699.</p>
            <p>The Deed of Settlement is enrolled in his
Majeſties High Court of <hi>Chancery:</hi> And an
Authentick Copy of it, tranſcribed into a
Book and well Atteſted, will conſtantly lye

to be peruſed on <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays</hi>

Attend at <hi>Mercers-Hall,</hi> to take Subſcriptions,

            <p>
               <hi>For this Reaſon I ſhall give no farther Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

What Eſtates are Settled, and the Value of them?
Who are the Truſtees, to whom theſe Eſtates are
