            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

your Lordship, with the fruit

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which first occasioned
this Discourse, was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of a little Pamphlet,
styled <hi>Nuntius inanimatus,</hi>
commonly ascribed to a late Reverend
Bishop: wherein hee affirms that there
are certain ways to discourse with a
friend, though he were in a close Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
in a besieged City, or a hundred
miles of.</p>
            <p>Which promises, at the first perusal,
did rather raise my wonder then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
having before that time observed
nothing, that might give any satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in these particulars. And I should
have esteemed them alltogether fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
had it not beene for the credit of
their reputed author.</p>
            <p>After this, I did collect all such notes
to this purpose, as I met with in the
course of my other studies.</p>
            <p>From whence when I had received
ful satisfaction, I did for mine own fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:99548:4"/>
delight compose them into this
method.</p>
            <p>This I have now published; not for
the publique good, (which I doe not
think my poore abilities can promote)
but to gratifie my brother the Statio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>The benefits of that trade do chiefly
consist in the printing of coppies; and
the vanity of this age is more taken
with matters of curiosity, then those
of solid benefit. Such a pamphlet as
this, may be salable, when a more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
and usefull discourse is negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
            <p>I have already attained mine owne
ends, both in the delight of composing
this, and the occasion of publishing it.
And therefore neede not either feare
the censure of others, or beg their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
I could never yet discerne that
any Reader hath shewed the more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
for the Authors bespeaking it.
Farewell.</p>

of their owne natures in the

they would discover to another.
And since they are of a <hi>Homogeneous</hi>
and <hi>immateriall</hi> essence, therefore do
they heare, and know, and speake,
not with severall parts, but with
their whole substance. And though
the Apostle mentions the <hi>tongue of
Angels,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> yet that is onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

will follow, that most men should
be of a double language; which is
evidently false. Whence likewise
you may guesse, at the absurdity of
their enquiries, who have sought to
find out the primitive tongue, by
bringing up infants in such silent,
solitary places, where they might
not heare the speech of others.</p>

meanes, both for the promoting

            <p>How strange a thing this Art of
writing did seeme at its first inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we may guesse by the late di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovered
<hi>Americans,</hi> who were ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to see men converse with books,
and could scarce make themselves
beleeve that a paper should speake:
especially, when after all their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and listning to any writing (as
their custome was) they could never
perceive any words or sound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from it.</p>
            <p>There is a pretty relation to this
purpose concerning an Indian slave,<note place="margin">Hermannus. Hugo de orig. Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendi. Pras.</note>
who being sent by his Master, with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99548:11"/>
a basket of figs and a letter, did by the
way eate up a great part of his carty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
conveying the remainder unto the
person, to whom he was directed, who
when he had read the letter, and not
finding the quantity of figges answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to what was there spoken of;
he accuses the slave of eating them,
telling him what the letter said
against him. But the Indian, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this proofe) did confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
abjure the fact, cursing the
paper, as being a false and lying wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
After this, being sent againe,
with the like carriage, and a letter
expressing the just number of figges,
that were to be delivered, hee did
againe according to his former pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
devoure a great part of them
by the way; but before hee medled
with any, (to prevent all following
accusations;) he first tooke the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and hid that under a great stone,
assuring himselfe, that if it did not
see him eate the figges, it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
tell of him; but being now more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99548:11"/>
strongly accused then before, hee
confesses the fault, admiring the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitie
of the paper, and for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doe's promise his best fidelity in
every imployment.</p>
            <p>Such strange conceits, did those
wilder nations entertaine, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this excellent invention. And
doubtlesse it must needs argue a vast
ability both of wit and memory, in
that man, who did first confine all
those different sounds of voyce,
(which seeme to be almost of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
variety) within the bounds of
those few letters in the Alphabet.</p>
            <p>The first inventor of this,<note place="margin">Cice. lib. 3. de Na. Deor. Polyd. Virg. de Inventor. lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And because the Planet of
that name, was thought to observe a
more various &amp; obscure revolution
then any of the rest, therfore likewise
did they attribute unto him, such
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99548:12"/>
               <hi>secret</hi> and subtle motions, as might
make him a trusty and private mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger,
and so the fitter for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
to which for this invention
they had advanced him.</p>
            <p>There is yet another way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing,
by signes and gestures.
And thought it be not so common in
<hi>practise,</hi> as either of the other; yet in
<hi>nature,</hi> perhaps it is before them both:
since infants are able this way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
themselves, before they have the
benefit of speech.</p>
            <p>But now, because none of these
wayes in ordinary use, are either so
<hi>Secret</hi> or <hi>Swift,</hi> as some exigences
would require; Therefore many of
the Antients have busied themselves
in a further inquiry how both these
deficiencies may be remedied: as
conceiving that such a discovery
would be of excellent use, especially
for some occasions that are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to <hi>Statesmen</hi> and <hi>Souldiers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the ignorance of <hi>Secret</hi> and
<hi>Swift</hi> conveyances, hath often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99548:12"/>
fatall, not onely to the ruine
of particular persons, but also of
whole Armies and Kingdomes;
may easily appeare to any one that
is but little versed in story. And
therefore the redressing of these
may bee a subject worth our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>

it to the art of <hi>Grammar,</hi> noting it as a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99548:13"/>

this is it handled by most of those

            <p>That art, in its true latitude com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
a treaty, concerning all

            <p>Now as it will concerne a man
that deales in traficke, to understand
the severall kinds of money, and that
it may be framed of other materialls,
besides silver and gold: So likewise
do's it behove them, who professe the
knowledge of nature or reason,
rightly to apprehend the severall
waies whereby they may be expressed.</p>

From which considerations wee

devoid of suspicion; for so far
as it is liable to this, it may be said to
come short in the very Nature of
Secrecy; since what is once suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,

            <p>1. In the <hi>Matter:</hi> when the thing
we would utter is so concealed under

that it is not of obvious conceit. To
which purpose are the <hi>Metaphors,

            <p>To this likewise appertaines all

            <p>And elsewhere tis intimated, that
our Saviour did use that manner of

those proud and perverse auditors,

might unawares be brought over, to
an acknowledgement, and confession
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99548:17"/>
of the thing we would have. Thus did
<hi>Nathan,</hi> unexpectedly discover to
<hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.</note> the cruelty and injustice of
his proceedings in the case of <hi>Vriah.</hi>
Thus did another Prophet, make <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi>
condemne himselfe, for suffering
the King of <hi>Syria</hi> to escape.<note place="margin">1 King. 20. 39.</note> And by
this meanes did our Saviour in the
Parable of the Vineyard,<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 33.</note> and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
husband-man, force the unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Jewes, to a secret acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of those judgements, they had
themselves deserved.</p>
            <p>Of this nature was that argument
of an antient <hi>Orator,</hi> who when the
enemies had proposed peace, upon
this condition, that the City should
banish their teachers and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers;
He steps up and tells the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
a tale, of certaine warres betwixt
the woolves and the sheepe, and that
the woolves promised to make a
league, if the sheep would put away
their mastiffe Dogs. By this meanes
better instructing them of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and madnesse there would be in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99548:17"/>
yeelding to such a condition.</p>
            <p>The Jewish Doctors doe general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their <hi>Talmud,</hi> and all their
others writings, accustome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to a Parabolicall way of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching;
and 'tis observed that many
of those horrid fables, that are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
upon them, doe arise from a
misapprehension of them in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.<note place="margin">Schickard Examen Comm. Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin. dis. 7.</note>
Whilst others interpret
that according to the <hi>letter,</hi> which
they intended onely for the <hi>morall.</hi>
As that which one <hi>Rabby</hi> relates
concerning a Lion in the forrest of
<hi>Elay,</hi> that at the distance of foure
hundred leagues, did with his roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
shake downe the walls of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and make the women abortive.
Wherein he did not affirme the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of any such monster, but only
intimate the terriblenesse and power
of the divine Majestie. But this by
the way.</p>
            <p>By this Art, many men are able
in their ordinary discourses, so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
to convey their counsels, or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99548:18"/>
reproofes, that none shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them, but those whom they
concerne. And this way of teaching
hath a great advantage above any
other, by reason it hath much more
power in exciting the fancy and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
Plaine arguments, and
morall precepts barely proposed,
are more flat in their operation,
not so lively and perswasive, as when
they steale into a mans assent, under
the covert of a parable.</p>
            <p>To be expert in this particular is
not in every mans power; like Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
it requires such a naturall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
as cannot be taught. But so
farre as it falls under the rules and
directions of Art, it belongs to the
precepts of <hi>Oratory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the generall 'tis to be observed,
that in these cases a man must be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
carefull to make choyse of such a
subject, as may beare in it, some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
analogie and resemblance to the
chiefe businesse. And he must before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
in his thoughts, so aptly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99548:18"/>
the severall parts of the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
that they may fitly answere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

tooke occasion to imprint his secret

the Ancients, was the <hi>Lacedemoniar.
Scytale:</hi> The manner of which was
thus: there were provided two round
staves of an equall length and size:
the Magistrats alwayes retaining one
of them at home; and the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
carried abroad by the Generall,
at his going forth to warre. When
there was any secret businesse to bee
writ by it, their manner was to wrap
a narrow thong of Parchment about
one of these staves, by a serpentine
revolution, so that the edges of it
might meet close together: upon both
which edges they inscribed their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle,
whereas the Parchment being
taken off, there appeared nothing
but pieces of letters on the sides of
it, which could not be joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
into the right sence, without
the true <hi>Scytale.</hi> Thus is it briefly
and fully described by <hi>Ausonius.</hi>

'Tis certaine that some occasions
may require the exactest privacie,
And 'tis as certaine, that there may
be some wayes of secrecy, which it
were madnesse for a man to think he

            <p>There is also a secret way of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with two severall inks, both of
them alike in colour, but the one
being of that nature, that it will easily
be rubbed or washed off, and the
other not.</p>
            <p>A man may likewise write secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with a raw egge, the letters of
which, being throughly dryed, let
the whole paper bee blacked over
with inke, that it may appeare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any inscription. And when this
inke is also well dryed, if you doe
afterwards gently scrape it over with
a knife, it will fall off from those
places, where before the words were
written.</p>
            <p>Those letters that are descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed

will not bee legible unlesse dust be

            <p>And 'tis thought that <hi>Attalus</hi>
made use of this devise, the better
to excite the courage of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
Being before the Battell to
sacrifice to the Gods for successe,
as hee pulled out the intrals of the
beast, he described upon them these
words, <hi>Regis victoria,</hi> which he had
before written backward in his hand
with some gummy juyce. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals
being turned up and downe
by the Priest to find out their signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
the letters did by that
meanes gather so much dust as to
appeare legible. By which <hi>omen</hi>
the Souldiers were so strangely

adde those other wayes of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

should bee of the same number

The order of the threeds

            <p>To this purpose likewise is that

according to certaine distances;
by which a man may as distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

discourse. For who would mistrust
any private newes or trechery, to
lye hid in a threed, wherein there
was nothing to be discerned, but
sundry confused knots or other the

the first Alphabet, onely inserting
(as you have occasion) such letters
of the second, as may expresse that
inward meaning which you would

For example, from those that

            <p>Wee prosper still in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires

Wee perish with hunger

            <p>But because the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

since they are both generally of
the same kind; the letters of the

for their better secrecy in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
it were safer to mixe them

            <p>This way of secrecy may be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
for such occasions as these.
Suppose a man were taken captive,
he may by this meanes discover to
his friends the secrets of the enemies
Camp, under the outward forme of
a letter perswading them to yield.
Or suppose such a man were forced
by his owne hand writing to betray
his cause and party, though the
words of it in common appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

desire; yet the involved meaning,
(which shall be legible onely to his
confederates) may containe any
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99548:47"/>
thing else, which he ha's a mind to
discover to them. As in the former
example.</p>
            <p>But now if there be a threefold
Alphabet, (as is easie to contrive,)
then the inward writing will beare
unto the outward but a triple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
which will be much more
convenient for inlarging of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
intimations.</p>
            <p>And this way of writing is justly
to be preferred before any of the
other, as contavning in it more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently,
all those conditions that are
desirable in such kind of inventions.
As,

            <p>The difference of characters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
severall languages are exprest, is
part of the second generall curse in
the confusion of tongues. For as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there was but one way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
so also but one way of writing.
And as now, not only nations, but
particular men, may discover their
thoughts by any different articulate
sounds, so likewise by any written
signes.</p>
            <p>These invented characters in the
generall, are distinguishable into such
as signifie either</p>

            <p>First,<note place="margin">The let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter.</note> concerning those that signifie
letters. To which kind, some learned
men refer the Hebrew character that
is now in use:<note place="margin">Hieronym. praef. ad lib. Regum.</note> Affirming that <hi>Ezra</hi>
first invented it, thereby the better to
conceale the secrets of their Law,<note place="margin">Ioseph. Scal. notis ad Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seb.</note> and
that they might not have so much as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99548:52"/>
their manner of writing common with
the <hi>Samaritans</hi> &amp; other Schismaticks.</p>
            <p>'Twere but needlesse to set downe
any particulars of this kind, since it is
so easie for any ordinary man to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
or vary them at pleasure.</p>
            <p>The rules that are usually prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
for the unfolding of such chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
are briefly these.</p>
            <p>1 Endeavour to distinguish betwixt
the vowells and consonants. The vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells
may be knowne by their frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
there being no word without some
of them. If there be any single cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in English, it must be one of
these three vowells, <hi>a. i. o.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Search after the severall powers
of the letters. For the understanding
of this, you must mark which of them
are most common, and which more
seldome used. (This the Printers in
any language can easily informe you
of, who doe accordingly provide their
sets of letters.) Which of them may
be doubled, and which not, as <hi>H. Q.
X. Y.</hi> And then for the number of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99548:53"/>
vowells or consonants in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
middle, or end of words, a man
must provide severall tables, whence
hee may readily guesse at any word,
from the number and nature of the
letters that make it. As what words
consist only of vowells; what have
one vowell and one consonant, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the vowell be first. As in these
words. <hi>Am. an. as. if. in. is. it. of. on or. us.</hi>
Or last, as in these words. <hi>Be. he. me.
by. dy. ly. my. ty. do. to. so.</hi> &amp;c. And so for
all other words according to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
quantities and natures.</p>
            <p>These tables must be various ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the difference of languages.
There are divers the like rules to be
observed, which are too tedious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite.
You may see them largely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by <hi>Baptista Porta,</hi> and <hi>Gustavus
Selenus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The common rules of unfolding
being once knowne,<note place="margin">In these cases Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thographie is nol to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</note> a man may the
better tell how to delude them. Either
by leaving out those letters that are of
lesse use, as <hi>H. K. Q. X. Y.</hi> and putting
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99548:53"/>
other characters instead of them, that
shall signifie the vowells: So that the
number of this invented Alphabet
will be perfect, and the vowells, by
reason of their double character, lesse
distinguishable. Or a man may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
delude the rules of discovery, by
writing continuately, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
betwixt the words, or with a
false distinction, or by inserting <hi>nulls</hi>
and <hi>non-significants,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>These Characters are besides lyable
to all those other wayes, whereby the
common letters may bee obscured,
whether by changing their <hi>places,</hi> or
their <hi>powers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The particulars of this kind may be
of such great variety as cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
recited. But it is the grand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
of all these wayes of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie
by invented Characters, that
they are not without suspition.</p>
            <p>For the remedying of which, there
have beene some other inventions of
writing by points, or lines, or figures;
wherein a man would never mistrust
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99548:54"/>
any private message: there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be discerned in these kindes of
intimation, but only, either some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
and casuall, or else some Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
descriptions. As you may see
in these following examples.</p>
            <p>By points alone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:99548:54"/>

               </figure>
By lines alone<figure>
                  <figDesc>scattered lines</figDesc>
               </figure>
            </p>
            <p>

Each of which figures doe expresse
these words.</p>
            <p>There is no safty but by flight.</p>
            <p>The direction both for the making
and unfolding of these descriptions, is
this. Let the Alphabet be described
at equall distances, upon some thinne
and narrow Plate, Pastboard, or the
like, thus.</p>

            <p>Let the sides of the Paper which
you are to write upon, be secretly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into equall parts, according to the
breadth of the Plate: and then by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication

to conceive, how such a writing may
be both composed and resolved. The
Points, the ends of the Lines, and the
Angles of the figures do each of them
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99548:56"/>
by their different situations, expresse
a severall letter.</p>
            <p>This may likewise be otherwise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
if the Alphabet be contrived
in a Triangular forme, the middle part
of it being cut out.</p>

            <p>The larger these Directories are, by

will the writing be, that is described
from them.</p>
            <p>It is easie to apprehend,<note place="margin">Ioh Walchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us fab. 9.</note> by these
particulars, how a man may contrive
any private saying in the forme of a
Landskip or other picture. There may
be divers the like ways whereby this
invention of secrecie may be further
obscured; but they are in themselves
so obvious, that they need not any
larger explication.</p>

            <p>THe next particular to be discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of, is concerning Characters
that expresse <hi>words.</hi> The writing by

               <hi>Scripturae compendium, cum

<hi>Lypsius.</hi> The art of them is to contrive
such figures for severall syllables, as
may easily bee joyned together in one
forme, according as different words
shall require. Thus 'tis ordinary, to
represent any proper name, by some
such unusuall character, as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in it all the letters of that name
for which it is intended. Of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was that angular figure, so much
used by the <hi>Grecians</hi> of old:<note place="margin">Schikard. Happer. Disp. 5.</note> which
might bee resolved into the letters

            </p>
            <p>This marke was esteemed so sacred
amongst the Ancients, that <hi>Antiochus
Soter,</hi> a perpetuall conquerour, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
instamp it upon his Coine, and
inscribe it on his Ensignes; unto which
he did pretend to be admonished in a
dream, by an apparition of <hi>Alexander</hi>
the great. And there are many super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
women in these times, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this to bee so lucky a character,
that they alwayes worke it upon the
swadling clothes of their young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
thinking thereby to make them
more healthful and prosperous in their
lives. Unto this kind also, some referre
the characters that are used in Magick,
which are mayntained to have, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a secret signification, but likewise a
naturall efficacie.</p>
            <p>This short-hand writing, is now so
ordinary in practice (it being usuall for
any common Mechanick both to write
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:99548:57"/>
and invent it) that I shall not need to
set downe any particular example of
it. In ancient times, it was not so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
used:<note place="margin">And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerollus</hi> reckons it amongst these later inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>lib. de Repert. tit.</hi> 14.</note> But then there was a

            <p>These private characters were pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
by the <hi>Roman</hi> Magistrates, and
others of eminent favour amongst
them: Who being often importuned
to write in the commendation of those
persons they knew not, were faine to
agree upon some secret notes, whereby
their <hi>serious</hi> Epistles, might be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from those of <hi>forme.</hi>

            <p>The other characters of publike and

               <note place="margin">De notis Tyronis &amp; Senec.</note> And there is a whole

               <hi>Polyd. Virgil.</hi> But <hi>Trithemius</hi> affirmes
that <hi>Cicero</hi> himselfe writ a Treatise on
this subject, which was afterwards aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by Saint <hi>Cyprian.</hi> And that hee
had found in an old Library, the copy
of a Psalter, written in these chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
inscribed by some ignorant man,
with this title: <hi>Psalterium in linguâ
Armenicâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Cicero</hi> was not unacquainted
with these notes, may be evident from
that passage to <hi>Atticus:</hi>

whose beginnings in this kind, did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
receive successive addition, from
the works of <hi>Tyro, Philargirus, Aquila,</hi>
and <hi>Seneca</hi> the Father, by whom they
were increased to the number of 5000.<note place="margin">De Orig. scribendi, c. 18. juxta finem.</note>

            <p>But <hi>Hermannus Hugo,</hi> a late Jesuite,
will have this short-hand writing to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99548:58"/>
be of farre more ancient use; affirming
that <hi>David</hi> alludes to the practice of it,
in that phrase, <hi>Psal. 45. 1. The pen of a

the wall in <hi>Daniel</hi> 5. 25. which so puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Wizards, was descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
in such kinde of Characters. But
whether this were so or not, is not
much materiall: It is sufficiently perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to the present enquiry; that the use
of these word-characters may well
enough conduce to the secrecie of any
written message.</p>
            <p>The third and last sort of signes, that
have been anciently used for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression

The benefit, and possibility of this.</head>
            <p>AFter the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> there were
two generall curses inflicted on
Mankinde: The one upon their <hi>labours;</hi>
the other upon their <hi>language.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Against the first of these, we do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
endeavour to provide, by all
those common Arts and Professions,
about which the World is busied: seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby to abate the sweat of their
brows in the earning of their bread.</p>
            <p>Against the other, the best help, that
wee can yet boast of, is the Latine
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99548:61"/>
tongue, and the other learned langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which by reason of their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
do somewhat restore us from the
first confusion. But now, if there were
such an universall character, to expresse
things and notions, as might be legible
to all people and countries, so that men
of severall Nations might with the
same ease, both write and read it; this
invention would be a farre greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in this particular, and mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conduce to the spreading and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of all Arts and Sciences: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that great part of our time, which
is now required to the Learning of
words, might then be employed in the
study of things. Nay, the confusion at
<hi>Babel</hi> might this way have been reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,
if every one could have expressed
his own meaning by the same kinde of
Character. But then perhaps the art of
Letters was not invented.</p>
            <p>That such a manner of writing is
already used in some parts of the

yet either of them can, by this help of

the books and letters of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as if they were only their own.</p>
            <p>And for some particulars, this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
kind of writing is already attained
amongst us also.</p>
            <p>1 Many Nations doe agree in the
characters of the common numbers,
describing them, either the <hi>Roman</hi> way
by letters; as 1. 11. V. X. C. D. M. or
else the <hi>Barbarian</hi> way by figures, as
1. 2. 3. 10. &amp;c. So likewise for that
which we call Philosophicall number,
which is any such measure, whereby
we judge the differences betwixt seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
substances, whether in weight, or
length, or capacity: Each of these are
exprest in severall languages by the
same character. Thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> signifies a

rest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:99548:62"/>
2 The Astronomers of severall
Countries doe expresse both the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Signes, &amp; Planets, &amp; Aspects by
the same kind of notes. As, ♈, ♉, ♊, ♋,
&amp;c. ♄, ♃, ♂, ♀, &amp;c. ☌, ⚹, <g ref="char:trine">△</g>, <g ref="char:quadrine">□</g>, ☍. Which
characters (as it is thought) were first
invented by the ancient Astrologers
for the secrecie of them, the better to
conceale their sacred and mysterious
profession from vulgar capacitie.</p>
            <p>3 The Chymicall Treatises that are
written in different languages do all of
them agree in the same forme of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Minerals. Those that are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to any of the Planets are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyphered
by the character of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
to which they belong. The rest by
other particular signes, as <g ref="char:trine">△</g> for Salt
Ammoniack, ☍ for Arsnick, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4 Musicall notes in most Countries
are the same. Nor is there any reason
why there may not be such a generall
kinde of writing invented for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of every thing else as well as
these particulars.</p>
            <p>In the contrivance of this there must
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99548:62"/>
be as many severall characters as there
are primitive words. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is the best patterne,
because that language consists of few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Radicalls.</p>
            <p>Each of these primitives must have
some particular marks to distinguish
the cases, conjugations, or other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
variations of those derivatives that
depend upon it.</p>
            <p>In the reading of such a writing,
though men of severall Countries
should each of them differ in their voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and pronounce severall words, yet
the sense would be still the same. As it
is in the picture of a man, a horse, or
tree, which to all Nations doe expresse
the same conceit, though each of these
creatures be styled by severall names,
according to the difference of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</p>
            <p>Suppose that Astronomicall signe
♉ were to be pronounced, a <hi>Iew</hi> would
call it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; A <hi>Grecian <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> An <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Toro;</hi> A <hi>Frenchman Taureau;</hi> A <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Stier;</hi> An <hi>Englishman</hi> a Bull.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:99548:63"/>
So likewise for that character, which
in <hi>Tyro's</hi> notes, signifies the world, A
<hi>Iew</hi> would reade it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; A <hi>Grecian</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; An <hi>Italian, il mondo;</hi> A <hi>French
man, le monde;</hi> A <hi>German, Belt.</hi> Though
severall Nations may differ in the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi>
of things, yet they all agree in
the same <hi>conceit</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>The learning of this character will
not be more difficult, than the learning
of any one Language, because there
needs not be more signes for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of things, than there is now
for the expression of <hi>words.</hi> Amongst
those in <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Iapan,</hi> there is said
to be about seven or eight thousand.</p>
            <p>The perfecting of such an invention
were the only way to unite the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
two Languages of the first confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And therefore may very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
their endeavours, who have both
abilities and leasure for such kinde of

            <p>1 <hi>Ex congruo,</hi> when there is some

the action done, and the thing to
be exprest. Of which kind, are all those
outward gestures, whereby not only
dumbe creatures; but men also doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
their inward passions, whether
of joy, anger, feare, &amp;c. For,
<q>Saepe tacens vocem verbaque vultus habet.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:99548:64"/>
And the Wiseman notes it of the
scorner,<note place="margin">Prov. 6. 13.</note> that <hi>hee winketh with his eyes, hee
speaketh with his feet, hee teacheth with his
fingers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this kinde likewise are many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
actions, and circumstances of
divine worship, not only amongst the
ancient Heathen; but some that were
particularly enjoyned the Priests and
Levits of the old Law, and some too,
that are now in use, in these times of
the Gospell. For by such bodily ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
and signes, we may as well speak
unto God, as unto men.</p>
            <p>To this kind also are reducible, those
actions of <hi>forme,</hi> that are required as
necessary circumstances, in many civill
affaires, and publike solemnities; which
are usually such, as in themselves are
apt to signifie the thing for which they
are meant.</p>
            <p>But now, sometimes the intended
meaning of these gestures is concealed
under a secret similitude. As it was in
that act of <hi>Thrasybulus,</hi> who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
with, how to mayntain a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99548:64"/>

the rest; intimating, that it consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in cutting off the Peeres, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
who were likely to be most
impatient of subjection. This I may
call a <hi>Parabolicall</hi> way of speaking by
Gestures.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Ex placito,</hi> when these signes have
their signification from use and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
compact; which kind of speaking,
as it refers to lascivious intimations, is
largely handled by <hi>Ovid. de Arte A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandi:</hi>
               <q>Verba superciliis sine voce loquentia dicam,

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>By the helpe of this it is common
for men of severall Nations, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not one anothers Languages,
to entertain a mutuall commerce and
traffique. And 'tis a strange thing to
behold, what Dialogues of gestures
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99548:65"/>
there will passe betwixt such as are
borne both deafe and dumb; who are
able by this meanes alone, to answer
and reply unto one another as directly,
as if they had the benefit of speech.
'Tis a great part of the state and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,
belonging to the Turkish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
that hee is attended by Mutes,
with whom hee may discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
any private businesse, which
hee would not have others to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
            <p>It were a miserable thing, for a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
soule, to be imprisoned in such
a body, as had no way at all to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
its cogitations: which would
be so, in all that are borne deafe, if
that which nature denied them, were
not in this respect supplied, by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

this invention, well followed, might
be of singular use, for those that stand

that was far beyond it, (if true)
which is related of an ancient Doctor,
<hi>Gabriel Neale,</hi> that he could understand
any word by the meere motion of the
lips, without any utterance.</p>
            <p>The particular wayes of discoursing
by gestures, are not to be numbred, as
being almost of infinite variety, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

               <hi>Pierius,</hi> and
others. In whom you may see, how the
Ancients were wont to expresse any
number, by the severall postures of the
hands and fingers; The numbers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a hundred, were denoted by the
left hand, and those above, by the right
hand. Hence <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> commending
<hi>Pylias</hi> for his old age, sayes that hee
reckoned his yeeres upon his right
hand.

annos.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There are divers passages in the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Authors, both sacred and profane,
which do evidently allude to this kind
of reckoning.</p>
            <p>Hence it is easie to conceive, how
the letters, as well as the numbers, may
be thus applyed to the severall parts of
the hand, so that a man might with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
touches, make up any sense, that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99548:66"/>
hee hath occasion to discover unto a
confederate.</p>
            <p>This may be performed, either as
the numbers are set downe, in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
before cited, or else by any other
way of compact that may bee agreed
upon.</p>
            <p>As for example. Let the tops of the
fingers signifie the five vowels; the
middle parts, the five first consonants;
the bottomes of them, the five next
consonants; the spaces betwixt the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
the foure next. One finger laid
on the side of the hand may signifie T.
Two fingers V the consonant; Three
W. The little finger crossed X. The
wrist Y. The middle of the hand Z.</p>
            <p>But because such various gesticula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as are required to this, will not
be without suspition; therefore it were
a better way, to impose significations,
upon such actions as are of more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
unsuspected use: As scratching of
the head, rubbing the severall parts of
the face, winking of the eyes, twisting
of the beard, &amp;c. Any of which, or
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99548:67"/>
all of them together, may be as well
contrived to serve for this purpose, and
with much more secrecie.</p>
            <p>In which art, if our gaming Cheats,

<hi>swiftnesse</hi> and <hi>speed,</hi> discover his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
to one that is far distant from

            <p>There is nothing (wee say) so swift
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99548:67"/>
as thought, and yet the impression of
these in another, might be as quick al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as the first act, if there were but
such a great power in imagination, as
some later<note n="*" place="margin">Marsil. Fic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Next to the acts of thought, the species
of sight, doe seeme to be of the
quickest motion. Wee see the light of
the East will in a moment fill the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere,
and the eye does presently
discerne an object that is very remote.
How we may by this means commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
our thoughts at great distances, I
shall discourse afterwards.</p>
            <p>The Substances that are most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
for the swiftnesse of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are either
<list>
                  <item>Spirituall.</item>
                  <item>Corporeall.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst all created substances,
there are not any of so swift a motion
as Angels or Spirits.<note place="margin">Spirits.</note> Because there is
not either within their natures, any such
indisposition and reluctancie, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them in the medium, any such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99548:68"/>
as may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the least manner
retarde their courses. And therefore
have the ancient Philosophers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
these as the causes of that mad
celerity, of the celestiall Orbs; though
according to their suppositions I thinke
it would bee a hard match, if there
were a race to be run, betwixt the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
mobile,</hi> and an Angell. It being
granted that neither of them could
move in an instant, it would be but an
even lay, which should prove the swif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>From the fitnesse of spirits in this
regard, to convey any message, are they
in the learned Languages called Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers.<note place="margin">

If wee could send but one of them
upon any errand, there would bee no

of businesse at all distances.</p>
            <p>That they have been often thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
is affirmed by divers relations.

any other Messenger could arrive with

            <p>And it is storied of many others,
that whilst they have resided in remote
Countries, they have known the death
of their friends, even in the very houre
of their departure: Either by bleeding,
or by dreams, or some such way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation.
Which, though it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
attributed to the operation of
sympathy; yet it is more probably to
be ascribed unto the Spirit or Genius.
There being a more especiall acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and commerce, betwixt the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telary
Angels of particular friends,
they are sometimes by them informed
(though at great distances) of such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
accidents as befall one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But this way, there is little hopes to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:99548:69"/>
advantage our enquiry, because it is
not so easie to imploy a good Angell,
nor safe dealing with a bad one.</p>
            <p>The Abbot <hi>Trithemius,</hi> in his books,
concerning the severall ways of secret

handle the forms of conjuration, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
each kinde of character by the
name of spirits, thereby to deterre the
vulgar from searching into his Works.
But under this pretence, hee is thought
also to deliver some Diabolicall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.<note place="margin">Vossius Gram. lib. 1 cap. 41.</note>
Especially in one place, where he
speaks of the three Saturnine Angels,
and certain Images, by which, in the

may bee informed of newes from any

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99548:70"/>
discoursed, in the fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which I now forbeare to repeat.</p>
            <p>Those living bodies, that are most
observable for their speed, and celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

Birds. Though I doubt not, but that
Fishes also may be serviceable for this

is reported to be of the greatest swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and most easily cicurated, or

            <p>Amongst the ancient Footmen,<note place="margin">Men.</note> there

The custome of riding post,

And such Horses (say they) were used

the mayne occasion of this discourse,
does refer to other ways of intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
besides these in ordinary use, of

in the generall wee must note: That

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99548:74"/>
means, whereby to expresse the cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
It is more convenient indeed,
that these differences should be of as
great varietie, as the letters of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet;
but it is sufficient if they bee
but twofold, because two alone, may
with somewhat more labour and time,
bee well enough contrived to expresse
all the rest. Thus any two letters or
numbers, suppose A. B. being transpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
through five places, will yield thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

will superaboundantly serve for the

such informations must be conveyed,
are either the species of <hi>sound,</hi> or the
species of <hi>sight.</hi> The eare and the eye,
being the only sences, that are of quick
perception, when their objects are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote.</p>

            <p>The two last of these are chiefly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
to the present enquiry. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which, in the generall it may
be concluded, that any sound, whether
of Trumpets, Bels, Cannons, Drums,
&amp;c. or any object of sight, whether
flame, smoake, &amp;c. which is capable of
a double difference, may be a sufficient
meanes, whereby to communicate the
thoughts.</p>
            <p>The particular application of these,
to some experiments, I shall treat more
distinctly in the remaynder of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Secret and speedy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation by the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of sound.</note> concerning the secrecy and
swiftnesse of any message by the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of sound. Though these audible
species be much slower then those of
sight; yet are they far swifter then the
naturall motion of any corporeall mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger.
The chiefe use of these is for
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:99548:75"/>
such as are within some competent
neernes, as perhaps a mile of. But they
may also by frequent multiplications,
be continued to a far greater distance.</p>
            <p>There is a relation in <hi>Ioach. Camera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>

of some that have heard their

when they have been many miles asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

But this hee justly refers to Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall
Magick, and the illusion of
spirits.</p>
            <p>There are other <hi>naturall</hi> experiments
in this kind, of more especiall note for
their antiquity. Such was that of
King <hi>Xerxes,</hi> related by <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> as
he is cited by <hi>Sardus.</hi> Cleomedes <hi>in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro
de circulis coelestibus scribit</hi> Xerxem

quadraginta horarum spatio, ex</hi> Graeciâ <hi>in</hi>
Persidem <hi>res nunciari poterat.</hi> But this
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99548:75"/>
invention, besides the great trouble
and uncertainty of it, is also too grosse
for imitation, savouring somewhat of
the rudenes of those former and more
barbarous ages.</p>
            <p>Much beyond it was that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the contrivance
of the <hi>Picts</hi> wall,<note place="margin">Britan. de Vallo sive the Picts Wall. p. 654 Boter. Geog. l. 2. &amp; lib. 4 <hi>where hee mentions also ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wall of 8000 furlongs in</hi> China.</note> related by our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Cambden,</hi> this wall was built by
<hi>Severus</hi> in the North part of <hi>England,</hi>
above a hundred miles long. The tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of it were about a mile distant from
one another. Betwixt each of these
towers there passed certaine hollow
pipes or trunks in the curtaines of the
wall, through which the Defendants
could presently informe one another of
any thing that was necessary. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that place wherein the enemy
was most likely to assault them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Since the wall is ruined, and this
means of swift advertisement taken
away, there are many inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
which hold their Land by a
tenure in <hi>Cornage</hi> (as the Lawyers
speak) being bound by blowing of a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99548:76"/>
Horne to discover the irruption of the
enemy.</p>
            <p>There is another experiment to this
purpose mentioned by <hi>Walchius,</hi> who
thinks it possible so to contrive a trunk
or hollow pipe,<note place="margin">Fabul. 9.</note> that it shall preserve
the voice entirely for certain houres or
days; so that a man may send his <hi>words</hi>
to a friend instead of his <hi>writing.</hi> There
being always a certaine space of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;
for the passage of the voice,
betwixt its going into these cavities,
and its comming out; hee conceives,
that if both ends were seasonably stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
whilst the sound was in the midst,
it would continue there till it had some
vent. <hi>Huic tubo verba nostra insusurremus,
&amp; cum probe munitur tabellario commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamus,
&amp;c.</hi> When the friend to whom
it is sent, shall receive and open it, the
words shall come out distinctly, and in
the same order wherein they were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
From such a contrivance as this,
(saith the same Authour) did <hi>Albertus
Magnus</hi> make his Image, and Frier <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,</hi>
his brazen Head, to utter certaine
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99548:76"/>
words. Which conceit (if it have any
truth) may serve somewhat to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
the grosse absurdity of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
relique concerning <hi>Iosephs</hi> [Hah] or
the noise that hee made (as other Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters
use) in fetching of a blow:
which is said, to be preserved, yet in a
glasse amongst other ancient Reliques.</p>
            <p>But against these fancies it is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
that the species of sound are
multiplyed in the ayre, by a kinde of
continuation and efflux from their first
originall, as the species of light are
from any luminous body; either of
which being once separated from their
causes doe presently vanish and die.
Now as it would be a mad thing for a
man to endeavour, to catch the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams.
or inclose the light; upon the
same grounds likewise must it needs be
absurd, for any one to attempt the shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in of articulate sounds: Since both
of them equally have the same intrinsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and inseparable dependance upon
their efficient causes.</p>
            <p>True, indeed, the species of sound
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99548:77"/>
may seeme to have some kinde of selfe
continuance in the ayre, as in Ecchoes,
but so likewise is it in a proportion
with those of sight, as in the quick tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
round of a fire-sticke, which will
make the appearance of a fiery circle:
And though the first kinde of these be
more lasting then the other, by reason
their naturall motion is not so quick,
yet neither of them are of such durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as may be sufficient for the present
enquiry.</p>
            <p>None of all these inventions already
specified, doe sufficiently performe the
businesse, that is here enquired after:
Nor are they, either so generally or
safely, appliable for all places and exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences.</p>
            <p>The discovery that is here promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
may be further serviceable for
such cases as these.</p>
            <p>Suppose a friend were perfidiously
clapped up in some close Dungeon, and
that wee did not know exactly where,
but could only guesse at the place,
within the latitude of halfe a mile or
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99548:77"/>
somewhat more: A man might very
distinctly by these other inventions dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
unto him. Or suppose a Citie
were straitly besieged, and there
were either within it or without it, such
a confederate, with whom wee should
necessarily confer about some designe:
We may by these means safely disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to him our intentions. By which
you may guesse, that the Messenger
which is here imployed, is of so strange
a nature, as not to be barred out with
walls, or deterred by enemies.</p>
            <p>To the performance of this, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
that there be two Bels of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
notes, or some such other audible
and loude sounds, which we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
at pleasure; as Muskets, Canons,
Horns, Drums, &amp;c. By the various
sounding of these (according to the
former Table) a man may easily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
any letter,<note place="margin">Cap. 9.</note> and so consequently
any sense.</p>
            <p>These Tables, I shall again repeat in
this place. That of two letters may be
contrived thus.</p>

(which is a singular curiosity) how the

the tune of it.</p>
            <p>I suppose that these letters and notes

with better advantage then here
they are expressed. And this perhaps,
would bee easie enough for those that

            <p>But now if these inarticulate sounds

The manner that is usually prescribed

there be two needles provided, of an

of them touched with the same load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.
Let the letters of the Alphabet
be placed in the circles on which they
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99548:82"/>
are moved, as the points of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
under the needle of the Mariners
Chart. Let the friend that is to travaile
take one of them with him, first agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the dayes and houres, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they should conferre together: At
which times, if one of them move the
needle of his instrument to any letter
of the Alphabet, the other needle by
a Sympathie, will move unto the same
letter in the other instrument, though
they be never so farre distant. And
thus by severall motions of the needle
to the letters, they may easily make up
any words or sense which they have a

            <p>The first occasion of these relations,
was the proofe of that strange imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
powers of the loadstone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it did work through thick and solid
bodies, as a table, or wall, or the like:
as also of that directive vertue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it alwayes tends to the poles; From
whence others have conjectured, that
it might be serviceable also, for such a
businesse, at so great a distance.</p>
            <p>But against this, it is considerable,</p>
            <p>1 That every naturall agent, is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to have some certaine sphere,
which determines its activity.</p>
            <p>2 That magneticall operations doe
not arise (as some fondly conceive)
from a Sympatheticall conformation
of natures, which is the same at all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
but from such a diffusion of
these magneticall qualities through
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99548:83"/>
the <hi>medium,</hi> that they may be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the agent to the patient. And
so these naturall powers, will not be
of so great an extent, as they are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in this experiment.</p>
            <p>The utmost distance, at which wee
may discourse with another, by these

it is not only the secondary
vertue of the needles that can be thus
effectuall (as is supposed in the former
invention) but there must be the help
also of the loadstone it selfe.</p>
            <p>As for the reason why these mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall
powers are able to worke
through solid bodies; 'Tis considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that any quality may be diffused
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99548:83"/>
through such a substance; as hath no
naturall repugnancie unto it. Wee see
the light does passe as wel through hot
bodies as cold, through solid as fluid,
&amp;c. only Opacitie keeps it out; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that quality alone is contrary to
its nature. So likewise is it with mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall
vertues, which doe equally
spread themselves, through all kind of
bodies, whether <hi>rare</hi> or <hi>dense, diaphanous</hi>
or <hi>opacous,</hi> there being no quality con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this; because it is that generall

            <p>There is an experiment in Opticks
to represent any writing by the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams,
upon a wall or front of a house:
For which purpose, the letters must
be first described, with wax or some
other opacous colour, upon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the glasse, in an inverted forme;
which glasse, afterwards reflecting the
light upon any wall in the shade, will
discover these letters in their right
forme and order. Unto some such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
I did first (before I had well
considered these particulars) attribute
the performance of those strange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
in <hi>Nuntius inanimatus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">World in the Moon. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</note> But upon
better thoughts, it will be found, that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99548:84"/>
the species of reflexion, in this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are so weake, that unlesse the
glasse and the letters be very bigge,
and the wall somwhat neere, there
will be no distinct appearance of the
writing. And therefore this way, there
can be no thoughts of contriving any
reflected species, that shall be visible
at so great a distance as the Moone.
Nor is there any other naturall means
conceiveable, by which so strange an
effect may be performed, which is the
reason that it is so frequently attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to diabolicall Magick, by almost
all the Writers that have occasion to
treat of it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Agrippa</hi> in another place speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
concerning this invention, affirmes
that it was performed thus. <hi>Pythagoras</hi>
did first describe with blood any let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which hee thought fit,<note place="margin">Agrippa de Vanit. Scient. cap. 48.</note> in some
great glasse, and then opposing the
glasse against the full Moone, the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
would appeare thorough it, as if
they were writ in the circumference of
her body. <hi>Quae collibuisset sanguine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripsit
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99548:85"/>

                  </gap> lunae commonstravit.</hi> In which
passage he seemes to intimate, that this
writing in the Moone, could not be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
at any great distance (as it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in common tradition,) but that it
did appeare to such onely, betwixt
whose eyes and the Moone, this glasse
might be interposed. And according
to this the wonder of the relation
ceases, nor may it truly be referred to
Diabolicall Magick.</p>
            <p>More properly reducible to this
kind,<note place="margin">Ioach. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merar. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oem. in lib. Plutarc. de defect. Orac.</note> are those inchaunted glasses, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in divers Authors: In which
some Magitians are said to containe
such familiar spirits, as doe informe
them of any businesse they shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after. I have heard a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
to the knowledge of all secret
Arts, confidently affirme, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was able at that time, or any
other, to shew me in a glasse what was
done in any part of the world, what
ships were sailing in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:99548:85"/>

            <p>That is, two lights being lifted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the right hand, shew the second co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne;
and at the same time three
torches appearing on the left hand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99548:88"/>
the third letter in that columne,
which is <hi>H.</hi> Thus a single torch being
discovered on both sides, doth signifie
the first letter of the first columne,
which is <hi>A,</hi> and so of the rest.</p>
            <p>There is another way mentioned by
<hi>Ioachimus Fortius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">By 3 Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> unto the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of which,<note place="margin">Lib. de Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perientia.</note> there are onely three
lights required. One torch being
shewed alone, shall signifie the eight
first letters. <hi>A. B. C. D. E. F. G. H.</hi> Two
together, the eight next, <hi>I. K. L. M. N.
O. P. Q.</hi> And all three the rest. <hi>R. S. T.
V. W. X. Y. Z.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One light being discovered once,
signifies <hi>A.</hi> If twice, <hi>B.</hi> Two lights
being shewed once, doe denote the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>I;</hi> if twice, <hi>K,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>According to this way, if I would
expresse the word FAMINE: the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
must bee contrived. One light
must be lifted up six times for the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>F.</hi> One light once for <hi>A.</hi> Two
lights foure times for <hi>M.</hi> Two lights
once for <hi>I.</hi> Two lights five times
for <hi>N.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:99548:88"/>
But here it will be requisite, that
there be some intermission, betwixt the
expression of severall letters, because
otherwise there must needs be a great
confusion, amongst those that belong
to the same number of Torches. In
which respect, this way is much more
tedious, and inconvenient, then the
former invention out of <hi>Polybius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is easie to conceive,<note place="margin">By two torches.</note> how by the
Alphabet consisting of two letters
transposed through five places, such
a manner of discoursing may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
contrived, only by two torches.
But then there must be five shewes, to
expresse every letter.</p>
            <p>There is another way of speaking,
by the differences of motion in two
lights; which for its quicknesse and
speed is much to be preferred before
any of the rest. The manner of it is
thus. Provide two torches on long
poles: Let them be placed so farre
from one another, that they may
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99548:89"/>
seeme unto your confederate to be
about foure cubits distance. By the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
elevations or depressions of these,
enclining of them to the right hand,
or to the left, severally or both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it is easie to expresse all the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet.</p>
            <p>One light alone being discovered,
must stand for <hi>A.</hi> lifted up for <hi>E.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
for <hi>I.</hi> enclined to the right
hand for <hi>O.</hi> unto the left hand for <hi>V.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two lights elevated, for <hi>B:</hi> depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

for <hi>D:</hi> to the left hand for <hi>F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two lights being still discovered,
and the torch at the right hand being
lifted up, shall signifie <hi>G.</hi> Being depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<hi>H.</hi> Inclined to the right hand, <hi>K.</hi>
To the left hand, <hi>L.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The torch at the left hand, being
elevated shall stand for <hi>M.</hi> Depressed,
for <hi>N.</hi> Inclined to the right hand for <hi>P.</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:99548:89"/>
To the left hand for <hi>Q.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The torch at the right hand being
moved towards the left hand, and that
at the left hand, being at the same time
moved towards the right hand, shall
signifie, <hi>R.</hi> The right hand torch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enclined to the left hand, and the
other at the same time being elevated
signifies, <hi>S:</hi> being depressed, <hi>T.</hi> The
left hand torch being enclined to the
right hand, and the other at the same
time being elevated, signifies <hi>W:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
depressed, <hi>X.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The right hand Torch being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to the right hand, and the other
at the same time being elevated, may
stand for <hi>Y;</hi> being depressed for <hi>Z.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When any thing is thus to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed;
the two torches, being disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
must remaine without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so long, till the confederate shall
by other lights shew some signe, that
hee is ready to take notice. After
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99548:90"/>
every one of these particular motions,
the torches must be carefully hidden
and obscured, that so the severall let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
expressed by them, may be the
better distinguished.</p>
            <p>The day-time informations by
smoke, cannot so conveniently be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
according to this later contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.
And therefore must be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by some of those other wayes,
that were specified before. To which
purpose there must be some tunnells
provided for the orderly inclosing and
conveying up the smoke. The other
particulars concerning this, are in
themselves easie enough to bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
            <p>How these significatory signes will
be visible at a great distance; How by
multiplication of them in severall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Barcla. Argen. lib. 1.</note>
they may be contrived for many
scores of miles; will easily bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
from the situation and use of
Beacons: by which the intimations
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99548:90"/>
of publike danger and preparations,
have been oftentimes suddenly spread,
over this whole Iland.</p>
            <p>This may further be advantaged, by
the use of <hi>Galilaeus</hi> his perspective.</p>
            <p>'Tis storied of the Inhabitants in
<hi>China,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Busbequius. Epist. Turc. ep 4.</note> that when any Merchants doe
happen upon the shores of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
they are presently examined,
whence they come, what commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
they bring, and of what number
they are; Which being knowne, the
watch (set for that purpose) doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
informe the King of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers,
by smoke in the day, and
fires in the night: Who by the same
meanes do's as speedily returne them
his pleasure, whether they shall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
or kept out. And so that is
easily dispatched in some few houres,
which could not be performed the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

Discourse; It may evidently appeare,
that the wayes of intimation, which
were there meant, are performed after
the same manner, according to which
they are here discoursed of.</p>
            <p>He does indeed mention out of <hi>Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bequius,</hi>
the practice of these informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
amongst the inhabitants of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi>
And thinks that they were used
too by the <hi>Romans,</hi> but withall he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
how that now amongst us, they
should be altogether forgotten, and the
restoring of them to these places and
times, seems to be his chiefe ayme, in
the promises of that discourse.</p>
            <p>The particular example which hee
mentions, is this. Suppose that one at
<hi>London,</hi> would send a message to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow,
Wells, Exeter,</hi> or though it were
any remoter place: <hi>Neque enim longin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitatem
viae multum moror, si detur facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
sternendi, &amp; permeabilem efficiendi.</hi>
That is, the greatnesse of distance can
be no impediment, if the space betwixt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99548:92"/>
be fitted with such high Mountaines,
and Beacon Hils, as may serve for
these kinde of Discoveries. Suppose
(I say) this Messenger should set forth
from <hi>London,</hi> in the very point of noon,
hee would notwithstanding, arrive at
<hi>Bristow</hi> before twelve of the clock that
day. That is, a Message may by these
means be conveyed so great a distance,
in fewer minutes then those which
make the difference betwixt the two
Meridians of those places.</p>
            <p>If according to this, we should inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret,
that passage out of <hi>Trithemius,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the three <hi>Saturnine</hi> Angels,<note place="margin">See before <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.</note> that
in twenty foure houres can convey
news from any part of the World; that
Author might then, in one respect be
freed from the aspersion of Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Magick, which for this very reason
hath heretofore been imputed to him.
But this by the way.</p>
            <p>It may be, the resolution of those
great promises in <hi>Nuncius Inanimatus,</hi> to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99548:93"/>
such easie causes as they are here ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
unto, will not be answerable to
mens expectation. every one will bee
apt to mistrust som greater matter then
is here exprest: But 'tis thus also, in
every other the like particular, for ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
is the mother of wonder, and
wonder does usually create unto it self
many wilde imaginations, which is the
reason why mens fancies are so prone
to atribute all unusual and unknowne
events, unto stranger causes shen either
nature or art hath designed for them.</p>

may unhappily advantage others, in
such unlawfull courses: Tis considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that it does not only teach how to
deceive, but consequently also how to
discover Delusions. And then besides,
the chiefe experiments are of such na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that they cannot be frequently
practised, without just cause of suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when as it is in the Magistrates
power to prevent them. However, it
will not follow, that every thing must
be supprest, which may bee abused.
