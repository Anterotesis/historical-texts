            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whose vertues were such, and his noble Qualities so great
<pb facs="tcp:22401:3"/>
and so wel knowen vnto al (who neither for sinister affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were blinded, nor for ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, vnapt to esteme and see the same) that I may wel saie and doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Nobilitie of bloud and parentage (which was very high and auncient) were greater in him, or els the vertues and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of his minde, the whiche alone had bene meete and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, to haue made him suche, if he had not ben thereto borne by kind and noble Race. For if true Nobilitie consist in the gifts of vertue, wisedome and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesse, adioyned with some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie of famous and worthie Progenitours: I nede not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the truth hereof to any that knew his Grace but a litle, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were not abundantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with al the same. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie of his renowned Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and Ofspring, the late Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb facs="tcp:22401:3"/>
of Naples and Spaine do ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifestly witnesse to the worlde. His liberalitie and passing Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in succouring poore Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and other in necessitie (the memorie wherof is yet fresh in the mindes of many so succou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him) his Religious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion toward God and his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Churche, his faithful cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel to his Prince, his true and readie seruise in publike affaires at sundry times employed, his valour and prowesse in Martial feates wel tried: all these Noble Qualities of his Grace being so wel knowen and witnessed to the world, must nedes confirme and prooue, that he was a very worthy and true Noble-man in deede.</p>
            <p>For whiche cause (as I said before) seeing and knowing all these high giftes of God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be so plentifully in him,
<pb facs="tcp:22401:4"/>
I did euer thinke my self bound to be ready to serue him, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him and to beare that loyal affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> toward him, which true Nobilitie doth of right require of al true honest hartes.</p>
            <p>But now wheras it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God, so sone to bereaue your Grace of so Noble and so deare a Husband, and al good men of so great and so hable a Patrone in their necessities, and that now the best seruise we can do him, is to praie hartily for him: yet that former desire of mine is not thus quenched, nor dead with him, but from him is deriued to such as be leaft behinde him, being most nere and deare than vnto him, and leaft now to vs as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereon stil to exercise our former seruise and duetie.</p>
            <p>And this very cause it was, which moued me of late, that whereas I had newly set forth a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:22401:4"/>
brief Latin Chronicle (printed before at Paris) and had somwhat augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted it my self, and emong other things, made mention of the most honourable Duke of Feria, both of that he did in England a litle before and after the death of Good Queene Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and now last, of his owne death, in departing out of this worlde in so good and so Godly Christian wise: al that part of my labour therein, I haue dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto that Noble Impe your Graces moste deare and onely Sonne, leaft now vnto you for a very paterne and comfort of his no lesse dere, than Noble Father. Which when I had done, yet was I not so satisfied, but tooke it to be against all good maner, if in shewing some seruice and honour to the Sonne, I should leaue alone the Mother not so much as saluted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22401:5"/>And therefore, whereas I had also translated out of Spanish a short Treatise co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teining a brief fourme or Doctrine of Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which hath seemed to the learned and vertuous of our Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion here a thing very necessarie and profitable, specially at this time in so great corruption both of true faith, and good life: it came also to mind, that I should doe right wel, to dedicate the same smal labour of mine vnto your Honour, for a further te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of my foresaid affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and duetie, not only vnto that moste honourable Duke, who now (no doubte) is gone from this transitorie honour, to liue in eternal Glorie with God. but also vnto your Grace, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I beseke our Lord to send suche continuance and increase of worldly honour, and such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to mitigate the dolour of
<pb facs="tcp:22401:5"/>
his departing hence, that you may liue bothe together againe in that life and glorie that neuer shall decaie nor haue end: and in the meane time suche good health and fortitude to beare patiently this losse and lacke of him, that those Noble vertues, which are in your Grace, be not letted thereby, but may be so exercised together with your Sonne, and in training him vp in his Fathers owne steppes, that as long as the Mother or Sonne shal liue here, the worthy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of the Father shall neuer die in mens hartes. </p>

            <p>WHereas in this great corruption of Faith and good life, there is also great want of good instruction for the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of both the same: &amp; wheras yet the blindnes or malice of some me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is so great, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same meanes leaft by Christe and his Apostles in the Church for that end, they make so smal account of, that they both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne, and condemne the same, &amp; without al reason raise therat with full vncomely termes: it hath semed to many good and vertuous men right necessary, to set forth some such Treatise, wherein briefly is conteined bothe the right vse and ende of Shrift or Confession and also the due order that eche Christian man ought to kepe and obserue
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:22401:6"/>
in the same. Whiche whoso shal duly peruse and examine, shall soone see, how litle reason or cause ther is, to make Confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a cloke or colour of any vice and lewednes, sith it is purposely ordeined for a meane and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Remedie against all vice and sinne.</p>
            <p>There is no time nor place now, to entre into farther dispi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions with suche kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, namely the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being already handled by diuers excellent great Clerkes, bothe in Latin, and in English also.</p>
            <p>Only this I had further to warne the Reader, that hauing tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated this Treatise into our owne Language, and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to set foorth the same for the better information of all sortes in this point: it seemed also very expediente, to adde therevnto certaine other godly

For a thing of suche importance, as is for a man to reconcile himself vnto God, oughte not to be done sleightly, and (as a man would say) at all aduenture, or vpon any sodaine light occasion: but of sad and set purpose, and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good aduise taken before, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring first into particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt with God, and with a mans owne conscience in his secrete chamber &amp; closest place, considering, that there he goeth to giue accompt of his life vnto God, and vnto the Priest in his name.</p>
               <p>The whiche accompt cannot be made in such sort, as it ought to be, except there go a diligent examination &amp; discussing of the bonds and burdens, charges and discharges of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science,

the whiche are our sinnes. And therefore the Priest, if he wil do wel his duetie, ought not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and receiue any penitent that is vnprouided in this poi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, vnlesse it be in extreme necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For it is a plaine contempt of the Sacrament of Penance, and of the Iudgement of God whiche is exercised therein.

The one are Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, the other Mortal. The Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, are those sinnes and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, into which almost houre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and at euery litle occasion we do fall through our weakenes: as are iesting, lawghing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche, idle talke, hastines and sodaine anger for a trifle, or to make a leasing without da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage to our neighbour.

                  <p>Al these, &amp; suche as these, are called Veniall sinnes, for that God our Lorde hauing respect to our weakenes, doth easily pardon &amp; forgeue vs th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And therefore, for that they are so daily, and so common through our weakenes, God hath left in his Church, byside the Sacrament of Penance,

presently so disposed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may be assoiled.

And therfore let the partie penitent do al that he can for his part, &amp; al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is requisite to keepe himselfe from sinne, &amp; from the euident dangers and occasions thereof. As for example, such as haue once promised to auoide their sinne, saying y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were of mind &amp; purpose to put away al occasion therof, &amp; yet haue not don so, as kepers of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cubines, &amp; vsurers are wont to do, and such as liue by vnlauful and yl trades: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ghostly father ought not to beleue nor assoile them, vntil they haue in deede aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned &amp; vtterly forsaken those occasions that brought them in bondage vnto that sinne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:22401:17"/>And he that should otherwise doo (as many Ghostly Fathers do now adaies) it is plainely both to his owne peril of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and of the persons that come vnder his handes to be shriuen. For he maketh them beleue, that they be at peace and reconciled vnto God, &amp; thereby abuseth them, &amp; bringeth them into a woorse state than they were in before their shrift and absolution.</p>
                  <p>The other part of Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which is a recompense &amp; amendes of the sinnes and tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paces committed by the partie penitent) must be done with ful intent and purpose to make sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and to do al kind of penance, according to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and aduise of the good and discrete Ghostly Father: doing for his part al that he can and certainely knoweth to be nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be done, for to make his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:22401:17"/>
Ghostly father vnderstand, that the mind that he hath to do sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and penance, is true and vnfained. Wherein it is to be noted, that satisfaction may be done to foure kindes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonnes, to witte:
<list>
                        <item>1. To God.</item>
                        <item>2. To our betters and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Vnto God, satisfaction is due for euery sinne, (if we wil wholy auoide his wrath) by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vengeance of our selues, or willingly bearing al tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, penalties, or paines that shal come of him, or that shalbe put vpon vs by them who are in his steade and place, whether it be almosedeedes, or fastings, or praiers, or pilgrimages, or other like paines, according as the qualitie of the trespace shal require.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb facs="tcp:22401:18"/>2. To our betters and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours satisfaction is done, by yelding due obedience &amp; humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie vnto them, namely when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spiritual Rulers of the Church haue ordeined any thing vnder the vertue of obedience, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, Interdiction, or any like ecclesiastical Censure. So that, if the partie penitent haue offended his Superiours, and continueth in disobedience vnto them, he may not by any prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se be assoiled of such sinnes except he be first reconciled vnto them, in such order &amp; meanes, as the discrete Ghostly Father shall giue him counsel to do, if he can not of himselfe attaine therevnto.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Vnto our equalles we doe satisfaction, by making them amends for any wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g or harme that we haue done them in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, or soule, in their name, or goodes. Wherein we must first
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:22401:18"/>
do al that lyeth in vs, for to be reconciled vnto them, and to make them amendes before we goe about to be assoiled.</p>
                  <p>And if the case be suche, that it may be done commodiousely, it is very expediente and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, to make al the amendes that may be done touching the case, before we come to the feete of our Ghostly Father, to the ende to shewe thereby an euidente plaine declaration of our good minde and purpose, and so to receiue absolution in such sorte as is due. For when wee delaie such satisfaction and amendes till afterwarde, wee doe commonly either forget thesame, or els the good minde that we had to doe it, waxeth colde againe.</p>
                  <p>And if so be the satisfaction &amp; amendes be such, that it is to be done by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduise &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel of our Ghostly Father, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most certaine

and surest waie were to aske counsel first of him, or els of some other discrete person, (as touching our duetie to be done in suche case) before that we come to confession. And that done, and al amendes made for the time &amp; place requisite, than may we wel come to receiue the benefite of reconciliation, both with God and the world, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sacrament of Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And this waie is none other but the same, which the Primitiue Church did vse of old time, that ordinarily Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should alwaies go before Absolution: and thereby was both penance and repentance more truely &amp; effectually vsed than, then it is now: for that now by ouermuch indulge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in giuing of penance and in seeing amends made, &amp; by negligence of Ghostly Fathers, &amp; such as haue care of soules, eche man is

suffred to liue as he wil, &amp; not only to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinew in sinne, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to iustifie himselfe therein, &amp; to think he doth wel: as though God would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>descend &amp; frame himselfe vnto our abuses and wicked mindes,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Howbeit when the penitent may duely choose his Ghostly Father, which we denie not but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in some case y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may fal, he may lawfully do: he must vse al the dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therin, that is wont to be vsed in the election &amp; chusing of such things, as are of muche importance vnto vs, forasmuch as this is one of the same, yea and that the chief &amp; most prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of al. And let him consider that in such a Confessour that so shalbe chosen, there must prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally concurre foure quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to witte:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he be not let by any Ecclesiastical Censure, wherby he can not assoile from sinnes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he haue knowlege to discerne betwene sinne &amp; sinne, betwene leaper and leaper.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he be discrete &amp; able
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:22401:22"/>
to applie the remedies &amp; good counselles that are requisite, &amp; to enquire of the penitent suche things &amp; circumstances as are good &amp; profitable to be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the case requireth, for behoof of his Ghostly children.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That he be of good name and estimation, &amp; of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation of life, to the end that his good counselles may take place, &amp; also that he may therby helpe the Penitent with his good instructions and praiers.</p>
                  <p>And by this it may appeare, how hard a thing it is, and in what da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger he putteth himself, that wil take vpon him by his owne iudgement, to iudge these qualities (or the most parte of them) whether they concurre together in the person that he woold chuse for his Ghostly Father: whereas it is certaine, that few men are of so perfect iudgement, yea and that fewe
<pb facs="tcp:22401:23"/>
can iudge their owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, and know how to make a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of their owne sinnes, or tel how to say their <hi>Pater Noster</hi> aright, and so much lesse can chuse their owne Ghostly Fathers.

where it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be vnderstood, that the contrarie vice is forbidden vs, which is, to dishonor &amp; disobey them. And so in al the other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>And this point of belief, is in the receiuing of this blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament of such necessitie &amp; such weight, with them that haue yeares &amp; discretion, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, they receiue it plainly to their damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And that point beleeued very ful &amp; fastly, must needes bee a great occasion to mooue any manne in all other points, to receiue it wel. For note wel the words of S. Paul therein:<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</note> 
               <hi>Qui manducat de hoc pane, &amp; bibit de calice indignè,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:22401:64"/>
iudicium sibi manducat &amp; bibit, non dijudicans corpus Domini,</hi> He that eateth of this bread, and drinketh of this cuppe vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, eateth &amp; drinketh iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vppon him selfe, in that he discerneth not the Bodie of our Lord.</p>
            <p>Lo heere this blessed Apostle wel declareth, that he, which in any wise vnworthily receiueth this most excellent Sacrament, receiueth it vnto his owne dam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nation, in that he wel declareth by his euil demeanour toward it, in his vnworthy receiuing of it, that he discerneth it not, nor iudgeth it, nor taketh it for the very Bodie of our Lord, as in deede it is.</p>
            <p>And verily it is hard, but that this point depely rooted in our breast, should sette all our heart in a feruour of deuotion toward the woorthy receiuing of that blessed Bodie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22401:65"/>But surely there can be no doubt on the other side, but that if any man beleeue, that it is Christes very Bodie, and yet is not inflamed to receiue him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly thereby: that man were likely to receiue this blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crament very coldly, and farre from al deuotion, if he beleued, that it were not his Bodie, but onely a bare token of him in stede of his Bodie.</p>
            <p>But nowe hauing the full faith of this point fastly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in our heart, that the thing whiche we receiue, is the very blessed Bodie of Christ: I trust there shal not greatly neede any great information farther to teach vs, or any great exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion farder to stirre &amp; excite vs, with al humble maner and reue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rent behauiour, to receiue him.</p>
            <p>For if we wil but consider, if there were a great worldly Prince, which for special fauour
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:22401:65"/>
that hee bare vs, would come visite vs in our owne house, what a busines we would then make, and what a woorke it would be for vs, to see that our house were trimmed vp in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point, to the best of our pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible power, and euery thing so prouided and ordered, that he should by his honorable recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, perceiue what affection we beare him, &amp; in what high estimation we haue him: we should sone by the comparing of that worldly Prince, and this heauenly Prince together (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene whiche twaine is farre farre lesse comparison, than is betwene a man &amp; a mouse) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme and teach our self, with how lowly mind, how tender louing heart, home reuerent humble maner we should ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour our selues to receiue this glorious heauenly King, the King of al Kinges, almightie
<pb facs="tcp:22401:66"/>
God himselfe, that so louingly doth vouchsafe to enter not only into our house (to which the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man Centurio acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him self vnworthy) but his pretious Bodie into our vile wretched carcas, &amp; his holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into our poore simple soule. What diligence can here suffice vs? What solicitude can wee thinke heere enough, against the comming of this almighty King, comming for so special gratious fauor, not to put vs to coste, not to spend of ours, but to enrich vs of his, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so manyfold deadly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures done him so vnkindly by vs, against so many of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable benefits before don vnto vs? How would we now labour &amp; foresee, that the house of our soule (whiche God were coming to reast in) should nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue any poisoned spider or cobweb of deadly sinne han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

in the roofe, nor so muche as a strawe or a fether of any light lewde thought, that wee might spie in the floure, but we would sweepe it awaie?</p>
            <p>But forasmuch (good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten Readers) as we neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> atteine this great point of faith nor any other vertue, but by the special grace of God, of whose high goodnes euery good thing cometh (for as S.

And euer let vs of our owne parte feare

our owne vnworthinesse, &amp; on his parte trust boldly vpon his goodnesse, if we forslowe not to worke with him for our owne parte. For if we willingly vpon the trust &amp; comfort of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes leaue our own deuour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, than is our hope no hope, but a very foule presumption.</p>
            <p>Than whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we come vnto his holy boord, into the presence of his blessed Bodie, let vs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his high glorious Maiestie, which his high goodnesse there hideth from vs, and the proper fourme of his holy Flesh coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnder the forme of bread, both to kepe vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abashment, such as we could not peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abide, if we (such as we yet be) should see &amp; receiue him in his owne fourme such as he is: and also for the increase of the merite of our faith, &amp; the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient belief of that thing at his commaundement, whereof our

               </gap>ord, she was sore a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled of her visitation, and thought herself farre vnworthy thereto, and therefore said vnto her: <hi>Vnde hoc,</hi>

But yet for al the abashment of her owne vnworthines, she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued throughly suche a glad blessed comforte, that her holy child S.

            <p>Now like as S.

vouchesafe to come and visite eche of vs with his most blessed presence, that he commeth not into our house, but into our self: Let vs, I saie, cal for the helpe of the same holy spirit, that than inspired her, &amp; praie him at this high &amp; holy visitation, so to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire vs, that we may both be abasshed with the reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t dread of our owne vnworthines, and yet therewith conceiue a ioyful consolation and comfort in the consideration of Gods inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable goodnes.

            <p>Now when we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued our Lord, and haue him in our bodie, let vs not than letre him alone, and gette vs foorth about other things, &amp; looke no more vnto him. For litle good could he, that so would serue any geast: but let al our busines be about him, let vs by deuout praier talke to him, by deuout meditation talke with him.

profit of our soule. And therfore let vs with Martha prouide, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all our ourwarde busines may be pertaining to him, in making cheere to him, and to his compa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie for his sake, that is to witte, to poore folke, of whiche he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euery one not onely for his Disciple, but also as for himself.

And let vs with Marie also sitte in deuout meditation, and hearken wel what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour being now our geast, wil inwardly saie vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Now haue we a special time of praier, whiles hee that hath made vs, he that hath bought vs, he whom we haue offended, he that shall iudge vs, he that shall either damne or saue vs, is of his great goodnes become

Let vs indeuour our selfe to keepe him stil, &amp; let vs saie with his twoo Disciples, that were going to the Castell of Emaus: <hi>Mane nobifcum Domine,</hi>

            <p>Let vs not plaie like the people of Genazareth, whiche praied him to depart out of their quarters, bycause they lost their hogges by him, when in stede of the hogges he saued the man, out of whom he cast the legion of Diuels that after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
