         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>ALL dear Friends remember the Cross of the Lord Jesus, which is his Power in you in every measure of its appearance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation in your inward parts, that is contrary to the power of Satan, and to all its motions and works within and without, and as you remember this Cross, to bear it, it will give you power over all the power of Satan, and by it you shall be made able to war against the same and overcome it, with all its motions and workings of whatever na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And as you bear it upon you, it will make you weighty, and solid, and grave in your Spirits and Conversation, and it will keep down all lightness, and froth, and vanity, and foolish jeasting, and laughter, and idle speeches, for who are found in these things bear not the Cross but lay it aside, and so follow not Christ Jesus, but follow him that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto him, who is the Antichrist, who leads contrary to the leadings of Christ. Now Christ leads to take up the Cross, Antichrist to throw it off; Christ leads into meekness, temperance, and gravity, but Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ leads into harshness, lightness and excess; Christ leads into the mortification of all the lusts, vanities and corruptions of the World, but Antichrist into the feeding and strengthening them. Now Friends, while you live in the World, you will have daily temptations by the World, and that Antichristian spirit that rules in it, to lead you into these things, and there is a part in all, till it be perfectly crucified, that is apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with the temp<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ations from without, to lead into the same things; so watch against that part, keep it under the Cross, yea nail it to the Cross for ever, till it be utterly slain, and so you shall be p<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eserved from all the ungodliness and lusts of the world, and from all its corrupt ways, customs fashions, idle speeches, vain and frothy communications, sportings, jeast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and laughings, which are not convenient to be found among them that profess the Lord Jesus Christ, and the bearing his Cross, thoagh
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47495:3"/>
they be too much to be found among most of them; which gives an evil savour. O let all Friends watch against these things, and the spirit that leads into them, I say let all Friends wacth against the corruptions of the world and worldly minded men and women, who may profess to be Christians, but are enemies to his Cross, who bear up on them the marks of Antichrist, and not the marks of the Lord Jesus Christ; for the marks of the Lord Jesus, which his followe<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s do bear in their Body and Spirit, are meekness, and temperance, and gravity, and weightyness in Spirit, in Word and Conversation, like unto Christ Jesus, who was never found to laugh, jest, sport, or use unprofitable and unnecessary discourse, but was a man of sorrows, well acquainted with griefs, and when he rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced h<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> rejoyced in Spirit, and in doing good; which is contrary to all that joy and mirth that is carnal, that abounds among carnal and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical Professors, whose frothyness, lightness, wantonness, idleness, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and folly in their words and conversations, are signes of madness and not of Christianity. So let all Friends stand up in the noble and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Life and Spirit of Christ Jesus, to witness against all these things, and judge them and condemn them, and all who are found in them; but if any of you be found in them, with the world, then you cannot witness against the world nor judge it. Oh Fri<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds, to what purpose is it that we have denyed the worlds corrupt words and wayes in some things, if we deny not the world in all its own corrupt words, wayes and works, to what purpose is it that any shall refuse to joyn with the world in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>you</hi> to a single person, and yet joyn with the world in other things as bad and worse? And perhaps some will think it a great oversight to say <hi>you</hi> to one, and be ashamed and troubled for it, and yet joyn with them in that which the Light condemneth as much and more, and this is deceit and hypocrisie, which every eye in the world is open to see and observe, and reproach the Friends of Truth, and Truth it self on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Wherefore l<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t us all be sober, and watchful in all things, that the enemy get no advantage, and if we refuse to bow our Bodies to Mens persons, which the Light condemns, let us also refuse to bow our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to the corrupt and filty spirits of men, which the Light condemns also. So let us not pertake in their filthyness, frothy wayes, customs, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shons, sportings, laughings, idle and unprofitable speeches which are good for nothing but feed the Serpent, are his meat and food, and strengthens that which is for judgement, and must die or go into everlasting torment. Concerning which things I have often born great burthens upon me both on my own account, and others, as finding the hurt of them, and how
<pb facs="tcp:47495:3"/>
they defile and leaven into ungodliness, and uncleanness, and how they hurt and weaken the tender Seed and Plant of God, and brings clouds veils over it, and have a tendency to kill it, and quench the Spirit of God; and I certainly know, the judgement and wrath of God burns against these things, and is as a Swo<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eonsness, leaving all the badness and unsavouryness in the world behind you, and treading it under foot, that a good savour in all things you may be to the glory of God, and let all your words be savoury and seasoned with salt, even when you speak of natural things, and go about your business and occasions, in your Families, Fields and Market-places, and keep out of all unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary words as may be, which the wisdom of Tru<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And all Friends, sh<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w forth the true and living Image of the noble Life and Spirit of Christ Jesus in all your conversation, and put away all that is ignoble, nasty and unsuitable to Truth, which becomes not saints; all the worlds ignoble and unvirtuous sayings, words and proverbs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and forget them, let your speech be like unto the Saints, and not the World, even in the meanest things when you are together; in your eating, drinking and meeting together and parting asunder from one another, and naming one another, or calling upon one another in all these things, the world hath his corrupt wayes and customs, which savour not of a noble and virtuous spirit, as the corrupting of men and womens Names, as with respect of persons, for <hi>Iohn</hi> to say <hi>Ionie,</hi> for <hi>Iames</hi> to <hi>Iamie,</hi> and the like; which has not a good Savour, but savours of that corrupting Spirit which spoiles and corrupts all things. And Friends, you know the Worlds Life and recreation is in words and discourse, and if they have no profanity and scurrility in it, then they think all is well, how much soever they talke and spend time in unbrofitable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which after it is all done serves for no other end but to ease and refresh that which wearieth in silence, and in silent waiting upon God but kills and hurts the tender Life of God. For, if even the Letter kill, when a man speaks the Letter of the Scripture and not in a right Spirit, how much more doth that kill which is bad both as to the words and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? And you know Friends, tha<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

and spirit of God, then they refresh the Seed and Birth of God in all, both hearers and speakers; but when words are uttered from a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Life and Spirit, yea, though true and good words, they deaden and burt the Seed of God, but they stir up and refresh the bad seed, the seed of the evil-doers, that is for judgement; and many times the effects of those idle and frivolous discourses, which Men and Women beget one another into, by answering one another, is that the light, aery, frothy, vain, wanton spirit that wearieth of the Cross, and is not subject to it, is railed up and strengthened in them, but that which is tender, meek, sober, and breathes for righteousness, is choaked, burthened, and deadned. So dear Friends, watch against all that leadeth out your minds into such things, and b<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ware of hurting one another, and being occasions to one another of using superfluity of words; for if you love the Cross of Christ Jesus, and bear it, you will love silence, and fewness of words, and it will be a pain and unease to you, either to speak or hear words which have not in them a true savour of Life, nor a true advantage for good, in the speaking or hearing of them.</p>
            <p>And, dear Friends, in all your Meetings to wait upon the Lord, be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in a present and diligent mind, having your loins girded about, and trussed up, and if you be diligent in applying your mindes to the Truth and Life of Christ J<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sus in you, then all laziness, and heaviness, and weariness of mind will vanish, and the mind will be composed, and ordered, and that will make a well composed and well ordered Body, so that no thing, nor appearance of a weary or lazy mind will be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, nor of wanderings of mind, nothing of that nature will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Body, to be an evil savour; but if the mind be lazy and slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish, and love not its present work it ought to be about, which is to wait upon the Lord, then will Signes of it appear, as in particular to gape, or gaunt in a Meeting, is a ready sign of a mind that is sloathful, and is not pres<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nt nor dilligent in its attendance unto Truth, though such a thing may lye near to some true and honest Friends, and it may come upon them at unawars, and I verily believe many have not a clear sight of the thing, nor know not the hurt of it, but a hurt it is, and of no good savour at any time, but much less at Meeting, for it is that which even many men, but as men, can observe, that when a man gapes or gauns, in any exercife he is found in, it shews a mind that is slack, and is not present or diligent therein; and besides the hurt that this thing of gaping does in ones one particular, it hurts the general, both that it is an evil savour, and also that it begets others into the same, if not watched against, so
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47495:4"/>
that one gaping, others will gape also, by a certain secret influence, which I have often observed with many others; and this is not only a sign of laziness and weariness of mind, but also feeds it, yet if it be watched a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against, it may be resisted and put back, as I have had frequent experience and if at any time it so come upon any that they cannot stop it, yet they may cover it by stoping the noise of it, and covering the mouth with the hand or napkin, that it appear not, but the way to be rid of it, and get Victory over it, is by coming to a diligent attendance of mind, into the Truth, and this will put it quite away, yea it will compose the whole Man and Body, so that no marks of either weariness or wande<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Dear Friends, bear with my freedom in these things, for they have a long time layn much upon me, which may be for a service to some. The Lord God make us in all things a good savour and a good example, bo<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               <p>AND dear Friends, many of whom have been Professors, and in a profession of Religion before you witnessed the possession of the Life and Substance of it, and others who witnessed somewhat of the Life, it was but very little, and was accompanied with a great mixture of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soundness both as to Spirit and Words, and the hypocritical ground had a deep place in many, as it hath at this day, among all the Professors out of the Possession of the Life of what they profess, from whence proceeds so many hypochritical shews and formalities, hypocritical prayings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions and professions, hypocritical singings, sounds, tones and accents, hypocritical sighings, whinings, wringing of the face, and putting on a sour and sad countenance when they pray, and their many other hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47495:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wayes, all arising out of the hypocritical ground and spirit, in an apish imitation of what the Saints did and do in the Life and Power of Christ Jesus; which Life and Power did and often doth work mightily in the Saints, and raised in them deep and wonderful affections, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of greif, and other sometimes of joy and gladness; sometimes of fear and terrour, and sometimes of boldness and courage; all which had and have their natural impressions upon the voice, speech and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of those which have been, or are thus exercised. Hence some mourn as a Dove, so <hi>David;</hi> some chatter as a Crane, so <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> some quake and tremble, as did <hi>Moses, Daniel, Habbakkuck,</hi> and many others; some roar as a Lyon, some sing and make a sweet mellody even with their voyces, and some sigh and groan unutterably. All which things in these holy men did proceed from the motions and workings of the Life in them, and so were a good savour to the Life in others, as having in them a manifestation of Life, and as it were a Signature or Impression of Life upon them: Which things at this day are witnessed by many of us, and dearly owned; so that it is only the hypocritical and counterfeit likenesses of these things, made by the hypocritical spirit that we disown, which not being able to reach unto the heavenly things themselves, maketh Images of them, which have upon them the very Signature and Impression of that hypocritical spirit which begot them, and are an evil noisom savour unto the true Life, and the Vessels in whom it is witnessed; therefore let all Friends watch against this hypocritical spirit and all its deceitful Images and Likenesses, and make war against the Beast, its Image, Number and Name, that a perfect Victory over it all may witness, and none may be found bearing his Image in any thing, but the heavenly Image of the Lamb, the Son of God in all things, that all your words and works may bear upon them the Image of his Life and when you pray, sing, exhort, teach or minister, it may be done in the pure motion and ability of Life, and you may be chaste waiters on and followers of it in its arisings and movings, so as in all your exercises to begin, go along, stop, stay, and rest with it; thus shall you be a good sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to God, and to one anoter, yea, unto all men in all things. Then shall you offer up the pure Incense and Sacrifice that is without spot or blemish,, that shall be pleasant and acceptable unto the Lord as in the days of old, being delivered and purged from all mixtures of hypocrisie and deceit, out of all the hypocritical likenesses, bearing upon you in all things the Image of the noble, royal and virtuous Seed.</p>
