            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
you know
better then I,
that the Church
hath beene pestered with
writings falsly fathered
upon men of renowne.
There is scarce an Age in
which many instances are
not given. Not onely <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:12252:3"/>
and <hi>Councels,</hi> but
<hi>Historians,</hi> have beene
stuffed from other mens
Pennes with adulterine
conceits. The <hi>Divell</hi>
knowes that as <hi>Labans</hi>
sheepe have conceived by
the eye; so men have been
apt peremptorily to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
from the opinions of
their great Masters: And
men have so cleaved to the
<hi>persons</hi> of men, that they
have catched up all shreds
that have fallen from them
with admiration and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to follow them. This
hath been very offensive: it
<pb facs="tcp:12252:3"/>
hath stayned the dead, and
corrupted the living. It is
not therefore alwayes safe
to trust <hi>posthume</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and to say, <hi>This
such a man held, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we finde it in the
Books published under
his name when hee is
dead.</hi> Yet is there an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
use of such Workes
of good men, as may truely
be affirmed to be theirs,
though time have brought
them forth, when their ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
have inhabited their
eternity.</p>
            <p>Now Bookes are of
<pb facs="tcp:12252:4"/>
excellent worth <hi>(not to
satisfie some greedy
Tradesmen, who know
how to value them for
themselves, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
they care not
two pence for the Au<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thor,

turne is served,)</hi> but to
take up, and gaine, the eyes,
hearts, and times of many,
who would reade none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they can reade new
ones.</p>
            <p>This here presented is
certainly the Authors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:
though not for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
word (for I cannot
<pb facs="tcp:12252:4"/>

which hath passed through
many hands) yet for the

               </gap>stance, and sense:
and it is as certaine that it
is new, and so, apt to invite
unto it as a new fashion.
It is wondred that it is so
new, when many of the
same Authors are so old.
It surely might have beene
set in the front both for
age, and worth. It was
preached before many of
the rest, and savours of the
Authours learning, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
piety, and affection to
<hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and his
<pb facs="tcp:12252:5"/>
               <hi>Church</hi> with us. But
though it hath beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
neglected, yet now it
is tendered in the Authors
owne words and hearty
affections, so neare as I
could. You may see in it a
glimpse of the full glory of
Christ, and of that use
which we make of him, as
we must receive him to
salvation. If it may doe
any service in the Church,
I, into whose hands it hath
fallen, am glad. If not, yet
I beseech you, accept of my
good meaning, and be to
me, as I am to you, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,

that ever were declared to

Thus all received their light

hee filled five thousand

then do these two fulnesses
differ?<note place="margin">Sol.</note> I answer, that they
differ three wayes.</p>
            <p>First, others are said to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
full according to their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,<note place="margin">Ioh 3.</note>
but <hi>Christ above measure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a little dish may bee
said to be full as well as the
Ocean: so they are filled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the narrownesse
of their present capacity.
<hi>Christ</hi> was full according to
all dimensions, length, depth,
bredth, and height of fulnes.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">plenitudo 1 vasis. 2 fontis.</note> there was in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
them a fulnesse of the vessell,
but in <hi>Christ,</hi> a fulnesse of
the Spring. In them was a
derived and participated
fulnesse, in <hi>Christ</hi> a fulnesse
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12252:13"/>
of a fountaine proceeding
from himselfe. This is well
expressed by the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,<note place="margin">Igni<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

when they say, that
Christs, &amp; the Saints fulnesse
differ <hi>as fire, and things set on
fire.</hi> The fulnesse of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
is too little to expresse
it: for if you take a drop or
two from it, it is so much the
lesse: but the fulnesse of fire
is such, as though you light a
thousand Torches at it, it is
not diminished.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, their fulnesse was
in them comparatively;
Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> was full in
comparison of other lesser
Saints: but in <hi>Christ</hi> it is an
absolute fulnesse without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
or comparisons.</p>
            <p>What shall we now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:12252:13"/>
benefit? Foure consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.<note place="margin">We are invited to come to Christ to take of his full heape.</note>
First, that we ought to
be invited to come to Christ
to take of his full heape. This
Incentive Saint <hi>Paul</hi> often
useth to inflame the desires
of the Gentiles to come to
<hi>CHRIST,</hi> even the <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
of that fulnesse which is
in him, which <hi>in the fulnesse
of time</hi> was exposed to all
commers; which was <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
before, but now (as hee
saith) fully <hi>revealed;</hi> seene
before, but in types and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
now with <hi>open face;</hi>
before preached to a few,
now <hi>to every creature</hi> under

his Spirit, by drops but now

hath so <hi>received for,</hi> &amp; <hi>given

gifts unto me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that he hath <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
all things.</hi> Let us therfore
be exhorted, when we heare
of such a fulnesse, not to take
the grace of <hi>God</hi> in vaine, but
labour to have our parts
therein, that, with the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
we may be made
rich in <hi>Christ,</hi> filled with all
knowledge, and every grace.</p>
            <p>Content we not our
selves to know this onely,
(for that is our common
fault to rest in the notion of
such things without practise)
but goe to <hi>Christ</hi> as Bees to
a Meddow full of flowers,
as Merchants to the Indies,
that are full of Wines and
Spices, that you may expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally
feele your selves
return from him full fraught
with treasures of truth and
grace.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:12252:14"/>
In other things fulnes invites
us much; <hi>Iosephs</hi> full Barnes
drew <hi>Iacob</hi> and his sonnes
downe into <hi>Egypt. Canaan</hi>
was a land full of milke and
honey, &amp; that invited the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
to seeke it. <hi>Solomons</hi>
aboundance and fulnesse of
wisedome invited the Queen
of <hi>Sheba</hi> to come out of the
South to his Court. In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, fulnesse doth much
allure, and affect. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
man though he spend
but a little, yet he delights to
<hi>take it from a full heape.</hi>
               <note place="margin">De pleno tollere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerno.</note> How
much more then should the
fulnesse of <hi>Christ</hi> worke in
us, seeing there is in him not
onely a repletive, but a diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
fulnesse; not only plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but bounty?</p>
            <p>But, alas, if we looke to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:12252:15"/>
the actions and lives of men,
we shall finde that they seek
a fulnesse in every thing else
almost. A fulnesse in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and delight; a fulnesse
in honour and preferment;
a fulnesse in profit and
worldly incomes; but this
full hony-combe is almost
every where despised. But
happy is he the bent of
whose heart <hi>God</hi> hath turned
the right way, to seeke a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of faith and wisedome,
a fulnesse of the holy Ghost.
Happy he, who cares not to
be empty of other things, so
he be full of these; to be a
looser in other things, so he
be a gainer in this. Such an
one hath indeed chosen the
better part which shall never
be taken from him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:12252:15"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">We must answer the fulnes of Christ with a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of affection.</note> we should ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
answer the fulnesse of
<hi>Christ</hi> with a fulnesse of <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
fully to beleeve, and
trust in him, fully to love
and adore him, fully to joy
and delight in him. For it
is good reason that the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
should be answerable
to the object. A little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
deserves at our
hands a little love and
esteeme, more excellency
more love; but when there is
a fulnesse of excellency, wee
ought to prosecute it with
all fulnesse of affections.</p>
            <p>All excellency of the
creature in comparison of
this, is but a drop to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,
and as a sparke to the
whole Element of fire. If
therefore we proportion our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12252:16"/>
affections to the object,
(which ought to be the rule
and square of them) we must
bestow upon the creature
but a drop of love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
but the full streame of
our affections should runne
after <hi>Christ,</hi> in whom is all
the fulnesse of perfection.</p>
            <p>It is true, as men hide trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
from theeves under
straw, or some other base
covering, so <hi>God</hi> hideth this
full excellency from the
world, under a base outside,
that his secret ones onely
might find it: and that others
<hi>(truely blinded)</hi> might not see
but stumble at it. So <hi>he hid
Christ</hi> himselfe under a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters
sonne: so he hideth
divine mysteries under the
meane elements of Bread
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:12252:16"/>
and Wine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so the wisedome
of <hi>God</hi> is hid under the <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse
of preaching,</hi> and
under sheepe-skinnes and
goat-skins, <hi>such as the world
was not worthy of:</hi> yet there
is a fulnesse of excellency
notwithstanding. For if ever
we saw beauty in the Sunne,
Moone, Starres, Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
or any thing else; all
must be more abundantly in
<hi>God,</hi> who is the maker, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and Author of all these
things. As <hi>David</hi> reasoneth,
<hi>He that made the eye, shall not
he see? and he that made the
eare, shall not he heare?</hi> So
he that made these things
shall he not have them more
eminently in himselfe? For
as the worth and value of
many pieces of silver is in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:12252:17"/>
one peece of gold: so all the
petty excellencies, which
are scattered abroad in the
creatures, are united in <hi>God;</hi>
yea, all the whole volume
of perfections which is
spred through heaven and
earth, is epitomized in him.
Why doe we not then with
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> trample on the
glory of the world, for the
excellent knowledge of
<hi>Christ?</hi> Why doe wee not
with <hi>David</hi> turn our hearts,
eyes, and affections from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
vanities, and pitch
them all in him? Why doe
we not recollect our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and gather up our
thoughts, which are scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
abroad, and busied about
a thousand trifles, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
them all on him in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:12252:17"/>
whom is the fulnesse of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
beauty, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">We must be content and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ful Christ.</note> let us also there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
be content with <hi>Christ,</hi>
having our hearts satisfied
with him and his fulnesse.
First, in regard of spirituall
things goe not to the brooks
of <hi>Teman,</hi> the broken Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternes
of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Saints
merits, Church Treasures,
and the like. For if there be
a fulnesse in <hi>Christ,</hi> that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
not,<note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> 
               <hi>In him we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</hi>
Secondly,<note place="margin">Christ is our fulnes in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things</note> for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
things, be content with
him alone: for he is our ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
even in them also.</p>
            <p>For the better conceiving
whereof, we must know that
the first <hi>Adam</hi> brought a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<hi>emptinesse</hi> over all the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:12252:18"/>
world. For though, the
world be full of pompe and
pleasure, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> calls
them (the <hi>lust of the flesh, the
lust of the eye, and the pride of
life</hi>) yet properly it is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
because it is not full of
that which it should be.
Eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we say, a well is emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
though it be full of ayre:
so all creatures, if not filled
with that they should be.
For emptinesse is not so
much an absence of <hi>entity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </note>
or of something that is, but
of that being that <hi>is due,</hi> and
should give filling to that
which should be full. Hence
therefore not onely the
heart of man, but all creatures
also are said to be empty.
<hi>Vanity of vanities,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 1.</note> saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
that is, emptinesse of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12252:18"/>
emptinesse. The whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>is subject to vanity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> saith
<hi>Paul,</hi> that is to emptinesse.
Hence is it that the hearts of
men are not satisfied with
the world: but, as the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
speaketh; they eate and
are not full, they drinke and
their soule is empty: because
now the creature is as the
Huske without the Graine,
the Shell without the Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,
full of nothing but emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse;
and being empty of
it selfe, cannot give us satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Christ</hi> the second <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
hath filled all things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
<hi>All in all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3.</note> that is, not
onely the hearts of men, but
the things also. It is the
neuter gender (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
all and in all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:12252:19"/>
Hence we may observe,
that many find a want in the
midst of plenty: their hearts
find no rest in all they injoy,
no satisfaction; with the holy
regenerate man it is much
otherwise. Though he have
but a little wealth with a
little food, yet there is a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
put into that little
which maketh it fit to give
him satifaction. This is the
meaning of that in the
Psalme,<note place="margin">Psal. 37.</note> 
               <hi>A small thing that
the righteous hath, is better
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great riches of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
The reason is, because
that little being filled with
the blessing of the second
<hi>Adam Christ,</hi> they find a
fulnesse, when the wicked
find an emptinesse in their
greatest abundance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:12252:19"/>
Lastly,<note place="margin">There is a fulnesse in Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the fulnesse of sinne.</note> hence therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
issues singular comfort; what
though there be a fulnesse
of sinne and guilt in us, yet
is there a fulnesse in Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to remove it and take it
away. A fulnesse of mercy
to receive our supplications:
a fulnesse of merit to make
atonement for our fowlest
sinnes: a fulnesse of favour
to prevaile with his father in
any requests. If therefore
there be a fulnesse of <hi>Christ</hi>
(as there is) be not discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note>
               <hi>Though thy sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,</hi>
yet (if thou turne from
sinne to Christ) <hi>his grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
much more.</hi> Thou
canst not be out of measure
sinfull, as he is out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
mercifull.</p>
            <p>Remember but the two
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:12252:20"/>
metaphors used in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
I will scatter your
sinnes <hi>as a mist,</hi> and they shal
be drowned <hi>in the bottome of
the Sea.</hi> Now, the Sunne, by
reason of his force, <hi>can scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the greatest mist,</hi> as well as
the least vapour: and the Sea,
by reason of his great vastnes
can drowne the mountaines
as well as the Mole-hills. So
<hi>Christ,</hi> by reason of that vast
fulnesse that is in him, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yea forward, and as
willing to forgive the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
sinnes as the least: I say,
<hi>as forward, and willing;</hi> for
mercy, though it be <hi>a quality</hi>
in us, yet it is a <hi>nature</hi> in him:
now, what is naturall, there
is no unwillingnesse, nor
wearinesse in that. The eye
is not weary with seeing, nor
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:12252:20"/>
the eare with hearing fit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
Therefore though
our sinnes be never so great,
and many; yet (if this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
be observed that we
lie in no knowne sinne, that
God bearing witnesse to our
consciences, we have a full
and resolute purpose not to
doe the least evill, nor to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the least good; in a word,
that we make our hearts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
with God in all things;
for without this there is no
remission of sinnes) then
they are not beyond the
price that was paide for
them, nor beyond the grace
of him with whom we have
to doe; because there is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in him. Now, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you take not this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
in vaine. For there
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:12252:21"/>
is nothing more effectuall to
heale a rebellious heart, to
instill soveraigne saving
grace, to cause a sinner to
change his course, then to be
perswaded that he shall be
taken to mercy, and that his
sinnes shall bee forgiven in
Christ.</p>
            <p>Even as the thiefe while
the Hue and Cry pursues
him, never returnes willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
Rebels and Pyrats, while
the Proclamation of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is against them, never
come in: but if there be a
Proclamation of pardon, yea
of some great advancement,
if that be beleeved once tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that, and nothing but that
causeth them to lay downe
their courses, and become
loyall and loving subjects:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:12252:21"/>
so is it with poore sinners
upon the apprehension of
<hi>Christs</hi> willing supply. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let the fulnesse of the
mercy of <hi>Christ</hi> moove us
to lay downe our armes of
rebellion, and to chuse God
for our God, and to give our
selves wholly unto him.
And thus I passe the fulnesse
given to <hi>Christ.</hi>

               <hi>That

            <p>The Scripture is evident for

this.<note place="margin">Phil 2. 13.</note> 
               <hi>It is God that worketh

               <hi>as of our

and all preparations to grace,
and all ability to accept
grace, is all from God, and
not of our selves, (whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

for these reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Because nothing can work

nature to get supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

as the water cannot heate,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12252:22"/>
which is an action above the

into it: no more can
meere nature doe any thing
tending to saving grace, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no principle in it selfe
whereby it can raise it.</p>
            <p>Indeed, to will is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
but to will good, is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall,
and must needs
arise from an higher Wels

it cannot except it have the

            <p>From this consideration

            <p>This errour of theirs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds

the acts goe before the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,

is not onely <hi>a sorrow for sinne</hi>

out of feare of hell, and desire

doe out of the strength of

but it is (when it acompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

thing, to wit,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 1.</note> an act of

               <note place="margin">2 Cor 5. 17.</note>
an act of a <hi>new creature</hi> by

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:12252:28"/>
as he said, <hi>I am not my selfe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ego non sum ego.</note>
by repentance I differ from
what I was. In a word, when
a man is a quite other man
then he was, serving God
out of an inward propension,
&amp; having the whole bent of
his heart turned to delight in
the <hi>Lord,</hi> and in his <hi>Law,</hi>
without all by-respects.</p>
            <p>And that this yet may be
made clearer, and put out of
all doubt, I would aske you
this one question. That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
which men take up
in age, or times of extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whence proceeds it? If
from selfe love, as is usuall in
such cases (because the soule
is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most strongly possessed
with an apprehension of
death, and hell, and another
life) then there is no more
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12252:28"/>
then nature in him: for the
streame naturally riseth no
higher then the fountaine. A
beast would as much, for
when he sinks into danger he
would struggle to save him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
But if it proceed from
love to God, why is it not
done sooper, why not in the
flower of youth? yea, when
it is done soonest, would we
not be heartily sorry that it
is not done sooner? If it
proceed of love to him, it
cannot but rise from his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, the breathings
whereof as they are most
free, so are they most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Therefore when such a
sparke is kindled in our
hearts, let us be carefull to
put fuell unto it, and not let
it goe out againe. All the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:12252:29"/>
creatures in heaven, and
earth, cannot helpe us to

Tertullian,</hi> who lived a little above an

In <hi>Origens</hi> time, who lived neere <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
it is evident, that there were
set formes of Prayer used in the
Church. For, in his 11 Homily, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth

<hi>he doth greatly allow a set forme of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall

should be bound to observe.</hi> But
(as I said before) of the lawfulnesse
there is little question.</p>
            <p>That which is to be reprehen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded,
is,<note n="a" place="bottom">Publike prayers are highly to be esteemed.</note> asecret dis-esteeme of publike
prayers, by reason of which many
neglect to come to them, and they
that doe come, doe it in a perfuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and overly manner, which is an
extreame madnesse. Better it were
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:12252:33"/>
that men would come to this disjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
either it is lawfull to use them,
or not: if not, why doe they not
wholly abstaine? if so, why doe they
not use them lawfully in a reverend
manner?</p>
            <p>One thing there is which if it were
well considered, would breed in our
men another esteeme of publike
prayer then indeed there is; and
that is, that, besides the end of attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
what wee want, (wherein yet
publike prayer hath a promise) there
is another end of prayer, and that
is, <hi>to worship God,</hi> and performe, a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to him. For proving of which
there are two places of Scripture un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable.<note n="a" place="bottom">Luke 2. 37. <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Ob.</hi> Besides, how sleight is that
which is objected against the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of it, to wit, that the <hi>spirit is stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
when we are fettered with words
appointed? <hi>Sol.</hi> I answer, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the spirit stands not so much
in the extent of words, as in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of zeale wherein they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> It is againe objected that we
cannot pray for occasionall necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<hi>Sol.</hi> I answer, that therefore we
bind not onely to them, but may and
ought to use priuate prayer wherein
we may expresse our private, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
and accidentall occasions. And
if they be more publike, there be
prayers both before and after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
(according to order) wherein
the Minister is left at more liberty,
<hi>according to fuller apprehension of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:12252:34"/>
Lords prayer.</hi> And if it be yet more
generall belonging to the State and
Church, we adde to it more generall
and publike prayers, as in the time of
publike infection, warre, and the
Gun-powder Treason dayes.</p>
            <p>But there needs not much to be
said to convince the judgement: that
which is chiefly to be desired is, that
they may be better observed, and
more esteemed: especially seeing our
publike prayers are holy, and good,
and (which should be a great induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
<hi>the Church hath commanded
them.</hi> For if the Church be to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
in indifferent things (as it is)
then much more in <hi>Gods</hi> owne Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.
And if a set forme be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
then must a set forme needs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
which is dictated by<note n="a" place="bottom">The excellency of the Lords prayer.</note> 
               <hi>Christ</hi> him-himselfe,
and is therefore more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to be used, and with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence

both in minde and gesture.</p>
