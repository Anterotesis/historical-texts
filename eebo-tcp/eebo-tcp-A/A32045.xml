            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ A Proclamation for the Aſſembling the Members of both Houſes at <hi>Oxford,</hi> upon occaſion of the Invaſion by the <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS We did by Our Proclamation, bearing date the twentieth day of <hi>June</hi> laſt, upon due conſideration of the miſeries of this Kingdom, and the true cauſe thereof, warne all Our good Subjects no longer to be miſled by the Votes, Orders, and pretended Ordinances of One or Both Houſes, by reaſon the Members do not enjoy the Freedom and Liberty of Parliament, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by ſeverall inſtances of Force and Violence, and by the courſe of their proceedings menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in Our ſaid Proclamation, and ſeverall of Our Declarations: ſince which time Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Scotland</hi> have made great and Warlike preparations to enter and invade this Kingdome with an Army, and have already actually invaded the ſame, by poſſeſſing themſelves, by force of Armes, of Our Towne of <hi>Barwick,</hi> upon pretence that they are invited thereunto by the deſires of the two Houſes; the which as we doubt not all Our good Subjects of this Kingdome will look upon as the moſt inſolent Act of Ingratitude and diſloyalty, and to the apparent breach of the late Act of Pacification ſo ſolemnly made between the Kingdomes, and is indeed no other then a deſigne of Conqueſt, and to impoſe new Lawes upon this Nation, they not ſo much as pretending the leaſt provocation or violation from this Kingdom ſo We are moſt aſſured that the Major part of both Houſes of Parliament doe from their ſoules abhorre the leaſt thought of introducing that Forraigne Power, to encreaſe and make deſperate the miſeries of their unhappy Country. And therefore that it may appeare to all the world how far the Major part of both Houſes is from ſuch Actions of Treaſon &amp; diſloyalty, and how groſſely thoſe few Members remaining at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> have and do impoſe upon Our People, We do Will and require ſuch of the Members of both Houſes, as well thoſe who have been by the Faction of the Malignant Party expelled for performing their duty to Us, and into whoſe roomes no Perſons have been ſince choſen by their Country, as the reſt who have been driven thence, and all thoſe who being conſcious of their want of Freedom, now ſhall be willing to withdraw from that Rebellious City, to aſſemble themſelves together at Our City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> on Munday the twenty ſecond day of <hi>January,</hi> where care ſhall be taken for their ſeverall Accommodations, and fit places appointed for their meeting, and where all Our good Subjects ſhall ſee how willing We are to receive Advice for the Preſervation of the Religion, Lawes and ſafety of the Kingdome, and, as farre as in Us lyes, to reſtore it to its former Peace and Security (Our chiefe and only end) from thoſe whom they have truſted, though We cannot receive it in the place where We appointed. And for the better encouragement of thoſe Members of either Houſe to reſort to Us, who may be conſcious to themſelves of having juſtly incurred Our diſpleaſure by ſubmitting to, or concurring in unlawfull actions; And that all the World may ſee how willing and deſirous We are to forget the Injuries &amp; Indignities offered to Us, and by an Union of Engliſh hearts, to prevent the laſting miſeries which this Forraigne Invaſion muſt bring upon this Kingdome, We doe offer a free and Generall Pardon to all the Members of either Houſe, who ſhall at, or before the ſaid twenty ſecond day of <hi>Ianuary</hi> appeare at Our City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and deſire the ſame, without Exceptions: which conſidering the manifeſt Treaſons committed againſt Us, and the condition We are now in, improved by Gods wonderfull bleſſing to a better degree then We have enjoyed at any time ſince theſe Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is the greateſt inſtance of Princely and Fatherly Care of Our People that can be expreſſed, and which Malice it ſelfe cannot ſuggeſt to proceed from any other ground. And therefore We hope, and are confident, that all ſuch who upon this Our gratious Invitation will not returne to their duty and Allegiance, ſhall be no more thought Promoters of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Lawes and Liberty of the Kingdome (which this way may be, without doubt, ſetled and ſecured) but Perſons enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the beginning, out of their owne Pride, Malice, and Ambition, to bring confuſion and deſolation upon their Country, and to that purpoſe (having long ſince contrived the Deſigne) to invite and joyne with a Forraigne Nation to ruine and extinguiſh their owne, and ſhall accordingly be purſued as the moſt deſperate and malitious Enemies of the Kingdome. And Our Pleaſure is, That this Our Proclamation be read in all Churches and Chappells within this our Kingdome, and Dominion of <hi>Wales.</hi>
